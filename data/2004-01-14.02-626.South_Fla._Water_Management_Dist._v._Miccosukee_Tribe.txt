 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 next in No. 02-626, the South Florida Water Management
 5 District v. the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians.
 6 Mr. Bishop.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. BISHOP: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 10 please the Court:
 11 Congress in the Clean Water Act provided that a
 12 section 402 permit is required for an addition of
 13 pollutants from a point source to navigable waters.
 14 Now, the South Florida Water Management District 15 concedes that the S-9 pump, through which it conveys
 16 navigable waters from a canal to a water conservation
 17 area, is a confined, discrete, discernible conveyance, and
 18 we agree that the water in the C-11 canal contains
 19 pollution which enters that water from a wide variety of
 20 point and non-point sources. 
 21 What we do say is that our pumps do not add
 22 pollutants to navigable waters. There is no addition of
 23 pollutants to navigable waters when navigable waters are
 24 simply moved around, which occurs all the time every day
 25 all around the country as public water management agencies

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 allocate and transfer the navigable waters to serve
 2 beneficial public purposes.
 3 QUESTION: The obvious question on your thing is
 4 you have one of these rivers that's so filthy that you can
 5 set fire to it, and next to it is the most pristine,
 6 beautiful trout lake ever. And so what we build is a
 7 little pipe and the pipe takes these filthy, absolutely
 8 disgusting water and pours it into this beautiful,
 9 pristine trout pond. All right?
 10 Now, you're saying that that doesn't fall within
 11 the statute, and --
 12 MR. BISHOP: No. It does fall within the
 13 statute.
 14 QUESTION: 
 I mean it doesn't require a permit. 15 MR. BISHOP: It -- it would not require a
 16 section 402 permit. There are all sorts of layers of
 17 protection from that occurring. That would never --
 18 QUESTION: Well, as far as this statute is
 19 concerned, EPA, it wouldn't. And -- and, of course, the
 20 obvious thing is that --
 21 MR. BISHOP: No. That -- that's not true
 22 either, Justice Breyer. 
 23 QUESTION: I mean, EPA through the permit. 
 24 Through the permit.
 25 MR. BISHOP: Through the 402, but this -- this

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is a complex statute with many, many layers of protections
 2 for the Nation's waters.
 3 QUESTION: And it would protect --
 4 MR. BISHOP: To begin with, there is always a
 5 layer of State protection. The statute requires that
 6 water quality standards be established for portions of the
 7 navigable waters. Those water quality standards are
 8 implemented through total maximum daily load requirements
 9 that the States are -- are required under the statute to
 10 -- to design. The States implement the TMDL's and the
 11 water quality standards through non-point source pollution
 12 programs that include land use restrictions, that include
 13 advice to and requirements on landowners as to best
 14 management practices.
 15 QUESTION: I -- I suppose it's beyond the
 16 purview of this case. Do we know whether or not the
 17 transfer of waters in this case would violate those other
 18 regulations? 
 19 MR. BISHOP: No, it does not. The -- the --
 20 there are exceedances. Understand that the S-9 pump,
 21 while not permitted under 402, is permitted by the State
 22 under The Everglades Forever Act. But there are water
 23 quality standards for the canal and for the water
 24 conservation area. The -- there is compliance with both
 25 of those. There are exceedances, phosphorus exceedances,

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 from time to time, but those are built into the permit.
 2 The -- the cleaning up of the Everglades, which
 3 is something that everyone is committed to and the
 4 district is deeply committed to, is not an overnight
 5 process. And so there are plans through the Comprehensive
 6 Everglades Restoration statute and also under The
 7 Everglades Forever Act to address these exceedances in the
 8 long term, but --
 9 QUESTION: Mr. Bishop, the Eleventh Circuit said
 10 that moving water within a single, distinct body of water
 11 could never result in the addition of pollutants to that
 12 body of water. Now, I assume you agree with that
 13 statement? 
 14 MR. BISHOP: 
 Well, I agree with that, but we and 15 the United States go further here in arguing that the
 16 statute -- what the statute prohibits is the addition of
 17 pollutants to navigable waters. Navigable waters are
 18 defined in the statute as the waters of the United States. 
 19 It's our position and the position of the United States,
 20 if I read their brief correctly, that an addition of
 21 pollutants from a point source occurs when the pollutant
 22 is introduced to the navigable waters for the first time. 
 23 And that is what the --
 24 QUESTION: So in -- in Justice Breyer's example,
 25 if the pristine trout pond is waters of the United States,

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 then there would not be an addition of the pollutant to
 2 waters of the United States when the filthy river was
 3 pumped into the pond.
 4 MR. BISHOP: No. That would violate State water
 5 quality standards which are --
 6 QUESTION: No. I -- maybe it would violate the
 7 standards, but I'm -- I'm just talking about the provision
 8 required here.
 9 MR. BISHOP: It would not require a section 402
 10 permit, Justice Souter. 
 11 QUESTION: And -- and it would not do so because
 12 it would not be the addition of a pollutant to waters of
 13 the United States. 
 14 MR. BISHOP: That is right.
 15 QUESTION: Assuming the river is navigable, the
 16 filthy river. Right?
 17 MR. BISHOP: Assuming that it's a navigable
 18 water under the Clean Water Act --
 19 QUESTION: Right.
 20 MR. BISHOP: -- and that -- which is a broader
 21 concept than waters that one can run --
 22 QUESTION: Well, what I'm driving at here is --
 23 is the following. You have ambiguous language. I think
 24 it's a very difficult question. If I accept your side of
 25 it, it seems to me I live -- leave the EPA without any

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 power to deal with what I just called the filthy river
 2 problem, or at least not the -- I'm not trying to be
 3 tricky in my words. I -- I understand they have other
 4 authority and so forth. But there is a filthy river
 5 problem if I take your side of it.
 6 And if I take their -- if I take your side of
 7 it, that is some kind of a problem. You can explain to me
 8 in 1 second why it's no problem whatsoever. I'd like to
 9 hear that. I want to say the opposite thing.
 10 Your problem that you raise, if I take their
 11 side, is suddenly everybody in the California water
 12 project, which is huge, central valley irrigation, has to
 13 run off and get permits, and that too is a big problem. 
 14 So it sounds to me that that second problem 15 could be dealt with by EPA through rules that would, in
 16 effect, not make them come in because they'd automatically
 17 get permits in certain circumstances. But if I take your
 18 side of it, the opposite filthy river problem, there's
 19 nothing to be done. 
 20 MR. BISHOP: Your premise --
 21 QUESTION: So that's what I say moves me at the
 22 second for hypothetical purposes towards their side, but
 23 I'm asking you to move me back.
 24 MR. BISHOP: Your premise is incorrect, Justice
 25 Breyer. Of course, moving filthy water to a pristine

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 water is a problem. I've already explained that it's
 2 addressed and addressed comprehensively and rigorously at
 3 the State level, as Congress contemplated in the statute
 4 through the water quality standards and TMDL's. 
 5 But beyond that, it is simply wrong to say that
 6 the Federal Government lacks power in these cases.
 7 First of all, it has broad power under section
 8 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act to protect navigability,
 9 and that -- that provision also includes power for the
 10 Corps to engage in a broad public interest review whenever
 11 the course of a waterway is changed. 
 12 Second, there are other provisions that deal
 13 with emergency type situations. If public health or
 14 welfare, for example, is implicated, then section 504 of 15 the statute gives EPA broad powers to go into court and
 16 get a restraining order not just for the discharge of
 17 pollutants, but much more broadly than that.
 18 QUESTION: Mr. Bishop, can we see -- take this
 19 concrete case? I mean, this is a case about phosphorus
 20 being dumped into a relatively unpolluted body of water. 
 21 What is the State of Florida or anybody doing to reduce
 22 the level of phosphorus that comes from this pump and gets
 23 dumped into the pure water?
 24 MR. BISHOP: Well, this has -- this has been the
 25 focus of not only our attention but of the Corps and EPA's

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 attention for a long time through the -- the Comprehensive
 2 Everglades Restoration Project. If I can -- and there are
 3 a lot of things that are happening to -- to reduce the
 4 phosphorus level, some of which are sort of purely State
 5 water quality standard implementation projects, such as
 6 prohibiting the sale of certain types of fertilizers,
 7 restricting the use of fertilizers that contain
 8 phosphorus. But the long-term CERP plans here have
 9 essentially two components. 
 10 The first one is that much of the water in the
 11 C-11 basin, in the canal, actually comes from the
 12 conservation area through seepage. There's an enormous
 13 amount of --
 14 QUESTION: Yes. 
 May I ask you a question right 15 -- I know some seeps through, but what is the principal
 16 source of the water in the C-11 basin?
 17 MR. BISHOP: Well, my understanding is that it
 18 is seepage. I mean, obviously there are --
 19 QUESTION: You think that's the principal
 20 source? It seeps in. You're just pumping it back into
 21 the Everglades?
 22 MR. BISHOP: That is my -- that is my
 23 understanding. There is an enormous amount of seepage,
 24 and the seepage involved --
 25 QUESTION: But where does the water that the

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 people in the western part of Broward County use to water
 2 their lawns and bathe and so -- where does that water come
 3 from?
 4 MR. BISHOP: From -- from the aquifer. I mean,
 5 obviously, in -- in --
 6 QUESTION: There's an aquifer to the east of the
 7 -- of the levees?
 8 MR. BISHOP: There is an aquifer that -- an
 9 unconfined aquifer that is really indistinguishable from
 10 the surface water that underlies the levee. But it's --
 11 it is not divided by the levee. It underlies the water,
 12 the surface water, on both sides --
 13 QUESTION: Are you telling me there's an aquifer
 14 to the east of the levee?
 15 MR. BISHOP: To the east of the levees and to
 16 the -- it's --
 17 QUESTION: Which is a separate source of water
 18 than the source that feeds the large -- the WCA-3 --
 19 MR. BISHOP: No, no. This is an aquifer that
 20 underlies both sides of the levee, the WCA and the basin.
 21 But if I can get back to -- I mean, your -- your
 22 question. Obviously, the seepage is an enormous source. 
 23 What I am told is that seepage alone will be enough to
 24 flood out towns like --
 25 QUESTION: But the seepage can't --

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BISHOP: There is other --
 2 QUESTION: But the seepage can't contain any of
 3 the pollution --
 4 MR. BISHOP: No. 
 5 QUESTION: -- because the water on the west side
 6 of the levee is -- is clean.
 7 MR. BISHOP: Well, it's not clean. I mean, it
 8 does contain pollutants under the definition of the Clean
 9 Water Act because that's a broad definition.
 10 QUESTION: Well, it's certainly cleaner than the
 11 water on the east side or you wouldn't have a lawsuit.
 12 MR. BISHOP: There is a substantial amount of
 13 water in the C-11 canal that comes from a -- a wide array
 14 of sources within the basin.
 15 QUESTION: But the water -- the seepage clearly
 16 is not what causes the problem. 
 17 MR. BISHOP: And that is -- just to go back to
 18 Justice Ginsburg's question, one way that we are
 19 addressing the phosphorus here is with the Corps. The
 20 Corps has built a new set of pumps right next to the S-9
 21 that is intended to intercept that cleaner seepage water,
 22 and it will pump that seepage water right back into the
 23 WCA before it is mixed with the more polluted waters from
 24 the C-11 basin. So that is one part of the effort. It is
 25 to get the seepage water back into the water conservation

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 area before it mixes with more polluted water.
 2 QUESTION: Which -- which means --
 3 MR. BISHOP: Those pumps are --
 4 QUESTION: Which means that the water to the
 5 east will be even more polluted and when you pump that
 6 back in, you'll be pumping more polluted water back in.
 7 MR. BISHOP: And the solution to that problem is
 8 that with the Corps and the task force and the EPA, a
 9 number of huge storage basins are being built. These
 10 require, obviously, buying a lot of land, putting together
 11 the land necessary for these STA's. But the -- the
 12 purpose of the plans under CERP is to stop as much water
 13 as possible getting from the C-11 to the water
 14 conservation area. 
 And so storing as much water as 15 possible in these basins will allow the phosphorus and
 16 other pollutants to settle out, and so water that is --
 17 and will also reduce the total amount of water that needs
 18 to be sent back into the conservation area.
 19 The combination of these new pumps getting the
 20 -- the cleaner water back into the -- into the
 21 conservation area and the storage basins, which will
 22 reduce the amount of flow and allow the pollutants to --
 23 to seep down, is -- is the essential way in which under
 24 CERP the problem of the phosphorus will be addressed. 
 25 No one disputes -- and the district least of all

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 disputes -- that cleaning up the Everglades and reducing
 2 the amount of phosphorus that gets into the water
 3 conservation area which, in turn, feeds the Everglades is
 4 a very important consideration.
 5 But you also have to understand that our
 6 purposes -- we are not -- we are not just dumping this
 7 water in -- in the water conservation area. This water
 8 could be sent to the ocean. In fact, on the eastern
 9 portion of the canal, the water is sent to the ocean. But
 10 the -- there are other functions, important functions,
 11 that are served by the water conservation area,
 12 maintaining water in there. One is the ability to --
 13 QUESTION: This is all very important, but on
 14 the legal question that we have, do you take the position 15 that it's a single body of water --
 16 MR. BISHOP: We take --
 17 QUESTION: -- and therefore no permit is
 18 required?
 19 MR. BISHOP: We take the position, first of all,
 20 that all of the navigable waters of the United States are
 21 unitary for purposes of determining whether they are --
 22 QUESTION: That's an extreme position, and you
 23 probably have a fall-back position. 
 24 MR. BISHOP: And the alternative --
 25 (Laughter.) 

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: You -- you go --
 2 MR. BISHOP: We do argue --
 3 QUESTION: What -- what's the fall-back?
 4 MR. BISHOP: The fall-back is precisely the one
 5 that you have described, Justice O'Connor, which is that
 6 these were -- these were unitary waters. They are divided
 7 solely by manmade structures that are changeable and are
 8 changing.
 9 QUESTION: Well, they have been altered by
 10 manmade structures so that they perhaps are no longer a
 11 single body. Is that what the Eleventh Circuit concluded
 12 in effect? 
 13 MR. BISHOP: Yes, I think the --
 14 QUESTION: That the manmade structures have
 15 separated them and they're no longer unitary.
 16 MR. BISHOP: It -- it did, but in doing that, it
 17 ignored a number of important considerations. One is the
 18 unitary aquifer that I have talked about. The second is
 19 the constant circulation --
 20 QUESTION: Does the record describe that
 21 aquifer? Does the record describe that aquifer? 
 22 MR. BISHOP: The -- yes. I -- I believe it's
 23 J.A. 177.
 24 QUESTION: While you're looking for that, I -- I
 25 find it hard to understand how you can interpret -- I can

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 understand how you can interpret the phrase, navigable
 2 waters, to mean all navigable waters. I can't understand
 3 how you can interpret the phrase, navigable waters, to
 4 mean only those navigable waters that are within a single
 5 aquifer or within a single drainage district. How -- how
 6 can you possibly derive that interpretation from the text?
 7 MR. BISHOP: No, I agree, Justice Scalia.
 8 QUESTION: Which is -- which is why you took the
 9 extreme position, that is really textually not very
 10 extreme at all.
 11 MR. BISHOP: No. I agree with that, Justice
 12 Scalia, obviously. But I -- but I do think that if there
 13 were a level of discomfort with that argument, which I
 14 think is -- you know, it's fully justified by the statute. 15 And I'd like to come back to that, Justice O'Connor, and
 16 explain the other textual basis for -- for that argument. 
 17 Nevertheless --
 18 QUESTION: Mr. Bishop, as I --
 19 MR. BISHOP: -- the concept of an addition --
 20 QUESTION: -- as I understand, that was the
 21 Government's brief and it was spelled out very clearly. I
 22 didn't understand your brief to be taking the position
 23 that all we have to worry about is the term, navigable
 24 water, then that's the end of it.
 25 MR. BISHOP: Well, we think that there is more

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to it than just the term, navigable water. We think that
 2 -- that we do -- we have argued throughout this case,
 3 including in the lower courts, that the navigable waters
 4 are a unitary concept for purposes of section 402.
 5 QUESTION: Mr. Bishop, isn't the problem with
 6 the unitary concept idea that given the purposes of the
 7 Clean Water Act, it makes great sense if there is a way of
 8 distinguishing between bodies of water to distinguish them
 9 in terms of their -- their pollution? And the -- in -- in
 10 effect, the -- the function of the kind of unitary
 11 definition is a function that -- that works against the
 12 protection of clean water as against to dirty water that
 13 can be added to it. And -- and shouldn't the -- shouldn't
 14 the purposes of the act be taken into consideration in 15 defining what is a body or a unified body of water?
 16 MR. BISHOP: The act does distinguish. Congress
 17 distinguished, when it wanted to, between the waters of
 18 the United States and specific portions of the navigable
 19 water. And there's an example of that at the bottom of 7a
 20 in the addendum.
 21 QUESTION: Are -- are you talking about a -- a
 22 distinction based on the -- the quality of the water as
 23 polluted or clean or relatively polluted/relatively clean?
 24 MR. BISHOP: The statute specifies that water
 25 quality standards which identify what the goal is for the

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 level of pollutants in the water and the TMDL's, the total
 2 maximum daily loads, that are used to achieve those water
 3 quality standards are set for specific portions or parts
 4 of the navigable water. That is, the State -- a State
 5 role is to identify, implement, and to enforce those water
 6 quality standards which do apply to separate bodies of
 7 water. The regulations talk about bodies of water.
 8 QUESTION: So you're saying -- you're saying
 9 that the problem that I'm raising is a problem that is
 10 dealt with solely by water quality standards and cannot be
 11 dealt with by -- by point source emission regulation. 
 12 MR. BISHOP: Well, I mean, that's -- that's -- I
 13 mean, because of the complexities of the act, that's not
 14 quite right. 
 As a definitional matter, the Congress 15 clearly distinguished between the navigable waters and
 16 those portions as to which water quality standards were to
 17 be set. In implementing water quality standards, a State
 18 may take account of the -- of effluence reaching the water
 19 through point sources. And in fact, there is a separate
 20 provision of the statute --
 21 QUESTION: All right, but assuming a State may
 22 do that, why does it follow that in defining bodies of
 23 water for point source purposes, we may not do that?
 24 MR. BISHOP: Well, just let me run through, if I
 25 may. I mean, first of all, there --

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: No, but answer my question before you
 2 run through because I -- I tend to lose the answers in the
 3 -- in the run-throughs.
 4 You're -- you're saying, look, when we're
 5 talking about water quality standards, there are
 6 distinctions made within a given body of water or within
 7 navigable water. And I think you're saying that for a
 8 point source emission issues, we don't make that kind of
 9 distinction. My question was, if the distinction can be
 10 made and in fact is made, with respect to water quality
 11 standards, why should it follow that the same distinction
 12 cannot be made for purposes of definition in point source
 13 problems? 
 14 MR. BISHOP: 
 Because Congress recognized that 15 this is a cooperative federalism statute where the Federal
 16 Government and the State government has their role --
 17 QUESTION: As I understood you --
 18 MR. BISHOP: -- and in the plain language --
 19 QUESTION: -- you didn't say it cannot be made. 
 20 You said it has not been made --
 21 MR. BISHOP: Well, it hasn't --
 22 QUESTION: -- in the statute.
 23 MR. BISHOP: It has been made in the statute.
 24 QUESTION: It has not been made and you're
 25 saying it would be illegitimate to make it as a matter of

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 interpretation. And my question is, why would it be
 2 illegitimate as a matter of interpretation?
 3 MR. BISHOP: Well, that's my run-through. The
 4 plain language of the statute is navigable waters defined
 5 as the waters of the United States. That is backed up by
 6 the use of the broad term discharge in section 401(a)
 7 where Congress meant to reach much more and which isn't
 8 limited by this language of an addition to the navigable
 9 waters.
 10 It is backed up by 304(f)(2)(F) where Congress
 11 described as non-point source pollution pollution
 12 resulting from the changes in the flow and circulation of
 13 navigable waters or ground waters caused by flow diversion
 14 devices like the pump.
 15 And it's backed up by the fact that neither
 16 Congress nor EPA has ever at any time since 1972 suggested
 17 that these sorts of movements of water should be governed
 18 by section 402.
 19 If I may reserve the balance of my time.
 20 QUESTION: Then what did -- what did the tribe
 21 mean when it said that there are, I think -- major
 22 components of the Everglades construction project are
 23 already under NPDES programs? 
 24 MR. BISHOP: Those are the STA's. The
 25 regulation 122.2, the definitional regulation, defines

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 treatment areas as not being navigable waters. So when
 2 you move water from a treatment area to a navigable water,
 3 that requires 402 permitting.
 4 If I may reserve the balance of my time.
 5 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bishop.
 6 Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
 9 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
 10 QUESTION: Mr. Minear, before you start, if I
 11 may just -- could you tell me if you think the record
 12 explains where the water in the eastern -- east of the
 13 C-11 basin originates?
 14 MR. MINEAR: I'm not sure the record is clear on
 15 this, Your Honor.
 16 QUESTION: Because the part that Mr. Bishop
 17 brought my attention to does not answer the question. 
 18 MR. MINEAR: I'm -- I cannot give you assurance.
 19 QUESTION: You don't -- you don't know the
 20 answer.
 21 MR. MINEAR: I do not know the answer to that,
 22 Your Honor. 
 23 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
 24 The United States submits that the Clean Water
 25 Act does not require the South Florida Water Management

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 District to obtain a section 402 permit for the operation
 2 of water control facilities like the S-9 pump which simply
 3 move water from one location to another. We believe that
 4 position is correct on the basis of both the text of the
 5 statute, the overarching purposes of the statute and its
 6 structure, and also EPA's actual practices.
 7 I'd like to turn first to the text of the
 8 statute. Section 402 states that a NPDES permit is
 9 required when there is an addition of a pollutant to
 10 navigable waters from a point source, and section 5027
 11 goes on to state that a -- the waters -- the navigable
 12 waters are the waters of the United States.
 13 Under that definition and those statutory
 14 provisions, when an industrial out-fall introduces 15 pollutants for the first time into the waters of the
 16 United States, an NPDES permit is required. However, when
 17 a water control facility like the S-9 pump simply moves
 18 water from one place to another, together with any
 19 pollutants that might be contained therein, that
 20 regulatory regime is not called into play.
 21 QUESTION: But if in fact an industrialist adds
 22 quite -- something quite filthy out of a pipe into a clean
 23 body of water, there is no addition if, at the same time,
 24 in some other body of water, he's taking out an equivalent
 25 amount.

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MINEAR: I think that the -- the text
 2 precludes that understanding because it states any
 3 addition of any pollutant. And we think the use -- these
 4 definitions are written quite carefully, and we think that
 5 those -- the term any --
 6 QUESTION: So a single body of water is --
 7 MR. MINEAR: -- indicates you can't rule it out.
 8 QUESTION: A single body of water, which seems
 9 to have been a concept that the EPA has used for years and
 10 years -- that's irrelevant.
 11 MR. MINEAR: That is -- that's not the case that
 12 EPA has used a single body of water.
 13 QUESTION: They haven't. They've never said --
 14 MR. MINEAR: No. I think that in fact the --
 15 the approach that EPA has taken in this is -- can be seen
 16 from a number of sources. First of all, EPA has never
 17 attempted to regulate water control facilities like the
 18 S-9 pump in the 30 years that the NPDES program has been
 19 in place. And what's more, in cases, the closely
 20 analogous cases, of dams where water is simply being
 21 passed through a dam, EPA has taken the position that an
 22 NPDES permit is not required. 
 23 Part of the reason for this is there are other
 24 regulatory programs that deal with these problems. 
 25 Justice Breyer mentioned the problem of taking a polluted

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 river and combining it with a pristine river. That
 2 actually implicates a number of different programs. First
 3 of all, in the case of the polluted river, that river is
 4 subject to 402 requirements, and so there will be steps
 5 taken to prevent the discharge of pollutants into the
 6 polluted river.
 7 The States also are required, or at least
 8 strongly urged by the Government and with strong carrot
 9 and stick type incentives, to adopt non-point source
 10 pollution programs to reduce any non-point pollution that
 11 might be going into that polluted river. 
 12 If there's an attempt to connect that river to
 13 another river, it does implicate, as Mr. Bishop indicated,
 14 the section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act which deals
 15 with regulations that result in the change in the flow
 16 of --
 17 QUESTION: What about -- C-11 doesn't come
 18 within that because it's not polluted enough?
 19 MR. MINEAR: C-11, when it was first constructed
 20 at that -- at the time that the C-11 canal was built back
 21 in the 1950's, most likely -- well, it was in fact
 22 constructed by the Corps of Engineers. So it was subject
 23 to the public interest review provisions that the Rivers
 24 and Harbors Act envisions. When the -- the Corps
 25 investigates private connections of this type, it conducts

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 what's called a public interest review, and this is
 2 described in your case, United States v. Alaska at 503
 3 U.S. 569.
 4 QUESTION: What about the other half of what I
 5 said, that I'm thinking if you were to be wrong on that,
 6 if I thought you were wrong on what you've said --
 7 assumption -- then it's not so bad for you because EPA can
 8 handle what I call the California central river valley
 9 project by the Costle -- you know what I'm thinking of. 
 10 Leventhal's opinion in Costle. Does that ring a bell? 
 11 NRDC v. Costle. Does that ring a bell to you?
 12 MR. MINEAR: I'm afraid I'm not familiar with
 13 that. That's --
 14 QUESTION: 
 He lists -- in that opinion there, he 15 lists -- he lists a set of things that EPA could do under
 16 the permit requirement that would, in fact, alleviate the
 17 administrative burden and would make sure that all these
 18 pipes and things in California don't really have an
 19 administrative problem or other problem by having to go to
 20 EPA to get the permit. 
 21 MR. MINEAR: EPA has substantial discretion to
 22 minimize the types of regulatory burdens that might be
 23 imposed here. Nevertheless, they're likely to be
 24 substantial. And what they amount to in this case is
 25 really a belt and suspenders approach, and you know, the

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 additional haberdashery is fine except for the cost that
 2 it does entail. In this case it could be very substantial
 3 for projects throughout the Nation.
 4 QUESTION: Don't you think there would be
 5 another lawsuit quite promptly if -- if EPA simply said
 6 you automatically get a permit for this type of operation?
 7 MR. MINEAR: I think that's correct. And in
 8 addition, I think we have to consider what would a permit
 9 accomplish in this case that the CERP project that the
 10 Corps of Engineers has -- is implementing is not already
 11 doing. That project is designed to deal with these
 12 problems.
 13 The permitting program is really designed to
 14 deal with the specific problem of introducing pollutants 15 into waterways for the first time. It's really not
 16 capable of dealing with this problem of water transfers
 17 that move from one place to another. Rather, there are
 18 other programs that deal with this. If it's a Federal
 19 program, it would be subject to NEPA, for instance, and
 20 there would be an environmental analysis before any action
 21 was taken. 
 22 In the case of the Rivers and Harbors Act that I
 23 described before, that would also implicate section 401 of
 24 the Clean Water Act, which requires a water quality
 25 certification, a determination from the State that in fact

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 waters would be -- would not violate water quality
 2 standards.
 3 I'd like to make the point also that our
 4 position is not an extreme one in saying that the -- the
 5 text requires that we only look at the pollution when it
 6 first enters the water. Rather, it's a -- it's a approach
 7 that recognizes that cleaning up polluted water requires a
 8 number of different control strategies. The NPDES
 9 permitting program is only one.
 10 QUESTION: Well, what do we make of information
 11 such as that provided by the State of Pennsylvania,
 12 talking about the application of the permit system to
 13 interbasin transfers in that State and saying how
 14 beneficial it has been?
 15 MR. MINEAR: Well, the State of -- the
 16 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania can, of course, adopt that
 17 type of program on its own under its State law to deal
 18 with those types of programs. Any State can.
 19 QUESTION: It tells us that it's been getting
 20 permits under this Federal scheme and that it's been
 21 helpful.
 22 MR. MINEAR: That might very well be, and it is
 23 allowed to supplement the Federal scheme with its own
 24 State additions. But other States, such as California,
 25 have found --

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: I don't understand that. You
 2 conceded that in Pennsylvania EPA permits are obtained?
 3 MR. MINEAR: No. These -- the -- EPA has
 4 delegated authority to implement the permitting program to
 5 a number of States, including Pennsylvania. So
 6 Pennsylvania is issuing the 402 permits in lieu of the
 7 Federal Government. My point is --
 8 QUESTION: It's done the same thing in Florida. 
 9 EPA has delegated to the State agency, hasn't it?
 10 MR. MINEAR: That's true. In fact, it has in
 11 most States. So in fact, in most States the States are
 12 issuing these permits with substantial guidance from the
 13 Federal Government. The Federal Government is setting the
 14 floor for what the permit requirements are, but the States 15 are free to supplement their permitting programs with
 16 additional State requirements and many do so. Many States
 17 like California actually operate with additional programs
 18 apart from the Clean Water Act. I think that Judge
 19 Kennedy when he was -- or Justice Kennedy -- excuse me --
 20 when he was a judge on the Ninth Circuit, wrote an opinion
 21 concerning the New Malones project where he talked about
 22 the imposition of water quality standards at -- at the
 23 State level on Federal projects and indicated that the
 24 States, in fact, do have that authority as well.
 25 My -- my point here is that there are a number

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 of different mechanisms here in which these problems can
 2 be addressed, and the important point is to choose the
 3 right one. In this context, the NPDES permitting program
 4 is not the correct mechanism for dealing with the problems
 5 that the Florida Everglades faces. Instead, that problem
 6 is being addressed comprehensively through Federal and
 7 State programs. 
 8 QUESTION: Is that the view that EPA takes?
 9 MR. MINEAR: Yes, that is the view. The brief
 10 of the United States here is it reflects a consensus of a
 11 number of agencies, not only EPA but the Department of the
 12 Interior, the Corps of Engineers, and the Department of
 13 Army. 
 14 And I'd like to mention there's been some
 15 suggestion that this Court should draw inferences from the
 16 names that are on the cover of the brief, and those
 17 inferences should not be drawn. The names on the brief
 18 have no relationship to whether or not -- the absence of
 19 the names of an agency does not indicate the brief does --
 20 does not represent the views of a particular agency. That
 21 can be seen in a number of briefs, including the Swank
 22 brief from two terms ago in which Administrator Browner
 23 was a party in that case, a party to the proceeding, and
 24 yet there are no EPA counsel names on the brief.
 25 QUESTION: But I notice that there's a brief

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 filed by former administrators and general counsel which
 2 says that the position of the EPA back in '75 was that of
 3 your opponent.
 4 MR. MINEAR: They're relying on a 1975 general
 5 counsel opinion that addressed the question of irrigation
 6 return flows. Congress repudiated the position that was
 7 taken there 2 years later in the 1977 amendments. It
 8 mentions this point only tangentially. It's not even
 9 among the 17 questions presented that are listed in that
 10 opinion. 
 11 And I think what's more telling is the practice
 12 of EPA since that time. EPA has not required permits from
 13 water control facilities to do no more than move water.
 14 QUESTION: Can I make one thing clear? You do
 15 not endorse the position of the petitioner that it has to
 16 be the point source itself that -- that causes the
 17 pollution.
 18 MR. MINEAR: That is correct. We do not endorse
 19 that addition.
 20 Thank you, Your Honor. 
 21 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Minear.
 22 Mr. Lehtinen, we'll hear from you.
 23 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEXTER W. LEHTINEN
 24 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 25 MR. LEHTINEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 please the Court:
 2 The Miccosukee Tribe and Friends of the
 3 Everglades contend that a pollutant is added to navigable
 4 waters whenever it's put into navigable waters where it
 5 would not otherwise be, whenever it's put somewhere where
 6 it's not already there or would not naturally flow.
 7 The receiving navigable water body is the point
 8 of focus under the Clean Water Act because the act
 9 specifically provides for designating different water
 10 bodies with specific designated uses and with associated
 11 water quality standards that will protect those uses. And
 12 the associated permitting system of the act 402 rests on
 13 the assumption that the proprietary of the -
 14 proprietariness of the proposed addition of a pollutant 15 will be measured against the receiving navigable water
 16 body's designated use and against the receiving navigable
 17 water body's water quality standards.
 18 QUESTION: What -- what says that? I mean, the
 19 -- the text we're dealing with here talks about adding
 20 pollutants to the navigable waters of the United States if
 21 you read the two definitions together. And as I see
 22 what's happened here, no pollutants have been added to the
 23 navigable waters of the United States. The total amount
 24 of pollutants is the same.
 25 MR. LEHTINEN: Yes. Justice Scalia, it says any

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 addition of any pollutant to -- to navigable waters. The
 2 reason navigable waters need not have and would be
 3 confusing to have any adjective is because the location of
 4 the point source inherently dictates the receiving
 5 navigable water.
 6 QUESTION: You -- it could -- it could say to a
 7 particular navigable water. It could have said that very
 8 easily. It doesn't -- it doesn't say that. It says to
 9 navigable waters. 
 10 MR. LEHTINEN: It could, Your Honor, but since
 11 the permitting system is from a point source, it would not
 12 make sense to say to any other navigable water that the
 13 point source is not discharging to. The point source
 14 itself makes the location of the navigable waters 15 specified by the fact that the point source can only
 16 discharge --
 17 QUESTION: No, it doesn't. It doesn't -- it
 18 doesn't do what you say the provision does, that -- that
 19 is, to make it unlawful without a permit to add to a
 20 particular navigable water a pollutant that is not already
 21 there but that is elsewhere in the navigable waters. As
 22 it's written, all it says is you shall not add pollutants
 23 to the navigable waters of the United States. That's how
 24 those definitions work out. And that has not happened
 25 here.

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LEHTINEN: Yes, Justice Scalia, but if that
 2 were the meaning of that text and the lack of an
 3 adjective, any navigable waters were to mean that once in
 4 navigable waters, that pollutant could be spread to any
 5 navigable water with any different designated use or any
 6 different water quality --
 7 QUESTION: As far as this provision is
 8 concerned.
 9 MR. LEHTINEN: That's correct, Your Honor. And
 10 this provision has been recognized as being the main
 11 method by which the Clean Water Act cleans up water.
 12 The -- the problem of the polluted river or
 13 dirty river is one problem with the interpretation that
 14 there's a singular navigable waters. 
 An example -- a 15 specific example is the Dubois case, in which the
 16 Pemigewassett River was, in fact, so bad that the First
 17 Circuit said it peeled paint off of the adjoining
 18 buildings on the bank. That river, under this
 19 interpretation, would have been put into Loon Pond
 20 strictly for the purpose of resupplying Loon Pond. It
 21 didn't always go through snow-making equipment. The First
 22 Circuit made it clear that sometimes it is directly from
 23 the east branch to Loon Pond. 
 24 Furthermore, it would make it impossible to
 25 actually administer the permitting system because a permit

33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 writer is told to evaluate the propriety of the proposed
 2 addition of a pollutant based on the designated use and
 3 the water quality standards of the receiving navigable
 4 water. It wouldn't be effective if thereafter that permit
 5 were deemed, as a matter of law, to have authorized the
 6 addition of that pollutant throughout the entire United
 7 States to any navigable water no matter what its
 8 designated use and no matter what its water quality
 9 standard.
 10 QUESTION: Is it just the First Circuit case or
 11 is there any history in the EPA over the years, I guess 30
 12 years, where they did make clear that the navigable waters
 13 of the United States -- the discharge is not just like one
 14 big water where the Sacramento River and Hudson are part 15 of the same big water?
 16 MR. LEHTINEN: Yes, the United States, Justice
 17 Breyer, on many occasions -- starting in 1975 EPA general
 18 counsel issued the opinion that surface water runoff and
 19 return flows from irrigation, even when in navigable
 20 waters, that is to say an agricultural canal, when then
 21 discharged to other navigable waters, would require a
 22 permit. Congress did not repudiate that because what --
 23 Congress, if it had repudiated it, would have said that
 24 was not an addition. In fact, Congress --
 25 QUESTION: Return flow from -- from irrigation

34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 seems to me quite different. I mean, that is taking
 2 something out of the navigable waters, adding something to
 3 it, and then returning it to the navigable waters. It's
 4 -- it's the fertilizer and -- and other pollutants that
 5 are picked up in the irrigation process that -- that is
 6 the problem. 
 7 MR. LEHTINEN: But the question --
 8 QUESTION: That's quite different from just
 9 transferring from one navigable water to another.
 10 MR. LEHTINEN: Well, those elements of it are,
 11 Justice Scalia, but what the EPA opinion --
 12 QUESTION: But why are they different? They go
 13 along and the water is pure and it sort of picks up some
 14 drainage from Tallahassee or someplace, and now it's not 15 quite the same, and by the time they get it next to the
 16 big lake there, it's filled with stuff, just like the --
 17 just like the stuff that drains off the land.
 18 MR. LEHTINEN: Well, it is not different when it
 19 gets into the canal. The C-11 canal, which is a drainage
 20 canal that receives surface water runoff, like an -- a
 21 agricultural canal that receives irrigation return flow,
 22 is itself a jurisdictional navigable waters under this
 23 Court's decisions in Riverside Bayview simply because it's
 24 connected to, in this case, the Atlantic. In other words,
 25 it's not navigable in fact itself.

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, apart from the -- what --
 2 1972 --
 3 MR. LEHTINEN: Yes.
 4 QUESTION: -- general counsel opinion, which --
 5 which applied to -- to return from -- from cultivated
 6 land, do you -- do you deny that -- that the EPA has never
 7 sought to require permitting of this kind of a facility
 8 for 30 years? Is -- is that inaccurate?
 9 MR. LEHTINEN: Yes. Well, it is inaccurate in
 10 the sense that in 1993 EPA told the South Florida Water
 11 Management District, to its chagrin, that it would have to
 12 have NPDES permits for all of these Everglades
 13 construction project features that were motivated by the
 14 United States v. South Florida Water --
 15 QUESTION: So that States have been violating
 16 the Federal law for 30 years and nobody knew about it?
 17 MR. LEHTINEN: I'm sorry, Your Honor? 
 18 QUESTION: The States have been violating the
 19 Federal law for 30 years.
 20 MR. LEHTINEN: Well, in most cases --
 21 QUESTION: That's kind of an extraordinary
 22 interpretation.
 23 MR. LEHTINEN: In most cases, Your Honor, the
 24 simple movement of water does not end up, even under
 25 Miccosukee -- this case, requiring a permit. Most of them

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 are -- are not covered. They return to the same water
 2 body. The dam cases make it clear that that's a return to
 3 the same water body. If they're --
 4 QUESTION: You don't -- you think the dam cases
 5 are correctly decided and you don't need to distinguish
 6 them?
 7 MR. LEHTINEN: We distinguish them, Your Honor,
 8 because the dam cases dealt with the condition -- the D.C.
 9 Circuit made it clear in the Gorsuch case in '82 that dam-
 10 induced changes in condition such as super-saturation and
 11 so forth, and that that was not a pollutant. They didn't
 12 say dams weren't point sources. They said that was not a
 13 pollutant.
 14 QUESTION: 
 I thought same water body made no 15 difference to you. I thought neither side thought that
 16 the answer to this case depended upon whether it was the
 17 same water body or not. If -- do you think that if it --
 18 if -- if it is established that -- that this is the same
 19 water body, these pumps would be okay without permitting.
 20 MR. LEHTINEN: No, Your Honor, because --
 21 QUESTION: I thought so. Neither side takes
 22 that position.
 23 MR. LEHTINEN: Neither side takes the position,
 24 but it is true that the phrase, water body, because it's
 25 used in so much of the EPA regulations, is a shorthand for

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 saying that the pollutant is added to a navigable water
 2 that wouldn't otherwise receive it. The fact is that as
 3 the First Circuit said, the argument about whether Loon
 4 Pond, well up here -- uphill from the Pemigewassett River,
 5 east branch, was hydrologically connected or not was
 6 irrelevant because Loon Pond would never receive water
 7 from the Pemigewassett River, even though that Loon Pond
 8 eventually flowed through the watershed to the river.
 9 QUESTION: The dam --
 10 QUESTION: May I ask you a question about --
 11 QUESTION: -- our problem, aren't they, that --
 12 that the -- for you. That is that it seems to me that
 13 under your definition, it's going to be the same body of
 14 water. 
 And then if you say, well, it didn't add any 15 pollutant that wouldn't have been there otherwise, I bet
 16 that with most dams that isn't so, I mean, because there's
 17 a lot of mud stirred up in that lake behind the, say,
 18 Boulder, Hoover Dam and so forth. A big problem. 
 19 And if we think of California and the central
 20 valley water project, my goodness, you're not going to say
 21 that's all one body of water. You have the Sacramento,
 22 San Joaquin, Los Angeles. You know, it goes all over the
 23 place. 
 24 And so that's their big problem. They are
 25 saying if you -- if you don't take a strong reading of the

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 dam cases, one that hurts you, we're suddenly going to
 2 find ourselves with -- with water valley projects all over
 3 the United States and 15 million permits required, and it
 4 just won't work. 
 5 All right. So what's your response to that? 
 6 MR. LEHTINEN: Well, Your Honor, first with
 7 respect to the same body of water, if you were referring
 8 to the Everglades, this is a -- C-11 is a canal that has
 9 gas stations, urban shopping malls, industrial parks
 10 around it. And the canal itself was dug out. It's not as
 11 though 99.99 percent of the Everglades were removed. So
 12 that canal has been dug deeper. The Everglades' ecosystem
 13 removed. It's distinctly different. 
 14 QUESTION: 
 That's why I think we need a separate 15 body of water requirement there. But what about the other
 16 part of what they say?
 17 MR. LEHTINEN: Well, with respect to these
 18 larger water projects, Your Honor, first of all, if
 19 they're withdrawing water, they're not going to come under
 20 our condition, withdrawing and then being used for a
 21 consumptive use and so forth. That's already dealt with a
 22 different way. If they're returning the water through
 23 irrigation return flow, that's already exempt.
 24 Otherwise, if they're -- the State does
 25 designate the use and does designate the water quality

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 standards. So these large movements through canals and
 2 water projects -- the State controls the designation of
 3 those uses.
 4 And even if they were found to be a movement
 5 from one navigable water to another, they're likely to
 6 qualify for a general permit. As Colorado said on page 3
 7 of its brief, none of their movements of water, through
 8 any structures in Colorado, interbasin transfers, result
 9 in a water quality standard violation. Accordingly,
 10 Colorado solves any problem it has with one general
 11 permit.
 12 As well, most of these big movements of water
 13 move water that doesn't distinctly, as in this case, move
 14 water that's four times higher in a certain content than 15 the receiving water body's water quality standard. The
 16 State law for the Everglades and only the Everglades
 17 protection area, not the C-11 canal, is now 10 parts per
 18 billion. That actual number was changed and became
 19 effective January 1 of 2004, but it had a separate
 20 designation and water quality standard throughout all of
 21 the time of this case. 
 22 QUESTION: May I ask you two questions that I --
 23 I think you may have answered, but I'm just not sure? Do
 24 you -- in your view is water conservation area 3 and the
 25 C-11 basin the same body of water, or are they different

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 bodies? That's my first question. 
 2 My second question is in your view does the
 3 record tell us where the water from the C-11 basin
 4 primarily comes from?
 5 MR. LEHTINEN: Yes, Justice Stevens. With
 6 respect to the first, they're distinctly different bodies
 7 of water. The C-11 canal is a canal that has been dug
 8 artificially deep, surrounded by gas stations, shopping
 9 malls. 
 10 QUESTION: I understand that.
 11 MR. LEHTINEN: And it does not have the ecology
 12 of the Everglades. Nobody stands at a gas station and
 13 says to their child, there, John, is the Everglades. It
 14 -- it has -- and it doesn't have Everglades water because 15 Everglades water would naturally flow west to east, and
 16 they have blocked that flow from the Everglades into the
 17 sloughs and into the Atlantic Ocean.
 18 QUESTION: Then what about the second question? 
 19 MR. LEHTINEN: With respect to the second, the
 20 record shows the trial court found that substantial
 21 surface water runoff goes into the C-11, and --
 22 QUESTION: That's right, but why does the --
 23 what is the source of the runoff?
 24 MR. LEHTINEN: Well, the source of the runoff is
 25 sometimes rainfall.

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: I understand. 
 2 MR. LEHTINEN: And it is sometimes from the
 3 aquifer --
 4 QUESTION: But surely it didn't get all their
 5 water from -- from rain.
 6 MR. LEHTINEN: And it is sometimes from the
 7 aquifer below the C-11 because the C-11 basin, as opposed
 8 to the canal -- the C-11 basin is a -- has been drained
 9 and substantial fill put in for the gas --
 10 QUESTION: But that -- that thing in the -- the
 11 water in the aquifer in turn comes largely from the
 12 Everglades, does it not?
 13 MR. LEHTINEN: Your Honor --
 14 QUESTION: 
 It filters down to the aquifer from 15 the Everglades and then seeps through to the other side of
 16 the levee. I thought it was -- I thought it was
 17 acknowledged on both sides that there's -- that there's
 18 transfer of water from the west to the east below the
 19 levee.
 20 MR. LEHTINEN: Yes, Your Honor, from west to
 21 east, but not east to west, and when the water transfers
 22 through the --
 23 QUESTION: Well, but that doesn't -- that
 24 doesn't go to the point of whether it's the same body of
 25 water or not. I mean, whether it flows east to west or

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 west to east, the point is it's -- it's the same water.
 2 MR. LEHTINEN: Well, Your Honor, the fact that
 3 waters will flow from the -- in that case, there would be
 4 perhaps three bodies of water in the United States: east
 5 of the Appalachian Divide, west of it, and -- and then
 6 separated by the Continental Divide in the west. The fact
 7 that one water will flow eventually into the other doesn't
 8 make them the same water body. That is to say, Loon Pond,
 9 which was a substantially different ecology and water
 10 quality standard and different classification by the
 11 State, flowing eventually into the polluted Pemigewassett
 12 River much further downstream, did not make them the same
 13 water body. 
 14 QUESTION: 
 You say that subsurface flow doesn't 15 count then in this question. 
 16 MR. LEHTINEN: That's correct. In this case
 17 subsurface flow -- that water is substantially changed in
 18 the aquifer. By the time it's underneath the C-11, it
 19 doesn't have the biological or ecosystem characteristics
 20 of the water that is in the Everglades protection area. 
 21 It's been substantially changed by the -- by the aquifer.
 22 QUESTION: But you say this doesn't matter
 23 anyway. You wouldn't care if it was the same water body. 
 24 That isn't -- that isn't what you're arguing.
 25 MR. LEHTINEN: We do argue that it is the same

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 water body and you pump it substantially upstream. You
 2 would also need a permit. 
 3 QUESTION: Right, right.
 4 MR. LEHTINEN: The downstream Pemigewassett
 5 River --
 6 QUESTION: If -- if -- do you know any place we
 7 could look for a definition of what is the same water
 8 body? Is -- is there some -- some -- can I -- you know,
 9 I'm not sure.
 10 MR. LEHTINEN: Well, there is a -- there is a --
 11 QUESTION: We could try Genesis --
 12 (Laughter.) 
 13 QUESTION: -- or then the second --
 14 (Laughter.) 
 15 MR. LEHTINEN: There is -- there is EPA
 16 guidance, but the fact that 303 of the act itself mandates
 17 that States designate different water bodies and the
 18 phrase, water bodies, used in the EPA specification of
 19 what water quality standards is means that, as a matter of
 20 fact, it's done all of the time. And in the State of
 21 Florida, the State legislature has designated the
 22 Everglades protection area quite distinct from the canal,
 23 a different water quality standard and a -- and a
 24 different use for that water. And as a hydrological
 25 matter, they are -- they are able to -- to deal with that.

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 They've given them different water body numbers in the
 2 State of Florida. The C-11 canal is a different water
 3 body number from the Everglades -- various parts of the
 4 Everglades protection area and -- and so forth.
 5 The --
 6 QUESTION: Could you explain what's at stake
 7 here practically? We're told that there are other means
 8 to deal with this phosphorus problem. If the permit you
 9 envision were required, what would that permit demand?
 10 MR. LEHTINEN: This permit would most likely
 11 require simply that the plan that the district already has
 12 -- has on the books and which they mentioned in their
 13 brief would be implemented within a reasonable period of
 14 time and under a reasonable compliance schedule. 15 The Everglades restoration project was first
 16 motivated, as -- as is admitted in all briefs, by
 17 litigation against the district for discharging phosphorus
 18 that caused an imbalance of natural populations of flora
 19 and fauna, and furthermore, all of the congressional acts
 20 that deal with the Everglades restoration projects --
 21 that's -- and they're referred to in our brief called
 22 WRDA, Water Resources Development Act '96 and Water
 23 Resources Development Act 2000 -- both refer to the
 24 pending litigation and make the statement that they don't
 25 intend to interfere with pending litigation. And WRDA

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 2000 specifically says that nothing in these Everglades
 2 restoration -- this section shall be deemed to eliminate
 3 any permitting requirements under law.
 4 QUESTION: What is -- what is then the -- the
 5 reason for this litigation? I mean, you -- you say you're
 6 just trying to get them to do what they have already said
 7 they are doing.
 8 MR. LEHTINEN: Yes.
 9 QUESTION: You don't believe that they're doing
 10 it.
 11 MR. LEHTINEN: Well, Your Honor --
 12 QUESTION: And you don't believe they're going
 13 to do it, you know, in the foreseeable future.
 14 MR. LEHTINEN: 
 We -- we believe, as -- as 15 Congress did, that the Clean Water Act -- that the
 16 programs in place were not always implemented and that the
 17 Clean Water Act was necessary as a backstop to stop the
 18 backsliding. The Federal Government's litigation in 1988
 19 required the State to do no more than the State in press
 20 releases was saying that it was doing and intended to do,
 21 but the litigation, reinforced by Congress that
 22 specifically said we don't intend to interfere with any of
 23 that litigation, indicates why Federal enforcement is a --
 24 is a useful and necessary tool to ensure that States under
 25 different pressures don't backslide.

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Our brief appendix indicates that 2 years ago
 2 they indicated they would meet water quality standards in
 3 the S-9 by 2005, and then with the pendency of this
 4 litigation, they have eliminated any commitment to reach
 5 it by 2005, hoping that this litigation will first relieve
 6 them of the oversight of the NPDES on S-9 and then they
 7 will use this litigation to eliminate the NPDES's that
 8 were required from 1993 forward on the other projects. 
 9 The only thing that keeps those -- those other discharge
 10 structures under the restoration project from not being
 11 extended or otherwise modified by the State are the EPA-
 12 placed NPDES permits that already exist on all of those
 13 Everglades restoration projects. We simply want the same
 14 permitting backstop on the S-9 structure.
 15 With respect to the question of singular waters,
 16 the singular waters approach of the United States
 17 eliminates the different designated uses and the ability
 18 to actually determine the effects of a permit. The
 19 Minnesota amici brief is very useful in this sense because
 20 it points out that St. Paul now, like the Commonwealth of
 21 Pennsylvania and others, does get an NPDES to remove water
 22 from the Mississippi to its lake and water reservoir. 
 23 However, if the Solicitor General's position were correct,
 24 St. Paul would no longer need that NPDES permit, and St.
 25 Cloud, substantially up-river on the Mississippi, would --

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 would be under a -- a review for does its discharges to
 2 the Mississippi, which have been found to meet the NPDES
 3 requirements, not changing the designated use or violating
 4 the Mississippi's water quality standard -- it -- its
 5 discharges should be deemed to be somehow removable
 6 artificially downstream in the Mississippi so that
 7 anyplace anyone at any time might construct the pipe and
 8 move them into a more pristine water body, you, St. Cloud
 9 now have to anticipate that and will be put under that --
 10 that mandate.
 11 So the inability of a permit writer to construct
 12 a 402 permit because he doesn't know that the evaluation
 13 is now to the receiving navigable water, but instead I
 14 have to evaluate where anyone with a pipe might move it, 15 hundreds and hundreds of miles, without an NPDES permit,
 16 that permit writer essentially has to permit only for the
 17 highest designated use and the highest water quality
 18 standard anywhere in the United States, notwithstanding
 19 that where the discharge -- point source is discharging to
 20 is a particular designated use. That would make the act
 21 either impossible to administer or place burdens on the
 22 governments that the petitioner says should not be placed
 23 on the governments. Instead of placing it on the
 24 government that for some purpose, some economic purpose,
 25 is able to -- to determine the costs and to -- and to

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 clean the water or at least subject itself to review, when
 2 it takes it from a navigable water into a pristine
 3 navigable water, you place the burden instead on anyone
 4 else who might discharge so -- and -- and whose -- whose
 5 discharge, might, if removed anywhere downstream by anyone
 6 for any reason, might end up causing a violation of a
 7 water quality standard.
 8 QUESTION: Look -- look, when -- when the States
 9 require permitting, as -- as they're allowed to do, they
 10 can presumably limit the permitting to just the -- the
 11 kind of difficult situations you're talking about, when it
 12 is into a pristine body of water from a more polluted body
 13 of water. But if we agree with you on the meaning of the
 14 act, permitting will be mandatory not just when -- when 15 there are differences between the pollution levels of the
 16 two bodies of water, but whenever there is a transfer from
 17 one body of water to another. Even when the two bodies of
 18 water are equally polluted, you would need a permit
 19 because you are adding -- you are adding pollutants.
 20 MR. LEHTINEN: Well, Your Honor --
 21 QUESTION: Now, it may well be you're adding
 22 pollutants to a body of water that already contains it,
 23 but you will need a -- a permit in every case whenever any
 24 State tries to do flood control projects or any project
 25 that requires the transfer of water from one body to

49
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 another.
 2 MR. LEHTINEN: Well, in the so-called worst
 3 case, Justice Scalia, they'd be qualifying because they
 4 don't have a -- they're not impairing either water body --
 5 qualifying for one general permit issued in the State. 
 6 But under other circumstances --
 7 QUESTION: Excuse me. Can you do that? Can --
 8 I mean, can EPA issue a general permit, say anybody
 9 that --
 10 MR. LEHTINEN: Yes, Your Honor. General permits
 11 are authorized and they are often written to say under the
 12 following conditions, you qualify for the general permit,
 13 and -- and --
 14 QUESTION: You don't have to get it. You just
 15 -- just --
 16 MR. LEHTINEN: That's correct, Your Honor. You
 17 don't have to get it.
 18 QUESTION: You just go ahead.
 19 MR. LEHTINEN: The general permit might or might
 20 not say to do certain monitoring to make sure that you
 21 stay within the conditions of the general permit. Those
 22 general permits are very common, and even individual
 23 permits are usually system-wide permits. You have 80
 24 structures --
 25 QUESTION: You say a general permit. You mean

50
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that applies to a number of different people? 
 2 MR. LEHTINEN: Yes, Your Honor. A general
 3 permit can be statewide. The permit looks almost like a
 4 rule, but the permit says -- and in the case of the Corps,
 5 they do nationwide permits, but 404 is not at issue here. 
 6 The general permit statewide could say that under the
 7 following circumstances, when you are an unimpaired water
 8 body discharging to an unimpaired water body or
 9 discharging at levels that have pollutants but don't
 10 impair the receiving water body, you automatically qualify
 11 for this permit. Do some monitoring. Let us know every
 12 year. That general permit is -- is frequently used and --
 13 and is very close to rulemaking.
 14 But it's also possible, under those 15 circumstances -- and this is not our case. Our case
 16 discharges at almost four times the water quality
 17 standard, 10 parts per billion, for the receiving water
 18 body. It clearly impairs the receiving water body. But
 19 if the standard for a water body were 20 of a substance,
 20 its actual receiving level was 10 and you discharged at 5,
 21 not to get too complex, but you're discharging at a lower
 22 level than the receiving water body and the water bodies
 23 are not impaired, it's possible mathematically, but not
 24 our case here -- these hypotheticals should be left to
 25 another time. It's possible that the 1 gallon in the

51
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 receiving water body that had 10, with 1 gallon added to
 2 it that had 5, the 2 gallons now have 15, or in fact,
 3 7-and-a-half per receiving unit. That may be determined
 4 by rule or other appropriate analysis in the western
 5 cases, if they ever come up, to not be an addition. But
 6 that's not our case here. 
 7 The Court, in an abundance of caution, could
 8 point out that our case here is an artificial canal that
 9 receives substantial surface water runoff, itself probably
 10 a conveyance under the Clean Water Act definition of
 11 channels or discrete conveyances, that it discharges at
 12 levels up to four times the receiving water body's water
 13 quality standard, that it is itself an impaired water
 14 body. 
 So that the hypothetical situations or application 15 to western States or elsewhere is -- are not being
 16 addressed by the Court.
 17 Now -- now, the -- the amici from the Tongue and
 18 Yellowstone River Irrigation District point out actually
 19 that in the west, they believe that ranchers and farmers
 20 will suffer from the Federal Government's unitary water
 21 theory because they will now be subject to water that is
 22 not of sufficient quality for their irrigation district
 23 and so forth. 
 24 It's not simply a west -- and the State of
 25 Washington also joined in our brief. We, of course -- we

52
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 don't count States, but more States support the tribe in
 2 their briefs saying this is essential than do support the
 3 -- the district and the United States. 
 4 The -- it's particularly important to recognize
 5 the C-11 was itself dug, is not a residual part of the
 6 Everglades, and that it's -- the C-11 basin is not simply
 7 a -- a water body divided from the WCA or the Everglades
 8 protection area by a levee. Looking at pages 6a and 7a of
 9 our brief, which are the appendix to our brief, are from
 10 the district's own web site, which it cited in its brief,
 11 and it shows the urban construction right to the boundary. 
 12 So it's not that the C-11 basin is water just divided. 
 13 It's an artificial canal. It's no -- no more part of the
 14 Everglades protection area than Fenway Park in Boston is 15 part of the Charles River because it's built on the
 16 landfill where the Charles River once was. They're quite
 17 distinct.
 18 With respect to federalism issues, the Clean
 19 Water Act itself is a federalism instrument because it
 20 provides for the States to do the designation of uses. It
 21 provides for the States to -- to create the water quality
 22 standards, and it does protect the ability of the States
 23 to allocate quantities of water, but this is not a
 24 quantity allocation.
 25 The record shows clearly that the S-9 pump is

53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 turned on when you get to 1 foot of -- turned off when --
 2 when the C-11 basin is at 1 foot and turned on when it's
 3 at 4 foot. It is strictly a drainage mechanism to take
 4 surface water runoff and other water out of the C-11. 
 5 They're disposing of water. They don't want the water. 
 6 They're dumping the water wherever they can put it.
 7 And actually the water is not our concern. It
 8 is the pollutants. Whenever they say merely conveying
 9 water, we would say conveyance is defined as a point
 10 source and they convey pollutants. If they didn't convey
 11 this massive amount of pollutants, we would not be before
 12 Your Honors.
 13 The district, by pumping pollutants contained in
 14 the water against the natural flow of that water into the 15 specially designated Everglades protection area, added
 16 that water to the Everglades protection area within the
 17 plain meaning of -- of the Clean Water Act and within the
 18 common usage of -- of language. The district put those
 19 pollutants in the Everglades and nobody but the district
 20 put those pollutants in the Everglades.
 21 An effort to reconstruct the term, addition to
 22 navigable waters, to allow them to dispose of those
 23 pollutants anywhere in the United States with a navigable
 24 water of any designated use or of any water quality
 25 standard would decimate the Clean Water Act's protection

54
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 not only of the Everglades, but of the case law that --
 2 that Your Honors have had cited in the brief. 
 3 Now, the circuit court cases are not
 4 particularly precedent for your Court, but it does point
 5 out that Loon Pond would have had water that peeled paint
 6 off of the adjoining buildings put into it and not just
 7 through snow-making devices. The -- the court clearly
 8 indicated that sometimes the Pemigewassett water was put
 9 directly to Loon Pond to -- to increase the amount of
 10 water in Loon Pond. 
 11 Now, the -- the United States would try to save
 12 its singular water theory in some cases by saying, well,
 13 water might be removed. They said on the Dubois case, the
 14 First Circuit Loon Pond, that it was removed for snow15 making, but I point out that the court said in several
 16 places that it also went directly, never through snow-
 17 making devices. 
 18 They would say that when you put it through
 19 tunnels or so forth, perhaps it loses its navigable water
 20 character. The State of New York, of course, is strongly
 21 in favor of the tribe because the 18-mile Shandaken Tunnel
 22 to them needs --
