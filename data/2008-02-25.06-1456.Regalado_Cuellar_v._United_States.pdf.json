    "speech": "We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-1456, Cuellar versus United States. Mr. Beard."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1956, the money laundering statute, requires an intent to minimize the criminal taint of unlawful proceeds. But the statute does not criminalize concealing money's existence. In this case, Mr. Cuellar's conviction should be reversed for two reasons. First, while the method of the transportation involved may have been designed to conceal, the transportation itself was not. Secondly, while Cuellar may have in fact concealed money itself, he did not conceal the nature, source, location, ownership or control of the unlawful proceeds."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, he certainly concealed the location. They were secreted in the car, under the goat hair and everything else. The location of the money was certainly concealed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "Chief Justice, in the broader sense location was concealed. The point to be taken here I think is this: An examination of the text itself reveals particular listed attributes, and location numbers among them. But what this suggests, the requirement that there be a design to conceal or to disguise these particular attributes, necessarily means a plan, if you will, for those -- excuse me -- for those attributes to be presented either to law enforcement if they intercept the money or inject it into legitimate commerce later. In other words, they'll be observed later. Location has independent meaning, but it's also understood within the context of the words that surround it. All money changes location, whether concealed or not. Location in this context means more than the location that the money was found in the car."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Maybe I should ask you this now because you've probably thought about it and I can't work it out. I don't see any problem with the word \"location.\" I thought what you would say is it isn't the transportation in this instance that concealed the location, it's the method of transportation that sealed the location."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "And if you read it that literally, then there is no problem in getting to your interpretation of the statute, or is there? Because since you didn't advance that argument, I thought maybe there's something I've not seen here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "No, Justice Breyer; you're correct. There is a huge difference between the method of transportation and the transportation itself. And in this particular case, the difference is certainly implicated. What we understand the government to be arguing is that the method of the transportation signifies the listed attributes. But if that were the case it would effectively render all transportation of funds necessarily to be money laundering."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "May I just ask, what do you mean by method of transportation in this case? I mean, that it was in a car or the fact it was wrapped up in dirty --in a dirty kind of container, and so forth and so on?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "Justice Stevens, what I'm referring to is certainly that it was in a car, but there was a secret compartment, goat hair was sprinkled around to try to throw off drug detection dogs, and those type of characteristics."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "But isn't that all just evidence that there was a motive to conceal the ownership?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "No, I don't think so, Justice Stevens. What we're looking at here is that the design of the -- the fact Mr. Cuellar may or may not have known, for example, who owned -- where the money was coming from or who owned it, that doesn't go to the design of the transportation. The design of the transportation itself is just to get the money to Mexico. I can say that abstractly, but in this case in particular because we know from the government's evidence that what this was was essentially the last leg of a drug trafficking deal. We know that this was repayment. So in this particular case at least, the purpose of this transportation was to get this money back as repayment money."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "Yes, you're correct that it would require inference as opposed to direct evidence. This is why in our reply brief, we gave an example of where the identical type behavior arose, not in Texas but in Alabama, and in fact the individual pleaded guilty to bulk cash smuggling. So I suppose my response would be this. The same weak inferences that supported the money laundering conviction in the government's eyes would be the same inferences that would support the cash smuggling."
  },

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "If we take it that you concede -- I don't want to say that you concede. If we take it the government has a strong case under the smuggling statute, wouldn't it have an equally strong case under (i) of the statute that we're considering here, which doesn't require concealing or disguising the nature, just to avoid a transportation reporting requirement. That's the same as the smuggling statute."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "You mean as the proceeds of an illegal transaction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "Well, I'm distinguishing between currency and transaction because as I understand it at least transaction might implicate in a banking context, but cash is cash, if you will. So --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "And it doesn't matter for purposes of the bulk cash statute that it was illegal. It could be perfectly lawful money."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, absolutely. That's certainly true."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "But why -- why isn't this transporting to conceal the location or the ownership in this sense? Suppose you have someone the police suspect of engaging in drug activities. They know he sold, you know, so much marijuana or whatever and got cash back. They think it's there, and they're going to investigate it, but this fellow comes in and they transport the proceeds across the border. Isn't that transportation to conceal the location or the ownership?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "As I understand it, Mr. Chief Justice, if the police are aware of it and then the flush, if you will, takes the money across, I think that's -- that's much closer. That's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, they think it's there, but they're not sure, and they -- you know, that would help them make their case, to find out that the guy they think sold the drugs has $80,000. So they get a search warrant or whatever, and it turns out he doesn't, because it's been transported to conceal the location or ownership."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "I would -- no, I think that the -- if the police were aware, if the police were aware and the kingpin were aware and put in place some type of design, if you will, to flush the money and perhaps to -- to Mexico under the circumstances you described, then you would be closer to, to having money laundering liability, although certainly I don't know that the courier necessarily would. However, I think it's very important to consider that the money laundering statute necessarily contemplates this notion of -- of detection or the money resurfacing, if you will. And the reason I think that's important is because it gives a particular meaning to those listed attributes. If the police were just -- well, in this case, just stumbled upon it, and nothing was -- had been done and there was no evidence on the record to suggest that there was going to be anything done in this case other than repayment, money laundering liability is simply not going to arise. Now, I think that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "I still don't see why isn't what the Chief Justice said absolutely right? If you are transporting this money to get it out of town so the police can't find it, you're transporting it to conceal it. That falls right within the statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "If you're transporting it simply to pay some courier somewhere else, you're not transporting it to conceal it. And if in fact the transportation is done in a way that conceals it, that's beside the point because the statute is interested in transporting it in order to conceal it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "I think that --"

  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "What is wrong with that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "I think what's wrong, Your Honor, is that the -- the statute focuses on the transportation or some of the other transfers of transmission and specifically is coupled, if you will, with this notion of -- of the attributes themselves. I don't know that it's -- it's simply too broad, in fact, to say that all transportation's will necessarily incur the money laundering liability."

  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "That -- you're correct, Your Honor, and that is, I think, a point to be made. The -- Judge Smith below did try to highlight the fact that if you transport to conceal, then you're beginning to implicate money laundering liability."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Suppose someone transports money across a border and is recorded surreptitiously on tape explaining exactly why the person did it, and the person says: The reason why I'm transporting this across the border is because I know that when I get it to the destination country, that's a place where people use huge amounts of cash for bank deposits, for purchases; and, therefore the act of transporting it from the United States to the other country will disguise the nature of the cash as drug money. Would that fall within the statute?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "No, I don't think so, Justice Alito, and the reason I don't is because that -- what you've described implicates potential money spending, this notion that the money is easier spent. But without more, money spending would not equate to money laundering. That's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Why wouldn't that fit the literal language of the statute? It's a transportation across the board with the design to conceal the nature, i.e., that it's drug money, of this money?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "I'm not sure, Justice, that you've actually concealed the nature. If the money was going -- if the money was dirty and going across dirty, it remained dirty and just happened to be spent. But --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "Yes, but it doesn't remain dirty simply because it goes to a place in which the appearance of this kind of cash does not have the dirty appearance that it does at home. Why -- why isn't that the correct answer?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "Why doesn't that make it laundering?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "No, but the design to conceal -- maybe I misunderstood the hypo, but I thought the design to conceal was you conceal the dirty character of the money by taking it to a place and using it in that place where use of large amounts of cash, whether for bank deposits or spending in luxury stores, does not have the dirty implication, the dirty appearance that it does in the United States. So, why doesn't that therefore satisfy the concealment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "I -- Justice Souter, I think that the answer to the question is here. The statute is designed to take -- or purposed to take these dirty proceeds, unlawful proceeds, and to cleanse them so as to prevent their injection into streams of legitimate commerce. What you've described as spending is admittedly spending, but I don't think that the spending that's -- that you've contemplated there basically implicates the core concern, if you will. The money --"

    "speech": "No, and, of course, we are well aware that those words are not found in the statute, nor do we suggest that they were. But what we have suggested is simply that that's, if you will, shorthand for describing what necessarily occurs if the attributes, the listed attributes, are obfuscated. That is the cleansing mechanism."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, why would that be so? Suppose -- I mean, just take --modify my hypothetical. What this person says on the tape is: I'm sending this money across the border because I know that if it -- once it gets there, it will be harder to establish my ownership of it. People will still know that it's drug money perhaps, but they -- it will be harder to establish my ownership of it. Now, would that fall within the statute?"

    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "Well, at that point, yes, because I think --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "Well, to the extent that the individual who has been taped is contemplating the money's resurfacing, I think that there would be. It would be not legitimate wealth, though. And perhaps I need to drive this point home. It would be less dirty. In other words, there's not a requirement that the dirty money necessarily be made clean or a description, but that the dirty money be made less dirty. And that I think is -- is what we're talking about."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Does the statutory purpose have to be the only purpose or the principal purpose? I mean, I could conceive that the principal purpose of this transportation was to give the money back to the fellow who gave the drugs, to pay the provider of the drugs. I assume that would be the principal purpose. But what if you know that when the -- when the provider of the drugs is paid, he'll be able to spend this cash easily in Mexico, which has a cash economy? And let's assume that the latter is enough to satisfy the purpose requirement of this statute. What -- what would be the result?"

    "speaker": "BEARD",

If you just had location by itself, I'd be making the same argument; but there's a huge difference between hiding money or hiding the location."

If you just hide the money, that would encompass just hiding money, for example, in the back yard of your house with -- with -- or in a tin can or under a mattress or whatever. It's a much broader -- broader concept. And I think that that's really what is at play here because, to the extent that the government is focusing on the method or -- of the concealment here, they're -- they're implicating that type of behavior, if you will, and saying it's sufficient to support a money laundering conviction."

Petitioner's construction of the statute is not supported by its tests and would defeat its purpose. What the statute does require is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knows that he has illegal proceeds and that he knows that the transportation across the border of those known illegal proceeds is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise one, at least one, of the facts in the statute about those proceeds. The phrase \"designed in whole or in part\" directs a full examination of the plan, of the way in which the cross-border transportation of these known illegal proceeds was planned out."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Does the word \"transportation\" mean the act of transportation across the border or the method of transportation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "The word \"transportation\" itself means the carrying of something from one place to another. The phrase \"designed in whole or in part,\" suggests that one should look at the entire plan, the way that this transportation was conceived or planned out in the mind, which would include, we would submit, the method that was -- that was chosen to be used for this transportation, the individual who was designated to conduct this transportation of known illegal proceeds across the United States border, and, yes, reasons for conducting that transportation as well. But it is not limited, as Petitioner would suggest, to just one fact, that being what's going to happen to the funds after the transportation is over."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "You go back to Justice Alito's question. I agree with you that you could read this as including a prohibition against a method of transportation which method is to hide the money. You could. But you could also read it the way that the question suggests, to refer only to the transportation. So you transport it physically in order later to hide it. Now, the difference between the two is if we accept yours, which is the broader, this statute includes everything that has nothing to do with the common word \"money laundering.\" Any time you hide something, for whatever reason you hide it, to take it to pay the couriers, you're money laundering. Any time you run a gambling operation and the people stick the money in the wad of their shoe, they're money laundering. I mean, why would you think Congress would want that narrow reading when it can be read to focus much more closely on money laundering just by reading it literally for what it says?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, several responses to that, to that question. First of all, what's the purpose -- if we want to look beyond the words \"designed in whole or in part\" in the context of the international money laundering statute to try to discern what the purpose was of the statute, the purpose of this statute was to prevent criminals from taking their proceeds abroad where they would be outside the reach of all of these controls that have been set up in the United States in order to detect illegal proceeds and use those proceeds to trace back to the crimes and the criminals that generated them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "But if that's all they were getting at, they wouldn't have to have this international component at all, because if you totally eliminated the \"to or through\" requirement and you were able to focus or properly focus solely on the method of the transportation, et cetera, then you would cover not only cases in which the concealment ultimately would take place by crossing a border, but you would pick up cases in which the concealment would take place even within the United States; and that would certainly be in the government's interest. But if you add, if you say, well, but this is limited by a to or through requirement, then it suggests, it seems to me, as Justice Breyer's question does, that it must -- the statute must be getting at what happens when it crosses the border as opposed to the means of crossing. What's your answer to that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "My answer to that, Your Honor, is that that would have -- that would defeat the purpose for which this statute was enacted. The -- the premise of this statute was that once illegal proceeds are taken abroad, taken outside of the United States system, we lose control of them, we lose the ability to find them, and we will have no idea --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "But that would be -- that would be equally true and an equally appropriate objective without the \"to or through\" requirement in there. In other words, you don't have to have the \"to or through\" requirement in order to give the government a tool for exactly the purpose that you describe."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "And there -- there could have been drafted a statute that was even broader than this one in that respect. But the way -- the reason that Congress imposed the \"to or through\" requirement is that it knew -- is that that was when law enforcement in the United States would lose the ability to use ordinary investigative methods to find the proceeds of illegal fraud."

It saw money laundering as the variety of ways in which criminals prevent the detection of their illegal proceeds and thus are able to profit from their crimes. It covered a wide range of conduct that included converting, yes, illegitimate wealth into legitimate forms through very complex means. But Congress was also concerned about criminals taking their proceeds across the border surreptitiously --"

We don't even know if he knows who put the money in the car. We don't know if he knows the -- who the person is that he's to deliver the money to. So on your theory, all you have to prove is that this defendant drove a car in which illicit money was hidden in order to get it out of the country. No grand design. All he is is a courier."

One can think of the kingpin having this elaborate plan, and when it gets to Mexico it's going to go into this bank and that place. But here the defendant is simply a courier, and on the government's theory anyone who transports hidden money to get it out of the country, who drives the car, just the driver, is a money launderer."

    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",

And in response to Justice Ginsburg's question, Congress also -- well, in the sentencing guidelines system now, the guidelines takes account of whether you have the individual who is also engaged in the underlying offense or whether you have a third party who had not been involved in the underlying offense. But no -- no matter how you see it, this was precisely the conduct that Congress is getting at. It saw that the only way to -- to get at crime -- one way that was very important to it was to get at the money and in order to get at the money you need to be able to counteract the ways in which the criminals would prevent law enforcement from getting at the money."

I think even if one were to hypothesize that there would be no effort whatsoever to conceal the money at the point of destination, but a jury could find that the transportation itself was designed in other respects -- in its method, in its means -- to conceal or disguise an attribute of the proceeds, that would be enough to find that it was designed in whole or in part, in any part --"

    "speech": "If the method of transportation were exactly the same, it would make no difference, Your Honor. In this case, this -- this transportation method was designed, a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt, to conceal or disguise the ownership and control of the proceeds through the third party, and if that were the case and they were going to Mexico it would be the same. The nature and the location of the proceeds through the use of this secret compartment and the goat hair to discuss the scent of the proceeds from the drug detection dog."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So, what if the fellow says: You know, there are dangerous roads between here and Mexico. I'm hiding the money so that if, you know, a gang comes up they don't find it. And you say: No, we think you're hiding it because it's illegal proceeds? Is that enough to get to the jury?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. It's -- that is enough. Concealing to transport when the jury -- when it is part of the design of the transportation to conceal the location, nature, source, ownership, or control, any single one of those things. And all of those are in here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Why do you make distinctions between methods of concealment? And if the design is to get the money out of the country, why should it matter whether you put it in a travel bag, you put it in the glove compartment, you put it in your wallet, or you go through this elaborate disguise that we see here? What -- if what's important is getting it beyond the border beyond the reach of law enforcement in the United States, why should it make a difference how carefully it is concealed?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "That need not make a difference if there is evidence before the jury, if there is evidence that the ultimate design of the transportation is to conceal or disguise the proceeds at the point of destination."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, then your only defense is to go across the border and before you go across you put all the money in your arms so the people can see it? That's the way you do it? (Laughter.)"

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Other than that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "In that situation, there would no basis to find concealment or disguise of location. Now, some of the other attributes may be at issue if a third party is conducting that transportation, but location from the method alone. So the jury would need information about, well, what is the design, what is the purpose of this cross-border transportation? They could still find that the necessary design to conceal or disguise is satisfied by evidence that the whole purpose here is to get it to Mexico where it will be turned into legitimate wealth, for instance."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "It covers both, Your Honor. It asks broadly what was this -- how was this transportation designed and planned out in whole or in part? In any part, was it designed to conceal or disguise? And that would encompass all of the stages that we are -- that we are discussing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "The bulk cash -- well, the bulk -- in this case, there's no evidence in this record that a bulk cash smuggling statute charge would have been viable because there's no evidence in this record that this defendant knew of a currency reporting requirement and intended to evade it. Petitioner's argument that the bulk cash smuggling statute shows that the conduct here was not intended to be covered by the money laundering statute is incorrect for the very reason that Justice Kennedy has identified. The bulk cash smuggling statute could not have filled a gap in the money laundering statute for the conduct here because it has always contained a provision that covers the transportation of known illegal proceeds across the border to evade a -- reporting requirements."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "There's no principle that all criminal statutes have to cover every -- every bad act. Maybe Congress has left a gap. I'm willing to entertain the possibility that this individual, obviously doing something very bad, doesn't -- falls between the two stools. He is neither guilty under the taking currency out of the country statute because he didn't know of the existence of the statute, and he's not guilty under one because he was not transporting to conceal but was concealing to transport. And so there's a gap. The Justice Department can certainly get that gap filled readily enough. I don't know why we should torture either one of the statutes to close it."

As Senator Biden said in questioning -- and he became one of the co-sponsors -- questioning a witness about this: Isn't it the truth that if we -- if we strengthen all our domestic controls against money laundering, aren't the criminals going to resort to physically transporting their cash out of the United States?

It would have made no sense for Congress, having understood that when money leaves the United States we have little if any ability to know what happens to it, to require in the statute proof beyond a reasonable doubt of what would happen to the money once it --"

But to take Petitioner's position that it would be necessary evidence in every case in which to prevail under this statute to know of future plans to launder abroad, when the premise of this statute is that when the money leaves the country we cannot know what happens to it, makes no sense."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "What if --- if that's what they're concerned about, taking the money out of the country, why do they have the concealment requirement? They could have just said, you know, if you take dirty money out of the country you're guilty."
  },

    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "They --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "They didn't say that. They have a concealment -- I can't understand why, if the money is hidden during the transportation, it's any worse than when the money is not hidden during the transportation. It isn't -- it isn't the hiding during the transportation they're concerned about. The statute doesn't make any sense that way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "I think that it does, Your Honor. The Court -- the Congress certainly could have written it in the broad way that you've suggested. It's not unlike the way that they wrote section 1957, which covers broadly all transactions in illegal money. They chose to not cover everything and to cover cross-border transportation's where there's evidence of some intent on the part of that individual to conceal or disguise. And when you think about it, they had set up regulatory provisions like the transaction reporting requirement when there's no conceal or disguise. There were other controls in place as, say, the first line of defense against money laundering to say, $10,000 or more is leaving the country, we're going to know about it because we have reporting requirements. Here the Senate report says that they made the decision to require evidence of concealment. \"Evidence of concealment of a crime\" is what the report says. And any time one of these attributes of illegal proceeds is being concealed or disguised, that is concealing a crime in a way that impairs law enforcement from finding those proceeds."

    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "I don't think so, Your Honor, and I would -- I would go back to the evidence that Justice Alito has pointed out that is in this record, that there's evidence in this record that -- that the -- by taking the funds to Mexico, they would be able to be used in a way that would not raise suspicion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "Well, there's also, consistent with the evidence, they want to pay the drug dealer for the drugs. And then a jury -- you can't say it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt that that was not what it was going on."

    "speaker": "SCHERTLER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, there was -- there was evidence in this case that the proceeds were removed -- this is expert testimony -- removed from the United States to conceal so as not to go through reporting requirements, so that the money would not be identified to U.S. law enforcement. We believe the jury could also infer that further efforts to conceal and disguise those proceeds would occur at the point of destination. Thank you, Your Honor."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BEARD",
    "speech": "Happily I've been thinking about it. Disruption versus detection I had told you, told the Court that this was not a detection statute as much as it is a disruption statute. I think it is important for the Court to recall that the very broad interpretations that the government advances today are essentially the very broad interpretations that the Congress rejected explicitly 20 years ago. The Congress rejected the notion that the transportation of illicit funds in and of itself created money laundering liability. And we've discussed that. I think it's important, Justice Scalia, in particular, in response to your question to bring this up, because the Congress recognized that detection would be harder in rejecting that type of legislation, but rejected that they did. The Congress has also shown itself capable of -- of -- in the 1957 context of taking transactions involving unlawful proceeds and making those per se illegal. They could have easily done the same thing in the transportation context if they had wanted to, but instead they were looking at the separate behavior that comprises money laundering. I mean, it is the notion that you're taking money somewhere else and you're doing something else and it gives rise to separate liability. I think the true harm in the government's interpretation, it basically conflates liability for money laundering with the underlying offense, because all of the underlying offenses involve concealment."
