3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 141280, Heffernan v. City of

5 Paterson, New Jersey.

6             Mr. Frost.

7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK FROST

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MR. FROST:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11             Public employees have a right not to be

12 demoted on patronage grounds.  It does not matter if you

13 are affiliated with a specific party or that you are

14 nonaffiliated.  It does not matter if you are mistakenly

15 perceived by your employer or supervisor that you're

16 engaged in political association to be protected by the

17 First Amendment.

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How would you define the

19 right at issue in this case?

20             MR. FROST:  The  the issue here is 

21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How would you define the

22 right that your client wishes this Court to vindicate?

23             MR. FROST:  I'm defining the right in that

24 pursuant to Elrod and its progeny, that there  it is

25 not necessary to have any affirmative acts, that by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
4 1 virtue of being a public employee, he has the right not 2 to engage in political association. 3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's just a 4 restatement of  of Elrod.  I  I  would  would  5 would it be fair to the proposition that you are putting 6 before the Court to say that you're asserting the right 7 to be free from government inquiry into an oversight of 8 your views?  Would that be a fair statement? 9             MR. FROST:  That would be a fair statement, 10 Justice Kennedy. 11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because  look, do we  12 it sounds to me from the way you began your argument 13 that we take this case on the assumption that, if he had 14 picked up the sign, that if he had been supporting the 15 candidate for chief of police who was challenging the 16 incumbent, if he had been engaged in the activity, that 17 would be protected.  He could not have been demoted. 18 If  you want us to take the case on that  do we have 19 to accept that proposition for you to prevail in this 20 case? 21             MR. FROST:  No, you do not have to accept 22 that proposition.  Proposition is just clearly that, as 23 a public employee, he has a right to either associate or 24 nonassociate, and he doesn't have to commit an 25 affirmative act in support, in this case, of the mayor's

1 opponent, which was Chief Spagnola.

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but the  the

3 First Amendment talks about abridging freedom of speech,

4 and I thought the case came to us on the proposition

5 that he wasn't engaging in speech at all.  That he was

6 not engaging in association, he was not engaging in

7 trying to convey a message, he was just picking up a

8 sign for his mother.  And if that's the basis on which

9 the case comes to us, I'm not sure how he can say his

10 freedom of speech has been abridged.

11             MR. FROST:  In this case, Mr. Chief Justice,

12 the case comes to us with respect to association.  With

13 respect to speech, speech is governed by a different

14 doctrine than association.  There is no need to do a

15 Pickering analysis in this case.

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  He wasn't associating with

17 anybody any more  any more than he was speaking.  He

18 was doing neither one.

19             MR. FROST:  Justice Scalia 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  He was associate 

21 associating with his mother, I suppose, in picking up

22 the sign for her.  But he was not expressing any

23 political view.  He was not associating with a political

24 party.

25             What case of ours vindicates the right

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 that  that Justice Kennedy described to you and which 2 you readily agreed with?  What  what case of ours 3 vindicates that  4             MR. FROST:  Elrod would stand for that 5 proposition. 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Elrod  7             MR. FROST:  Elrod  8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Elrod says you have a First 9 Amendment right to favor a political party or not favor 10 a political party, and you cannot be fired for doing so. 11 That's not what happened here. 12             MR. FROST:  But he was not favoring a 13 political party. 14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.  He was not 15 expressing any First Amendment view whatever.  I mean, 16 he was fired for the wrong reason, but there's no 17 constitutional right not to be fired for the wrong 18 reason.  If he was fired because his  his  his  19 his government employer thought he had committed a 20 felony and he hadn't, he might  he might have a cause 21 of action under some statute.  But there  there  22 there's no constitutional right not to be fired for the 23 wrong reason, and that's what happened here. 24             MR. FROST:  There's a constitutional right, 25 Justice Scalia, to be able to be free from patronage

Official
7 1 decisions and to be discharged or demoted on patronage 2 grounds.  And in Elrod  3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where do we say that?  We 4 never said that.  Elrod and  and Branti are  are 5 cases decided under the First Amendment.  The First 6 Amendment guarantees the right to freedom of speech and 7 freedom of association.  Your client was neither 8 speaking nor associating.  So how could he possibly have 9 a cause of action under the First Amendment? 10             MR. FROST:  He doesn't need to speak, and he 11 doesn't need to take a position.  The Rutan plaintiffs, 12 they didn't take a position with respect to promotion or 13 transfers.  They took  the fact of the matter is, 14 is  is that since they were not affiliated with the 15 Republican party or supporting the Republican party or 16 endorsed by the Republican party, none of those 17 individuals would have been promoted or transferred. 18 They didn't take any affirmative acts. 19             JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't understand  I 20 don't understand your answer.  What  what expressive 21 activity did he engage in?  He wasn't  he was not 22 allegedly demoted for failing to support the mayor.  He 23 was allegedly demoted for seemingly supporting the 24 mayor's opponent. 25             MR. FROST:  In  in Waters this Court
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 looked at the motive of the employer, the motive of

8

2 government.  If government perceives that you are

3 engaging in a political activity and the motive is to

4 suppress one's beliefs and associations or

5 nonassociations, then you look at it through

6 government's analysis, and it's their basis of their

7 facts that you are evaluating.

8             Here they evaluated the facts that he was

9 engaged in campaigning.

10             Officer Heffernan went to a political

11 gathering.  He went and picked up a sign.  What was

12 misperceived by his employer was the fact of his intent.

13 He said that, I'm not intending to support Spagnola, but

14 he is doing all those incidents that are core First

15 Amendment activities.

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let me just 

17 to clarify what I  how I thought the case was

18 presented.  Let's say the employer comes in to Smith and

19 says, you know, Smith, I saw you getting a  a  a

20 political sign, and you're  and you're  you're

21 fired.

22             And Smith says, it wasn't me.  I was off,

23 you know, in a different town then.

24             In other words, it's a pure mistake of fact.

25             Your answers, it seems to me, you try to get

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 advantage of the fact that there  you could perhaps

9

2 have argued this was expressive activity.  Say, oh, he

3 was at a meeting, a political event.  He was getting a

4 sign.  But your theory, I thought, didn't depend on that

5 at all.

6             MR. FROST:  It  it 

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It was simply a

8 mistake of fact.

9             And then  now, can the person who wasn't

10 even there, can he bring a First Amendment challenge to

11 his dismissal?

12             MR. FROST:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.

14             MR. FROST:  And the point that I was

15 making 

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then again  but it's

17 still not clear to me:  What is the right that he's

18 asserting?

19             And  and I'll back up while you're

20 thinking about that.

21             Is  can a local government say that all

22 our employees must be neutral in campaigns and must not

23 take part in campaigns?

24             MR. FROST:  Well 

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They can vote, but they

1 can't take part in campaigns?  Like the Hatch Act?

10

2             MR. FROST:  Well, there are Hatch Acts.

3 There was no provision here.

4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can the government insist

5 on neutrality?

6             MR. FROST:  I think the government can have

7 a policy after balancing the interests between that of

8 the employer and that of the position.

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that an issue 

10             MR. FROST:  I was not saying 

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that an issue  is

12 that an issue in this case?  Is there any allegation

13 that there was such a policy of neutrality that no

14 employee could engage in political activity?

15             MR. FROST:  Okay.  Justice Ginsburg, there

16 was no such policy in this case involving 

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I thought

18 there was an unwritten policy.

19             MR. FROST:  There  there was a policy that

20 Chief Wittig said that existed with respect to members

21 of his staff only.  However, with respect to that

22 policy, there's no testimony regarding that policy.  In

23 other words, the people that worked in the Chief's

24 office  there were four individuals who were

25 officers  none of them ever heard of that policy.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 Also, that policy was never raised below in any of the 2 motions for summary judgment or the motion before the 3 Third Circuit twice.  So we believe that that motion is 4 waived. 5             But to answer your question, Your Honor, is 6 the fact that no one knew of this policy.  So  so he 7 could say he had a policy and he could make reference to 8 it, but it's just not supported by any evidence in this 9 case. 10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there a remedy 11 for your client, apart from this action under the First 12 Amendment?  Does he have civil service protections of 13 any kind or  or  I don't know  collective 14 bargaining? 15             MR. FROST:  Your Honor  16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's just say: 17 What would happen if the boss comes in and says, you 18 know, for the  you didn't turn off the lights last 19 night.  You're fired. 20             Can he  is there a way for him to say, I 21 was on leave yesterday.  It wasn't me. 22             MR. FROST:  Well, that's not a 23 constitutional violation for  24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  My point is 25 that maybe this shouldn't be a constitutional violation

12 1 if there are adequate remedies to address what may or 2 may not be a First Amendment issue. 3             MR. FROST:  Mr. Chief Justice, there are  4 there were no other remedies. 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 6             MR. FROST:  There is a  State of 7 New Jersey has a State Civil Rights Act which mimics 8 1983.  Just because there is a  such a right, doesn't 9 mean that you can diminish the First Amendment and give 10 up your First Amendment rights.  So clearly, we 11 proceeded with the fact that there was a violation of 12 the First Amendment just because it was created by the 13 State.  There is no civil service  14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What  what is the New 15 Jersey Act?  That's a strange act.  It protects State 16 employment only against First Amendment violations? 17             MR. FROST:  No, it  it mimics  18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I can't imagine that.  It 19 must  it must have other protections for State 20 employee  employees. 21             MR. FROST:  With respect to the New Jersey 22 statute, it's just identical to a 1983 cause of action, 23 so it doesn't give you any additional rights. 24 Officer Heffernan  25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  How does it read?  You have
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 to violate the Federal constitution to get relief under 2 New Jersey law? 3             MR. FROST:  Do you have to? 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah.  That's what 1983 5 says. 6             What is  what does New Jersey law say? 7             MR. FROST:  He proceeded in Federal court. 8 He has every right to proceed in Federal court for a 9 First Amendment violation. 10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does the New Jersey 11 law say?  You brought it up.  I didn't bring it up. 12 What does it say? 13             MR. FROST:  New Jersey law, the statute just 14 mimics a 1983 cause of action. 15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it says  it says if 16 you violate  you can't fire a State employee in 17 violation of the Federal constitution.  That's what the 18 New Jersey law says.  What a strange law. 19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You don't have the text 20 of it, do you? 21             MR. FROST:  I'm sorry. 22             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The text of the 23 New Jersey law, so we can know what we're talking about. 24             MR. FROST:  Sure.  I mean, this was  25 New Jersey law can't create substantive rights.  So with
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 respect to this matter, he's also not protected by civil 2 service, either. 3             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Goldstein's brief 4 says New Jersey law provides a statutory right of action 5 for an attempt to violate an individual's civil rights. 6             Is he wrong? 7             MR. FROST:  An attempt to violate? 8             JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah. 9             MR. FROST:  It  it is included in there, 10 but  but that doesn't give you an exclusive right. 11 You can't diminish his First Amendment rights. 12             JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  The question is not 13 whether the New Jersey law somehow abrogates First 14 Amendment rights.  The question is whether he has a  15 an independent remedy under State law.  That's the 16 question, I think, that's being asked. 17             MR. FROST:  He could have a remedy under 18 State law.  But it  in this instance, he pursued it, 19 his First Amendment rights. 20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How could he?  If we say 21 there's no First Amendment right, what civil right has 22 he  was violated if  if what Mr. Goldstein says is 23 the  24             MR. FROST:  The civil right  25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   is the state of the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 law attempting to violate civil rights?  What right, if 2 we say there isn't the First Amendment? 3             MR. FROST:  The right not to associate. 4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, if we say it 5 doesn't exist.  You lose this case. 6             MR. FROST:  If what doesn't exist, 7 Justice Sotomayor? 8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just that, the right 9 you're claiming. 10             MR. FROST:  He has every right to bring this 11 claim in Federal court as  12             JUSTICE ALITO:  He may have broader 13 substantive rights under New Jersey law.  I would be 14 somewhat surprised if that were not the case.  The civil 15 rights to which this  the New Jersey statute refers 16 may refer to rights under the New Jersey constitution or 17 other New Jersey laws. 18             MR. FROST:  There are New Jersey laws. 19 But  but just because  again, it doesn't abrogate 20 your First Amendment rights.  So the fact  it 21 shouldn't matter whether or not he  22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just  23             MR. FROST:   engaged  there could have 24 been a violation of any type of New Jersey statute.  It 25 wasn't alleged in this case.  It was never brought up by
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Respondents in this case during  during any of the

16

2 arguments in any of the briefs.

3             And  and therefore, with respect to this

4 matter, it's our position that he has every right to

5 maintain this litigation with respect to violation of

6 his First Amendment right.  And here, he is alleging

7 that he has the right not to associate.  And that right

8 really stems from the fact that we have  that this

9 Court has considered in Elrod and its progeny.

10             Furthermore, the Third Circuit makes its

11 mistake in requiring Heffernan to actually engage in

12 some type of political activity, campaigning.  That's

13 not necessary, as I've indicated, with respect to Elrod

14 and the Rutan plaintiffs.

15             Additionally, the Third Circuit's decision

16 in this case is actually  lacks common sense.  I mean,

17 if you take a hypothetical with two police officers

18 going to pick up a sign, and when they go to pick up the

19 sign they're at a campaign gathering, and one police

20 officer states to his employer, yeah, I was supporting

21 Spagnola, and Mr. Heffernan would say, no, I'm  I'm

22 not supporting it.  I'm doing this to pick up a sign for

23 my mother, should make no difference.

24             The outcome is still the same in the sense

25 that they're both engaged in that activity.  The only

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 difference is, is that the employer perceived

17

2 Mr. Heffernan as engaging in protected activity.  They

3 went to stifle and squash his rights of association or

4 nonassociation.  Their motive was to suppress that.  And

5 clearly, that has a chilling effect on other employees.

6             I mean, it's just very clear from the

7 testimony in this case.  And if you go to the Appendix,

8 page 50, what is very telling about this case is the

9 fact that when he went to pick up the sign, there was a

10 councilman there who was a chairperson of the election.

11 And he says to Heffernan, says, boy, you better be

12 careful.  Maybe you should come back later while

13 we're  because we're hanging up these signs.  And that

14 clearly shows the chilling effect that it would have not

15 only in this police department or in the City of

16 Paterson, but other employees in different jurisdictions

17 and different areas would have the same issues.  You

18 would have to think twice before you did something.

19             If you went to a political gathering or a

20 campaign, or you went to hear a speaker speak and you

21 picked up a pamphlet and put it on your desk, the  if

22 your employer saw that and they didn't like that

23 candidate and they took action against you, you would

24 see that that is action based on a motive to suppress

25 one's rights.

18 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  All of those things would 2 be true if the mayor gave a speech saying I am going to 3 fire anybody who's not a Republican.  All of those 4 things would be true.  Would it chill people  blah 5 blah blah  would there be a cause of action?  Would 6 anybody have a cause of action because of that speech? 7             MR. FROST:  Because of the speech itself? 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah, just the speech.  He 9 hasn't fired anybody.  He's just said I am going to fire 10 anybody who's not a Republican, or anybody who's not a 11 Republican will not get promoted. 12             MR.

So  so part  you have the 17 perception that they engaged in an activity. 18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.  So  so what 19 counts is whether action was taken for a particular 20 reason, not whether you chilled  whether you chilled 21 people, which you're arguing to us is this is 22 unconstitutional because it chills other people. 23 That  that doesn't  that just doesn't carry water. 24             MR. FROST:  Justice Scalia, what carries 25 water is the fact that in this instance, Heffernan was

FROST:  Yes.  Because they perceived it 8 that he was exercising his rights, and the fact that he 9 actually was not engaged in any political activity 10 should make no difference with respect to the motivation 11 outcome of what took place with Mr. Heffernan.  The 12 issue was clearly that it was ill will.  It was because 13 it was against the administration, and they took that 14 action to suppress that belief, and it chills other. 15             Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the 16 remaining time  17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You may. 18             MR.

Alderson Reporting Company

1             I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's

20

2 question about how we define the right here.

3             We think that Petitioner has a First

4 Amendment right not to have adverse action taken against

5 him by his employer for the unconstitutional purpose of

6 suppressing disfavored political beliefs.  He was

7 directly injured 

8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what's your best case

9 for that proposition?

10             MS. ANDERS:  Well, we think that there are

11  there are two aspects of this  this Court's case

12 law I think that support that, and then I'd like to get

13 back to your concern about probing of beliefs.  But we

14 think that the way that the Court defined the right at

15 issue in Branti and Rutan, and again in O'Hare,

16 demonstrates that an employee doesn't have to

17 affirmatively exercise his First Amendment rights first.

18             So in those courts  in  in those cases

19 the court said that the plaintiff can show a

20 constitutional violation of the First Amendment simply

21 by showing that the employer acted for the

22 unconstitutional purpose of suppressing disfavored

23 political 

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And those cases,

25 Ms. Anders  I missed what you said those cases were.

ANDERS:  No. 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that your point? 9             MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think actually in the 10 Rutan case there were  there were three plaintiffs, 11 and it wasn't clear, actually, whether they had engaged 12 in any affirmative exercise of their First Amendment  13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was it clear that they 14 hadn't? 15             MS. ANDERS:  So what the court said was that 16 they had  17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was it clear that they 18 hadn't? 19             MS. ANDERS:  It was not clear whether they 20 had or hadn't, and the court didn't inquire into that. 21 So what had happened there was that the  the 22 plaintiffs had been  had adverse action taken against 23 them because they had lacked the support of the correct 24 Republican party officials.  That's all the court says 25 about their allegations.

22 1             There are any number of reasons they could 2 have lacked that support.  They could have affirmatively 3 refused, obviously, to seek the support, which would be 4 an exercise of First Amendment rights.  But on the other 5 hand, they may simply have not had the time to seek the 6 right support, or they may have been ignorant of the 7 requirement in the first place.  Those wouldn't have 8 involved an affirmative exercise. 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah.  I thought in all of 10 these cases up to now, whenever anybody's fired, 11 demoted, or even not promoted, it hurts and  and you 12 want to bring a lawsuit sometimes.  Up to now, those 13 lawsuits would have to show I was asserting a First 14 Amendment right, and it's for that reason that I was not 15 promoted. 16             But what you're saying is, you don't have to 17 show that at all.  All you have to assert is that the 18 reason I was not promoted was that the  the employer 19 believed that I was thus and so or not thus and so.  You 20 don't have to show any assertion of a First Amendment 21 right.  You just show that the  the employer liked 22 Republicans, and that's enough. 23             MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think in the employment 24 context, I think there's no question that the plaintiff 25 was directly injured by the unconstitutional condition.

1 But to respond directly to your point, I think  I

23

2 don't think there's a serious concern here that there

3 will be a meritless  a flood of meritless lawsuits or

4 anything like that, and that's primarily for two

5 reasons.

6             I take your point that  that, you know,

7 this will expand the universe of  of litigation

8 somewhat, but we already know in the statutory context,

9 the courts have recognized suits based on a mistaken

10 perception, and  and in that context we haven't seen

11 any flood of meritless lawsuits.

12             And with respect to Elrod claims

13 specifically, I think it's always been fairly easy for

14 plaintiffs to allege that a particular affiliation of

15 belief, I was in the Republican party 

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you know we

17 haven't seen a flood of meritless lawsuits in that

18 context?

19             MS. ANDERS:  Well, we  we haven't in the

20 statutory context.

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, the one that

22 you were just referring to.

23             MS. ANDERS:  Well, we looked at this, it 

24 it doesn't come up very much.  And when it does, it 

25 it looks to us that  that courts have been able to use

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the standard technique to 

24

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're looking at

3 the reported decisions rather than  you haven't done

4 any survey to see how many complaints have been filed in

5  in this type of case?

6             MS. ANDERS:  No.  But when you looked to

7 reported decisions, what you see is that courts are able

8 to use Twombly and Iqbal and summary judgment in order

9 to get rid of claims where the allegations aren't

10 plausible or there's no evidence.

11             But I also think if the plaintiffs are going

12 to have to allege that  that they actually held the

13 beliefs in question, this is going to raise exactly the

14 concern that Justice Kennedy mentioned earlier about

15 oversight of beliefs, probing into beliefs.  So this

16 will affect all Elrod cases.  So every time an Elrod

17 case is brought, the defendant will have the incentive

18 to say 

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So are you saying there's

20 a right to be secure from government oversight of your

21 beliefs?

22             MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think the Court

23 recognized in O'Hare that that is a particular concern

24 in the affiliation context.  We  we don't want courts

25 to have to  to examine the nature and extent of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 plaintiff's beliefs or associations.

25

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, that's a good idea,

3 maybe.  And maybe  maybe it should be in some civil

4 service act, but where do you find it in the First

5 Amendment?

6             MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think the right  the

7 right in question is the right not to be subject to a

8 test of political affiliation 

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is  is that because

10 you're concerned with a chill, or is there some other

11 right that is  is somehow affected that's a First

12 Amendment right of the individual?

13             You turn around and you say the government

14 cannot act for an unconstitutional purpose, but we

15 usually ask how is the defendant hurt?  What is his

16 right?  That's still a little unclear to me.

17             MS. ANDERS:   We think the defendant has

18 been hurt in the constitutional sense because the way

19 that the court has defined the right in question is the

20 right not to be subject to a test of political

21 affiliation when it's not a reasonable job requirement.

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know why 

23             MS. ANDERS:  And I do think what the Court

24 said in 

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Please.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1             MS. ANDERS:  What the Court said in O'Hare, 2 essentially, was that  we're not necessarily talking 3 about a separate right not to be subject to probing of 4 beliefs, but I think the Court was suggesting that we 5 shouldn't have First Amendment tests, if we can help it, 6 that lead the Court to have to probe into a plaintiff's 7 beliefs.  And that is exactly what will happen. 8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know why the 9 right isn't the right to be free from arbitrary 10 employment action based on a mistake.  That's his 11 objection here.  You made a mistake; you thought I was, 12 you know, being politically active.  I wasn't. 13             I mean, isn't  is there such a right under 14 New Jersey law, you can't be fired for an arbitrary 15 reason, or you can't be fired for a mistaken reason? 16             MS. ANDERS:  I think with, at least with 17 respect to some job actions, there  there would be 18 such a right under New Jersey law, and that's  I'm not 19 sure whether it would apply here, but I think the 20 gravamen of  of plaintiff's complaint here is not that 21 he was fired for an inaccurate reason; it's that he was 22  he was demoted because  for an improper purpose, 23 the perception that he was engaging in protected First 24 Amendment activity.  And  25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You've brought up in your
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 brief, I think, that  that the employer might have had 2 a contracttype policy.  I think you said we should 3 remand to determine whether this employer said nobody 4 engages in political activity. 5             MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think  I think if you 6 rule for the Petitioner here, there would be a remand 7 anyway because the Court hasn't  8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it based on the facts 9 up till now to think that there was such a policy? 10             MS. ANDERS:  Well, so there  there is, I 11 think, a factual dispute about this.  So if you look at 12 the  the summary judgment filings, this is document 13 No. 189 on Pacer, there  there are, in  in the 14 Respondents' statement of undisputed facts, some 15 assertions that this was in fact a neutrality policy. 16             Now you definitely have a dispute about that 17 coming back from the other side.  Petitioner says that 18 nobody knew about that policy.  So we think that is one 19 thing that potentially the lower courts would have to 20 look at, decide whether it was preserved and  and 21 resolve the dispute in that sense. 22             But I do want to get back to another concern 23 that I think Respondents' position raises.  You know, we 24 do think that  that Petitioner has his own First 25 Amendment right here.  That was violated.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             We do think that when an employer acts

28

2 against an employee based on a mistaken perception of

3 his beliefs, that creates exactly the same chilling

4 effect with which the Elrod cases are concerned.

5             So the other employees will know that the

6 employer expects political orthodoxy and will be chilled

7 in their  in their own association as a result.

8             And I think there's another concern here

9 that deepens the chilling effect, and that is that the

10 logic of Respondents' position applies not only in cases

11 of honest mistake, it also applies in cases in which the

12 employer acts to exploit a loophole, essentially.

13             You can imagine a situation in which the

14 employer knows that some people have engaged in

15 political affiliation.  The employer wants to send a

16 message, and it does that by acting against the employee

17 it thinks didn't actually engage in that association.

18 And so I think that is one of the dangers of

19 Respondents' rule here, that it will create a loophole.

20             And so what we are saying, essentially, is

21 that it's just a narrow corollary to the Elrod right

22 that the Court has already recognized.  When the

23 employer acts with the exact same intent that  that is

24 already impermissible under Elrod, and it injures the

25 employee in his employment as a result, then the

It shouldn't get a 2 free pass simply because it  it's illmotivated and 3 wrong. 4             If there are no further questions. 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 6             Mr. Goldstein. 7           ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C.

GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 10 it please the Court: 11             The doctrinal fight in the briefing is over 12 whether the plaintiff in a case like this has to assert 13 a constitutional right.  And I think the questions so 14 far have indicated an understanding that the plaintiff 15 would have to.  And the real question, then, is, is 16 there actually a constitutional right here, one that we 17 might define in other terms, including the one that 18 Justice Kennedy identified as the right not to have your 19 political views inquired in. 20             And this is actually discussed in the 21 Court's opinion in O'Hare in describing Elrod and 22 Branti.  And so I want to start there because we have to 23 recognize that this right has never been recognized in 24 any other political association case whatsoever.

One of them is 6 a big supporter of Spagnola, and he gets demoted.  And 7 the other is politically neutral, and he gets demoted 8 because the employer thinks he's a supporter of the 9 rival mayoral candidate. 10             What  how could you make sense to a person 11 of ordinary reason that one of them, the one who was in 12 fact engaging in political activity, can't be demoted 13 but the other one, who just was innocent, didn't do 14 anything? 15             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I'm sorry. 16             I have to focus on, really, the precise 17 wording of your hypothetical, but I think you may 18 actually have something slightly different in mind, 19 because you identify this, the second employee, one who 20 is politically neutral.  And the Court has said, in 21 cases like Elrod and Branti, that the decision to remain 22 neutral  that is, I see this candidate, I see that 23 candidate.  I'm going to just not choose between them, 24 because I  you know, for any individual reason, that 25 that's protected.  That's a political choice.  And in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 your precise hypothetical, both of those employees would 2 have a claim. 3             This case is different, and critically 4 different.  The other side has quite consciously, 5 throughout the case, made only two arguments.  The first 6 is that he was a supporter of Spagnola.  And he's given 7 up on that. 8             And the second is that he had no association 9 whatsoever.  He didn't have any more association than I 10 did.  He was politically oblivious. 11             And so, Justice Ginsburg, if you were to ask 12 me that question, which is what difference  what  13 what sense does it make?  The sense that it makes is one 14 is exercising a constitutional right, and one doesn't  15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So just to make sure I 16 understand what you're saying, suppose there's somebody 17 who comes into office, and it's a Democrat.  And he says 18 I want as many Democrats as possible in my office, no 19 matter what jobs they're doing. 20             Now, what you're saying is he can't demote 21 or fire Republicans.  He can't remove, demote, or fire 22 people who have other political views, neither Democrat 23 or Republican.  But what he can do is he can get rid of 24 anybody who is just politically apathetic. 25             Is that your view?
Alderson Reporting Company

1             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  If that was actually the

32

2 policy, then technically, the answer to your question is

3 yes under the First Amendment.  And I'd like to explain

4 why.  I know it sounds anomalous.

5             The reason is that those people  there is

6 nothing in the First Amendment that says that the

7 government can't encourage people to be politically

8 active.  And that is entirely the point of Elrod and

9 Branti.

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you  you encourage

11 the person to be politically active and then fire him or

12 her because they're politically active the wrong way?

13             (Laughter.)

14             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, sir.

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the employee says,

17 like fiction.  I  I don't  I don't know if I'm

18 Republican or Democrat.  I don't care.

21 fired?  What is his right?

22             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  My point, Justice Kennedy,

23 is that he may have a State law right; he does have a

24 collective bargaining agreement right, but he doesn't

25 have a First Amendment right, because he's not engaging

8 government has a right to compel him to declare one way

9 or the other?

10             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No  Justice Kennedy, and

11 that  that brings us back to your question.  And that

12 is does he have a right not to have an inquiry into his

13 political views.  And that is, of course, not a right

14 that's been recognized in any other political

15 association context.

16             When the Court discussed it in O'Hare, it

17 did it in a very specific and really important way, and

18 that is it looked at cases like Elrod and Branti, which

19 are general policies.  And what the Court has said

20 there, is that when it's a sweeping policy, it's not

21 necessary into  to inquire into individual political

22 beliefs.

23             And what those cases ought to be understood

24 as is applications of First Amendment overbreadth

25 doctrine.

1             It is commonplace in First Amendment law

34

2 that if you have a general rule, and the general rule

3 will be unconstitutional as applied to some people, and

4 the other people involved weren't asserting First

5 Amendment rights, the policy can be facially

6 unconstitutional, and we don't inquire into the

7 individual standing of the plaintiff.

8             And that's what happens in Elrod and Branti.

9 It's not necessary to inquire into the  each

10 individual employee.  It is an entirely different 

11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  See, I had always thought

12 that the  the idea behind those cases is a different

13 one.  That the idea has to do with why the government

14 acted.  And once we say that the government acted for an

15 impermissible purpose, which is to  let's say in my

16 hypothetical, get as many Democrats as possible into the

17 government, once we say that's an impermissible purpose,

18 it matters not at all whether the person is a

19 Republican, an  an independent, or somebody who has

20 never thought about politics in his life, because the

21 government is acting in a way that's wrongful,

22 irrespective of that.

23             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And we just disagree.  It's

24 called an individual right, not a government wrong.  The

25 individual has to be engaging in  whether it's

35 1 expression or association, I actually thinks it's not 2 contested, Justice Kagan, any more on the free speech 3 side, that with cases like Waters, an employee cannot 4 bring a First Amendment free speech claim that says, you 5 know, I didn't actually engage in speech, but my 6 employer thought I did.  There is no First Amendment 7 right not to have this individual inquiry. 8             And Justice Kennedy, remember that our 9 position, in particular  10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So does that mean that the 11 government can compel speech of a person if the person 12 really just doesn't care one way or the other? 13             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.  It's a very important 14 distinction.  So let me give a hypothetical that ought 15 to be hard for us, and that is Heffernan is asked by the 16 chief of police, you know, do you support the mayor. 17 He's completely agnostic, and he refuses to support the 18 mayor, and he's transferred. 19             The decision not to support or to be 20 subjected to your hypothetical is a political choice. 21             This case was framed by the plaintiff in a 22 very specific way on purpose, and that is he disclaimed 23 any such influence, any such pressure, any such choice 24 that he was having to make. 25             Now, the important piece about  on this
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 question of inquiry is that our position only applies to 2 a party that doesn't claim anything other than being 3 politically apathetic.  So Justice Kennedy, there is no 4 inquiry. 5             Justice Kagan is quite right that if you 6 have somebody who is an Independent or a Democrat or 7 Republican, the First Amendment doesn't care.  But if 8 the plaintiff is going to pursue a claim that says I'm 9 not engaged in association or speech, there is nothing 10 to inquire into  11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Goldstein, let's take 12 a Title VII case, and the employer fires a woman because 13 he thinks she's pregnant.  She brings a sex 14 discrimination case and alleges, well, I wasn't 15 pregnant.  I just was gaining weight. 16             So she has no sex discrimination claim, 17 then, because she wasn't pregnant? 18             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, the courts 19 are divided.  The position of the EEOC is that she would 20 have a claim.  I just think it's a good point for us 21 that Congress can write laws that recognize such, 22 regarded as claims. 23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Those  those statutes 24 focus on the employer.  The employer cannot discriminate 25 on the basis

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:   of sex.

3             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that employer was doing

5 that.

6             The First Amendment does not focus on the

7 government; it focuses on the citizen.  The citizen has

8 a right to free speech and free association.

9             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So 

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the difference

11 between the two cases.

12             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, it will not surprise

13 you that I agree, Justice Scalia.

14             The  Justice Kagan, if  if we could just

15 take this outside the public employment context.  And

16 the reason I want to do that is that we ought to be able

17 to agree that the First Amendment rights aren't

18 greater association of rights there.  The Court has

19 pointed out that there is a greater Federalism interest

20 in managing the public employment workforce, and also

21 that this is an unconstitutional conditions case.

22             But just imagine the following simple  you

23 know, hypotheticals that relate just to this case.

24 Imagine that the chief of police, with the same

25 motivation, went up to Heffernan as he went to pick up

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
38 1 the sign, grabbed the sign, and tore it up.  Or imagine 2 that Heffernan was trying  was stopped from entering a 3 parade in favor of Spagnola, but what he was actually 4 trying to do was just cross the street.  Or he went to 5 the building where it is that Spagnola had the  his 6 headquarters, and the chief of police stopped him from 7 going in, but he was actually going to his lawyer's 8 office. 9             Those are all the exact same motivation. 10 And there  I don't think there's any way the Court 11 would recognize such a claim. 12             It's a very sympathetic claim.  Okay?  I get 13 the fact that we are very concerned that public 14 employees not be transferred or demoted, but we have 15 other laws and other regimes that are  that fill that 16 gap. 17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is  what is 18 the other law here?  What  what relief does he have? 19             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  He has two forms of relief. 20             The first is the collective bargaining 21 agreement.  I will tell you that it is not in the 22 record, but it is judicially noticeable.  It is a public 23 document.  It's available on the government Web sites of 24 the State of New Jersey, and it is exactly what you 25 would expect.  In fact, it's a little bit broader.  It
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 says that if you are  you have an employment action 2 that is inequitable, it is  you  it is grievable. 3             The second thing is the attempt provision, 4 which was discussed, and Justice Alito is right, that 5 there are broader civil rights under New Jersey law. 6             And this just makes sense.  The Court, in 7 cases  8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, do  do you 9 agree that the Petitioner is entitled to relief under 10 that provision of the collective bargaining agreement? 11             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  If  if he  his 12 allegations of the facts are correct, yes. 13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In your hypothetical about 14 stopping the person from crossing the street, or, they 15 think, entering the parade, the individual is  has no 16 right to insist that the government doesn't make a First 17 Amendment judgment about his activities? 18             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's correct. 19             Justice Kennedy  20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In  in other words, 21 the  the  the individual in the  in  in  in  22 the citizen of the United States, have no right, have  23 have  have no  have no injury, have no interest in 24 making sure the government doesn't evaluate everything 25 they do from a political standpoint?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I think they have an

40

2 interest, Justice Kennedy.  I'm not saying that.  We are

3 concerned that people be able to have conscience, that

4 they be able to make their own personal, private

5 judgments.  But what we're talking about here in the

6 context in which there is a real concern that I would

7 like to talk about, about whether it will interfere with

8 the management of local government, that it's an

9 affirmative constitutional right, it's a violation of

10 the First Amendment.

11             Now the reason you ought to be concerned,

12 Justice Kennedy, is there is another side of the coin.

13 Take it from the perspective of the supervisor.  If this

14 right is recognized, which is to say the plaintiff need

15 not have engaged in any association, then the

16 supervisor's expression of political views may well be

17 chilled because he has to worry that any employee can

18 say, look, I was regarded as politically active.

19             If I could just give you this case again,

20 and that is, take the sign out of it.

21             The plaintiff says he was well known as a

22 Spagnola friend and supporter.  Okay?  Imagine that

23 that's discussed in the chief of police's office, but

24 the chief of police thinks that  that Heffernan really

25 should be transferred.  Okay?  The chief  if the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 Petitioner is right, he really has to worry because if 2 it's discussed, then there's every reason that Heffernan 3 can just bring a lawsuit saying, look, I wasn't actually 4 involved in the campaign, but you did it because he was 5 my friend.  And that is a very significant consequence 6 for the individual rights. 7             Now, if we didn't have other protections 8 that get to the concern about conscience, I could see 9 the case being even stronger. 10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We know that you can't  11 let's assume in this particular position you can't be 12 fired because you're a Republican or a Democrat and 13 that's what they  that's what  what they do.  But 14 that  the person did not engage in that activity. 15 He's still  he still is in the position of the 16 government ascribing to him a political belief that he 17 does not have. 18             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kennedy, that's 19 right.  The government thinks a lot of things about me, 20 okay?  Some of them are not very nice, I imagine, but  21 and some are about my politics and that sort of thing. 22 But there is not a constitutional right to have the 23 government not think something about you.  Just remember 24 as well  25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Here, they thought and

2             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Or to act,

3 Justice Kennedy.

4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's not just something.

5             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Oh.

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's  the government is

7 taking action against a person because the government

8 thinks that that person is exercising First Amendment

9 rights.

10             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Just 

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I thought  and

12 unlike Justice Scalia  that the thrust of the First

13 Amendment is operating on government.  It says

14 government, thou shalt not  thou shalt not act on the

15 basis of someone's expression, speech or belief.

16             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, essentially all of the

17 rights, individual rights in the Constitution, other

18 than the antislavery provision, requires State action.

19 They all talk about what the government can't do.  But

20 the government 

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, so here, the

22 government acted.  No question they demoted the person.

23 This was a detective, and they put him back on the beat.

24 So the government acted.  Why did they act?  Because

25 they thought that this person was engaging in political

Alderson Reporting Company

1 activity.

Official

43

2             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, let

3 me just say that I don't think it's  it's contested

4 after the Petitioner's reply brief.  You described this

5 in First Amendment terms, that if this was a speech

6 case, which it used to be, rather than an association

7 case, he would lose.  It is well settled in this Court's

8 precedents that the threshold inquiry under Pickering is

9 did the individual engage in the constitutionally

10 protected activity?

11             This actually is at issue, I should say, in

12 the Court's other associational case, public employment

13 association case, this sitting, where there is a

14 significant issue of is there a different rule that

15 applies  when we're talking about a policy, Justice

16 Kennedy  that applies broadly to a lot of employees

17 versus an individual, oneoff employment action which is

18 what is at issue here?

19             We think that's a critically important

20 distinction, whether you look at this as kind of a

21 Pickering standard case, where the first thing that has

22 to happen is that the individual has to assert at least

23 that they engaged in the constitutionally protected

24 activity.  If you have an Elrod and Brantitype case,

25 which is what's discussed in that part of O'Hare, it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 an entirely different kettle of fish because there, you 2 do have a general policy.  You could see people being 3 chilled.  You could see the government taking a broad 4 view of its employees. 5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm not sure how 6 that works.  It just seems to break down very easily, if 7 you can't have a broad rule that says that you can fire 8 everybody but Democrats.  But you're saying that you are 9 going to allow somebody to come in and fire people one 10 at a time. 11             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kagan, that's, of 12 course, not what I'm saying.  What I'm saying is that 13 under First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine, when you 14 have a general policy  and this is what we think 15 happened in Elrod and Branti  the fact that you 16 don't  you do not inquire into the individual person's 17 political views because the policy is facially 18 unconstitutional.  But it has never been the case in any 19 context. 20             And the other side has had every opportunity 21 in the world.  We cannot find any First Amendment case 22 that says, you know what?  You don't have to engage in 23 constitutionally protected activity so long as the 24 government thinks you did.  And it's really a problem if 25 that's the rule because it is the threshold thing that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 stops plaintiffs with meritless cases from getting out 2 of the box.  In all of these cases, if the plaintiff no 3 longer has to say, I engaged in  4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you're saying  and  5 and I think you said this straight out  you're saying 6 I can come into an office  I'm a Democrat.  I can  I 7 can identify every person without a wellknown political 8 view, every couch potato out there, just fire one after 9 another, after another, after another.  Replace them all 10 with Democrats, change the entire character of the 11 office, do it for a reason that I prefer one political 12 view to any other, and that that will not be a violation 13 of the First Amendment. 14             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That will  two things. 15 First, I think it is practically impossible because you 16 would have to somehow magically pluck out the people who 17 are politically apathetic from those that are 18 politically neutral.  I just don't think you can do it. 19             But the second is that's right.  The 20 Constitution doesn't fix everything. 21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You want this Court to 22 hold that the government of the United States has a 23 right to ascribe to a citizen views that he or she does 24 not hold. 25             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kennedy, I think
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 that that is not a First Amendment violation.  I don't 2 think the other side thinks it's a First Amendment 3 violation.  Remember that there's the materiality 4 requirement. 5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  See, I had always thought 6 that the First Amendment running through all our cases 7 is an extremely strong strand.  That part of the reason 8 we have these protections is because we worry that 9 government is doing things for impermissible reasons. 10 That the government wants to create a world of speech in 11 which everybody agrees with it and nobody opposes it. 12             And that's a fundamental tenet of what the 13 First Amendment and all our cases are about.  And you're 14 saying, oh, no.  The government's motive doesn't really 15 matter as long as you can't point to somebody who is 16 holding up a sign. 17             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kagan, I think you 18 are right.  It is an important thread of this Court's 19 decisions.  And the Court has said that it is a 20 necessary but not sufficient condition.  Waters makes 21 very clear, which is a First Amendment public employee 22 case, that the individual has to have engaged in the 23 constitutionally protected activity.  Every one of  24 Garcetti says the same thing.  You have to have an 25 individual

3 Congress pass a law or a legislature pass a law that

4 attempts to abridge the freedom of speech.  Is that a

5 violation of the First Amendment?  It's an attempt.

6             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  What would the attempt 

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, let's say there

8 doesn't have to be a thousand examples.

9             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The Court 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  You say that's the law.  No

11 one can espouse in a public place the political

12 philosophy of Ruritanianism, okay?

13             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.

14             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I mean, I doubt that

15 they'll pass such a law 

16             (Laughter.)

17             JUSTICE BREYER:   but I just  substitute

18 any one that you want for that.  They pass it.  And by

19 the way, the six people who hold that philosophy all

20 leave on a boat before the effective date, but  or

21 what's more likely, they bring a declaratory judgment

22 action, and the law never takes effect.  And therefore,

23 it had no impact.  And that happens every day of the

24 week.  I'm just wondering if such a law, which is an

25 attempt  it's right on the books as blatant as you

5 that we allow

7 is it yes or no?  Does it  in your opinion, does it

8 attempt to  a clear attempt to violate the First

9 Amendment in a statute?  It has general application.

10 Does it violate the First Amendment?  Does it abridge

11 the freedom of speech?

12             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  If it's only going to be an

13 attempt and it's not going to succeed, no.  The statute

14 you describe is unconstitutional.

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  It is unconstitutional.

19 effects.  It will have all kinds of chilling effects all

20 over the place.

22 Breyer, as not going to succeed, if the statute doesn't

The  in  in the one 7 that you just described, Justice Breyer, if it is the 8 case that the law is going to go into effect, we do 9 allow, including under First Amendment overbreadth 10 grounds, an effort to bring a declaratory judgment 11 action. 12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course.  And I'm just 13 asking you if, in fact, they think it will succeed, they 14 want it to succeed, that's why they passed it, and 15 through a fluke it fails, does the fact that it fails 16 mean that it doesn't violate, it doesn't  does it not 17  does it or does it not violate the First Amendment? 18             MR.

21 we don't care whether someone is a Republican or not in

22 Elrod and Branti and those cases  and you say it's

23 only because it's a policy.  The intent of the

And there doesn't need to be 19 an inquiry.  But the  20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't it simple 21 to say, I'm not hiring you, or, I'm demoting you because 22 you politically associated?

2 there is a concern that comes into play.  And so I do

3 not mean to demean the concern about the government

4 having a sense of what individuals' political views are.

5             But I'm saying that that happens, Your

6 Honors, in all kinds of cases, whether it's

7 redistricting, whether it's campaign finance.  There's

8 lots that we do to ascribe political views to people in

9 this country.  And adopting that doctrine is going to

10 have pretty widespread consequences when it's not

11 necessary.

12             I do think that it should be common ground

13 that there are multiple layers of protections for these

14 employees.  The basic rule  and Justice Kennedy,

15 remember, under the basic rule, the plaintiff has always

16 come in and said, I'm a Democrat, right?  The Elrod

17 Branti rule when it's involved, oneoff cases.  The

18 opinion in O'Hare describes the political views of the

19 tow truck company there.  And it has never been regarded

20 as a First Amendment problem when you don't actually

21 exercise any First Amendment rights.

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  But that is a First

23 Amendment problem for the reason that lots of other

24 people will have their speech chilled.  And normally in

25 the law there is a doctrine where the person who does

GOLDSTEIN:  Well  8             JUSTICE BREYER:  That is to say I would 9 think that a statute that has a chilling effect on the 10 speech of millions of people but is directly aimed at A, 11 B, and C, if because of some fluke A, B, and C are not 12 themselves injured, nonetheless everybody else is, and 13 it would violent the First Amendment. 14             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Under  15             JUSTICE BREYER:  That, I think, is what you 16 have here, which is why I raised my point. 17             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Great.  Justice Breyer  18 and if you would just contrast in your own mind the 19 statute that affects millions of people versus the beat 20 cop who talks to one person in terms of its chilling 21 effect, because First Amendment overbreadth doctrine was 22 born because of your hypothetical. 23             The concern that a broad policy or statute 24 will have widespread effects.  That is not anything like 25 this.  We have a guide

55 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you know of any case in 2 which we have relied on chilling effects where what was 3 at issue was a oneoff like this one as opposed to a  4 a general policy which had a chilling effect?  I don't 5 know of any case. 6             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  To the contrary, I can tell 7 you that in  in both Waters and Garcetti v. Ceballos, 8 the Court said, look, we recognize the rule that's being 9 proposed to us.  So in Waters it was the idea that the 10 public  the employer's views wouldn't matter; it would 11 just be whether the speech was protected. 12             In Garcetti it was the question of whether 13 it was the public employer's speech.  And the public 14 employee's argument in both those cases is that, look, 15 these rules are going to chill speech because they are 16 of uncertain boundaries.  We need to have wideranging 17 expression.  If I have to bring my case, there will be 18 inquiries into my speech views or whatever, and the 19 Court said we just have to balance things here. 20             There is a real concern that is rooted in a 21 history of the United States involving political 22 patronage.  We have  the Court has never tried to 23 extinguish politics from local government.  And if you 24 try to do that in New Jersey, we are going to be here a 25 lot.

2             (Laughter.)

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  And the question in this

4 case seems to me to be highly artificial.  It's sort of

5  it's like a law school hypothetical.

6             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I agree.

7             JUSTICE ALITO:  How often will it be the

8 case that an employee will be unable to allege any

9 expression or any association that is protected by

10 the  the First Amendment?  It seems to me quite rare.

11             And it may be that this case comes to us the

12 way it does because the plaintiff was dealing with two

13 things, one was the First Amendment, and the other  I

14 mean one was the issue that's  the question of his

15 motivation, and the other was this alleged policy

16 prohibiting any kind of political activity.

17             Even in the  the person who is just

18 apathetic, is there not a  a First Amendment right to

19 be  say, I don't  I don't like politics, I don't

20 want anything to do with politics, I'm not going to

21 register, I'm not going to vote?

22             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  All right.  So Justice

23 Alito, the Third Circuit has a rule discussed in the

24 brief  brief in opposition adopted in a case called

25 Ghaly that says you do have the right to be politically

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
57 1 apathetic.  The reason the case is so bizarre is that 2 the other side, for its own reasons, decided not to 3 assert that right. 4             Now, I will say that it does nonetheless 5 matter because there are going to be other kinds of 6 cases where you have a public employee that just is not 7 asserting any rights at all, and is not involved, say, 8 in environmentalism or gun rights or whatever.  And the 9 public employer, if it's thought just to have perceived 10 the employee as having been involved in some 11 association, then is subject to a claim. 12             And our real  13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You have 14 to  you have to show some facts to draw that 15 inference. 16             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well  17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, you just can't 18 say, I'm involved in this and the employer fired me 19 because of that. 20             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Sotomayor  21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  To show some connection 22 between the firing and  23             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   the political belief. 25             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I would just take you back

58 1 to my hypothetical of getting rid of the sign.  And his 2 political view  his support of Spagnola is discussed 3 in  in the chief's office, right?  And then he has to 4 be reassigned.  And the chief has to really worry that 5 he's going to be sued. 6             The  my point is this:  The set of cases 7 that you have to be concerned with, there have been no 8 other cases we've been able to identify like this one. 9 It's very small. 10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well  11             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  But the downside risk is 12 significant. 13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Goldstein, I mean, if 14 somebody had come in to me before today's argument and 15 just said, does the First Amendment prevent the 16 government from punishing a person because that person 17 does not share the government's views, I would have 18 said, why, yes, of course the First Amendment protects 19 that.  That's the whole point of the First Amendment. 20             And now you're telling me, no, the First 21 Amendment does not prevent the government from punishing 22 a person because that person doesn't share the 23 government's views, unless that person is actively 24 opposed to the government's views. 25             But if that person just really could not
Alderson Reporting Company

59 1 care less, which a lot of people in this country could 2 not care less; they don't vote, they don't pay 3 attention, they wouldn't know who was running.  But the 4 government can punish that person because that person 5 doesn't share the government's views.  And I would have 6 said, that is one strange doctrine. 7             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It  it may be that I have 8 not persuaded you in this case. 9             (Laughter.) 10             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The  the  I will say, 11 Justice Kagan, what you ask is, can the government do 12 it?  The government cannot because there are lots of 13 other protections.  And remember, if the person is 14 politically neutral, it is the case that  the right of 15 political association is the right of political 16 association.  If you aren't engaging it, you aren't 17 actively pursuing the right in any way, or even if you 18 aren't active about it. 19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 20             Mr. Frost, you have a minute left. 21              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK FROST 22                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 23             MR.

1             If Heffernan was engaged in political

2 activity and said, I'm supporting Spagnola, of course he

3 would be protected by the First Amendment.  What I'm

4 hearing is that if he said, I'm neutral, he would be

5 covered; he would be protected.  I see little difference

6 between being a neutral and being agnostic in the sense

7 that I'm not taking a position.

8             So  so 

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  I'm so totally

10 confused.  I know it's the way it was presented to us,

11 but I thought he testified that he had made a choice not

12 to get involved in the campaign but that Spagnola was

13 his friend and he supported him.  So he wasn't neutral;

14 he just wasn't engaging in associational conduct by

15 choice.  That's what I thought.

16             MR. FROST:  That's correct, Justice

17 Sotomayor.  And the point that I was trying to make was

18 the fact that in this case he was not going to be

19 exercising his right to vote or campaign for him, but 

20 but clearly he engaged in what we would consider core

21 First Amendment activity by picking up that sign.

22             The mistake that the employer made was

23 actually one that they perceived him as actually

24 campaigning on behalf of Spagnola.  And that should make

25 no difference for the simple reason that with respect to
