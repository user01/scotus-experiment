3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 next in Case 14510, Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin

5 v. the United States.

6             Mr. Strommer.

7           ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY D. STROMMER

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MR. STROMMER:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it

10 please the Court:

11             The facts in this case are very complex, but

12 the legal question that is presented to you today is

13 relatively straightforward to state.  And the legal

14 question is whether or not an individual or an entity

15 that reasonably relies on classaction tolling can, if

16 tolling is found to be ineffective at a later date, then

17 rely on the same facts to argue that equitable tolling

18 under Holland should apply.

19             In the Irwin case, this Court specifically

20 crossreferenced American Pipe as an example of a

21 defective pleading that could satisfy equitable tolling.

22 American Pipe obviously being a classaction tolling

23 rule.

24             We read that crossreference as a suggestion

25 that, under the right circumstances, if somebody

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 reasonably relies on classaction tolling facts that

4

2 ultimately prove to be ineffective, that that individual

3 has the ability to ask the Court to find that equitable

4 tolling should apply.

5             If there is such a case, the facts of this

6 case really should satisfy this test.

7             The test is set forth in the Holland case.

8 Due diligence and extraordinary circumstances are the

9 two prongs that have to be satisfied.  Both of them are

10 wellsatisfied in this case.

11             First, the Menominee Tribe relied on a

12 preexisting class action which dealt with almost

13 identical substantive claims against the United States.

14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you talking about the

15 Ramah?

16             MR. STROMMER:  Yes.  Correct, Justice

17 Ginsburg.

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And  and that was a 

19 a decision, unpublished decision by a district court.

20 It never went any further.

21             MR. STROMMER:  Well, it is still a certified

22 class, Justice Ginsburg, and the Menominee Tribe not

23 only is a member of that class but has, to date,

24 received a portion of several settlements that were

25 entered into in that class action and, in fact, is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1 poised to receive another large payment in a settlement 2 that the class and the United States  3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The issue  4             MR. STROMMER:   has asked the Court to 5 approve. 6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The issue that that case 7 settled or addressed was whether exhaustion was required 8 at all.  Minimal research would have shown that every 9 other court at that time who had addressed the issue had 10 required exhaustion. 11             Now, we'll go later to exhaustionwhen. 12 That's a separate question. 13             So how could you reasonably rely on a lower 14 court decision that hasn't gone through the crucible of 15 appellate review without having done any research on 16 whether its premises were subject to dispute, reasonable 17 dispute, and rely on that? 18             MR. STROMMER:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, I 19 have a couple of answers to your question. 20             First of all, the United States did not 21 challenge the certification of the class in the Ramah 22 case.  Not when it was originally certified, based on 23 the claims that were then in the case, miscalculation 24 claims, nor later on with additional claims  25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they raised the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 argument just lost.  They raised the argument that the 2 exhaustion requirement didn't meet the commonality prong 3 of class certification.  So they did make an argument 4 against it. 5             MR. STROMMER:  Oh, they argued, but the 6 district court judge in the Ramah case reasonably, we 7 think, concluded that, because of the unique nature of 8 the claims that the Ramah class was seeking  9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know that's what you 10 believe, but every other court up until that time had 11 said no, you needed to exhaust. 12             Now, we can go to a separate question of 13 exhaustwhen later.  But how could you at that point 14 rely on that case to think that you didn't have to  15             MR. STROMMER:  Well, the Menominee Tribe 16 didn't rely just on that case.  That case was an 17 important factor that it relied on, but there was also 18 other factors that it relied on. 19             In the Cherokee Nation certification 20 process, the United States did not raise presentment as 21 a defense.  Instead, it raised Rule 23 grounds as a 22 basis not to certify the class. 23             And the district court judge in that case, 24 on gardenvariety Rule 23 grounds, ruled that that case 25 could not be certified.  Didn't say anything in his
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 order about presentment, jurisdiction.  Did not talk

7

2 about that whatsoever.  And in fact, in his ruling he

3 specifically said that, if a class had been certified,

4 it would have been easy to identify all of the tribes in

5 the country that would have been members because they

6 were all listed on the shortfall reports that the

7 United States produced at the same time as the years in

8 which the claims were  arose.

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Strommer 

10             MR. STROMMER:  But then 

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:   all of this goes to

12 deciding whether the legal advice they received was

13 reasonable legal advice.  I find that quite irrelevant.

14 Do you have a single case in which legal advice has

15 qualified for equitable tolling?

16             MR. STROMMER:  No, Your Honor.  We can't

17 cite a single case for that, no.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you're really  you're

19 really arguing a  a remarkable proposition, that if

20 you get bad legal advice, that justifies equitable

21 tolling.

22             MR. STROMMER:  Well, that's 

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you mentioned

24 extraordinary circumstances, but our  our cases refer

25 to extraordinary circumstances that stood in the way and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 prevented timely filing.

8

2             I  I would not qualify erroneous legal

3 advice as preventing time  timely filing.  I don't

4 care how reasonable it was.  It didn't prevent it.

5             MR. STROMMER:  Well, Your Honor, in the

6 context of classaction tolling, there is always a legal

7 judgment call made about whether or not classaction

8 tolling applies.  And if equitable tolling is not

9 available as a fallback, if in fact that judgment was

10 not made correctly and discovered many years later, then

11 the whole premise of classaction tolling, I think, is

12 undercut because any member of a class  for example,

13 in the Cherokee Nation case where the district court

14 judge said absolutely nothing about presentment, nothing

15 about jurisdiction, the government didn't raise that

16 defense, focused only on Rule 23 issues  in any case

17 in which a district court judge declines to certify a

18 class, if equitable tolling isn't available as a

19 fallback, then the most you could 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you want us to  to

21 limit our principle of erroneous legal advice justifies

22 erroneous equitable tolling only in classaction cases?

23             MR. STROMMER:  No.  I would frame it

24 slightly differently, Your Honor.  I would say that,

25 when a party reasonably relies on classaction tolling

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that at a later date is found to be ineffective 

9

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you're limiting it to

3 class actions.  You  you don't want to  why  why

4 should it be limited to class actions?  I mean, if 

5             MR. STROMMER:  Because the party still has

6 to show the circumstances.

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:   if erroneous legal

8 justifies equitable tolling, why should it be limited to

9 class actions?

10             MR. STROMMER:  Well, the Holland test still

11 has to be satisfied, Your Honor.  Have to show due

12 diligence.

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

14             MR. STROMMER:  Have to show extraordinary

15 circumstances.  We're not eliminating 

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That prevent  that

17 prevent the test prongs at all.

18             MR. STROMMER:  Right.

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But  but if legal advice

20 prevents tiling  timely filing in classaction

21 situations, I don't know why bad legal advice doesn't

22 prevent tile  timely filing in every other situation

23 as well.  I  I just don't  it  it's sort of a

24 weird  a weird rule.  Just  just for class actions?

25             MR. STROMMER:  Well, Justice Scalia, the

Official
10 1 circumstances in this case are extraordinary and are  2 are very rare.  It is very unlikely that you will find 3 another circumstance where a preexisting class action 4 dealing with the same substantive matter against the 5 same party, the United States, in which a court 6 specifically addressed the presentment issue and ruled 7 in favor of certifying the class is what was  8             JUSTICE ALITO:  What was the length of time 9 between the denial of class certification and  and the 10 presentment?  It was a long time, wasn't it? 11             MR. STROMMER:  The total amount was 707 12 days, Your Honor. 13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So why was that due 14 diligence  I mean, I know that we're not arguing about 15 due diligence, but it seems to me that, when there 16 was  certification was denied in the Cherokee case, 17 you had two years to present and you would have been 18 home free.  You would not have encountered a time bar. 19 Two years.  But you, in fact, didn't present until four 20 years after the denial in the  in the Cherokee case. 21 So how was that due diligence? 22             MR. STROMMER:  Well, in the context of 23 reliance on classaction tolling applying, Your Honor, 24 it is due diligence.  And it's reasonable diligence.  In 25 a class action environment, a party is not encouraged to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 do anything and a party is entitled automatically 

11

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the class action is

3 over.  It's been denied.

4             MR. STROMMER:  I'm sorry, Your Honor?

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The class action has been

6 denied.

7             MR. STROMMER:  Correct.

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So at that point you know

9 you're on your own.  You can't piggyback on the class.

10 You know you're on your own, and yet you let two years

11 go by.  I don't understand that.

12             MR. STROMMER:  Well, Your Honor, under

13 classaction tolling rules, you're entitled to the

14 entire period that the classaction certification was

15 pending.  That's 707 days 

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Actually 

17             MR. STROMMER:   you're automatically

18 allowed.

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   that's not quite

20 true.  There's a circuit split which hasn't been

21 addressed anywhere in the briefing.  Some of the

22 circuits do it the way you say.  They stop the clock and

23 restart the clock at the end of the tolled period.  In

24 those circuits you would win.  You could wait the entire

25 six years plus however long the other case was pending.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             But another series of circuits looked to

12

2 diligence throughout the period.  And so you'd be asking

3 us to make an assumption about which  or make a

4 decision about which tolling applies.

5             You are taking a risk no matter what you

6 did.

7             MR. STROMMER:  All right.  There's certainly

8 in any classaction environment a risk in relying on

9 classaction tolling, particularly, as the facts of this

10 case demonstrate, if ultimately 

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, let's go back to

12 Justice 

13             MR. STROMMER:   reliance is found

14 ineffective because classaction tolling.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   Scalia's question ask

16 you a question.

17             MR. STROMMER:  I'm sorry.

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All of these decisions,

19 were they made with the advice of a lawyer?

20             And I have a sense that the Tribe was

21 concerned about its resources and that they were just

22 getting together and talking about this and deciding,

23 we're not going to win under the law, so we're not going

24 to file.  And it was only when Cherokee Nation was

25 decided by this Court that they realized they had a

Alderson Reporting Company

1 viable claim.

Official

13

2             So  but answer my question:  Was there

3 legal advice sought?

4             MR. STROMMER:  They relied on legal advice

5 provided by class counsel, who communicated with all

6 putative class members, and made it clear that the

7 tolling period would apply during the pendency of the

8 certification.  And they also made 

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we disagree that that

10 was  if we think that was unreasonable, what  your

11 reading of what class counsel said, what would happen?

12             MR. STROMMER:  Well, we still think the

13 backdrop against which the Tribe was making the

14 decision  which is as a member of a class that had

15 been certified where presentment had not been found to

16 be an obstacle because of the unique nature of the

17 claims at issue in the case  should be an important

18 factor that this Court will factor into whether or not

19 equitable tolling should apply.

20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it has not been found by

21 a single district court, right?  I mean, you're saying

22 that that single district court should have had such

23 power in the Tribe's mind that they didn't do the

24 presentment.  And that  that seems an extraordinary

25 thing.  It's just a single district court.  A single

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 district court has no controlling authority over anyone 2 or anything other than that particular decision. 3             MR. STROMMER:  That's true, Your Honor.  And 4 that particular decision had a direct impact on the 5 Menominee Tribe because they were a member of the class. 6 They benefitted from that decision.  They received 7 payments out of settlement that the United States and 8 class counsel had the court approve premised on the 9 court having jurisdiction to be able to approve them. 10 They will benefit shortly next spring from another 11 proposed settlement where the class counsel, as well as 12 the United States, have proposed that the claims that 13 will be signed by parties will serve as the presentment 14 to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement. 15             So yes, they did benefit, and that was not 16 an  17             JUSTICE BREYER:  They benefitted, but the 18 point is there is one court that says your Tribe can be 19 a member.  Your  your Tribe didn't present its claim 20 to the contracting officer. 21             And so why can they be a member?  The judge 22 addresses that question, and he says, normally they 23 couldn't be a member, but they can here because this is 24 the kind of case that is attacking general practices of 25 the administration.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             Then okay.  Fine.  You got that.

15

2             Then shortly after that or maybe a few years

3 after that, another case comes along.  And the other

4 case doesn't involve the situation of attacking the

5 practices generally.  It concerns the individual

6 contracts between the Tribe and the Indian Bureau,

7 what  you know, in the government.

8             And there they say, you can't have a class

9 action.

10             So you'd think  and this kind of case you

11 want to bring now is the second kind, not the first

12 kind.  So you'd say, why is it fair to let you bring

13 this case?  After all, if you'd read the opinion closely

14 in the first one, you wouldn't have thought you should

15 have waited.  If you had any doubts about it, the second

16 one would have told you you should have waited.  And

17 even beyond that, the administrator signs a piece of

18 paper where they ask him:  Do you have any claims under

19 these contracts?  And he says, none.

20             So it doesn't seem to me you're talking

21 about pure equities; you have very strong grounds.

22             Now what's your reply to that?

23             MR. STROMMER:  Well, I  I would not agree

24 with one of your premises.

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  You probably wouldn't agree

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 with any of them.  But  but  but 

16

2             MR. STROMMER:  Not  not your conclusion or

3 one of your premises.

4             But the premise that I disagree with  that

5 I think is very important is that the Cherokee Nation

6 complaint alleged the same kinds of systemwide

7 shortfundings by the United States that were contained

8 in the Ramah complaint.

9             The Ramah complaint initially, when it was

10 certified, only included one category of claims, called

11 "miscalculation claims."  But later on, during the

12 pendency of the Cherokee Nation case, additional claims

13 were added.  And by the time the Cherokee Nation

14 certification decision was issued, the claims were, for

15 all intents and purposes, the same, and they challenged

16 a systemic underfunding and shortfunding by the

17 United States that was based on  we know now from your

18 Court's decision in the Cherokee case as well as the

19 Ramah case  on an incorrect reading of the law.  And

20 they implemented that, systemwide, the policies that

21 the Indian Health Service used to implement this

22 shortfunding system were designed to shortfund tribes

23 because they were designed based off of the assumption

24 that they were not statutorily entitled to 100 percent

25 funding.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1             So the nature of the claims in the Cherokee 2 case, in my view, Your Honor, were the same as both were 3 included in the Ramah complaint initially and then as 4 the complaint was amended over the course of the years 5 by the time the Cherokee Nation cert  6             JUSTICE BREYER:  You're not making that kind 7 of claim here, are you?  I mean, you're not challenging 8 the general practices of the government.  Rather, you're 9 challenging the particular contracts and whether you got 10 enough money under them.  Is that right? 11             MR. STROMMER:  That's correct, Your Honor. 12 We're  13             JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's correct  14             MR. STROMMER:  Well  15             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then the fact that 16 the second case emphasized the general  you know, the 17 general attack, which lacks in your case, is more reason 18 for thinking that we better file our claims quickly 19 because what had  they held in those two cases are not 20 going to help us, who have an individual claim.  We 21 better do what the statute says or the rules, and we 22 better file our presentment to the contracting officer 23 and certainly not write the words "none" when they ask 24 you if you have any claim; am I right? 25             MR. STROMMER:  I would disagree with part of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
18 1 what you're suggesting, Your Honor, which is that the 2 Tribe only had one option, which was to file, 3 essentially, after the Cherokee Nation's certification 4 decision was issued.  In fact, there was nothing in that 5 decision that talked about presentment and jurisdiction. 6 The court ruled on gardenvarietyRule 23 reasons.  And 7 ordinarily, those reasons are not a basis for class 8 action tolling not to apply.  In fact, Crown Cork is 9 almost identical, the same kinds of gardenvarietyRule 10 23 reasons were found in that case to bar the 11 certification of a class, but class action tolling, in 12 fact, applied in that case. 13             So when you focus just on the Cherokee 14 Nation decision itself, I think there's every reasonable 15 reason to be able to rely on class action tolling. 16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But wait.  I just want 17 to clarify one point.  On this issue of  that you were 18 a member of the class, you rely just on counsel's letter 19 in the first case, in Ramah, the letter that  where 20 counsel described the class and said there would be  21             MR.

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no, no, no.  You

3 said that the lawyers had told you that there would be

4 class action tolling.  That was the general 

5             MR. STROMMER:  That's in the second case.

6 That's in the Cherokee Nation case, Your Honor.

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.

8             MR. STROMMER:  And they said that when they

9 filed the complaint.  The complaint clearly included the

10 Tribe.  It identified all tribes that had

11 selfdetermination contracts with the Union Health

12 Services.  The Tribe clearly fell within that

13 definition.  And when the court ultimately ruled and

14 chose not to certify the case, the court said, I could

15 have identified who would have been part of this case,

16 because the government's own shortfalls identify each

17 Tribe by name, and how much we actually shortfunded

18 them in the given years.

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you haven't answered

20 my question.  That's the only advice from a lawyer you

21 received.

22             MR. STROMMER:  Yes, Your Honor, that's

23 correct, that's the only advice in the record.

24             I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

2           ORAL ARGUMENT OF ILANA H. EISENSTEIN

3               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

5 it please the Court:

6             Justice Sotomayor, you stated the Tribe

7 determined that it was not going to win on the law, and

8 so it decided not to file.  Indeed, the Tribe made a

9 strategic calculation here to allow the sixyear CDA

10 statute of limitations to pass, because it wanted to

11 monitor the litigation by other tribes, rather than file

12 and pursue its own action.

13             The miscalculation that it made about

14 whether the clear deadline could be extended by class

15 action tolling, that was a routine litigation mistake,

16 the kind that is far from the sort of extraordinary

17 circumstance that could warrant equitable relief.  Nor

18 did that miscalculation prevent the Tribe from filing

19 earlier.  To the extent that there was uncertainty as to

20 whether it was a member of the Cherokee Nation class,

21 and whether presentment was a jurisdictional bar to that

22 class membership, the prudent course, and any reasonably

23 diligent litigant would have filed under the clear

24 deadline, rather than wait for the uncertain application

25 of tolling and the potential forfeiture of its claims.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How did it know that, in 2 Cherokee Nation?  He claims that the only decision was 3 on  under Rule 23, and that presentment and tolling 4 was not at issue there. 5             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, the  the 6 Tribe confuses the definition of the class and the class 7 certification decision with its own  whether the  8 the court's own jurisdiction over its claim.  So the  9 the Tribe itself was jurisdictionally barred from the 10 class membership, regardless of how the class was 11 defined.  There was no need necessarily for the class to 12 be  carve out those over whom the district court lacks 13 jurisdiction.  The fact that the court lacked 14 jurisdiction flows from the fact that the Tribe failed 15 to meet the mandatory presentment requirement. 16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, let's talk about 17 the American Pipe tolling.  It would seem to me, as has 18 happened in a number of litigations, that at the time 19 that the complaint is filed, it doesn't mean that every 20 member of the class has to have exhausted, because if 21 that's what it means, then there can never be a class 22 action. 23             MS. EISENSTEIN:  I agree, Your Honor, that 24 they can present  25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 issue is still open under the law, because it would seem 2 to me, and I could be wrong, that if you still have time 3 on the clock when the complaint is filed, that you 4 can  before you receive any remedy under the class 5 action suit, you can present  exhaust then, and 6 recover, if you've done it during the period that  the 7 sixyear period plus tolling.  That's what some courts 8 have done.  They've defined the class as people who have 9 exhausted, or who still have time to exhaust. 10             MS. EISENSTEIN:  That  that's correct, 11 Your Honor.  But if  but if the Tribe exhausted while 12 it still had time during the pendency of the Cherokee 13 Nation class action, we wouldn't be sitting here today. 14             Secondly, if it exhausted, because  let me 15 just be clear, that one of the problems with the class 16 action  or a fundamental problem with the class action 17 tolling argument is the Tribe is trying to toll the 18 wrong deadline.  Class action tolling doesn't apply to 19 the time to file administrative prerequisites to suit; 20 it applies to the time for filing a lawsuit in Federal 21 court.  And there is a good reason for that.  And that's 22 because the policy of class action tolling is to relieve 23 litigants of the difficult choice of whether to file an 24 individual lawsuit or to wait and participate in the 25 class and risk forfeiting their right to the lawsuit.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1             But that doesn't apply to an administrative 2 prerequisite that must be completed either way.  Whether 3 the Tribe proceeded individually or as a class, the 4 first step and mandatory step it had to take was to 5 present its claim.  And it failed to do that within the 6 requisite time frame. 7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, this is a slightly 8 different argument.  You're saying they can't get 9 equitably tolled for exhaustion of the administrative 10 process. 11             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, I'm saying  12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even if they could get 13 tolled for filing a lawsuit. 14             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Yes, Your Honor.  They 15 can't get class action tolling for the time  the 16 administrative period, because that's not what American 17 Pipe refers to.  It refers to the time for filing a 18 lawsuit. 19             And  and in any event, the  the class 20 action rule under American Pipe  American Pipe made 21 clear that it only applies to asserted class members who 22 would have been parties to the suit had it been 23 permitted to continue as a class action.  And the Tribe 24 fails there, too, because it was jurisdictionally 25 barred, at the time the class decision was pending, from
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 participating in the suit.  So even if Cherokee Nation 2 had been certified during the pendency of the class 3 certification determination, the Tribe was barred. 4             But importantly, the Cherokee Nation class 5 was not granted.  It was denied.  And it was denied, as 6 Justice Ginsburg pointed out, two years before the CDA 7 deadline would expire for the first claim.  And the 8 Tribe waited more than four years after class denial to 9 present its claim. 10             There was no basis for waiting.  At that 11 point, the Tribe knew it must pursue an individual 12 action, and the only reason it waited was to hope that 13 this Court would more conclusively reject, and did 14 eventually conclusively reject, the government's 15 affirmative defense that it was asserting in that case. 16             But the  the idea that a  a Tribe, or  17 or any litigant, who could have acted earlier chooses to 18 delay for strategic reasons, and then could get tolling 19 when it finds out that it miscalculated the deadline, 20 would be unprecedented.  And in fact, the fact that 21 equitable tolling is foreclosed follows directly from 22 this Court's cases. 23             It simply is a common litigation problem 24 that this Court has addressed time and again, where a 25 litigant believes the deadline is longer than it is,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 believes their claim occurred later than it did,

25

2 believes that tolling applies, and in fact, it didn't.

3 That was the case in Lawrence; that was the case in

4 Pace; that was the case in Irwin.  And in each of those

5 cases, the Court found equitable tolling did not apply.

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain something

7 in  in your brief that would seem to make all of this

8 beside the point?  You several times referred to a

9 release form that covered the years in question.  And

10 it's in the appendix at Pages 240 to 242.

11             If the  if there was a release covering

12 those years, then why does anything else matter?  Why

13 isn't the release  they release the claims for those

14 three years?

15             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, certainly

16 on the merits, we agree with you, that the release would

17 foreclose the right of the Tribe to collect on these

18 particular years.  But we're at the preliminary stage,

19 which is to say, whether we even get to the merits of

20 the claim.  And certainly, we think it does have

21 relevance to the equitable tolling inquiry, and whether

22 the timeliness inquiry, which is  first of all, it

23 goes to the diligence.  This isn't just a litigant who

24 took no action.  It took one affirmative step, and the

25 one affirmative step it took was to release the claims

Alderson Reporting Company

1 at issue.  That 

Official

26

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  Did the Indian Health

3 Service have the authority to require the Tribe to

4 release those claims during the contract closeout

5 process?

6             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, there's no

7 specific statutory authority.  The Tribe argues in its

8 reply brief that the  the Health Service was somehow

9 barred from seeking a release, but I don't believe that

10 there was any  certainly in the government's view

11 there was no statutory prohibition on the type of

12 release that was issued here, which basically allows for

13 exceptions, provides a place in the release for

14 exceptions of claim, and the Tribe lists agreed to none.

15             So 

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  What would have happened if

17 they refused to sign the release?

18             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, the  the

19 declaration of the contracting officer that's in the

20 record speaks to that point which said that there would

21 be no adverse consequences to a tribe that refused to

22 sign the release or that signed the release with

23 exceptions.  It was an administrative process for the

24 agency to be able to close out the contract after a

25 requisite contracting period.  But it certainly is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 significant as to what the Tribe was thinking in its

27

2 diligence as to the pursuit of its claims, which is the

3 concern of equitable tolling.

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it turned out

5 there were consequences after all.

6             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, there weren't

7 consequences in terms of its ability to contract with

8 his, or  or the terms on which it could contract with

9 his going forward.  I think that there are consequences

10 in equity when a party releases what  releases a claim

11 affirmatively, whether or not that was something that

12 was required of it.  It voluntarily signed that release.

13             But  but ultimately, even without the

14 release, the  the Tribe took no action to pursue its

15 claim during the statutory period.  And counsel for the

16 Tribe suggests that we should equate the rules for

17 classaction tolling and equitable tolling, but equity

18 operates under different  different rules.  And the

19 diligence requirement is paramount among them.

20             Equitable tolling requires the party to

21 demonstrate diligence throughout the entire period it

22 seeks tolled, and it requires that the impediment to

23 suit actually prevent the timely filing.  Neither of

24 those standards are met.

25             JUSTICE ALITO:  Are there any circumstances

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1 in which reliance on legal advice could constitute the 2 extraordinary circumstance required for equitable 3 tolling? 4             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, I think it's  5 this Court has never recognized as such.  In Holland, it 6 was the very unusual circumstance where it was mistakes 7 by counsel, but mistakes that really amounted to an 8 abandonment by counsel.  It was certainly not advice of 9 counsel, so  10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That it's settled in all 11 13 circuits.  They've all ruled one way.  You don't 12 think it's reasonable to give advice based on that 13 ruling, that that might be an exceptional circumstance? 14             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think 15 in that  in your hypothetical, it would be the 16 reliance on the binding circuit precedent, not the 17 reliance on counsel's advice per se, especially if 18 counsel's advice was  was poor  poorly rendered. 19             But in the case  if you're asking if there 20 was a situation where binding precedent afforded more 21 time to a litigant but yet later was determined that 22 less time was available, that may be  may be a 23 circumstance that could qualify for tolling, but only 24 where other factors are met.  And for example, in  25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how about it's not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 13, it's 12, but you're in a circuit that hasn't ruled. 2 You mean that it's  it wouldn't be an extraordinary 3 circumstance in that situation? 4             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, that was 5 the case in Pace, for example, where the litigant in 6 that case claimed that he was relying on then binding 7 and existing Third Circuit precedent in believing that 8 his time for filing a Federal habeas action was tolled. 9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's one circuit.  I'm 10 talking about the vast majority. 11             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Right. 12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  12 out of 13. 13             MS. EISENSTEIN:  And even in those cases, 14 like in Duncan, this Court overturned a large number of 15 circuits in terms of the tolling standard.  And the 16 lower courts did examine whether that could be an 17 extraordinary circumstance.  But it wasn't enough to 18 necessarily get tolling where the litigant failed to 19 otherwise exercise diligence in the pursuit of the 20 original claim.  And here that would meet  be  21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Fair.  Fair answer. 22             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Yes.  Exactly. 23             As this Court has  and the questions have 24 already suggested, the Tribe's reliance on classaction 25 tolling in this case was not reasonable.  But even if it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 had some belief that the deadline for filing its

30

2 administrative claim could be extended, it was incumbent

3 upon it, under the diligence standard for Holland, the

4 diligence prong of Holland, to file within the clear

5 deadline.

6             After 2001, the Tribe knew that it had to

7 proceed individually.  And the reason it waited, in the

8 words of the Waxhaw Declaration, was that it wanted

9 certainty over its  over the substantive claim.  And

10 what it amounts to, what this  this case essentially

11 amounts to is the Tribe's determination that it was not

12 worth the effort to pursue a claim until after this

13 Court's decision in Cherokee Nation.

14             JUSTICE ALITO:  Was the government harmed in

15 any way by the  the lack of presentment?

16             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, in some

17 respects it remains to be seen.  But I believe that

18 prejudice may result from the failure to present in a

19 timely fashion.

20             First of all, putting aside the notice

21 requirement, this is a very recordsintensive inquiry.

22 And in  in Petitioner's brief they suggest that this

23 was just a matter of records that are already stored in

24 the government's possession.  But many of the  the

25 inquiry of what actually the contract support costs

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 would be required is a detailed and complex

31

2 determination.

3             And in fact, the  the  the experience in

4 Ramah highlights this where the settlement negotiations

5 have gone on for three years trying to determine what

6 the actual damages are through goodfaith negotiations.

7             And so yes, I would believe that the

8 government may suffer prejudice as a result of now

9 nearly 20 years later having to determine actual

10 contract support costs if this were to go back on the

11 merits.

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The D.C. Circuit said

13 this is presentment, this is just paperwork, easy 

14 easy to do.  But the Tribe couldn't  if they had

15 presented to the contracting officer, they just couldn't

16 leave it at that.  They would have to take an

17 administrative appeal within 90 days, or they'd have to

18 appeal to the Federal circuit within a year.  So more

19 was at stake for this Tribe than simply filing a piece

20 of paper.

21             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, there's no

22 doubt that perhaps the D.C. Circuit's

23 envelopeandastamp may have been a bit of hyperbole.

24 But that said, what the Tribe's argument, that it was

25 the subsequent deadlines that would have led it to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 delay, is really an astounding proposition, which is

32

2 that their basis for tolling is the existence of the

3 statutes of limitation.  And that really can't be the

4 case, that the fact that once they filed their claim, it

5 may then follow; that additional limitations periods may

6 kick in; that that could warrant delay in and of itself.

7             But even putting that aside, there were

8 other options that the Tribe could have pursued.  For

9 example, having presented its claim, and if it did so

10 prior to  it said it hoped to be a part of the

11 Cherokee Nation class action, if it did so prior to the

12 Cherokee Nation class action, and the Cherokee Nation

13 class action was in fact certified, then  then it may

14 have an argument it's part of that class.

15             To the extent to which the Cherokee Nation

16 class was denied, then the only  then the presentment

17 requirement was the necessary step to moving forward to

18 presenting its claim individually at the contract, Board

19 of Contract Appeals level or at the judicial level.

20             So I don't believe that the inevitability of

21 further litigation in any way is a basis for tolling in

22 this case.

23             If there are no further questions, thank

24 you.

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

Alderson Reporting Company

3         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY D. STROMMER

4                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5             MR. STROMMER:  Thank you, Your Honor.

6             I'll start with a few comments on the last

7 point that counsel made.

8             The stampandanenvelope quote is more than

9 hyperbole; it's just flat wrong.  There's costs incurred

10 by the Tribe to calculate the amount of claims.  There's

11 costs in pulling together the letter that then goes into

12 the envelope that is the claim itself.

13             But more than that  and your question

14 alluded to this, Justice Ginsburg  the  once  once

15 the claim is filed, and the government, undoubtedly, as

16 it did during this period of time with all of the claims

17 that were filed, they would have denied the claim.  That

18 triggers another statute of limitations, either 90 days

19 to appeal in the civilian board of contract appeals, or

20 one year to appeal in Federal district court.  And that

21 deadline had been found by courts to be jurisdictional.

22             So in fact, what we're talking about here is

23 a conundrum, because the sixyear statute of limitations

24 under the Contract Disputes Act had not been found to be

25 jurisdictional.  It was later on found to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 jurisdictional as a result of the presentment

34

2 requirement, but the statute of limitations that would

3 have been triggered would, in fact, have been

4 jurisdictional, and the Tribe would have had no option

5 but to litigate.  And if we place these facts on top of

6 what happened in Cherokee Nation, it perfectly

7 illustrates the conundrum.  707 days it took for the

8 certification process in that case.

9             If the Tribe had filed at the beginning of

10 that process and received a rejection of its claim

11 during the first 100, 150 days  let's give the

12 government, you know, ample time to respond  then it

13 would have triggered a statute of limitations that was

14 jurisdictional that the Tribe would have had to have

15 acted on, in order to make sure that its claim was, in

16 fact, going to still be alive.

17             And that would have happened before the end

18 of the 707 days.

19             So it's more than a stamp in an envelope.

20 It really is a jurisdictional conundrum that the Tribe

21 was aware of and concerned about, that partially

22 factored into the Tribe's decision not to file a claim.

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There  there are so

24 many people who don't have resources to pursue a

25 litigation.  How do we differentiate you from those

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
35 1 millions of people with lack of resources who choose not 2 to pursue claims, either because they think, at least up 3 till then, they're going to lose, because that's the 4 state of the law, or for whatever other reason they're 5 waiting?  How  how do we  how do we articulate an 6 equitable tolling principle that won't open a floodgate 7 to making a statute of limitations basically a nullity? 8             MR. STROMMER:  Well, the  the primary 9 basis, Your Honor, for the Tribe's position that 10 equitable tolling should apply is its reasonable 11 reliance on classaction tolling. 12             The other factors, such as the cost of 13 litigation, such as the United States' fiduciary 14 responsibility and trust responsibility towards the 15 Tribe  16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If it was reasonable, 17 why didn't you litigate that? 18             MR. STROMMER:  There was no  19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why didn't you take the 20 order of the  the court below, that  and appeal that 21 order? 22             MR. STROMMER:  Well, there were two cases. 23 Both the Federal circuit and the D.C. Circuit ruled just 24 about the same time on that issue, and both concluded 25 the same, that classaction tolling was not available
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 because of the presentment requirement.

36

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  To seek cert. on that

3 question?

4             MR. STROMMER:  The Arctic Slope, the other

5 case, did, so  so there was no split in the circuits,

6 and the Arctic Slope case did, in fact, petition this

7 Court, and this Court didn't take the case.

8             So the Menominee Tribe chose not to throw

9 bad money after  after a bad result, which was

10 guaranteed, by preparing a petition cert., which this

11 Court had already denied in the Arctic Slope Native

12 case.

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When there was no split.

14 But you had a split.

15             MR. STROMMER:  There was no split.  No, Your

16 Honor.

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When your decision came

18 up.

19             MR. STROMMER:  No.  Our decision on that

20 issue  there were two rounds of litigation at the

21 court of appeals level.  In the first round, both the

22 Federal circuit and the D.C. Circuit held that

23 classaction tolling was not available, and they both

24 remanded back to the trial courts to determine whether

25 or not equitable tolling applied.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             And that first decision was appealed by

37

2 Arctic Slope Native  or petitioned this Court to take

3 that case, and it was not taken.  And Menominee did not

4 take those steps by filing a petition.

5             I  I also want to address the prejudice

6 issue.  There's  if there's anything in the

7 government's briefs that strikes me as hyperbole, it's

8 that they were prejudiced.  They have been settling

9 hundreds of these claims around the country.

10             These claims are very straightforward.  The

11 contract, the methodology that's used to calculate the

12 entitlement for contract support costs, are well

13 established in policy.  We know the government produced

14 shortfall reports, contemporaneous with the years in

15 which these claims accrued, in which they told Congress,

16 for each Tribe, how much they shortfunded them.

17             So the  the government would tell you that

18 they're prejudiced because they would have to go back

19 and look at the contract and look at the policy in place

20 at the time to calculate the amount due is just not 

21 just not credible, in my view.

22             I rest our case, Your Honor.

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

24             The case is submitted.
