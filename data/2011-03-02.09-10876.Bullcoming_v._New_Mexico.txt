1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:15 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument first this morning in Case 09-10876, 5 Bullcoming v. New Mexico. 6 Mr. Fisher. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 The text, purpose, and history of the 12 Confrontation Clause make it clear that the prosecution 13 cannot introduce one person's testimonial statements 14 through the in-court testimony of someone else. Thus, 15 having held in Melendez-Diaz that a lab analyst's 16 statements in a forensic lab report are testimonial, 17 this is an easy case. 18 The State violated the Confrontation Clause 19 by introducing lab analyst Curtis Caylor's statements in 20 a forensic lab report without putting him on the stand. 21 The New Mexico Supreme Court resisted this analysis, 22 straightforward as it is, on the ground that 23 Mr. Bullcoming, as the defendant, had the opportunity to 24 cross-examine a substitute or a surrogate witness, 25 Mr. Razatos.

1 But a surrogate witness procedure violates 2 all four components of the right to confrontation. It 3 quite obviously violates the defendant's right to have 4 the witness testify in his presence, in the presence of 5 the jury so the jury can observe it, and under oath, as 6 happened in this case. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, when you say 8 "in the presence," do you -- do you mean it necessarily 9 must be in the courtroom, or would a video-conferencing 10 set-up be permissible so that the technician or the 11 analyst could testify from the lab, rather -- but it 12 would be screened in -- in the courthouse? 13 MR. FISHER: Well, the default rule under 14 the Confrontation Clause is in presence, in the 15 courtroom. Now, in Maryland v. Craig, this Court held 16 in a child witness setting -- of course, very different 17 than this case -- that closed-circuit TV would be 18 permissible, and I believe, you know, in a future case, 19 if the State perhaps made some sort of showing that the 20 lab analyst couldn't come to court for some reason, and 21 certainly if the defendant stipulated, and maybe even if 22 the defendant didn't stipulate, a court could 23 accommodate - 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The defendant didn't give 25 his consent, so we don't -- that's not a concern, but
4

1 let's -- let's suppose defendant doesn't stipulate. Is 2 this adequate to meet the Confrontation Clause? 3 MR. FISHER: I don't think it would be 4 adequate, Justice Ginsburg, with at least some -- absent 5 at least some showing of unavailability of the witness 6 or -- making the witness unable to come to court. 7 Now -- now, there is an amicus brief in the 8 case, I believe, that suggests some flexibility that 9 trial judges might employ in -- in accommodating lab 10 analysts' schedules. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about police 12 witnesses? What about not requiring the officer who - 13 who took the confession or who witnessed the alleged 14 crime -- not requiring him to appear because he's busy? 15 MR. FISHER: Well, that's never been - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't make it. He's out on 17 the beat. So can we have him appear by television? 18 MR. FISHER: That's never been the rule, 19 Justice Scalia, and I don't think there would be a need 20 to - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is a lab 22 technician different? 23 MR. FISHER: I don't think -- I don't think 24 one is, and you don't have to reach that in this case, 25 because the State never attempted to make any showing

1 that Mr. Caylor was unavailable for any reason. This - 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher, what if 3 you had two people doing this procedure? They're 4 sitting in, you know, chairs right next to the other. 5 The one, you know, takes the blood samples from the 6 vials, puts them in another vial, and puts the aluminum 7 stuff on and crimps it. The other one then takes the 8 vials and puts them in the machine and runs it. Do you 9 have to have both of them testify? 10 MR. FISHER: Only if the State wants to 11 present statements from them both. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, they want to - 13 MR. FISHER: They both - 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They want to present 15 the results of the blood analysis - 16 MR. FISHER: I think - 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the numbers the 18 machine spits out. 19 MR. FISHER: I think in that scenario, if 20 both people were there for the whole thing, the State 21 could have either one of them testify. What the State 22 couldn't do - 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though one - 24 MR. FISHER: -- and this is the rule - 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though one
6

1 didn't do it? Even though the question is going to be, 2 did you put the aluminum on and crimp it, and the answer 3 is going to be, no, Joe did it; he sits right next to 4 me? 5 MR. FISHER: That's right. The 6 Confrontation Clause is a purely procedural right, Mr. 7 Chief Justice. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. That's 9 right. Does -- do they both have to testify, then, or 10 not? 11 MR. FISHER: They do not have to. The 12 Confrontation Clause is a purely procedural right. It 13 all depends on what -- whose statements the State wants 14 to introduce. So, if the State is satisfied to prove 15 its case by having somebody testify, saying, I watched 16 the thing go into the machine and I watched this result 17 come out and I saw that it wasn't tampered with and it 18 was Mr. Bullcoming's sample, then that would be fine. 19 And in fact, what some labs do - 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't understand 21 that. How is that any different than the supervisor of 22 the lab saying, I know what these people do, I -- I 23 watch them on a day-to-day basis, and they perform their 24 work correctly? 25 MR. FISHER: Again, the question, Justice
7

1 Kennedy, is not who the State has to bring in. The 2 question is whose statements the State wants to 3 introduce. Here, the State wanted to introduce 4 Mr. Caylor's statements, and so it therefore needs to - 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What the State wanted to 6 introduce is the result of the exam, and the Chief 7 Justice gives you the hypothetical. Say, two people are 8 necessary for the exam. You say only one has to be 9 there if both saw it? 10 MR. FISHER: If only -- if the State is only 11 introducing one person - 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- but it's hearsay 13 as to what the first person did with -- with crimping - 14 MR. FISHER: I don't - 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- crimping the thing. 16 It's not direct testimony from that person. You didn't 17 say, are you experienced in crimping? Did you use your 18 right hand or your left hand? Is there a danger of 19 spillage? And so on. All that is beyond the ability of 20 the defense to ask. 21 MR. FISHER: No, I -- Justice Kennedy, I 22 don't think it's hearsay. It's simply being an 23 eyewitness and saying: Here's what I watched. I 24 watched this person put it into the machine, and this is 25 the result that I saw come out.

1 Now, again, the only question is whose 2 statements the State wants to introduce. By all means, 3 Mr. Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, if the State 4 wanted to introduce statements from both of the lab 5 analysts who worked together on the case, they would 6 need to bring them both in, but if they only want to 7 introduce one lab - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: The State takes its 9 chances, right? I mean, as to how much it has to bring 10 in, in order to persuade the jury? 11 MR. FISHER: That's right. That's the 12 decision the State makes in every case, whether it be 13 multiple police investigators, multiple eyewitnesses, 14 or - 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You always take your 16 chances with a business record. That's a given, of 17 course. Of course, the State takes a chance with the - 18 with the admission of any admissible hearsay testimony 19 that the jury will be -- that you'll make the argument 20 to the jury that you should discount it if the person 21 isn't there. That's always true. 22 MR. FISHER: I'm not sure I -- I disagree 23 with anything you said, but the rule of the 24 Confrontation Clause applies to a particular kind of 25 statements, testimonial statements. And our rule today
9

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and the one that resolves this case is, if the State 2 wants to introduce a witness's testimonial statements, 3 it needs to bring that witness to court. 4 Now, footnote 1 in Melendez-Diaz - 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, I take it it's a 6 testimonial statement that this blood that was taken at 7 the hospital was the blood of the defendant. That's a 8 testimonial statement? 9 MR. FISHER: Yes, I believe it would be, 10 Justice Kennedy. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so I assume that in 12 this case, the nurse and the police officer were both 13 present. 14 MR. FISHER: Yes, and, in fact - 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I assume under your 16 position, you could not have a record showing that 17 the -- the nurse withdrew the sample at 10:08 p.m. on 18 such-and-such a date and that she followed the regular 19 procedure. That would be insufficient if the State 20 wanted to introduce just a certificate or just -- just 21 that record? 22 MR. FISHER: I think that's what footnote 1 23 in Melendez-Diaz says. If the defendant wants to 24 challenge the chain of custody, then the State needs to 25 bring in the witnesses. Now, I think it's an
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 interesting fact in this case, and it shows why that 2 rule isn't so - 3 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's not -- I don't 4 think that's what Melendez-Diaz' footnote 1 says. It 5 says that the State may be able to prove chain of 6 custody by testimony other than the actual individuals 7 who handled the sample, and then it has to take its 8 chances as to whether the trier of fact is going to 9 believe -- is going to believe that. Isn't that right? 10 MR. FISHER: I think that's right. I think 11 what footnote 1 says is the defendant -- when the State 12 chooses whose testimony it wants to introduce, the 13 defendant has the right to insist that that be done 14 live. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It does -- it does not - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does not Melendez-Diaz also 17 say that if the defendant wants to challenge the -- the 18 chain of custody, the State can adopt rules that 19 requires the defendant to assert that challenge or his 20 intention to make that challenge, or his intention to 21 make that challenge, prior to the trial so that the 22 State will know whether it has to introduce any live 23 testimony? 24 MR. FISHER: Of course, that's correct under 25 the notice and demand regimes that Melendez-Diaz
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 approved of. And the Public -- the PDS brief in this 2 case showed that many States do use those regimes. Now, 3 Justice Kennedy, I did want to - 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the chain -- the chain 5 of custody does involve a testimonial statement that 6 this is the blood, that I took it out at 10:05 p.m. on 7 Saturday evening. That's a testimonial statement. It's 8 the defendant's blood. 9 MR. FISHER: Yes, it can, Justice Kennedy, 10 but chain of custody is proved by live witnesses every 11 day in -- every day in courtrooms across the country - 12 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's not just - 13 MR. FISHER: -- long before Melendez-Diaz or 14 Crawford. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not just chain of 16 custody. I think the Chief Justice is trying to get at 17 this problem, or I am: Lab technician Jones looks at a 18 vial, and it's blue. She says to Smith, "it's blue." 19 Smith turns a lever on a machine to B. 20 Jason sees the B and goes into court -- you 21 make him go into court; that's our case. And what I 22 wonder is, is the defendant now entitled to the 23 following instruction: Jury, because he's in court, he 24 can say that the machine read B, but that proves nothing 25 about the vial, nothing. All it proves is what someone
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 said in the laboratory to another person, and those two 2 people aren't in court. 3 Now, that's -- you see, that's the problem, 4 I think, of the intermediate step. I'd either like to 5 be told I'm wrong about that, you don't have to have 6 them, or explain whatever you'd like. 7 MR. FISHER: If I understand your 8 hypothetical correctly, I think that if the defendant 9 wanted -- the defendant can certainly make that argument 10 to a jury, and the defendant, if he wanted to insist - 11 if the prosecution wanted to tie the results -- let's 12 bring it back to the facts of this case -- wanted to tie 13 the .21 to Mr. Bullcoming by saying that was 14 Mr. Bullcoming's sample, then they'd need to bring 15 somebody into court if the defendant insisted upon it. 16 But the one thing I want to add is that the 17 Public Defender Service brief makes clear, and the facts 18 of this case make clear, it's going to be very rare that 19 a defendant wants to do that. The defendant in this 20 case wanted to stipulate to the nurse's blood draw and 21 that it was his blood that was drawn in the hospital. 22 It was the State that insisted on putting her on the 23 stand. It happens in courtrooms all across the country. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if you want to 25 tell us, don't worry, it won't happen, I think that's an
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 unacceptable argument. You're saying the defense has 2 certain rights, and we have to presume there is a 3 defense attorney who's going to afford his client every 4 right the Constitution has. So the fact that we're not 5 supposed to worry because it won't happen very often is 6 (a) it seems to me, an unlikely hypothetical; and (b) it 7 seems to me, irrelevant to your argument. 8 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Kennedy, I will 9 gladly accept (b) if we want to say that consequences 10 are irrelevant, because I think that's what -- the Sixth 11 Amendment is what it is, but I think the only thing I 12 would add is that all I can say is, empirically, in the 13 States that have followed the rule we advocate today, 14 long before Crawford or Melendez-Diaz, it simply is a 15 manageable burden. I'm not saying it's no burden. But 16 it is a thoroughly manageable - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher, I thought -- I 18 thought the Court put this worry behind us in Crawford. 19 Wasn't the same worry raised in Crawford? 20 MR. FISHER: Well, I think it was raised 21 even more pointedly in Melendez-Diaz when it comes to 22 lab analysts. I think in both places the Court, yes, 23 set that aside. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Said, yes, it may be 25 something of a risk, but the States have managed it in
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the past, and there's no reason to think they can't 2 manage it in the future. 3 MR. FISHER: I think that's what 4 Melendez-Diaz - 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there are 6 different types of hearsay involved here or different 7 types of statements. There's the report itself, which 8 was Exhibit 1 that was introduced, and it has certain 9 certifications by the analyst, that he followed certain 10 procedures, et cetera. I'm assuming that you're 11 claiming that those -- those are the Confrontation 12 Clause violations, that exhibit itself, because it is 13 attesting or certifying to something. 14 MR. FISHER: Yes. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The witness is not at 16 trial here. 17 MR. FISHER: Yes, Mr. Caylor's 18 certifications in this -- in the lab report, not only 19 that the blood -- that the blood had a .21 blood alcohol 20 content, but also that - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's where I 22 want - 23 MR. FISHER: Oh, but - 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- the "also" is 25 what I summarized in saying that he followed certain
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 procedures, that it was in accordance with law, et 2 cetera. 3 MR. FISHER: And also that it was 4 Mr. Bullcoming's blood sample and that the sample had 5 not been tampered with. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.
 7 MR. FISHER: That's the totality of the -
 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.
 9 JUSTICE ALITO: But as to those persons
 10 who - 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now -- if I might just 12 finish my question. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Go ahead. Yes. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume that the 15 raw data, the graphs that were made, were reviewed by a 16 separate witness, and he reviewed the data and says, 17 this data shows that the blood level concentration was 18 .21, or two-point whatever it was. Would that violate 19 the Confrontation Clause, using the raw data itself? 20 MR. FISHER: I want to be clear that raw - 21 by "raw data," you mean the printout from a machine? 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The printout from the 23 machine. 24 MR. FISHER: It's used a few different ways 25 in the briefing.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That wasn't introduced 2 here; am I correct? 3 MR. FISHER: It was neither -- it was not 4 introduced, and there's nothing in the record to show 5 that Mr. Razatos even reviewed it. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But let's 7 assume - 8 MR. FISHER: So what he did is just read the 9 report. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume he just 11 took the raw data at trial. I know we now have a chain 12 of custody, and someone will have to prove that this is 13 the data related - 14 MR. FISHER: Right. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to Mr. Bullcoming. 16 But if that expert then read that data and testified 17 that this was of a certain amount or percentage of 18 alcohol, would that violate the Confrontation Clause? 19 MR. FISHER: Probably not. Provided, as you 20 say, the chain of custody had been either properly 21 proved or stipulated to, I think an expert could take 22 the stand and say, I'm looking at a graph, and here's 23 what the graph shows me. Now, you might get into - 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's what -- that's 25 the New Mexico Supreme Court suggested, didn't they?
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 They said bring the printout from the gas -- whatever - 2 chromatograph, and then have an expert who was not the 3 one who certified -- it was not Caylor -- but that 4 here's the graph that came out of the machine, and this 5 is the way this process operates. 6 I -- in your answer to Justice Sotomayor, 7 did you mean to agree with the New Mexico Supreme Court 8 when they said printout plus an analyst who didn't do 9 this particular run but knows how the process works? 10 MR. FISHER: No, Justice Ginsburg. I'm 11 certainly not here today to agree with the New Mexico 12 Supreme Court. What they said doesn't -- doesn't make 13 any sense in this case because (a) the printout was 14 never introduced into evidence or looked at, and (b) it 15 would matter a great deal -- and this is how I continue 16 my answer. It mattered a great deal what was on the 17 printout. If the printout is nothing more than a graph, 18 then I don't think you can say that's a testimonial 19 statement. If a printout comes out of a machine that 20 also says at the top blood sample was Donald 21 Bullcoming's, here's the test that was run, et cetera, 22 those may well be testimonial statements that the 23 analyst triggered the machine to spit out. 24 So the Fourth Circuit has wrestled with this 25 issue in the Washington case, and you can -- you can
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 look at the majority and the dissenting opinions in that 2 case. I think that the question would arise in that 3 scenario, if the graphs were -- if the machine printouts 4 were introduced into evidence, the question would be, 5 are the machine printouts testimonial? And to the 6 extent they are, you'd have the same problem in this 7 case. To the extent they are not -- as the Fourth 8 Circuit suggested, at least to some degree they may not 9 be -- then you don't have a - 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What part - 11 MR. FISHER: -- Confrontation Clause 12 problem. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What part do you see as 14 testimonial or not? What can an outside expert look at? 15 MR. FISHER: I think an expert can look at 16 anything. The only question is what's introduced into 17 evidence. There's no -- there's no Confrontation 18 Clause - 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I -- that - 20 MR. FISHER: -- barring an expert from 21 reviewing whatever he wants. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's two different 23 issues: one, what can be introduced into evidence, 24 which is the reports themselves; and what can he or she 25 testify to is a different question. That's a form of
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 evidence. And so that's the line I'm trying to get you 2 to describe for me, which is, when does that testimony 3 become a violation of the Confrontation Clause? 4 MR. FISHER: In one of two scenarios, 5 Justice Sotomayor, the first which is the scenario we 6 have in this case, when the report is introduced and 7 it's testimonial. The second - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume the 9 hypothetical I proffered. 10 MR. FISHER: The second is that it's not 11 introduced. Then you have a Confrontation Clause 12 violation if the expert -- and this is the words many 13 lower courts have used -- is a mere conduit for 14 introducing the out-of-court testimonial statement. 15 So - 16 JUSTICE ALITO: Could we break this down in 17 -- in this way? I see three things that the -- three 18 statements that the -- the State was attempting to -- to 19 prove. The first was that the sample that was tested 20 was the sample that was taken from the defendant. 21 Second was that the standard procedures were followed in 22 this case, and the third was that the result was .21. 23 Would you agree with that? Those are the three things? 24 MR. FISHER: I think there's one other 25 thing, Justice Alito, which is that the sample had not
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 been tampered with - 2 JUSTICE ALITO: All right. 3 MR. FISHER: -- or contaminated. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: That the sample had not been 5 tampered with. Now, as to the first three, in other 6 words, everything other than the results, could the 7 State prove those things without having -- simply by 8 introducing testimony regarding the way things were 9 generally done in the lab, and ask the jury to infer 10 that the general procedures were followed in this 11 particular case? 12 MR. FISHER: I think that would be a 13 question of State law, Justice Alito. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: It wouldn't be a 15 Confrontation - 16 MR. FISHER: It wouldn't be a Confrontation 17 Clause question. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Now, in this 19 case, as I read the record, it seems to me that's what 20 the prosecutor was attempting to do. This is on page 50 21 of the Joint Appendix. The analyst is beginning to 22 testify, the second answer on page 50: So what we do is 23 we will get the sample in the mail, et cetera. 24 The analyst is beginning to testify about 25 standard lab procedures, and then defense attorney says,
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 "Your Honor, I'm going to object to what's done in the 2 status quo." I take that to mean what is generally 3 done. "I don't object to what was done in this case." 4 So the defense attorney is preventing -- is 5 objecting to the prosecution's attempting to discharge 6 its responsibility with respect to those first three 7 propositions through testimony about standard 8 procedures, and is insisting that the analyst provide 9 the testimony that you say was a violation of the 10 Confrontation Clause; namely, testifying as to what was 11 done in this particular case. 12 MR. FISHER: Justice Alito, I think if you 13 look earlier in the Joint Appendix, I believe it's at 14 page 40, where the State for the first time says we're 15 going to put Mr. Razatos on the stand instead of Mr. 16 Caylor, there's a -- there's an objection there as well 17 that says you can't then put the document into evidence 18 that Mr. Caylor wrote if he's not going to be on the 19 stand. That's the critical objection here. 20 Now, you're right, there's nothing wrong 21 with Mr. Razatos having taken the stand in this case, 22 there's nothing wrong with him having described typical 23 procedures in the lab. I think the objection you're 24 pointing was to the one that said -- again, as far as 25 the State law objection, saying he can't testify to
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 something he doesn't have personal knowledge about, 2 which is whether the procedures were followed in this 3 case. But Mr. -- Mr. Razatos could certainly take the 4 stand and testify to -- to general procedures. But at 5 page 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix, he -- he simply 6 reads the report's results. 7 And so you have two Confrontation Clause 8 violations, really. You have the report being 9 introduced in the first instance, and then you have -- I 10 believe it's at 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix. You 11 have the prosecutor asking Mr. Razatos, what was the 12 result? He says the result was .21. As the State 13 itself says at page 58, note 15 of its brief, there was 14 no independent analysis being applied there. All Mr. 15 Razatos was doing was repeating and giving the jury the 16 conclusions that Mr. Caylor had reached. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: But if the -- if the machine 18 had expelled a piece of paper that said .21, that piece 19 of paper would not be a -- introduction of that piece of 20 paper, the contents of the piece of paper, would not be 21 a violation of the Confrontation Clause? 22 MR. FISHER: If it said nothing more than 23 the .21 coming out of the machine, I think probably not. 24 Now, judge Michael in the First Circuit would disagree; 25 and so that's an issue that's not in this case, and I
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 think you could debate whether that should -- even that 2 should be considered hearsay of the operator. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how can -- how can you 4 debate it? The purpose of the Confrontation Clause is 5 to allow cross-examination. How are you going to 6 cross-examine the machine? 7 MR. FISHER: Well -- well, the question that 8 would arise there would be whether the .21 should be 9 treated as Mr. Caylor's statement. Let me -- if I give 10 you two hypotheticals, maybe it explains. On the one 11 hand, I don't think anyone would claim that a time stamp 12 on a fax machine, for example, is a human statement. 13 It's a machine statement, and so therefore it can't be 14 testimonial. On the other hand, if someone types out an 15 affidavit on a word processor and hits print, you can't 16 say, well, that's the machine talking, not the human. 17 So the question arises in the lab context 18 whether a .21 or anything else that comes out of the 19 machine has enough human influence that it ought to be 20 treated as the -- as the person's statement. 21 Now, you don't have to resolve that in this 22 case, and what's important to emphasize is that that 23 hypothetical of the .21, even though the State would 24 like it to be this case, is really miles away for the 25 reason you said, because the State proved a lot more
24

1 than .21 by Mr. Caylor's lab report, and that's why 2 these hypotheticals I think are important. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: But all of those other 4 things could potentially be proven by indirect evidence, 5 by establishing standard procedures and asking the jury 6 to infer that the standard procedures were followed in 7 this case. They might -- they might believe that; they 8 might not - 9 MR. FISHER: The State could - 10 JUSTICE ALITO: They might make the 11 inference; they might not. 12 MR. FISHER: The State could make that 13 choice, but it would be a considerably weaker case, 14 Justice Alito, not just because they wouldn't have 15 anyone saying that the procedures were actually followed 16 in this case, but also in this case it would be a far 17 weaker case because they'd have somebody on the stand 18 who would now be subject to cross-examination as to why 19 he had been recently put on unpaid leave. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: But as to this case, didn't 21 the defendant actually testify that he was drunk at the 22 time of -- at the time when the blood was extracted? He 23 took the stand and he testified that after the accident 24 he went off into the woods and he came upon people who 25 were drinking vodka and he drank, they drank -- what was
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it -- a gallon of vodka together, and then he went back 2 to the scene and his blood was tested? 3 MR. FISHER: That was - 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that correct? 5 MR. FISHER: That was his defense, Justice 6 Alito, and here's why the lab report is still important, 7 though. Because you're right, he did admit he was 8 drunk. But remember, he was not convicted simply of 9 DUI; he was convicted in New Mexico law of aggravated 10 DUI. And to have aggravated DUI you need to have up to 11 a .16 blood alcohol count. So the report is the only 12 the State could have proved over .16, even if Mr. 13 Bullcoming admitted that he had been drinking that day. 14 So that's why it's important in this case. 15 That's why he wanted to challenge -- that's one reason 16 why he wanted to challenge the report. 17 Let me come back to the -- to the important 18 point, I think, though, that what the State wants to be 19 able to do -- I don't want to ascribe a bad motive, but 20 what the State's rule would allow States to do is to 21 insulate people from cross-examination, not just Mr. 22 Caylor in this case, but -- but -- but please pay 23 attention to, for example, the Dungo case that's cited 24 in our opening brief, from California. That's a case 25 where a coroner had been fired from his job, blacklisted
26

1 by law enforcement, and prohibited from testifying in 2 many counties because he falsified his reports, his 3 autopsy reports, by writing them with the police report 4 sitting right next to him. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: But the State can't - 6 MR. FISHER: And - 7 JUSTICE ALITO: The State can't immunize 8 those people from testifying. You could have subpoenaed 9 Caylor, couldn't you? You could have asked for a 10 continuance and -- and a subpoena, and brought him in to 11 testify? It's just a question of who has to take the 12 step, right? 13 MR. FISHER: Well, we -- we could have, but 14 Melendez-Diaz makes clear that doesn't satisfy the 15 Confrontation Clause. And when you deal especially with 16 a garden variety DUI case there is only so much time and 17 resources at issue, and that's why the Confrontation 18 Clause I think is especially important in a case like 19 this, that the prosecution bring its witnesses into 20 court. 21 And if I could just finish the Dungo story, 22 in the -- in the California Court of Appeal, when they 23 reviewed that case, they said the prosecutor's intent in 24 that case had been to shield Mr. -- I'm sorry, the - 25 the actual analyst in that case from cross-examination.

1 And, in fact, the supervisor when he took the stand at 2 the preliminary hearing told -- told the court the 3 reason why they have me here is the prosecutors find it 4 too hard to have this person in court. So that would be 5 perfectly permissible, if -- if the State win this case 6 today and surrogate testimony were allowed. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the 8 practical situation that Caylor, who did this particular 9 run, does some dozens day in and day out, and he will 10 have no memory, in fact, of this particular test. So 11 having him there -- he knows how the process operates; 12 he doesn't remember this particular one -- how does 13 having him there -- what could be elicited on 14 cross-examination of him that couldn't be from his 15 supervisor? 16 MR. FISHER: Let me give you two answers, 17 Justice Ginsburg, but first let me say we don't know 18 whether somebody doesn't remember it until he's put on 19 the stand. What the NACDL brief says is that even 20 though analysts don't ordinary remember run-of-the-mill 21 tests like this, that do remember if something went 22 wrong or if something went haywire. So we don't know 23 that. 24 But assuming you're right that - 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't it the case that
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 these tests are unusual in this particular jurisdiction? 2 MR. FISHER: That's my understanding, 3 Justice Scalia. So that's another reason why he may 4 have remembered. 5 But even if he didn't, there's two things 6 that could be importantly probed here. One is his 7 credibility. And I've explained why that was a very 8 serious issue in this case, because he was put on unpaid 9 leave. 10 The other is his competence. Again, 11 Melendez-Diaz says it's important to have the person on 12 the stand to explain how he does his job, for the jury 13 to observe his professionalism, for him to explain 14 here's my understanding of these procedures, et cetera. 15 That could be very important, and if I could leave you 16 with one thing before I - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that even if 18 he doesn't remember, his testimony is not worthless to 19 the prosecution. He -- the prosecution can bring out 20 his high qualifications, and he can testify: It -- this 21 is always the way I do it. I do it this way all the 22 time. I don't remember this particular incident. 23 All of that can be persuasive to the jury, 24 can't it? 25 MR. FISHER: Of course, it can, Justice
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Scalia. And on the flip side, even if he doesn't 2 remember, cross-examination is very important. 3 If I could leave you with one thing that I 4 think isn't highlighted in the brief maybe the way it 5 should have been. There's a line of cases from this 6 Court, California v. Green, Delaware v. Fensterer, and 7 United States v. Owens, that all hold that if a witness 8 takes the stand and doesn't remember anything, that the 9 Confrontation Clause is still -- is still satisfied, as 10 long as that witness is on the stand for the reason 11 Justice Scalia explained and because the jury can 12 observe them, et cetera. 13 And so, the flip side of that has to be - 14 it's the holding of Owens most recently is that those 15 are meaningful things that the Confrontation Clause 16 requires. And so the flip side of those cases has to be 17 that if the witness takes the stand and doesn't 18 remember, the ineffectiveness potentially of a 19 cross-examination there doesn't matter, either. 20 If I could reserve what little time I have 21 left. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 23 Mr. Fisher. 24 General King. 25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY K.

1 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 2 MR. KING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 3 please the Court: 4 As the Court said in Michigan v. Bryant, a 5 police interrogation resembles an ex parte examination 6 when the primary purpose of the examination is to 7 create, quote, an out-of-court substitute for trial 8 testimony, end quote. 9 A public record not prepared by a police 10 officer is not the product of structured interrogation. 11 It is neither ex parte nor is it an examination. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. 13 You mean so long as all -- all hearsay by non-police 14 officers can be admitted without, without confrontation, 15 just because they're not police officers? 16 MR. KING: No, Your Honor, I don't believe 17 that that's the - 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think that was 19 your point, because it's certainly not true, is it? 20 MR. KING: It is not my point, Your Honor. 21 Your Honor, the point that I am making is 22 that in this case, the document, the report that we're 23 talking about is a public record, and that 24 differentiates it from the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz, 25 and so the case that -

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, could you 2 tell me what that means? Why is it different than the 3 affidavit? It's certified, and my understanding of the 4 dictionary meaning of certification is that that's an 5 attestation as to the truth of the statements contained 6 therein. That's the common definition. 7 So I'm assuming it's the equivalent of an 8 affidavit. So how is it different than the 9 Melendez-Diaz lab report? 10 MR. KING: Your Honor, and I understand, and 11 I'll answer your question with regard to your 12 expectation that the certification is the same as the 13 affidavit. It's not our position that they're exactly 14 the same, but there are several - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me why not. 16 MR. KING: There are other distinguishing - 17 distinguishing features that are significant between the 18 affidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this case. 19 For one, the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz was prepared 20 pursuant to an statute in Massachusetts that called for 21 the preparation of an affidavit from the lab at some 22 point in time after the actual test was done, and it was 23 to be used specifically as an in-court statement to 24 replace the live in-court testimony of the affiant. 25 In our case, the report being a public

1 record was a record that is kept contemporaneously by 2 the analyst in the lab, it is, in this case, the .21 is 3 a single data point that is taken from the raw data in 4 the machine and recorded on a standard document that's 5 provided by the - 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can any - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that was prepared just 8 for fun, not for use in trial? 9 MR. KING: No, Your Honor. I believe 10 that -- that that statement is planned to be used in 11 trial, and - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: So what difference does it 13 make whether the statute requires it to be taken to be 14 used at trial or whether the police send it over to be 15 used at trial as a use of the State? What difference 16 does that make? 17 MR. KING: Your Honor, I think the key is to 18 look at the purpose of the analyst who was preparing the 19 report, who is a public employee, who is just carrying 20 out, as our court said, copying the information from the 21 machine onto the report. And so, that's significantly 22 different than the amount of analysis that was done 23 by -- by the -- the witness in - 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. He's not 25 simply looking at a number and putting it on a report.
33

1 He's certifying to certain things. He's certifying to 2 following certain steps, that the evidence wasn't 3 tampered with. He's certifying that he's complied with 4 all the requirements of New Mexico law with respect to 5 the report, so he's just not copying a number. 6 MR. KING: That's correct, Your Honor. 7 In -- in this case the certification doesn't necessarily 8 make the report testimonial. There -- there are several 9 other examples of -- of cases where -- where evidence is 10 introduced at court that -- that have certifications. 11 For instance, it may be necessary for a 12 public records custodian to provide a copy of a birth 13 certificate in -- in a trial, and in that case, the 14 custodian always has a certification that says I 15 certify - 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't the difference 17 between those two documents is that one was prepared 18 primarily for the purposes -- this lab report, for 19 prosecution purposes, and the birth certificate is not 20 prepared for that? It's prepared to mark the birth of a 21 person, then it's used for many other purposes besides 22 trial; is that correct? 23 MR. KING: That is correct with regard to 24 the birth -- birth certificate, Your Honor. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So tell me what makes
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this certificate not primarily for the purpose of use in 2 the prosecution of an individual? Would they have 3 tested this blood if -- if it wasn't to prosecute him? 4 MR. KING: Your Honor, in -- in this case, 5 no. This -- this case is all about a sample that was 6 sent to the lab to be tested for this. But I think you 7 made it clear in Michigan v. Bryant that -- that there 8 might be a variety of purposes that should be analyzed 9 in order to decide whether or not the statement is 10 testimonial or not. 11 In this case, the purpose of the -- of the 12 lab analyst is significantly different from the purpose 13 of the police officer who requested the analysis. The 14 lab analyst does this for a living, and it's -- it's 15 their public duty. The lab in this case is -- is 16 operated by the State Department of Health, scientific 17 lab division, and -- and they do a variety of different 18 kinds of analysis. 19 And so, the -- the analyst who does the test 20 wouldn't necessarily have the same purpose in -- in 21 creating their statement for that document. As a matter 22 of fact, the analyst would most likely be driven by the 23 desire as a scientist - 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does he do any testing 25 except for the police?
35

1 MR. KING: Yes, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Who else do they test 3 for? 4 MR. KING: This lab also tests for, in this 5 particular case, the gas chromatograph analyses of blood 6 alcohol, they test for the office of the medical 7 examiner and -- and under New Mexico law, interestingly 8 enough, the -- the defendant can also ask for a test. 9 They would use the same form to ask for this test. 10 So, the analysis might be being done for a 11 defendant as well as for the State. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: Are these lab analysts civil 13 service employees? Are the lab analysts civil service 14 employees? 15 MR. KING: Yes, Your Honor, they are. They 16 work for the New Mexico Department of Health. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any way in which 18 your office or prosecutors or the police could cause 19 them not to get promotions if they weren't producing the 20 kind of lab reports that the police and the prosecution 21 might like? 22 MR. KING: No, Your Honor, they could not. 23 As a matter of fact, there -- there is a separation 24 between the operation of the Department of Health lab 25 and the police that even extends to the point of a
36

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 physical separation. Police officers are not allowed 2 into the lab area where -- where they are - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: This analyst was fired, as 4 I recall. Was he fired, placed on administrative leave 5 or something? 6 MR. KING: No, Your Honor, the record 7 indicates that -- that Mr. Caylor was not available for 8 court because he was on leave without pay, which - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: On leave without pay? 10 MR. KING: Uh-huh. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And do we know why it was 12 leave without pay? 13 MR. KING: We don't know why, Your Honor. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the defense know why 15 it was leave without pay? Could the defense have found 16 out in cross-examination that the reason he was leave 17 without pay because he was -- had shown himself to be 18 incompetent, and they were in the process of firing him? 19 I don't know whether that's true, but wouldn't that be 20 important to the defense? 21 MR. KING: Your Honor, I -- I think that the 22 defense would like to know the answer to that question. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And didn't -- and didn't 24 the prosecution intentionally set it up this way so that 25 this person would not have to testify, so that he could
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 not be cross-examined? Isn't that why they sent the 2 substitute to testify? 3 MR. KING: No, Your Honor. In this case, 4 that's -- that's not the case. I -- the -- this case 5 came about in a little bit of an unusual circumstance, 6 because both sides had been negotiating a plea agreement 7 and when the -- when the plea agreement was not 8 successful, the defendant asked for the trial to be 9 expedited and moved quickly to trial. So the defendant 10 didn't do as much discovery, I think, as you would 11 normally do in a case like that, but - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what the facts 13 are, but boy, it smells bad to me. It really does. And 14 even if that was not the case, the mere possibility that 15 it could have been the case shows why you should have to 16 bring this person in if you want to introduce his 17 testimony. 18 MR. KING: Your Honor, I think that the key 19 here is that if you would not look at the -- at any of 20 the qualities of the declarant in deciding whether the 21 statement is testimonial or not. And so once -- once 22 the Court makes the determination as to whether it is 23 testimonial or not, you wouldn't -- even if you would 24 like to ask those questions, you wouldn't have the 25 opportunity to ask those questions.

1 In this case, factually, it might also be 2 that Mr. Caylor was on unpaid leave because he had run 3 out of his regular leave time, and he decided to do 4 that. We -- it would all be speculation - 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree that whether it's 6 testimonial does not depend upon whether there's 7 skullduggery or not, but the possibility of 8 skullduggery, even in machine -- machine situations such 9 as this, is a good reason for saying this is 10 testimonial. 11 MR. KING: Your Honor, I think that's why 12 it's -- it's important that this is a public records 13 case, because that is one of the assumptions that courts 14 have made for hundreds of years with regard to the fact 15 that there is -- there is a duty by the person who's 16 taking down the information to -- to observe in a 17 regular manner, to record in a regular manner, and so 18 that's important here. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the principal 20 thrust of your brief, that this isn't testimonial at 21 all. You have not said because it was unsworn, because 22 you recognize the certification is the same, but you're 23 trying to equate it to a business record, public record? 24 MR. KING: Yes, Your Honor. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You do have the hurdle
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that this record was created for a specific purpose. It 2 was created to provide evidence for use in a criminal 3 prosecution. 4 MR. KING: Your Honor, I don't believe that 5 that is the only purpose that this form 705 could be 6 used for. It is the common purpose for this form, but 7 it is a form that the lab uses in every circumstance. 8 And indeed, as I said, in New Mexico law, the defendant 9 can ask for a second test. They can have that done. 10 It's done at the State's expense. They can have it done 11 at any laboratory that they want to. 12 But if they have the report done at the 13 State lab, and they're entitled to have that done, they 14 would utilize the same form. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, does the - 16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what are the other - 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the analyst 18 know whether he's being asked to do one for the 19 prosecution or the defendant? 20 MR. KING: Not necessarily, Your Honor. I 21 -- I actually don't know the answer to that specifically 22 except that the form -- and if you look at it, it's in 23 the Joint Appendix -- does have some information in part 24 A that -- that indicates that there is a police officer 25 that -- that sent the test to the lab. There's a nurse
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that did that in this case. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, so they would 3 know the difference, right? 4 MR. KING: They -- I think that the same 5 information would be on the form whether the defendant 6 submitted it or whether the -- or whether the 7 prosecution submitted it, and - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, not the same 9 information. One would say the police submitted it and 10 the other one would say the defendant submitted it, 11 right? 12 MR. KING: Your Honor - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: So if the police submitted 14 it, the -- the person doing the -- the test would know 15 that the police submitted it, I assume. 16 MR. KING: If you look at the form, Your 17 Honor, it would have the same information, but we're 18 not -- we're not here today arguing that the analyst 19 wouldn't know that the police submitted this form. But 20 it is an arm's length request, and once again, the Court 21 addressed that in your most recent case, in Michigan v. 22 Bryant, I believe because the -- the question is whether 23 or not there was an interrogation. One of the key 24 questions is whether there was an interrogation. 25 This clearly does not look like a case where
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there was an interrogation by the police. It was a 2 request on a standard form that was -- that was sent. 3 And so the purpose test, it appears from Michigan v. 4 Bryant, would not even apply in cases where there's not 5 a police interrogation. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is a key question 7 whether this was an interrogation? Does the 8 Confrontation Clause apply only to confrontations? To 9 interrogations? I mean, if a -- if a witness, before 10 the police ask any questions, blurts out, you know, 11 "Jones did it," can that statement get in because it has 12 not been in response to an interrogation? 13 MR. KING: Your Honor, the analysis would be 14 somewhat different. That's the point, is that - 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: It would be different 16 because interrogation doesn't make any difference. That 17 is not the condition for the application of the -- of 18 the Confrontation Clause. 19 MR. KING: Your Honor, we -- it appears that 20 it does make some difference with regard to Michigan v. 21 Bryant, and it's new to all of us. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: If it were an 23 interrogation, the factors mentioned in Michigan v. 24 Bryant would be relevant, presumably, but since this 25 wasn't an interrogation, I don't see how that has any -
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 any relevance whatever. 2 MR. KING: Well, the relevance, Your Honor, 3 I think, is since it's not an interrogation, then - 4 then you have to look at, and I think the Court has set 5 this out, you have to look at the nature of the evidence 6 and to make a determination as to whether the evidence 7 that's being presented is merely a substitute for live, 8 in-court testimony. 9 And there, back to the difference between 10 the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this 11 case is, in our report, even if Mr. Caylor had been at 12 the trial and on the stand, it would have been necessary 13 to have the report as well. I think Justice Ginsburg 14 raised this point, is that six months after the 15 examination was done, to cross-examine the analyst and 16 ask him, do you remember what the result was six months 17 ago from this one test out of a hundred that he ran, he 18 will not remember without looking at the report. The 19 report is the best evidence in this case to prove the 20 point that is being made here, and - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he'd look at the 22 report and say, gee, I don't remember; you know, I do a 23 lot of these reports. But then the prosecution in 24 direct would say, well, how do you do them? And he 25 would say, I always do this, I always do that, I always
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 do the other thing. Did you do it in this case? Well, 2 I don't specifically remember this case, but I always do 3 it. And that's the testimony that would go to the jury. 4 It would be pretty persuasive. Not as good as if he did 5 remember. 6 MR. KING: That's correct, Your Honor, and 7 so that's why the analysis of whether this is 8 testimonial or not is such an important analysis, 9 because if the -- the reasoning that the Court has had 10 for all of the hearsay exceptions, for excited 11 utterances or, in this case, for a public record, would 12 look at whether or not that evidence was the best 13 evidence to support the truth-finding purpose of the 14 trial. That's our -- that's our analysis, at least, 15 Your Honor. 16 And what we are arguing in this case is that 17 there is no difference between Mr. Caylor transferring 18 the .21 data from the machine to the piece of paper than 19 there would be if you took a photograph, for instance, 20 of the machine data and - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why did you give the 22 data to the analyst at trial? If there wasn't a more 23 persuasive power in the lab certification, why didn't 24 you just have the new expert look at the printout from 25 the graph and say, this is what it says?

1 MR. KING: Procedurally, in this case, Your 2 Honor, this -- the trial at the District Court level 3 occurred before the Court's opinion in Melendez-Diaz. 4 And so I think that at this point in time, that it would 5 be more normal behavior for the -- for the State to 6 present the raw data as well. 7 In this case, Mr. Razatos - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's that as well. 9 Don't you introduce the lab report because it -- it 10 gives more credence to the reliability of the result? 11 Because he's certifying that he followed certain 12 procedures, that he did certain things, that the sample 13 wasn't tampered with? 14 MR. KING: Yes, Your Honor. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it -- you're looking 16 for that testimony, correct? You're looking, at trial, 17 to that testimony to bolster the test? 18 MR. KING: Not using testimony in the sense 19 that we're talking about testimony here. I mean, you 20 might want that -- very well want that evidence in, not 21 different from other cases where if you had a -- it was 22 necessary to submit the judgment of a felony, for 23 instance, to show that a person in a later trial was a 24 felon with -- a felon in possession of a firearm, you 25 would have a certification from the court clerk that

1 would say, I certify that the copy of this document that 2 I'm submitting to the court is a true copy of -- that's 3 also not testimonial from -- for the purposes of the 4 Confrontation Clause I don't believe. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: You might want that in 6 order to show the machine says X, Y, Z, but that's only 7 as good as the stuff that was put into it. So you're 8 going to have to show that this was his blood put into 9 it. And many, many people might have handled it, and 10 there might be a routine so that they all check a box 11 when it's sealed and they get it. 12 Is it your understanding if you lose these 13 cases -- this case that you then have to take into court 14 all those people? 15 MR. KING: That's certainly a concern, Your 16 Honor. I -- if you look at this document, there are six 17 or seven people who have certifications on the -- on the 18 dire -- different statements on the document. There are 19 three certifications; there's one from the -- from the 20 woman who takes the samples into the lab that says she 21 received the samples; there's this one from Mr. Caylor; 22 there's one from -- from the reviewing analyst who 23 reviews it; and I gather that the -- that the Petitioner 24 is only challenging the -- that one certification 25 from -- from -- from Mr. Caylor.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: The chain of custody wasn't 2 -- wasn't contested here, was it? 3 MR. KING: It was not. And this document - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it often contested? My 5 impression is it's not very often contested. 6 MR. KING: I'm not aware of it being 7 contested often, Your Honor, I -- and this form I think 8 is one of the things in New Mexico that really helps 9 with that. The reason that the court submitted the form 10 is that you have everything relating to the chain of 11 evidence on -- on one document, and -- and so indeed a 12 lot of those statements really help - 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but the reason I asked 14 the question is because I don't think it is normally 15 contested. It's normally a business record of some 16 kind. 17 However, what I was looking for is a 18 distinction, because in the future I don't see why it 19 wouldn't be contested, unless there's a distinction. 20 MR. KING: Yes, Your Honor, and I think that 21 the distinction is that in this case the -- the analyst 22 is not essentially a party to the action. The analyst 23 works arm's-length transaction from -- from the -- from 24 the police and from the prosecutors, and so he's not 25 part of the prosecution team, is -- is how I've been
47

1 thinking about it. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: General, I know your State 3 takes a different view of it or you wouldn't be here, 4 but aren't there are a number of States that -- that do 5 provide the testimony of the technician, who do require 6 the technician to come in and -- and testify? 7 MR. KING: Your Honor, I believe that there 8 are other States that have statutes that -- that have 9 different ways of presenting evidence. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And have they had, to your 11 knowledge, serious problems about defendants contesting 12 chain of custody simply because this other thing is 13 required? Again, I'm -- I'm not aware that that's been 14 a problem. I think it's a boogeyman. 15 MR. KING: Your Honor, we -- we understand 16 that -- that the -- that the burden on the State is - 17 is not an issue that comes directly into the analysis 18 relating to the Confrontation Clause. I -- in New 19 Mexico, for instance, one of the problems that we have 20 is that -- is that the lab's centrally located in 21 Albuquerque and the -- and in this case the trial was in 22 San Juan County, so -- so the witness has to drive for 23 about 3 hours to get to where the courthouse is. So 24 that's sort of different in New Mexico than, say, in 25 Massachusetts or something like that. And -- and even
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 for 10 minutes worth of testimony, they might have to 2 drive 6 hours and take a whole day out of the lab. 3 So it -- it is a problem that -- that is 4 there, but I don't think that it is the seminal issue 5 that - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Are there States -- are 7 there States that do require a -- a -- a prosecutor to 8 produce everyone who has handled something in a chain of 9 custody at a -- at a laboratory, a criminal -- you know, 10 normal business? Are there States that do require that? 11 If so, could you tell me a couple, because I - 12 MR. KING: Your Honor, I'm not aware of any 13 State that requires that everyone in the chain of 14 custody appear in -- in trial. It is indeed normally up 15 to the prosecutor with regard to chain of custody to 16 determine who --who is going to be appearing. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: What about medical reports 18 that are aimed at a particular known victim of a crime 19 and thus will end up in trial? For example, a graph, a 20 graph which the nurse keeps, which is a statement by the 21 nurse that the patient's temperature on such and such a 22 day was 98.6 or whatever, and normally that graph would 23 be introduced; but are there any States that wouldn't 24 require -- would say, oh, no, you have to produce the 25 nurse? You have to produce the doctor for all medical
49

1 records? Which of course, are known by the keeper that 2 they will be used at the criminal trial. 3 Are there any States that require that? 4 MR. KING: There are none that I'm aware of, 5 Your Honor. I -- I don't -- I haven't - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Are there any States that 7 require ordinary business records perhaps of the most 8 ordinary kind, which always are statements that somebody 9 did something on a particular day? When those business 10 records happen to be kept before with the knowledge that 11 they'll probably be introduced at the trial, are there 12 States that require the man or woman who made the 13 business record to come into court? 14 MR. KING: No, Your Honor, and I think 15 that's the point of all of those. State law has their 16 -- their hearsay law that -- that analyzed whether those 17 statements are admissible. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I don't think 19 that's an accurate response, at least if you include the 20 qualification that Justice Breyer put in the question, 21 which is that the records were kept with the knowledge 22 that they would be introduced in -- in criminal trials. 23 I mean, you can say that all the records of 24 labs -- let's assume there's a -- there's a police lab 25 which -- which only does police testing of blood. Those
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 would be business records of the lab, but they certainly 2 would not be introducible just because they're business 3 records. If the record is made for the use in 4 prosecution, surely it's -- it doesn't come under the 5 business records exception, or else we wouldn't be here 6 today. 7 MR. KING: Your Honor, I think the 8 hypothetical that -- that you say really shows where the 9 line is. If -- if the lab is a police lab and only 10 doing the analysis for the police, then they -- they 11 look a lot more like a party to the -- to the lawsuit, 12 and certainly the hearsay exceptions have made it clear 13 that even though observations are -- are generally - 14 that are public records are generally allowed, that 15 observations by police officers are not. 16 And -- and so - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's an independent lab and 18 police always send it to this independent lab, but in 19 fact it's an independent business, it makes a profit; 20 but all the stuff it does it knows is going to be used 21 at trial. That wouldn't be admissible, would it? Even 22 though it's a perfectly normal business record. 23 MR. KING: Your Honor, I think that that 24 depends on -- on how you look at the purpose and whose 25 purpose it is that -- that you're analyzing. Now first
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 off that, would assume that the purpose test applies in 2 this case, and it seems to me since Michigan v. Bryant 3 that the purpose test may not apply to these kinds of 4 cases where -- where there's not a police interrogation. 5 But if -- if that is the case and the 6 purpose test applies, then it -- it also appears to me 7 that the -- that the test now requires that -- that you 8 look not just at the purpose of the policeman who - 9 who's asking the question, but that you look at the 10 purpose of the declarant, and in this case the purpose 11 of the labs clearly is -- is a purpose just to -- to get 12 the sample, do a good analysis, and -- and report that 13 analysis to, in New Mexico's case, both parties. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel - 15 MR. KING: The analysis that comes from our 16 State lab goes not only to the prosecution but also to 17 the defendant. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General - 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General, we seem to be 20 describing -- this case seemed rather particular, that 21 is, there was no objection by New Mexico to having an 22 analyst show up, Razatos; so -- so he had to travel 23 however long he said. It's just a question of one 24 employee's time rather than the other. 25 But -- and then you described how simple
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this thing was, you just put it in a machine, you would 2 get out a piece of paper. Why didn't New Mexico have 3 this -- there was an additional sample that could have 4 been -- it would have been si simple to just retest it. 5 Having the witness come to the court, why don't you arm 6 him with the additional test, and then there would be no 7 controversy? 8 MR. KING: Your Honor, one of the problems 9 in New Mexico would be since -- since the court believed 10 that -- that that report was -- was admissible, if they 11 did a second sample and --- and tried to submit that it 12 would be cumulative evidence, and probably would be kept 13 out by -- by the rule in New Mexico in that case. 14 So Mr. Razatos did have an important purpose 15 at this trial. In New Mexico you still I believe have 16 to have a witness who -- who can authenticate the 17 document to bring the document in. It might not have 18 had to have been Mr. Razatos in this case. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's say that this 20 Court holds that the Confrontation Clause requires the 21 presence of the actual analyst to testify about the 22 sample. Is there anything in the law that says that 23 that testimony is suddenly excused, and you do not need 24 the analyst if there's another sample available for the 25 defendant to test? That's not the rule, is it?
53
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. KING: It's not the rule, Your Honor, 2 although one of the things that we pointed out is that 3 -- is that the State always keeps two samples, that the 4 defendant has the right statutorily in New Mexico to - 5 to have a sample retested at a lab - 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm saying that 7 analytically that does not bear on the question whether 8 or not the sample that's introduced by the State 9 requires the -- the analyst to be present. They're just 10 unrelated. 11 MR. KING: Correct, Your Honor. 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That may -- that may show 13 that the confrontation rule is a silly rule. But it 14 doesn't -- but it -- there's -- assuming confrontation 15 is required, it's not excused - 16 MR. KING: Yes. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- by the presence of 18 another sample. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I don't follow that 20 because we have a substitute now. Caylor is out of the 21 picture; we know that it is the defendant's blood 22 because everything else is the same, and there's this 23 vial that has a certain amount of blood and there's a 24 certain amount left over, so it's not cumulative, 25 because Caylor's out of the picture. It is the
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 defendant's blood that has been lab tested by another 2 analyst. 3 MR. KING: I'm sorry, Your Honor, in -- in 4 your hypothetical, if -- if the State knew far enough 5 ahead of time that they -- they would not be able to 6 submit the -- the -- that analyst's results, they could 7 always -- because the blood sample continues to exist, 8 they could always retest that and -- and have another 9 witness who could do that. Depending on how the Court 10 rules in this case, it might be that States will be 11 required to do that. 12 But at this point in time under -- under the 13 current jurisprudence, it -- it didn't appear to the 14 State that they needed to retest the sample, and I think 15 you have to worry a little bit about -- about how many 16 people you might indeed have to have come into court and 17 testify if -- if the State -- if the burden on the State 18 is that you have to -- you have to sample twice just in 19 case you're going to lose one of your analysts, I -- I 20 think that that does indeed put a great burden on the 21 State to do that. And so - 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: General, I -- I don't want 23 to eat up your -- your little remaining time, I think 24 you can answer yes or no. Does New Mexico assert the 25 same rule as applicable to ballistics testing?
55

1 MR. KING: No, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 3 MR. KING: I think that you have to do the 4 analysis in each kind of statement that you're looking 5 at, Your Honor, to determine whether or not the 6 statement that's -- that's being made and that's being 7 proposed for trial is a substitute for live in-court 8 testimony. And so, with regard to ballistics, you know, 9 you would be looking at a little bit different set of 10 facts. 11 But in this case the facts are that -- that 12 the gas chromatograph gave us a printout that said that 13 the -- that the level of alcohol in the blood is .21 14 grams per 100 milliliters, Mr. Caylor transferred that 15 to a form, and that's what we are putting in. 16 I -- I think that -- that it proves the 17 point that I'm talking about, in a ballistics analysis, 18 you would have to have some analysis and someone to 19 reach a conclusion. And it's that that sets 20 Melendez-Diaz apart from this case, is -- is that there 21 was -- that there was some analysis by -- by -- by 22 the -- the declarant in that case. And in the 23 ballistics cases I think, most often, you would find 24 that. 25 Now, if the -- if in the ballistics case you

1 just took a photograph of the bullet and wanted to bring 2 that into the court and say here's what the bullet looks 3 like, the jury then could make a determination whether 4 they think that that bullet appears to be the same as 5 the other. That wouldn't be covered by the 6 Confrontation Clause. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Certainly not. 8 MR. KING: And -- and - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you -- you think 10 the result would be a -- the same if we could develop a 11 machine that you put the bullet in and -- and -- and - 12 that's been fired from this gun, and the murder bullet, 13 and the machine goes, blah, blah, blah, and it spits 14 out, you know, 99 percent, 99.9 percent match, that 15 would be okay? 16 MR. KING: May I answer the question, Your 17 Honor? 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. 19 MR. KING: In -- in that case, if -- if the 20 machine were able to do all of that, the machine 21 essentially is giving you the best evidence, yes, I 22 believe that that would be the case. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 24 Mr. Fisher, you have 2 minutes remaining. 25 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 2 MR. FISHER: Thank you. Let me try to make 3 four quick points. 4 First, Justice Alito, I said the first 5 objection was at JA 40, it's actually 44-45 in the Joint 6 Appendix. 7 With regard to the State's argument about 8 whether this document is testimonial, I would simply 9 urge the Court to take a very close look at the lab 10 report itself. It's at JA 62. At the top it says, 11 Mr. Chief Justice, in response to your question, 12 arresting officer identification, and the officer 13 writes, check for blood alcohol concentration. That's 14 the order to the lab. 15 If you look at the bottom in the 16 certification of analyst, he certifies that the 17 following is true and correct, signs his name, and 18 perhaps the most critical thing is at the very bottom, 19 the actual rules of the New Mexico evidence law and 20 criminal procedure law are referenced. So, it's exactly 21 like Melendez-Diaz. This is a document that is 22 expressly prepared for substitute live testimony. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not under oath, though, 24 that's the only difference? 25 MR. FISHER: Not under oath if a
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 certification is actually different than an oath, that 2 just makes this worse, as in Crawford this Court said 3 that it would be implausible that trial by affidavit 4 would be prohibited but trial by unsworn affidavit would 5 be okay. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do the rules of 7 criminal -- do the rules of criminal procedure in New 8 Mexico say it should be prima facie evidence? 9 MR. FISHER: They say much the same thing. 10 There are -- there are several rules referenced at the 11 bottom that all make this automatically admissible, 12 notwithstanding the hearsay rule to prove the truth of 13 the matter asserted. 14 With respect to Justice Ginsburg's question 15 about retesting, you are exactly right. The State had 16 many choices in the case -- in this case about how to 17 proceed. But if it wanted Mr. Razatos to be its 18 witness, all it had to do was have him do a -- retest it 19 and write a new report and have him be the witness. 20 There is no reason it would have to introduce 21 Mr. Caylor's report then and come up against any State 22 law issue. Mr. Razatos could have been the live 23 witness. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it depends on 25 when they do it, of course. I mean, you have the right
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to look at their evidence presumably so -- so far in 2 advance of trial, whatever, and if they had to get a 3 new -- new technician, that would have to put off the 4 trial - 5 MR. FISHER: And I think that -- I'm sorry. 6 I think that goes to my last point, which is, Justice 7 Breyer, you're talking about States that do this -- I'll 8 combine my answer to these two things. A continuance 9 would have been perfectly -- perfectly appropriate if 10 that scenario had arisen, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's 11 what -- one thing the public -- Public Defender Service 12 brief it talks about 23 -- 26 jurisdictions encompassing 13 23 different States that follow the rule that we're 14 advocating today. And it -- we're not asking for more 15 witnesses. It's important that we're -- this isn't a 16 multiple witness problem, we're just asking for a 17 different witness. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 MR. FISHER: In other words, the State just 20 brought the wrong witness. Thank you. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 22 The case is submitted. 23 (Whereupon, at 11:16 a.m., the case in the 24 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 25
