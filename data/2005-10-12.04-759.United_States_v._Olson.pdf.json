    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Tort Claims Act waives the sovereign immunity of the United States for the torts of Federal employees when private persons in like circumstances would be liable. But instead of applying private-person principles of liability, the Ninth Circuit looked to the State and governmental-entity principles of liability. It concluded that the United States could be liable here, because Arizona has decided to hold its governmental entities liable when State employees are negligent. That decision is wrong, for two reasons. First, it is contrary to the plain text of the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Federal Tort Claims Act makes clear that the liability of the United States is to be judged by the principles of private-person liability in the place where the tort occurred. In section 1346(b)(1), the Federal Tort Claims Act allows jurisdiction and waives the sovereign immunity of the United States under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred."

It's not quite the Good Samaritan -- not quite the Good Samaritan type, but you would accept that as the proper measure of your liability in a case like this?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "It gets ahead of the argument just a little bit, but you had a footnote about police officers. You have a park ranger, Federal employer. Is the analog there that we look to -- what the duties of a private security guard would be -- what do you do with those cases?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "Well, those cases, as we note, do present, often, special circumstances not present in this case, Justice Kennedy. But the answer to the question that's presented here is the same. You still would look to whether or not there is private -- a private-person analog. And, if there is, then you would look to the liability of private persons in that circumstance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "So, even with the police officer, I have to find a private analog."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "Yes, you do. For example, if someone brought a trespass action against a Federal law enforcement officer for entering upon their land, you would apply the same State law as it relates to trespass claims against private persons. Those claims may, for example, have a defense of lawful authority to enter. When looking at whether or not a police officer had -- a Federal officer had lawful authority to enter, one might then look to Federal law to determine whether or not the officer had authority to enter, but you would still be applying the principles of private-person liability. If one concluded that there was no private- person analog, then the only answer under the Federal Tort Claims Act would be that the United States cannot be liable."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "To the extent you're suggesting that we just look to general theories of tort law, I think that would be incorrect. The -- because the Tort Claims Act -- the language of the Tort Claims Act makes the United States liable only where a private party in like circumstances would be liable. And in Indian Towing, this Court defines \"in like circumstances\" as looking to the same character of conduct of the -- of the person. So, you would have to find a private person who's engaged in the same character of conduct, and then ask the question, What principles of liability does the State apply to those persons? Here, the --"

  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, all right, so if it's a police officer stopping somebody on a highway, it's the same as a private security guard stopping somebody at a -- you know, the driveway at a plant or something."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "That may be the closest private- person analog. In that situation, however, when one goes to apply the defense, it's just as one would if talking about a private security guard. One would ask the questions whether the guard had the requisite authority. And the State would look to what that guard's authority was. And often States would look -- if the guard happened to be a Federal officer, would look to Federal law. And that can be appropriate, I think, for -- under, potentially, three different -- for, potentially, three different reasons. One, the language of the defense in 2680(a), which provides the United States with a defense to liability in circumstances where , with due care, you're carrying out a Federal statute or regulation. It -- another source of authority might be the State-law principles simply look to what the authority of the person doing the conduct is, and then you would look to Federal law for the source of that authority. And that could be right, under this Court's suggestion in Muniz, that Federal regulations -- once an actionable duty is established under State tort principles, one can look to Federal regulations to determine whether or not -- what the applicable standard of --"

    "speech": "You may be right, Justice Ginsburg. I think the important point to take away from Muniz is that the Court stressed that, whatever the measure of the United States' liability would be for the claims at issue in that case, it could not be the State law as it related to governmental entities; that one would have to, as the text requires, look to State law as it relates to private persons. The point that I --"

But that's not the argument that we're making today. Today, we are arguing simply that one must, as the Court held in Indian Towing and Rayonier, one should look to the -- to the -- to the text of the statute, and that that must be the measure of our liability."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "If a State statute looked to Federal law as the source -- I think one has to be careful when one talks about \"negligence per se\" type principles, which is what you're suggesting -- some States look to statutes and regulations solely to establish a standard of care once a separate duty has been established. And some States, as respondents claim Arizona does, look to it establish both duty and a standard of care. But, putting that aside, if -- to respond directly to your question -- if a State adopted a Federal statute and used it to apply to private persons, you would be most of the way home in getting Federal Tort Claims Act -- at least the creation of potential liability against the United States. However, I think in that instance, there would still be a question as to the intent of Congress, in the Federal statute itself that was used, as to whether Congress intended to foreclose any private action, any private enforcement, such that the States -- if the State has misinterpreted, in other words, a Federal law, that presents, I think, a Federal question."

If there is such a thing as private safety inspectors in Arizona -- I'm not sure, but if there are, I assume that what they do is, when they go into a particular industrial area, they look at the safety standards for that industry, including Federal and State regulations.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "Well, I think that, in fact, would be an application of the Good Samaritan doctrine, Justice Ginsburg. In other words, I think you're referring to the first part of the -- we have an -- we believe we have an argument. And the Daggett case, which we cite, addresses whether -- I think this is an open question in Arizona law under their interpretation of the Good Samaritan doctrine -- whether someone in the position of the United States here is -- has undertaken to render services to another. Because that's the argument to which you're referring, I believe. And we think there is an argument that we are not rendering services to another. But that is not the same as saying that the Good Samaritan doctrine -- that is an application of the Good Samaritan doctrine. In other words, courts, when they -- these are all factors that take into account whether someone will have a duty, pursuant to the Good Samaritan doctrine -- one of the services to another. Another factor, which we think is also relevant here, is whether or not the injured party of Arizona, as a public-policy matter, has decided to create broader, actionable tort duties on its own governmental employees, and to expose itself and open its own coffers to -- when -- to claims when its employees have injured its citizens. But that is not the same law that they apply to private persons, and we know that from the Daggett case, which we discuss -- I believe it's on page 6 of our reply brief. In the Daggett case, that was a case involving an inspection by a county of a swimming recreation area, pursuant to mandatory State and county regulations that required such inspections. The Arizona Court of Appeals there held that there was a duty by the county to a person who had -- who dove into the swimming pool and was injured as a result of hitting the bottom, that there was an actionable duty running against the county there as a matter of the State of Arizona's decision to create tort duties when its employees and governmental entities violate mandatory obligations or perform them negligently."

That -- a point of interest in that case is that in that case, the State -- because Arizona is a pure comparative-negligence State -- alleged that the Federal mine inspector was partially at fault and that, therefore, Mr. Olson and Mr. Vargas' damages should be reduced, just as, in our case, if we had proceeded beyond the motion-to-dismiss phase, we could have anticipated, as is common, that the Federal Government would have identified the State of Arizona and the mine operator to be non-parties at fault, as well, so that those individuals -- the negligence of those individuals would reduce the plaintiff's damages against the Federal  Government."

So, the Ninth Circuit was essentially asked a hypothetical question by the Federal Tort Claim, and it was asked to resolve that question on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which the standard is, of course, that we can set -- we can prove no facts which would -- which would establish a cause of action. And what the court really did, because the court applied a body of law -- the Ninth Circuit -- that began with the Louie doctrine -- is, the court looked at Arizona mine- inspector law as a predictor to what Arizona private- person law would be. And from Justice Roberts' questions about police officers, in the Louie case, the State of Washington, like the State of Arizona, had waived sovereign immunity."

And the D.C. Circuit found, no, it would follow Louie and Crider, and say that the best predictor of the State law, when you can't find an analogous private person, is the liability statutes that concern the law enforcement, but, following Indian Towing, it would not apply the gross-negligence standard that the D.C.

The other extreme, you have the Ninth Circuit, which could -- which says as long as the Government was involved in regulation, there is no analogous private person, because private people don't regulate.

And the case I would refer to is Martinez versus State, which is simply a case where a road washes out, and the Government reroutes the road for a -- for a period of time across a private land, and, for a period of time, grades it, and then stops grading it. And, in that circumstance, the Government was held liable simply for having, for that period of the time, assumed a duty. And there wasn't an analysis in the Martinez case of whether or not the elements of section 324(a) were met or not."

And, to the extent that that's at issue, Your Honor, I would think that that would be a question, under State law, of whether the Government had assumed the duty. And if not under State law, it would be a question under the Federal Tort Claim of whether an -- there is an exception that has been met. And there is no exception. I think that this Court, in Berkovitz, said that regulatory conduct can be actionable under the Federal Tort Claim if it -- the discretion isn't met -- or the discretionary exception isn't met. And in this case there was an absolute obligation to make these inspections and an absolute failure to do so."

Just to be clear, Justice Scalia, the point that I was making is, the only private-person law to which respondents pointed below was that of the Good Samaritan doctrine. That -- whether or not respondents can make out a claim under the Good Samaritan doctrine would require meeting all of the elements of that doctrine. That would be primarily a State-law question, but we do think there's an ingredient of a Federal question there, especially, for example, in deciding whether or not they reasonably and detrimentally relied. Other courts of appeals, including the Sixth Circuit, in Myers and Raymer, have said that the language of the Mine Act is relevant to whether or not a party can simply rely on the very -- just the bare existence of the MSHA -- of MSHA's existence and its inspections, and held that, given the language in the Mine Act that expressly leaves the safety of the mine to the -- primarily to the mine operators through the assistance of the miners, that it would be unreasonable to rely. Here, it -- this was completely appropriately decided by the district court on a motion to dismiss, because they came forward with affidavits that say nothing more than that they relied upon the existence of the MSHA scheme.
