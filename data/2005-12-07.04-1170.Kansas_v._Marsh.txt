5 General Kline.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8 MR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 This Court has never held that a specific

11 structure for weighing aggravating and mitigating

12 factors is required by the eighth amendment. Yet, this

13 Court has consistently held that all that is required

14 by the eighth amendment is for States to afford an

15 opportunity to jurors to consider all mitigating

16 evidence relevant to determination of a sentence other

17 than death.

18 The Kansas statute, it is undisputed in this

19 case, allowed the respondent to introduce all such

20 evidence and that the jurors, under Kansas law, are

21 specifically instructed to consider all such mitigating

22 evidence on an individualized basis.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: General, may -- may I -- I'd

24 like to pose a question which at least gets to the nub

25 of the issue, as I see it, and -- and get your response

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to it.

2 The premise of my question is this. We -- we

3 generally regard mitigation evidence as favoring life,

4 aggravation evidence as favoring death. We've got a

5 case in which the -- the assumption is that they are

6 evenly balanced. The -- the pans of the scale are

7 exactly even on that. Kansas says in that case the

8 jury shall return the verdict of death.

9 If we are going to demand, as we have said

10 that we're going to demand, that the determination --

11 that the death penalty determination be one of

12 what we have called reasoned moral judgment, then what

13 has to be supplied in order to make the Kansas

14 provision consistent with reasoned moral justice, it

15 seems to me, is a presumption in favor of death. Other

16 things being equal, there is a presumption in favor of

17 death.

18 And my question is, am I correct in saying

19 that in order to hold your way, we have to hold that

20 the eighth amendment -- is consistent with the

21 eighth amendment to presume the appropriateness of

22 death, other things being equal?

23 MR. KLINE: As the Court -- yes. As the

24 Court has done in Walton, the standard in the --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you agree that's --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that's a proper way to look at the issue then.

2 MR. KLINE: Well, to take the issue in its

3 total context and refer to the instructions and the

4 totality of what the jury is instructed, I would

5 disagree that there is a presumption of death --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then how do you get off the

7 dime?

8 MR. KLINE: The jury is given in the

9 instruction, instruction number 4 and instruction

10 number 5, a direction as to the effect of their

11 reasoned moral judgment.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the -- the

13 direction, as I understand it, is that if mitigation

14 and aggravation are even, then the only way to come to

15 a conclusion is to say, as the statute does, because

16 the mitigation does not outweigh the aggravation, you

17 should return a verdict of death. And that seems to me

18 another way of saying there is a presumption that if

19 aggravation and mitigation are equal, that the penalty

20 should be death.

21 MR. KLINE: Instruction number 5 does

22 instruct the juror, Justice Souter, that if the State

23 meets the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt

24 that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the

25 aggravating factors, then the jury shall sentence the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 defendant to death.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: The State has made a

3 judgment that this particular offense -- what's it

4 called? Aggravated murder, you know, whatever --

5 MR. KLINE: First, they have to be convicted,

6 Justice Scalia, of capital murder.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Capital murder, as its name

8 implies, warrants a judgment of death unless there are

9 mitigating factors that -- which indicate that that is

10 not proper.

11 MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Scalia.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a moral judgment,

13 isn't it?

14 MR. KLINE: That certainly is, and --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And even if the State had

16 said the opposite, it -- it is a -- still a State-

17 prescribed moral judgment. If the State had said

18 capital murder warrants a judgment of death only if the

19 mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors,

20 that's still a State-prescribed moral judgment, isn't

21 it?

22 MR. KLINE: That is correct.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: And can -- can you go back

24 to Justice Souter's question for a minute? Because the

25 way I'm thinking about this, I'm making two assumptions

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that I'd like you to make: first, that there could be

2 such a case, which I very much doubt, but -- but this

3 is a lawyer's hypothetical, this whole thing, in a

4 sense. But I'll make the assumption there could be

5 such a case. Second, I will assume that our case law

6 leaves this open, a matter that can be argued.

7 But suppose that we do make that assumption

8 for the moment. Then what I'm thinking of is this

9 made-up case is the case of the following. We have

10 aggravating factors and break them down into molecules

11 on a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here,

12 there is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the

13 juror who is very conscientious ends up with the same

14 number of molecules of equal weight on this scale. And

15 in our made-up instance, Kansas says, if that's the

16 situation, you must say death.

17 Now, if that's the case, how would you

18 reconcile that with a view of the eighth amendment that

19 says if you're going to sentence someone to death,

20 there has to be something special about his case that

21 means it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case

22 because, after all, for every molecule of specialness

23 that warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation

24 that doesn't?

25 So that's where I am, trying to get the cases

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 out of it and trying to take very seriously the

2 hypothetical that is before us.

3 MR. KLINE: There -- thank you, Justice

4 Breyer. There are several considerations and steps

5 that must be approached and proven by the State before

6 we get to that actual equation.

7 First of all, the State follows the guided

8 discretion standard of this Court, as laid out in

9 Furman and its progeny, to a very narrow definition of

10 what capital murder is. In fact, the Kansas death

11 penalty statute is one of the most narrow in the

12 Nation.

13 And then past that point to the sentencing

14 jury, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at

15 least one of eight specific aggravating factors exist

16 with jury unanimity.

17 And then past that point, Kansas has complied

18 with this Court's requirement under the eighth

19 amendment for a juror to consider and give effect to

20 all mitigating evidence relevant to a sentence other

21 than death and that instruction is specifically pointed

22 out in your appendix, pages 23 through 28.

23 Furthermore, the jurors are --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Furman -- the --

25 it's hard to tell where the voice is coming from, I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 know. We ought to get that fixed.

2 (Laughter.)

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Furman narrowing is

4 produced by the very first part of subsection (e). If,

5 by a unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable

6 doubt that one or more of the aggravating circumstances

7 enumerated in -- in section 24-4625 and amendments

8 thereto exist -- that's the Furman.

9 MR. KLINE: That is correct, and --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then beyond that you say

11 if that is found, then the jury has to find that the

12 existence of such aggravating does not outweigh.

13 MR. KLINE: That is correct. And that --

14 that is how it complies with your hypothetical, Justice

15 Breyer.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you see, my

17 hypothetical is designed to cut free of the language of

18 the cases. I have no doubt you can go through the

19 language and show that. And it's designed to say, but

20 the very point of those cases is you do not send

21 someone to death unless the jury decides that the

22 circumstances here make him somewhat worse, at least

23 one molecule worth of worse, than the typical person.

24 And given the evenness of the balance, I don't see how

25 we can say that, though I grant you, when you go back

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to those words in the cases, you're right.

2 MR. KLINE: Well, the guided discretion of

3 this Court has indicated that the State must be able to

4 -- and a juror -- differentiate between a defendant who

5 is convicted of the same crime as to the -- and

6 sentenced to life as the defendant who is sentenced to

7 the same crime and sentenced to death. And that is

8 laid out, as Justice Scalia pointed out, in the

9 definition of capital murder and the requirement of

10 aggravated factors.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the -- the

12 instructions don't tell the jury to weigh the

13 molecules. They tell the jury that the State has to

14 prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating

15 molecules do not outweigh the aggravating molecules.

16 MR. KLINE: That is correct.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how likely is it,

18 if you have a jury who thinks the -- a juror, who

19 thinks the molecules are precisely balanced, is going

20 to conclude that the State has carried its burden of

21 proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the 50 here

22 don't outweigh the 50 here?

23 MR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a theoretical

25 proposition --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, we are dealing

2 with a hypothetical that we believe does not exist in

3 jury deliberations. A juror steps back and decides

4 whether they can live with the decision that is before

5 them and then decides whether the death penalty is

6 warranted.

7 And in fact, Kansas law leads them to that

8 reasoned moral decision. In Kansas law, in instruction

9 number 4, which again is laid out in your appendix,

10 instructs the juror that mercy, in and of itself, is

11 sufficient to determine a sentence other than death.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask -- ask you

13 this. As a -- rather than presumptions, can we look at

14 this case as a matter of shifting burdens of proof? I

15 -- I take it the Constitution does not require the

16 State to introduce mitigating evidence. That's --

17 that's the responsibility of the accused.

18 MR. KLINE: That is correct.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so what we're saying

20 here is that when a State shows that the mitigators do

21 not outweigh the aggravators, then it's the

22 defendant's/accused's burden to go forward and show

23 that they do.

24 MR. KLINE: Except -- you're correct, Justice

25 Kennedy, except that the burden on the State is beyond

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a reasonable doubt to demonstrate that, the highest

2 burden allowed by law. And beyond that burden that was

3 in the Arizona statute, which was functionally

4 identical to the Kansas law, that was presented in this

5 -- to this Court in Walton v. Arizona, and this Court

6 rejected that very argument in that case. As you may

7 recall, the Arizona law was that there was a

8 responsibility for the defendant to demonstrate that

9 mitigating factors were sufficiently substantial to

10 call for leniency. The Arizona Supreme Court had

11 decided that that meant that the mitigating factors

12 must outweigh the aggravating factors.

13 And this Court accepted that case because of

14 a conflict between the ninth circuit which held, as the

15 Kansas Supreme Court did, in Adamson v. Ricketts, that

16 that was an unconstitutional violation of the eighth

17 amendment.

18 This Court resolved that conflict, and in

19 fact, States relied on that resolution, as did the

20 Kansas legislature, in articulating the very standard

21 except Kansas goes further and keeps the burden on the

22 State.

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. In Arizona, the

24 burden was placed on the defendant, was it not --

25 MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 O'Connor.

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- to -- to prove the

3 mitigation? And yet, the Court upheld that even in the

4 equipoise situation.

5 MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice

6 O'Connor.

7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Over a dissent.

8 MR. KLINE: Correct. Justice Blackmun's

9 dissent.

10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So Kansas does not put the

11 burden on the defendant.

12 MR. KLINE: Not at any stage of the

13 proceeding. The burden remains on the State to prove

14 beyond a reasonable doubt.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but I take it

16 the State has no duty to adduce mitigating factors.

17 MR. KLINE: It is incumbent upon the

18 defendant, Justice Kennedy, to bring forth factors in

19 mitigation. The standard, though, in introduction is

20 relevancy, and Kansas has met the -- the requirements

21 of this Court, as it relates to the specific sentencing

22 or individualized sentencing structure, by allowing the

23 jury to consider all evidence relevant to the

24 determination of a sentence other than death.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that means they

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 comply with Lockett.

2 I want to ask you one question that goes back

3 to your colloquy with Justice Souter and Justice

4 Scalia. Justice Scalia pointed out that the State has

5 made a moral judgment on a certain state of facts, the

6 death penalty shall be imposed and which you agreed

7 with. And that was true in the cases back in 1975 and

8 6. There were some State statutes that mandated death

9 based on the moral judgment of the State in certain

10 circumstances. I think one was a North Carolina

11 statute.

12 Do you ask us to reexamine those cases?

13 MR. KLINE: No, Justice Stevens. Actually

14 the State's position is consistent with the previous

15 decisions of this Court in this fashion.

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: It -- it does not rely on

17 the proposition that there's a situation in which

18 there's a mandated death penalty which is perfectly

19 okay.

20 MR. KLINE: No, because there is a

21 requirement upon the State in the sentencing phase to

22 prove factors in aggravation with jury unanimity beyond

23 a reasonable doubt that set aside this particular act

24 in a different framework than those who commit capital

25 murder and are convicted of capital murder. If the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 State does not meet that burden --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but of course, the

3 aggravators -- it would be permissible for a State to

4 include the aggravators necessary to narrow the category

5 in the definition of the crime itself.

6 MR. KLINE: This Court has held that it does.

7 And Kansas has a very narrow death penalty in the

8 definition of capital murder and also the specified

9 aggravators that the State must prove.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you would say that if

11 the State met that burden and there was no mitigating

12 or no substantial mitigating evidence, it would be

13 permissible to -- for the State to mandate the death

14 penalty.

15 MR. KLINE: Just as it is in Walton v.

16 Arizona.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: The answer is yes.

18 MR. KLINE: Yes. The answer is yes, Justice

19 Stevens.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you think that's fully

21 consistent with the North Carolina case.

22 MR. KLINE: It is not fully consistent, I

23 don't believe. It is consistent with the Walton case

24 in that this Court said a mandatory death penalty is

25 not unconstitutional, as long as the State

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 differentiates between those convicted of the same

2 crime and who are sentenced to life and those who are

3 convicted of the same crime and sentenced to death.

4 Kansas clearly does that in the requirement that the

5 State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one of at

6 least eight specific statutory aggravating factors

7 exist in the case.

8 But Kansas goes further. Unlike in Walton v.

9 Arizona, the burden remains on the State to also prove

10 that the mitigating evidence proffered by the defendant

11 who has the lowest threshold allowed by law, and all

12 that is required by this Court -- that is relevancy --

13 that all of that evidence does not outweigh --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it -- that's the way

15 Justice Blackmun interpreted the majority, but the

16 majority didn't quite say that because it said the

17 burden on the defendant was to prove sufficient

18 mitigation to justify something other than the death

19 penalty. And conceivably one could have met that

20 burden with substantial mitigating evidence that came

21 out even.

22 MR. KLINE: Well, the --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Under the majority's

24 opinion -- now, you're dead right about what Justice

25 Blackmun said, but --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KLINE: Justice Stevens, you are correct.

2 The majority didn't specifically address that, but

3 they also analyzed the case, much as Justice Kennedy

4 just did, in saying that really what we're talking

5 about is whether the State eventually at some point,

6 once it has met the requirement of the individualized

7 sentencing requirements of this Court, can say that

8 death is appropriate. And the answer in this Court's

9 jurisprudence has been clearly yes once we are able to

10 set aside this defendant from other defendants

11 convicted of the same crime.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you would agree that it

13 would be consistent with the -- the text of the

14 majority opinion to say it really meant they have to

15 prove enough mitigating evidence to make death the

16 inappropriate sentence, which could be less than --

17 even a 50/50 balance?

18 MR. KLINE: Arguably, yes, Justice Stevens.

19 And that is the language of the Arizona statute, but it

20 would fly in the face of the interpretation of the

21 Arizona Supreme Court, as well as the Ninth Circuit

22 Court of Appeals in Adamson v. Ricketts which,

23 subsequent to the Walton decision, held that Walton

24 controlled and allowed the potentiality of equipoise to

25 be constitutional.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Now, one thing I would like to --

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to address

3 the other questions? I think we added a question

4 about whether the Kansas Supreme Court's judgment was

5 adequately supported by an independent State ground.

6 And I'm not sure that this has been adequately

7 addressed.

8 Do we have jurisdiction here? The -- the

9 Kansas Supreme Court vacated the capital murder

10 judgment and remanded it and said it would have done it

11 anyway because of the State law evidentiary error

12 concerning admission of third party guilt evidence. So

13 does that independent ground mean we don't have

14 jurisdiction here on this thing?

15 MR. KLINE: No, Justice O'Connor, there is

16 not an independent and adequate State ground for this

17 decision. It is undisputed that the Kansas Supreme

18 Court relies on this Court's interpretation of the

19 eighth amendment for the interpretation of the cruel or

20 unusual punishment clause of the Kansas constitution.

21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there was another

22 ground.

23 MR. KLINE: Yes, but it is not adequate and

24 independent. The argument of the respondent is that

25 the constitutional savings doctrine and severability

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 arguments are independent and adequate, and by their

2 very nature, they are dependent rather than

3 independent.

4 The Kansas Supreme Court engaged in a -- and

5 I quote from the decision -- a full reexamination of

6 the eighth amendment jurisprudence in coming to the

7 conclusion in paragraph 25 of the syllabus, which is

8 the law of the case in Kansas under Kansas law, that

9 the Kansas death penalty statute is unconstitutional on

10 its face. That was the first such holding in Kansas

11 jurisprudence history finding that determination.

12 Previously, 3 years earlier, the court had

13 found the death penalty statute constitutional as

14 construed, and as this Court knows, you will not accept

15 jurisdiction of a State court's interpretation or

16 construction of a State law. So, therefore, this is

17 the first opportunity that the State has had and I

18 would say the last.

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but was this -- was

20 this case remanded for a new trial?

21 MR. KLINE: It is, Your Honor.

22 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And presumably, if there

23 is a conviction and a sentence, you could come back

24 here again by way of a cross appeal.

25 MR. KLINE: That would be incorrect, Justice

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 O'Connor. Kansas is prohibited. The prosecutors are

2 prohibited and limited of the right of appeal in Kansas

3 law as in most States.

4 And -- and this Court had a similar case in

5 Neville v. South Dakota in which you construed South

6 Dakota law as it relates to limiting the prosecution's

7 ability to appeal and, through that construction,

8 identified in an interlocutory basis, when the lower

9 court passes on a constitutional measure that has

10 import for this Court, that the inability of the State

11 to be able to pursue that case renders jurisdiction

12 under 28, section 1257. So --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If I -- if I understand

14 what the situation is, there is no death penalty in

15 Kansas as a result of this decision.

16 MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice

17 Ginsburg. There is no death penalty. The highest

18 court of our State has spoken and stricken it down as

19 unconstitutional on its face.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Has there been any

21 movement in the legislature to change the law so you

22 won't be in this situation where there is no death

23 penalty?

24 MR. KLINE: Justice Ginsburg, there's

25 significant discussion in the legislature, but that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 discussion is somewhat mixed, as you might imagine, and

2 some were concerned that action might moot this case.

3 Right now there are 12 pending capital murder cases in

4 Kansas which, if this Court does not reverse the Kansas

5 Supreme Court, the State will not be able to seek

6 capital murder charges and the death sentence in those

7 cases.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that wouldn't be true

9 if you amended the statute though, would it? If you -- if

10 they amended the statute to take the 50/50 problem out

11 of it, which wouldn't seem to me all that difficult,

12 you could still impose the death penalty on these other

13 12 people who haven't been tried.

14 MR. KLINE: It is our position, Justice

15 Stevens, since their crimes were committed prior to any

16 act of the legislature, we would be prohibited from

17 seeking the death penalty.

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because of an ameliorating

19 amendment to the death penalty statute?

20 MR. KLINE: That is -- that is our -- our

21 position. It would have to take an entire --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: I doubt if you'd take that

23 position if they did it.

24 (Laughter.)

25 MR. KLINE: Well, Justice Stevens, if you put

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 me in that position, I will be an advocate for the

2 State.

3 However, it is our position, as Justice

4 Ginsburg alluded to, that the State has no death

5 penalty and it would take a complete reenactment of the

6 death penalty for the State to have one.

7 And that is borne out in case law. There is

8 no uncertainty as it relates to the ability of the

9 State to seek appeal in charging death once there is no

10 death statute that is available. The references in

11 Kansas law to KSA section 22-3602(b) are a very settled

12 area of the law. The respondent argues that subsection

13 (1) of that statute would allow us an opportunity to

14 preserve this issue below. However, that only relates

15 to the State being able to appeal charging documents,

16 and the definitions of those documents are very

17 specific in Kansas law.

18 Furthermore, subsection (3) states that a

19 prosecutor can reserve an issue, but case law is very

20 clear, and that is only if the Kansas Supreme Court

21 sees that issue as important for the administration of

22 justice, the uniform administration of justice, in the

23 State, and has interpreted that to mean only where

24 guidance of the supreme court is necessary. It is not

25 a method for moving for rehearing. The Kansas Supreme

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Court rejects that. We moved for reconsideration and

2 reconsideration was not granted.

3 If this Court embarks, as the respondent asks

4 it to, it will put in jeopardy 12 capital murder cases

5 and prevent 12 capital murder cases from being pursued

6 in Kansas. It will effectively strike down the laws of

7 seven other States that have functionally identical

8 statutes as Kansas.

9 And furthermore, it would effectively call

10 into question the laws of five other States that do not

11 even require any weighing mechanism whatsoever. This

12 Court has never gone further and required a specific

13 mechanism of weighing aggravating and mitigating

14 circumstances and has relegated that duty, as it

15 should, to the States as long as the juror has the

16 opportunity to make the reasoned moral decision based

17 on the consideration of all mitigating evidence

18 relevant to a decision other than death that relates to

19 the character, the background of the defendant, or the

20 circumstances of the offense.

21 And if you would look in your joint appendix

22 on pages 25 and 26, you will see the instructions that

23 the State of Kansas gave in this case, and it is

24 undisputed that the respondent's presentation of

25 mitigating evidence was presented to the jury in full,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and additionally, the jury was specifically instructed

2 to consider and give weight -- I'm sorry. It's pages

3 24 and 25 -- specifically instructed to give weight to

4 all of that evidence. Pages 24 and 25. I am referring

5 to instruction number 4. And you will see the

6 delineation beginning on page 25 of all the mitigating

7 evidence that was admitted as relevant in this case.

8 And I would also say that Kansas continues to

9 bear a greater burden in its consideration -- for the

10 juror's consideration in that the juror is instructed

11 on paragraph 2 of instruction 4 that mercy in and of

12 itself is sufficient -- is sufficient -- to outweigh

13 the aggravating evidence presented by the State. So

14 contrary to the --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: I have no idea what that

16 means. I mean, you -- you go into this very elaborate

17 system, you know, molecules on one side, molecules on

18 the other.

19 (Laughter.)

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then you throw the whole

21 thing up in the air and say mercy alone is enough. I

22 mean --

23 MR. KLINE: Justice Scalia, I think it is --

24 it is default for a life sentence. And I believe it

25 is certainly an acknowledgement that what really

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 happens here is a juror steps back, after the

2 consideration of all the evidence that this Court

3 requires under the eighth amendment, and decides what

4 they can live with: a sentence of death or a sentence

5 of life. And one juror who has doubt can extend mercy.

6 And, Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the

7 Court, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.

9 Ms. Woodman, we'll hear now from you.

10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA E. WOODMAN

11 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12 MS. WOODMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

13 please the Court:

14 I'd like to devote the bulk of my time to

15 answering the State's arguments on the merits because

16 the constitutional issue presented by the Kansas

17 capital sentencing statute is actually quite different

18 than the State and its amici would have it appear.

19 Their arguments rest on an erroneous assumption about

20 the way the statute operates and the real issues that

21 its operation raises.

22 Under the Kansas formula, prosecutors can and

23 do urge jurors not to persevere in their decision-

24 making if they are undecided regarding the balance of

25 aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In other

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 words, if the decision is too hard to make, the

2 sentence must be death. The formula --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is it reasonable

4 to suppose that one of those cases where it's too hard

5 to decide is when there are 50 molecules on one side

6 and 50 on the other? In other words, it would seem to

7 me that that's an easy case to say that the State has

8 not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt

9 that the mitigating factors don't outweigh the

10 aggravating ones when the evidence is evenly balanced.

11 MS. WOODMAN: No, Your Honor. I think that

12 it's not right to think of this in terms of

13 mathematical formulas, molecules on one side or the

14 other. This is a subjective, qualitative determination

15 that the jury makes, and whatever capital sentencing

16 statute a State chooses, States are free to choose

17 whatever structure they see fit to determine whether

18 death is an appropriate sentence. However, States are

19 not free to enact a statute that doesn't ensure a

20 reliable determination that death is an appropriate

21 sentence, and that's what we're dealing with here.

22 It's a qualitative judgment and one can imagine, very

23 easily I think, a scenario where jurors are

24 deliberating. They take their jobs very seriously and

25 they cannot make a determination whether aggravators

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 outweigh mitigators, or vice versa.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because the

3 defendant hasn't introduced enough evidence of

4 mitigation and that's the duty of the defendant to come

5 forward with it.

6 MS. WOODMAN: Well, in -- in a situation of

7 equipoise, by which I mean a state of indecision on

8 whether the relative balance between aggravating and

9 mitigating circumstances, burden of proof is not the

10 sticking point there.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say it's a state

12 of indecision. The jury has decided that aggravating

13 factors have been established.

14 MS. WOODMAN: But that -- that's -- that's

15 the problem because that's not a reliable

16 determination. It's no determination that based upon

17 the individual --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it a reliable

19 determination that, number one, it's a death-qualified

20 accused in -- in any event, and there have been

21 specific aggravators proved? That has been determined.

22 It's now for the defendant, in effect, to show that

23 the mitigating circumstances outweigh this. The -- and

24 you have the bonus that the State has to prove beyond a

25 reasonable doubt that the mitigators have not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 outweighed the aggravators.

2 MS. WOODMAN: But the jury is specifically

3 instructed under this formula that they have a third

4 option, and that is where they can't make a decision,

5 whether aggravators outweigh mitigators, or vice versa

6 --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They have made the

8 decision. They have made the decision that the

9 aggravators are there and have not been outweighed.

10 They have made that decision.

11 MS. WOODMAN: But the jury is required to

12 impose death at that point, and it is a decision that

13 aggravators are not outweighed by mitigators. But this

14 Court's eighth amendment jurisprudence requires --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's because the

16 mitigation case hasn't been made.

17 MS. WOODMAN: The eighth amendment requires

18 jurors to make a determination, based upon individual

19 characteristics, whether death is an appropriate

20 sentence, whether the defendant deserves death. And

21 when the jury is in a situation of equipoise and is

22 required to impose death, they're imposing death

23 without having made that determination that death is an

24 appropriate --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. They're -- they're

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 saying it is appropriate. They're saying it is

2 appropriate. We have the people put in the box. The

3 box is are they in a situation that is different from

4 the average murderer. Yes. And they're making the

5 determination that although they're in that box, that

6 morally they're no different. Morally they're the same

7 --

8 MS. WOODMAN: Well, there's no --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because for every factor

10 that makes them morally one way, there's a factor that

11 makes them morally the other way. So they're

12 different, but they're not morally different.

13 Now, that's -- that's what I think this case

14 presents. And I -- I mean, I imagine a juror who's

15 thinking just what I said. I don't know if there ever

16 was such a juror, but if there was such a juror, the

17 statute in this instant tells him what to do.

18 MS. WOODMAN: The statute does tell them what

19 to do. It tells --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: It says where you think

21 there is an equivalent, but not a moral difference,

22 death.

23 MS. WOODMAN: Well, but if -- if you think --

24 if you look at the prosecutorial arguments, for

25 example, that have been made in both the Kleypas and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Marsh cases, those prosecutorial arguments have urged

2 the jurors to do exactly what I described, and that is

3 to abdicate their decision to make a -- a determination

4 based on the -- on individual characteristics on

5 the question of whether death is an appropriate

6 punishment for this individual offender based on the

7 specific circumstances of this crime, and that if

8 they're in equipoise, they have to impose a death

9 sentence. That is encouraging the jurors to abdicate

10 their decision to determine whether death is an

11 appropriate sentence or not.

12 Then --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. Woodman, you

14 know, I -- I have not, you know, gone along with --

15 with most of our Walton jurisprudence anyway, but --

16 but what I have really always thought it demanded was

17 really nothing more precise than that a jury has to be

18 given the opportunity to grant mercy. I -- I'm not

19 sure I would describe any of it as any more precise

20 than that.

21 MS. WOODMAN: Well --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: The jury has to be given the

23 opportunity to say this poor devil doesn't deserve the

24 death penalty. However you want to put that, you know,

25 you can put the burdens here, the burdens there. You

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 can talk about equipoise or not. Does the jury have a

2 chance to say this -- this fellow does not deserve the

3 death penalty? That --

4 MS. WOODMAN: Well --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and clearly exists

6 under this scheme, it seems to me. Any jury that --

7 that really thinks this person should not go to death

8 can -- can do it. In fact, you know, I guess the

9 statute does not demand that instruction, but that

10 instruction that says -- what is it? The

11 appropriateness of the exercise of mercy can itself be

12 a mitigating factor. I mean, gee, what -- what else --

13 what else do you have to do?

14 MS. WOODMAN: But that's one factor among

15 many that the jury has to consider. And the problem

16 here is that the jury could have all of the information

17 that a defendant has proffered as a basis for a

18 sentence less than death, and a jury could still be

19 unable to decide whether aggravation or mitigation is

20 the weightier in a closely balanced case. And that is

21 the problem here.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any jury that thought this

23 -- this person did not deserve death would have ample

24 opportunity to give expression to that determination

25 under this scheme.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. WOODMAN: Only if they persevere in that

2 decision-making, and prosecutors urge them not to by

3 telling them that they must impose death when they

4 cannot decide the balance between aggravating and

5 mitigating circumstances.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Woodman, you said that

7 they didn't make such an argument in this case and in

8 some other case, but you did not include the argument

9 in the joint appendix, did you?

10 MS. WOODMAN: No, I did -- we did not include

11 the prosecutorial closing arguments. They are in --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- are you -- the

13 -- the argument --

14 MS. WOODMAN: They are in the brief.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is a brief from the

16 Kansas law professors, and this is the instruction from

17 the Kleypas case?

18 MS. WOODMAN: Yes.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the aggravators are not

20 outweighed by the mitigators, you shall impose the

21 death penalty, not that you may, not that you can, but

22 that you shall impose the death penalty. This is the

23 duty you were sworn to uphold. Shows command. It

24 means must. That's -- is that the type of instruction

25 --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. WOODMAN: That's correct.

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the type of argument?

3 MS. WOODMAN: That's correct, and then in Mr.

4 Marsh's case, which is part of the record in this case

5 -- and I've cited to the record for that argument,

6 which is at -- I apologize. It's at volume 54 at pages

7 54 and 55 of the record of the Kansas Supreme Court in

8 the Marsh case. And in that case, the prosecutorial

9 arguments told the jury that they can't even consider

10 mitigating evidence unless they find that mitigating

11 circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances

12 because the law has told you and the judge has told you

13 that the law says that if the aggravating circumstances

14 are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, you

15 shall return a verdict of death.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: And therefore, they

17 shouldn't consider mitigating at all, he told them?

18 MS. WOODMAN: No. This is not a question of

19 not being able to consider mitigating circumstances.

20 And as I said --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is this mercy

22 instruction always given? Is that standard? Is it --

23 is it, in effect, that -- that mercy is -- is always

24 one of the mitigating circumstances?

25 MS. WOODMAN: Yes. That's part of the jury

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 instructions in capital cases.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I -- I really don't see

3 what -- what complaint you have then. Any jury that --

4 that thinks this person deserves mercy says, I think he

5 deserves mercy, and that's -- that's a -- a mitigating

6 circumstance that outweighs whatever aggravating

7 circumstances there are.

8 MS. WOODMAN: But when you think about the

9 difficulty of the individualized sentencing decision

10 that the jury has to make, the -- one juror might feel

11 that way, but it's only if they persevere in that

12 decisionmaking. This statutory equipoise provision

13 encourages jurors not to persevere in their

14 decisionmaking. They're -- they're sitting around in

15 the jury room. One juror --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is the

17 statutory equipoise provision?

18 MS. WOODMAN: It says that if the jury finds

19 the existence of at least one aggravating factor and

20 determines further that any aggravating circumstances

21 that exist are not outweighed by any mitigating

22 circumstances found to exist, the sentence shall be

23 death.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's my

25 question. There is no --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: If the State is --

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is no statutory

3 equipoise provision. The State has a burden of proof

4 to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating

5 factors don't outweigh the aggravating. That's what

6 you mean by the statutory equipoise provision?

7 MS. WOODMAN: The statutory equipoise

8 provision, as the Kansas Supreme Court found -- they

9 construed this statute. They construed it to mean that

10 it requires death when jurors are undecided about the

11 balance between aggravating and mitigating

12 circumstances. That construction of the statute is

13 entitled to respect. And under --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Who said that? Excuse me.

15 That -- that description of the statute.

16 MS. WOODMAN: The Kansas Supreme Court in the

17 Kleypas case in holding it unconstitutional.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it seems to me the

19 statute doesn't really say that, does it? But I mean,

20 what the statute says is that if it's in perfect

21 equipoise, the State loses because the State has the

22 burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the --

23 that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators.

24 It seems to me if a jury sees them in perfect

25 equipoise, the jury would have to say the State has not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do

2 not outweigh the aggravators. What -- isn't that what a

3 jury would have to say?

4 MS. WOODMAN: No. Under the statute, the

5 State's burden of proof, which is beyond a reasonable

6 doubt -- I'll grant that, but it's to prove beyond a

7 reasonable doubt that the aggravators are not

8 outweighed by the mitigators.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. Okay. And --

10 and if the jury cannot decide whether the aggravators

11 are outweighed by the mitigators, if they're in perfect

12 equipoise, who loses?

13 MS. WOODMAN: The defendant.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. The State loses. It's

15 the State that has the burden of proving beyond a

16 reasonable doubt that they are --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the Kansas Supreme

18 Court thought that --

19 MS. WOODMAN: The Kansas Supreme Court

20 construed it to mean that a tie goes to the -- to the

21 State.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: That's different from saying

23 not decided. I thought the Kansas Supreme Court didn't

24 speak of not decided. I thought it didn't speak in

25 Kleypas about a jury who -- a juror who can't make up

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 its -- his mind. I thought it said the jury has made

2 -- it assumed the juror has made up his mind. That's

3 why I think it's artificial. It says where the jury

4 finds. It finds equipoise as to the mitigating and

5 aggravating circumstance, then death, that the jury has

6 to find that.

7 MS. WOODMAN: But this is not about

8 structuring decisionmaking. This is about terminating

9 decisionmaking on the issue that is central to the

10 eighth amendment requirements at the selection stage --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's terminating it

12 because there's not enough mitigating evidence.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true I -- I think,

14 isn't it?

15 And then the question is, does a State have a

16 right not to do with burden of proof, not to do with

17 anything else, but to have perhaps the artificial

18 situation where the jury finds that the evidence is in

19 equipoise whoever has the burden of proof. Put it all

20 on you, whoever had it. That was their final

21 conclusion. I find it is in equipoise.

22 Next question: what happens?

23 MS. WOODMAN: Well, the statute hasn't

24 assigned a burden of proof, but still that's not the

25 problem here.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I agree with you.

2 That's not the problem.

3 MS. WOODMAN: Because what the

4 individualization requirement means, in this Court's

5 own jurisprudence, is that mere consideration of

6 mitigating circumstances is not enough. The Court said

7 so in Tennard and in many other cases, Penry v.

8 Johnson, that it's not enough that the sentencer be

9 allowed to consider mitigating circumstances. It must

10 be allowed to consider and give effect to those

11 mitigating circumstances.

12 And when a jury cannot decide between

13 aggravating and mitigating circumstances, when that

14 jury is, nevertheless, required under this -- that

15 situation to impose a sentence of death, the sentence

16 of death has been imposed without the jury having made

17 the requisite individualized sentencing decision under

18 the eighth amendment at the selection stage.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: I might point out -- I just

20 looked at the question presented. It does assume --

21 and I guess is drafted by the Kansas Attorney General.

22 The question is what happens when mitigating and

23 aggravating evidence is in equipoise. So the

24 assumption on which we took the case is that there will

25 be cases in which there's equipoise.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. WOODMAN: That's right. And the Kansas

2 Supreme Court found that that was a real possibility.

3 And the Kansas Supreme Court found this statute

4 unconstitutional in Kleypas because it violates the

5 individualized sentencing requirement, and the court

6 specifically found that it requires death when jurors

7 are unable to decide the balance between aggravating

8 and mitigating circumstances. That's how the statute

9 was construed in Kleypas.

10 I would like to address the jurisdictional

11 issue for a few moments, unless there are any further

12 questions from the Court on the equipoise issue, which

13 I'd be happy to answer. But one of the things I want

14 to discuss today is the jurisdictional issue on the

15 adequate and independent State law ground, which this

16 Court asked the parties to brief.

17 I feel that the State misstates the issue

18 there as well because in the Kansas Supreme Court, the

19 State conceded the Federal unconstitutionality of the

20 Kansas equipoise formula, as decided by the court in

21 the Kleypas case 4 years ago, and defended in this case

22 only on the contested State law ground of severability

23 and bypassed raising a Federal question in a motion for

24 a rehearing, which again relied solely on State law

25 severability grounds.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the -- the Attorney

2 General said that the -- the fact that in this

3 particular case the issue was focused on, in effect,

4 sort of remedy, severance, and so on, was dependent

5 upon the assumption about what Federal law required.

6 It was dependent upon the earlier case which so held.

7 So I don't -- and -- and what he seem -- says seems

8 plausible to me. I -- I don't see how we can divorce

9 the judgment here with the earlier judgment, which

10 Kansas -- which the Kansas Supreme Court relied upon

11 here, which was a Federal ground.

12 MS. WOODMAN: Well, it's clear that the

13 Kansas Supreme Court's decision relies on severability

14 as a basis for its decision, and it's true that the

15 Kansas Supreme Court, in doing so, reiterated the

16 Kleypas holding.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: It wouldn't have even raised

18 the issue had it not been for the earlier Federal

19 holding. Isn't that correct?

20 MS. WOODMAN: That's right, but Mr. Marsh

21 raised the issue on State law severability grounds.

22 The State conceded that Mr. Marsh was entitled to have

23 his death sentence vacated because of the

24 unconstitutional equipoise provision.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you -- I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- I take it this is the implication of your position.

2 Do you take this position that in any instance in

3 which a State supreme court decides a case on a Federal

4 -- decides an issue on a Federal ground in case A, and

5 for whatever reason, case A is not brought to this

6 Court for review, that in every subsequent case in the

7 State system, which depends upon State A, the State is

8 totally without the -- or this Court is -- is totally

9 without jurisdiction to review it?

10 MS. WOODMAN: Where the issue has not been

11 pressed by a party in the State court, no, I don't --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how could the issue be

13 pressed? I mean, it had already been decided by the

14 supreme court. I mean, what -- what could the State

15 say to the trial court?

16 MS. WOODMAN: Well, we asked the court to

17 overrule the severability decision in Kleypas. There

18 was absolutely nothing preventing the State from

19 arguing that the constitutional decision in Kleypas

20 should be overruled. Absolutely nothing preventing

21 that.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think this -- you think

23 the State has to challenge as unconstitutional a

24 decision of the State supreme court in -- in the lower

25 court, lower State court.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. WOODMAN: I think that they --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you expect the lower

3 State court to come out on that?

4 MS. WOODMAN: Well, but futility is never a

5 reason for not raising an issue. Criminal defendants

6 are required to raise issues all the time in order to

7 preserve them for later review. In Engle v. Isaacs,

8 this -- this Court said futility is no excuse. And

9 what is good for criminal defendants, very

10 respectfully, is good for the State. And Justice

11 Rehnquist said as much for the Court in the Court's

12 decision in Illinois v. Gates, that -- that States are

13 not exempt from the ordinary rules of procedure which

14 govern this Court's jurisdiction.

15 And the fact of the matter is that the State

16 not only did not raise the Federal issue in the Kansas

17 Supreme Court below, which it could have, but it

18 conceded the Federal unconstitutionality of the

19 statute.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a little different

21 from an adequate and independent State ground argument.

22 You're -- you're now making a -- a waiver argument.

23 MS. WOODMAN: Well, there's a -- there's a

24 relationship between the adequate and independent State

25 law cases and the not pressed or passed upon cases

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 because, for example, in Michigan v. Long, this Court

2 has said where an issue is pressed -- a Federal issue

3 is pressed in the State courts, then this Court on

4 review will resolve any ambiguity in the Court's

5 opinion in favor of a presumption that the issue was

6 passed upon by the State court.

7 But conversely, in Coleman v. Thompson, this

8 Court held that where an issue is not pressed in the

9 State courts, then the presumption will be the

10 opposite. The presumption will be that the State court

11 has not passed upon --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we don't need a

13 presumption here. I mean, the -- the only basis for

14 inquiring into severability is the presumed

15 unconstitutionality of the statute. I mean, that's the

16 only basis why severability comes up. We don't have to

17 presume anything.

18 MS. WOODMAN: But the Kansas Supreme Court

19 didn't redecide that issue in the Marsh case.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't matter whether it

21 redecided it. It -- it was the postulate of -- of its

22 -- necessary postulate of -- of its decision in this

23 case, it seems to me.

24 MS. WOODMAN: There -- well, under article

25 III and under section 1257(a), there has to be a case

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 or controversy for this Court to review. There was no

2 live case or controversy in the Kansas Supreme Court on

3 the Federal question of whether the equipoise provision

4 in the Kansas statute was constitutional. It was

5 conceded that it was unconstitutional and the parties

6 agreed on that. It was treated as settled. And all

7 the Kansas Supreme Court did, before overruling the

8 Kleypas severability decision, which is a matter of

9 State law, was to reiterate that holding, and mere

10 reiteration, as this Court knows from the Morrison v.

11 Watson case, approved in Illinois v. Gates, that is not

12 the decision of a Federal question.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: If you're -- if you're

14 right, I take it, we would not have jurisdiction to

15 review a Federal ground that was raised by a State

16 court, even though it had not been raised by the

17 parties. If they get -- you know, they get the opinion

18 from the court and there's a big surprise -- the -- the

19 State court decided to go off on -- on a Federal

20 ground, which had not been pressed -- I take it on your

21 view we would not have jurisdiction to review that.

22 MS. WOODMAN: I don't believe the Court

23 would, and I think that's what the Court's original

24 jurisdictional rules were intended to be.

25 Now, I do understand that the Court has taken

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jurisdiction over such issues, and it's usually --

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because

3 the -- the formula is that the issue has to either have

4 been raised or decided.

5 MS. WOODMAN: Well, the only issue that I

6 could find that says that -- that really enforces that

7 rule is the Cohen v. Cowles Media case. And if you

8 look at the provenance of that decision, that's the

9 only case where the Court actually considered a

10 question for the first time in -- in this Court. And

11 what happened in that case is that the Federal issue

12 that was presented to this Court was actually discussed

13 at oral argument. It wasn't raised by either of the

14 parties in their briefs in the State court, but it was

15 discussed at oral argument. And the Court decided a

16 first amendment issue on the basis of that discussion

17 at oral argument. And so this Court took jurisdiction

18 and stated that as long as it's been passed upon, it's

19 not necessary that it was pressed upon.

20 And the decision, which the Court relied on

21 in that case is, if I'm remembering it correctly, was a

22 decision involving a Federal question which was raised

23 too late to comply with the procedural requirements in

24 State court. And so it's really not the case that this

25 Court routinely takes cases where the issue was not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 pressed by the parties in the State courts. And that's

2 the situation we have in this case.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I don't -- I

4 don't -- excuse me. I don't understand how that makes

5 any sense. If you had an -- a -- a case that's

6 litigated entirely on State law grounds and in the

7 State supreme court opinion, they announce we are sua

8 sponte deciding this on the basis of the Federal

9 Constitution and you, State, lose, your argument is

10 that State is just out of luck. They can't seek

11 review of that decision?

12 MS. WOODMAN: I think where the issue is

13 decided sua sponte and affects the parties in that

14 case, then maybe.

15 But that didn't happen here. What happened

16 here was that the court merely reiterated a holding

17 from 4 years ago, and the State law severability

18 decision, which was the issue in contest in this case

19 and the issue that was decided in this case, the

20 matter of State law, and it was sufficient to support

21 the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court.

22 And really, what -- what the State is trying

23 to do here is to -- I mean, these issues were decided

24 in the Kleypas case, and if we were here on the Kleypas

25 case, there wouldn't be any argument as to whether the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Kansas Supreme Court's decision rested on an adequate

2 and independent State law ground because the Federal

3 issue was clearly decided and it was interwoven with

4 the State law determination. But that's not the case

5 here.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Kleypas didn't hold that the

7 whole statute was bad. Kleypas gave a savings

8 construction of the statute, as I recall.

9 MS. WOODMAN: Yes, they did. But the State

10 is misconstruing their decision by saying they didn't

11 decide the constitutional question in Kleypas. It was

12 merely construction of the statute to avoid the

13 constitutional issue and therefore --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but in the case

15 before us, the court -- the Kansas court said -- I

16 think it's 24 or 25 of the -- of the headnote -- we are

17 reconsidering the issue.

18 MS. WOODMAN: The -- that language in the

19 court's opinion was, after full reconsideration, we're

20 declining to revisit the issue at the dissenter's

21 invitation. We're declining that invitation to revisit

22 the issue.

23 And there's no question that the court

24 discussed it and thought about it, and the dissenters

25 were clearly inviting them --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And made a reasoned

2 judgment about it.

3 MS. WOODMAN: But they didn't reopen the

4 issue. They said there's nothing new here. We don't

5 need to reopen this decision, and --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they reopened it to

7 the extent as Justice Scalia has indicated, but they

8 now take a different view of the validity of the State

9 statute.

10 MS. WOODMAN: They're taking a --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's -- that's a decision

12 following a reason, and the reason is a Federal reason.

13 MS. WOODMAN: Well, no, because the -- what

14 they were saying was that the appropriate remedy in

15 Kleypas was to return the subject to the legislature

16 because the statute was ambiguous and the court had no

17 authority, under separation of powers grounds and under

18 State law statutory interpretation grounds, to construe

19 this statute to mean the opposite of what it said. And

20 that's the decision that they overruled in this case,

21 and that's a State law decision.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the State can get

23 mouse-trapped in this way. In -- in the first case, it

24 doesn't take the case up because not too much has been

25 lost, and then in the second case, the court says, oh,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 by the way, everything has been lost. And you say that

2 we can't review that because -- because the -- the

3 State didn't -- didn't challenge Kleypas at the time.

4 MS. WOODMAN: Or challenge that decision in

5 this case.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that decision in

7 this -- they had no reason to challenge it until the

8 State decided to -- to change it.

9 MS. WOODMAN: But if they wanted to raise the

10 issue, they could have raised it in either case, and we

11 wouldn't have this problem here. But they didn't raise

12 it, and that presents a jurisdictional problem for this

13 Court.

14 What they're trying to do in this case is

15 yoke a live horse to a dead one to form a plowing team,

16 and it doesn't work.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I like that.

18 (Laughter.)

19 MS. WOODMAN: I looked -- as a matter of

20 fact, I looked at our Kansas State seal because it has

21 a plowing -- a horse-drawn plow on it, and I looked at

22 it again this morning before I came in here because I

23 couldn't remember whether it was one horse or two, and

24 it's two horses. And I was thinking about how the

25 meaning of that State seal would be fundamentally

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 altered if one of those horses was dead.

2 (Laughter.)

3 MS. WOODMAN: Thank you.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.

5 Woodman.

6 General Kline, you have 4 minutes remaining.

7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE

8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9 MR. KLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

10 may it please the Court:

11 The State is here on a final court decision

12 wrongfully -- the State supreme court wrongfully

13 interpreting this Court's eighth amendment

14 jurisprudence. And just as Justice Souter and the

15 Chief Justice's hypotheticals, as it relates to this

16 case, were articulated, it is actually true that in

17 this case the State was not aware that this issue would

18 be raised again and only conceded -- and waiver is

19 truly not an issue because a lower court did not rely

20 upon it. And we have some confusion between the terms

21 here. It only conceded that Kleypas, a decision by the

22 Kansas Supreme Court, was the law of the case in

23 another case subsequently reaching the Kansas Supreme

24 Court. And the Kansas Supreme Court, on its own

25 motion, engaged in a full reconsideration and the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 respondent in their brief argues that the primary

2 reliance of the court was not on eighth amendment

3 jurisprudence but other grounds.

4 There is no requirement for jurisdiction

5 under 28-1257 that the primary reliance be on a Federal

6 issue. There is a requirement to deny jurisdiction

7 that there be an independent and adequate State ground

8 on which the decision would rest regardless of the

9 outcome of the Federal issue. Clearly that's not the

10 case here.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't they have come out

12 the same way if they never mentioned the Federal issue?

13 MR. KLINE: This case come out -- no, it

14 would not because the Kleypas court found that the

15 Kansas -- or the Kansas death penalty was

16 constitutional as construed. And the Kansas court in

17 this case found it unconstitutional on its face. And

18 there is a significant difference, and the court raised

19 the issue again.

20 I would like to point out to the Court that

21 there are five ways that a juror can, after their

22 reasoned moral decision, give effect to the belief that

23 the mitigating evidence does not warrant the death

24 penalty.

25 The juror can state that they have a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reasonable doubt as to whether the State has met its

2 burden of proving that the mitigating factors do not

3 outweigh the aggravating factors.

4 The juror can simply delay. Kansas law has a

5 defect -- default for life in its sentence or in its

6 structure, and I would encourage you to read on page 28

7 of your appendix instruction number 12 in which the jury

8 is told that if, after a reasonable time, you are unable

9 to make a decision -- in other words, in a doubtful

10 case -- the judge is required by law to dismiss the

11 jury and sentence the defendant to life. And so there

12 is a default for life, and that is another way that a

13 juror can give effect to their reasoned moral decision

14 that death is not appropriate.

15 The juror can give effect to their reasoned

16 moral decision that is not appropriate by determining

17 that the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating

18 factors. And the juror under instruction number 5 --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it cannot do that by

20 determining that they're in equipoise.

21 MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Stevens.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is the very issue

23 your -- your petition presents us with.

24 MR. KLINE: It is, but the juror does know

25 what the effect of that decision is and, therefore, is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 able to engage in a reasoned moral choice.

2 What truly happens -- and -- and Justice

3 Breyer alluded to it, I believe, as it relates to this

4 hypothetical about weighing molecules -- is that a

5 juror essentially steps back and decides what is the

6 appropriate sentence --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: No, do it. Do it.

8 Make the reasoned moral choice. And the facts are that

9 we have, because of the balancing, molecules or not --

10 we have by the balancing made a determination that

11 anything for the bad that distinguishes this person

12 from the ordinary is -- is equally balanced by the

13 good. Now, make the moral choice.

14 MR. KLINE: I think the moral --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the reason?

16 MR. KLINE: I think the moral decision,

17 Justice Breyer, is determined in all the variables of

18 the introduction of the evidence, and as this Court has

19 required under the eighth amendment, that it allow the

20 jury to consider and give effect to all mitigating

21 evidence relevant. And that's in Kansas law.

22 I would state this in closing, and that is

23 that the Kansas legislature reenacted the death penalty

24 for the first time since this Court struck it down in

25 Furman in the spring of 1994. And in doing so, it gave

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 great deference to this Court's role as final arbiter

2 of the meaning of the Constitution. And if you read

3 the instructions and the law that is provided to you in

4 this case, you will see this Court's words mirrored

5 back to you in the scheme of the Kansas law as it

6 relates to the death penalty.

7 Thank you.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General

9 Kline.

10 The case is submitted.
