3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 this morning in Case 14723, Montanile v. The Board of

5 Trustees of the National Elevator Industry Health

6 Benefit Plan.

7             Mr. Stris.

8              ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

9               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10             MR. STRIS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

11 and may it please the Court:

12             In this ERISA case, a fiduciary has sued a

13 beneficiary to establish and enforce an equitable lien

14 by agreement.

15             As this Court has repeatedly acknowledged,

16 an equitable lien is enforceable only against specific

17 property and its traceable product in the defendant's

18 possession.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Stris, there's some

20 fuzziness about the facts in this case, and maybe at the

21 outset you can clarify them.

22             Different figures are given about how much

23 money from this settlement was actually delivered to

24 your client.  And also, what did your client do with it?

25 Did he put it with his general assets, or did he keep it

Alderson Reporting Company

1 in a separate fund?

2             Maybe you can start by answering those

3 questions.

4             MR. STRIS:  I think I can, Justice Ginsburg.

5             So I  I want to start with what's in the

6 record, and then I want to add some color that I think

7 will provide context.

8             So as far as what's in the record, there was

9 a genuine issue of  of material fact on how much

10 dissipation there was.  One thing that's clear from the

11 record is that 

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before we get to

13 dissipation, how much did he receive?

14             MR. STRIS:  Yes.  So that's clear, he

15 received over time, after all expenses were out, about

16 $200,000.

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  200.

18             MR. STRIS:  I think that's clear from the

19 record.

20             What's also clear procedurally  and this

21 is important, and this is Page 64 of the Joint

22 Appendix  is that he took the position in opposing

23 summary judgment that he has very little of the money

24 remaining, and he cited a declaration and an attached

25 sheet that I admit are confusing.

1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And  and this $200,000,

5

2 did he put it in a general account or was it set aside

3 in a specific account?

4             MR. STRIS:  It is nothing in the record to

5 indicate that, but I think as far as the rules work, it

6 wouldn't matter because the rules for equitable lien by

7 agreement, the tracing rules, are actually very robust,

8 Justice Kagan.  And so as equity evolved, you cannot

9 dissipate money by putting it in its own account and

10 spending it.  Something called the "lowest intermediate

11 balance rule" developed to prevent against precisely the

12 kind of mischief that we would reasonably worry about.

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But Mr. Stris, it does

14 make a difference, because if he just put it, say, in

15 the bank account where he had all of his other money,

16 then how  how could we say that he spent all of the

17 proceeds on childcare and living expenses?  If you have

18 one mixed pot, how can we say, oh, yes, this came from

19 the settlement and not from his general funds?

20             MR. STRIS:  It's a very fair question,

21 Justice Ginsburg.  And there  there are settled

22 tracing rules at equity, and it worked as follows:

23             If you took money and it was cash and you

24 put it in a bank account, what was presumed was that,

25 unless your total cash assets dipped below the amount

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 that you got, that the spending that you did was not out 2 of that, the creditor's rights were not impaired. 3             So the only way we would prevail on 4 remand  I want to be clear about the modesty of the 5 position that we're taking here.  The only way we would 6 prevail on remand is if he got the money and he spent it 7 down  all of his money, not just the settlement but 8 all of the cash that he had  down below the  the 9 amount of the settlement. 10             That's why this is very important. 11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what  12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I  I don't 13 know if it's the right Latin phrase or  "pro tanto" or 14 something.  I mean, you would lose  it  it  it 15 doesn't have to spend it all the way down.  Whatever is 16 left would be subject to tracing. 17             MR. STRIS:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's 18 correct.  But the point I was trying to make is, there 19 is a big difference between the way equity worked, which 20 was to have a sensible rule below its intermediate 21 balance, and what I view as the extreme swollen asset 22 theory, that never was applied at equity, that my friend 23 Mr. Katyal is advocating. 24             Under the swollen asset theory, if you get 25 new money in the future, if you spend below the lowest
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
7 1 intermediate balance but then you start earning income, 2 people can come and garnish your wages.  So the  the 3 point that I'm making here is that the equity 4 lienbyagreement remedy is actually far more robust 5 than one would think if one read the briefs of the other 6 side. 7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Equitable lien by 8 agreement. 9             Was there an agreement  do you think 10 there's an agreement here because of the Plan? 11             MR. STRIS:  I think the  that issue, we've 12 lost.  So I mean, you know  I think that's another 13 important point, Justice Kennedy.  We hear a lot about a 14 promisebreaking by beneficiaries.  And that happens. 15 And those are legitimate concerns.  But from where I'm 16 sitting, I see a lot of cases where there's 17 promisebreaking by fiduciaries, where they take a 18 reimbursement provision that's preempted in an insured 19 plan and then try and enforce it, or where they try and 20 enforce a provision that doesn't apply by its own terms. 21             So when we're thinking from the perspective 22 of, is this a sensible rule that is consistent with the 23 broad purposes of ERISA, I think it very much is because 24 if you take the ability of fiduciaries to reach the 25 general assets of participants

1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just as a background

2 matter, when we left, as I understand, Great 

3 GreatWest, we left  left the issue open.  If the

4 beneficiary receives a check that by mistake is three

5 times more than it should be, but he may think it's a

6 bonus, he may not understand; he spends it all.  Is

7 there an  or is there a legal action that the Plan can

8 take to recover that money?

9             MR. STRIS:  Yes.  If  if  if I could not

10 answer it yes or no for a minute, and I promise I'll

11 come back to a yes or no.  I think it's a very important

12 question, because this happens all the time in the

13 pension context.

14             So the first thing I'm going to tell you is

15 that usually when that's the case, there is an error on

16 the part of the Plan.  And our view is even if there

17 were no remedy, that it's not consistent with the

18 purposes of ERISA or the way historical equity practice

19 worked to make the participant the insurer of that type

20 of error.

21             Now, there are remedies, and here's what

22 they are under ERISA.  The first one is a setoff

23 remedy.  And in exception II C of the GreatWest

24 opinion, you  this Court made that very clear.

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  For future payments.

Alderson Reporting Company

9 1             MR. STRIS:  Against future payments.  And  2 and that's used repeatedly in pension and disability 3 cases  4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose that weren't 5 available. 6             MR. STRIS:  Okay.  So if that's not 7 available, if  if you have a case where there's 8 outright fraud  and I don't think that's your  your 9 fact pattern.  But if you have a case where there is 10 outright fraud  and I've seen these, where a 11 participant receives money because they claim that 12 someone is still alive, but they're actually dead, I 13 think that there is a remedy there, because in terms of 14 outright fraud  15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In law. 16             MR. STRIS:  Well, the second prong of Davila 17 wouldn't be satisfied. 18             So ERISA does not  ERISA's broad 19 preemptive sweep does not go so far as to stop plans 20 from policing outright fraud. 21             Now, the more difficult issue is your 22 question  23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right. 24             MR. STRIS:   which is, what if there's not 25 outright fraud?  What is  what is the obligation of

10 1 the beneficiary who gets that check and knows it's three 2 times, you know, what I got, like, this can't be right. 3 You know, if  if the beneficiary is a bad actor and 4 says, you know, I'm going to get one over on the Plan, 5 and I'm going to keep this money, and I'm going to spend 6 it, in the rare case where that person was of limited 7 means and they spent the money down and it was 8 dissipated, I think unfortunately, I would have to say 9 that I  I think a plan would not have a remedy.  But 10 the reality is that's a very rare case. 11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And  and  and because 12 State law, legal remedies are preempted by ERISA? 13             MR. STRIS:  Yes.  That's essentially  14 that's essentially the regime. 15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that a position that's 16 generally accepted, or is this an arguable point? 17             MR. STRIS:  From the perspective of this 18 Court's cases, or  or  19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  Yes. 20             MR. STRIS:  Well, I mean, I think the  the 21 letter of your cases  22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I thought 23 GreatWestern had left that open. 24             MR. STRIS:  Yes.  So I think that's fair. 25 The letter of your cases does not bind  does not bind

11 1 us here.  I'm  I'm not making a pure statutory stare 2 decisis argument, but if  3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm just asking, is there 4 a rule in the courts of appeals, or in the  in the 5 legal system generally, or  or are they divided on 6 this, or just nothing written on it? 7             MR. STRIS:  Well, in the context of ERISA, 8 how you would rule on this case would determine that 9 issue.  And so the  the circuits are split.  That's 10 why I think the issue is very important.  This is not 11 just a subrogation matter.  This is an issue that will 12 have dramatic impact in the pension and the disability 13 context as well. 14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, if  if 15 you prevail here and are representing a fund, what would 16 you advise them to do so they don't confront this result 17 in the future? 18             MR. STRIS:  Yes.  It's  it's  it's a 19 good question.  And I do advise funds.  And I think that 20 there is a simple answer, which is funds that are 21 responsible and sophisticated will do exactly what 22 they've always done.  And this is a very important 23 point:  Funds are always worried about dissipation. 24 Health insurers have always been worried, and here's 25 why.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1             The  the mine run of individuals who get a 2 large tort settlement  this is just a reality of 3 life  they're effectively judgmentproof except for 4 that tort settlement.  So the remedy doesn't matter.  In 5 other words, even if you had a compensatory damages 6 remedy in most cases, once that money is spent, you've 7 got nothing.  So what health insurers and plans have 8 done since well before GreatWest and has continued to 9 do it after GreatWest is, when a medical claim is 10 submitted, they investigate it carefully.  And they look 11 and flag the ones where there is likely a tort  there 12 could be a tort recovery.  They monitor them carefully, 13 either internally or through outside subrogation agents. 14 And they act promptly. 15             And, you know, I'm not going to say it's not 16 a dance, because we see a lot of litigation in this area 17 because there is a lot of money passing through, but 18 plans have faced this problem since before GreatWest. 19 These policy arguments about how this is a concern about 20 dissipation were made in GreatWest.  And I just think 21 they're  they're substantially overrun. 22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you say "they 23 act promptly," what do they act promptly to do?  And is 24 it always the case that they can act promptly enough? 25             MR. STRIS:  No.  The  you know, whatever
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 rule you pick, there will be cases where we don't like 2 the result on both sides.  I can give you examples on 3 the  on the other side as well.  But  4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, presumably in 5 the  in the hypothetical, your  your opposing 6 counsel will be advising the recipient to, I  I 7 suppose, spend it right away, because then there won't 8 be anything left; it will have been dissipated, or put 9 it in different accounts, or  or commingle it with, 10 you  you know, a variety of things.  And I'm just 11 wondering if the solution you're advocating is going to 12 make life a lot more complicated and expensive for the 13 funds, which is, of course, contrary to the idea of 14 preserving the assets. 15             MR. STRIS:  I  I understand that point. 16 I  I think the answer is, no, not in any meaningful 17 way.  And  and here's why.  You ask what you do. 18 Well, you write letters, and you put people on notice of 19 your lien.  And a lot of people are affected by that, 20 lawyers  21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do  how do you put 22 people on notice?  That's a  23             MR. STRIS:  Pardon? 24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's a legal concept. 25 A letter is one thing.  But how  what is  what is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 necessary?  What is the action necessary?  Is it going 2 into court and say, enjoin this person from spending any 3 of that money? 4             MR. STRIS:  Here's what plans do, and here's 5 what plans should do:  They  they write a letter.  The 6 minute they find out there's a settlement, they contact; 7 they ask to be paid.  If they're not paid immediately, 8 they say put this money in escrow because we have a 9 dispute.  If the person says no, you have a pretty good 10 idea that you might have a problem, and you go into 11 court. 12             And this is a perfect example with regard to 13 Mr. Montanile.  There was six months of negotiation, 14 several letters where it was said, hey, if  if you 15 don't  if we don't decide by this date, we're going to 16 distribute the money. 17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How  how do you 18 find  how does the Plan find out that there's been a 19 settlement? 20             MR. STRIS:  Well, they  they find out in 21 many ways.  So a lot of cases actually result  include 22 where there's large dollars amounts, and a lawsuit is 23 actually filed. 24             But in cases where no lawsuit is filed, 25 there's traditional

2 lawsuit between who and whom?

3             MR. STRIS:  A State court lawsuit is filed.

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You mean by the

5 beneficiary to recover 

6             MR. STRIS:  The tort.

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   the tort claim?

8             MR. STRIS:  Yes.

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And how is the Plan

10 notified of that?

11             MR. STRIS:  Well, because of the risks that

12 we're talking about right here in this dialogue, plans

13 are very sensitive to making sure that the minute that

14 there's a potential subrogation recovery, they write

15 letters to everyone:  To the participant, to the

16 participant's lawyer, to the tortfeasor, the

17 tortfeasor's lawyer, the insurer.  And they say we have

18 a lien, and please notify us if anything happens.

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do they, heavily?

20             MR. STRIS:  In some cases they do some; some

21 cases they don't.  That's ultimate 

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But they say they do,

23 anyway?

24             MR. STRIS:  Well, I've  I've seen both.

25 Look, I  I don't actually think it's a pretty

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 controversial point.  There are some people, no matter 2 where they're sitting, that misbehave.  And so I have 3 seen participants who break promises absolutely.  And 4 also, I've seen plans that are trying to enforce 5 provisions that are not enforceable. 6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would it basically, 7 ignoring the impact of that letter by a beneficiary, be 8 a basis for the sort of fraud action you were talking 9 about earlier? 10             MR. STRIS:  No.  I don't think so.  I 11 believe  12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the  the 13 beneficiary, even the beneficiary's counsel gets a 14 letter saying, by the way, we have a lien on this, you 15 know, good luck.  I hope you recover a fair amount.  But 16 if you do, make sure you put it in a separate account. 17 Make sure you notify us. 18             And  and if the beneficiary or the lawyer 19 just ignores that, that's not a basis for fraud? 20             MR. STRIS:  It would depend on the facts of 21 the case.  You know, I  merely ignoring the letter, 22 I'm not so sure.  But I guess I keep coming back to the 23 same point.  This is a legitimate problem.  I don't mean 24 to  to demean that at all, but this has always been a 25 problem.  And because of the fact that most people who
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1 have these moneys are of limited means, the compensatory 2 damages remedy is  is of very little help. 3             And so plans came to this Court in 4 GreatWest and said, oh, well this is going to be a 5 disaster if there's a present possession requirement. 6 And yet, it hasn't proven to be the case because people 7 in their circumstances act promptly, and in most 8 instances, they're able to protect their rights. 9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stris  10             JUSTICE ALITO:  This may be where the law 11 leads us.  But in your brief, you try to make the 12 argument that this is equitable in the ordinary sense of 13 the word.  And I don't understand that.  What sense does 14 all of this make? 15             MR. STRIS:  Okay.  So that's a fair point, 16 but I  I would put it a little bit differently.  What 17 I would say is that I think a fairminded policymaker 18 could certainly pick the rule that we're describing. 19 I'm not going to get up here and tell you that it's the 20 rule that I would pick, but I think a fairminded 21 policymaker could  and particularly, Justice Alito, 22 when you appreciate that it's a rule that's going to 23 apply to all cases, not just subrogation.  I think the 24 case for this as a policy matter becomes much stronger 25 in the pension context.

18 1             The reason I make that point is I know that 2 I'm running up against this counterintuitive view that 3 how can our  how can our position, even if it's what 4 the cases say, even if the unbroken line of history 5 means this, how can it not be totally at odds with 6 the  the core purpose of ERISA?  And I think it's not. 7 It may not be the better policy in your view, but it's 8 certainly one that is consistent with the spirit of 9 ERISA, and so the decision that needs to be made is: 10 What is this line of cases that this Court has decided? 11 What did they say? 12             And I think repeatedly from GreatWest to 13 Sereboff, you reiterated in CIGNA that in nonfiduciary 14 cases, a lien is not equitable relief unless it's 15 against property in the defendant's possession.  You 16 have adopted a historical test. 17             And so unless applying it here is so 18 obviously at odds with the purposes of ERISA, I think 19 that applying that test, the unbroken line of 20 authorities tell us that the rule is you can only 21 enforce these liens against specific property or its 22 traceable product. 23             If I could reserve. 24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 25             Ms. Anders.

1             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS

19

2    ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3                   SUPPORTING PETITIONER

4             MS. ANDERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5 please the Court:

6             If I could just start with Justice Alito's

7 question about what  what sense this framework makes,

8 in limiting available relief to equitable relief in

9 ERISA, Congress, I think, contemplated that there

10 wouldn't be a remedy for plan breaches in every case.

11 And so the framework this Court developed was to

12 distinguish between equitable relief on the one hand and

13 things like damages that, clearly, Congress didn't mean

14 to include in the relief that would be available.

15             And so  I think it's been true since

16 GreatWest when this Court interpreted equitable relief

17 pretty narrowly that a beneficiary will have an

18 incentive in some cases to structure a settlement in

19 order to avoid paying reimbursement to the Plan.  But

20 it's also been true since GreatWest that because of

21 that, plans have a need to counter those incentives by

22 diligently protecting their rights.

23             And so I think the way that the Court rules

24 in this case is not going to affect the existence of

25 those incentives on the part of beneficiaries or the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 need for plans to be diligent.  So I think it's

20

2 important to keep in mind here that the only reason this

3 issue comes up in this case is that the Plan wasn't

4 diligent, that the Plan waited for months when it knew

5 that it had a reimbursement claim, and that that was

6 being disputed.  It didn't seek an injunction.  It

7 didn't file suit.

8             So yes, I think this is a situation that is

9 unlike the mine run of cases where we see that plans

10 since GreatWest have developed measures that they can

11 take in order to protect their rights.

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Anders, in

13 GreatWest, the government filed on the side of the

14 Plan.  What led the government to shift its position?

15             MS. ANDERS:  I think in GreatWest, I think

16 we were taking a somewhat broader view of equitable

17 relief than the court ended up adopting in that case.

18 And so as we get here today, we've taken this position

19 because we think it is absolutely the logical

20 consequence of GreatWest and Sereboff together.

21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you took your position

22 because of GreatWest?

23             MS. ANDERS:  That's absolutely right.  In

24 GreatWest, the Court said that when the funds are not

25 in the beneficiary's possession, the Plan cannot enforce

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1 an equitable lien  cannot get equitable relief against 2 the Plan.  And it relied on equitable authorities that 3 said, quoting, "If the property or its proceeds have 4 been dissipated so that no product remains, the 5 plaintiffs may not enforce a constructive trust or 6 equitable"  7             JUSTICE ALITO:  Probably what  8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You thought  you 9 thought  10             JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sorry. 11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you thought 12 GreatWest adopted a  a narrower understanding of what 13 equitable meant in this context than you thought was 14 appropriate. 15             MS. ANDERS:  I think at the time we were 16 arguing for a broader understanding.  But as we  as we 17 come here today, of course, nobody has  has argued 18 that GreatWest or Sereboff should be overturned, or 19 Mertens, for that matter.  And so we think the 20 consequence of those two decisions is that there will 21 not be relief in a case in which the Plan participant 22 has dissipated the funds. 23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But would you  say, 24 what is the government's position on commingling? 25 There's no  the beneficiary gets the check, puts it in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 his bank account, together with whatever else he has in 2 there.  So how do we tell if he's dissipated? 3             MS. ANDERS:  I agree with my friend that the 4 commingling rule at equity, I think, reflected the fact 5 that once funds have been dissipated, the lienholder can 6 no longer collect.  So the way it worked was that if you 7 had funds in your account that  and you spent them, 8 that at first it would be presumed that you were 9 spending your own money. 10             But  but once you got down below the 11 amount that  that was originally subject to the lien, 12 the lienholder would only be able to enforce against 13 whatever remained in that account even if it wasn't 14 sufficient to satisfy the lien amount. 15             So it's basically the same dissipation rule 16 that applies in cases that don't involve commingling. 17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why can't  in a case 18 where there's no time problem  forget the delays and 19 so forth  but like this one, the Plan sue the lawyer? 20 I mean, if there was $500,000 and the lawyer received 21 200,000  but he certainly received it with notice. 22 It's not any kind of goodfaith purchaser  why can't 23 they get it back from him? 24             MS. ANDERS:  I think there may be situations 25 in which the Plan could sue the lawyer.
Alderson Reporting Company

23 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why couldn't they normally 2 in my situation? 3             MS. ANDERS:  I think they probably could. 4             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If they could, 5 then doesn't that solve the problem for them because 6 lawyers will be awfully careful not to dissipate the 7 funds if, in fact, they're going to be subject to the 8 lawsuit? 9             MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think that's right, and 10 I think lawyers also have ethical rules that  that 11 prevent them from  from dissipating funds  12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But wait a minute.  I mean, 13 if they can get it from the lawyer immediately, why 14 can't they get it from the lawyer at  at the end of 15 the day?  I mean, do you mean that  that the  the 16 fund can get back not only what the beneficiary 17 receives, but also what he has paid his lawyer? 18             MS. ANDERS:  No.  I just mean that  that 19 if the funds are in the lawyer's possession, the lawyer 20 is the agent of  of the  of the beneficiary, I think 21 in that situation, equity would permit the plaintiff, 22 the lienholder to trace that  that lien amount. 23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  To  to get the whole 24 amount from the lawyer, right, so leaving the lawyer 25 without his fee?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1             MS. ANDERS:  Yes.  I  I think that could 2 be correct.  I mean  3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought in most States, 4 the lawyer has a lien on the fee.  His lien is prior  5 I may be wrong.  His  his lien, the lawyer's lien is 6 prior to the  7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah. 8             MS. ANDERS:  I think  9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That has to be or nobody 10 would take these cases. 11             (Laughter.) 12             MS. ANDERS:  That may be correct.  I 13 don't  I don't think this situation has come up very 14 much.  But I  15             JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see why it would 16 be.  There is a fund.  The fund belongs to person X. 17 The lawyer knows it belongs to person X.  Nonetheless, 18 the lawyer takes $200,000 out of the money that belongs 19 to person X and gives 300,000 to the client. 20             I assume the client is more likely to spend 21 money down than the lawyer, because lawyers tend, in 22 general, to have a larger bank account than poorer 23 clients.  So therefore, I do not see why they wouldn't 24 sue the lawyer. 25             But they aren't, so there's something I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 didn't understand; hence, I am asking the question.

25

2             MS. ANDERS:  All right.  Well, I don't think

3  I don't think it's come up very much, but I do think

4 it's possible that in some situations, plans may be able

5 to sue the lawyers.  They can sue other 

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it must depend on

7 how the agreement reads, and I can't imagine the

8 agreement wouldn't  wouldn't require the beneficiary

9 to turn over the net.  Not the gross, but the net

10 recovery, what  what he receives after paying legal

11 fees.

12             MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think a lot of these

13 plans are going to disclaim a common fund or  or 

14 you know, they're going to disclaim their  their 

15 any obligation to have the attorneys' fees counted

16 against them.  So the  the person is not 

17             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm 

18             MS. ANDERS:   going to  the entire

19 amount 

20             JUSTICE BREYER:   thinking in my mind 

21             MS. ANDERS:   but just to  just to make

22 a  a broader 

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  There is a model.  There is

24 a  two diamond rings belonging to a trustee.  They end

25 up being given to the cousin.  The lawyer has them in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 his safe.  I do not believe that no matter what the

26

2 agreement between the cousin and the lawyer, the lawyer

3 can take the diamond ring that belongs to somebody

4 else  and he knows it  and put it in his pocket, no

5 matter what the agreement.

6             MS. ANDERS:  Right.  He's not a bona fide

7 purchaser for value in that situation.

8             But I think the Plans do have many other

9 remedies in these situations.  They can trace against 

10 against any third party who takes the  the property

11 with notice of the lien.  They  they could monitor the

12 litigation.  They can intervene in these suits.  They

13 can seek injunctions.  These are all things that the

14 Plan here did not do.

15             And just to  to pick up on a point that my

16 friend was making, I do think that this is a situation

17 in which reasonable policymakers could differ.  There

18 are legitimate concerns on both sides.  It is absolutely

19 a legitimate concern that in some cases a plan may not

20 be able to recover even if it has diligently protected

21 the rights.  But 

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All  all of those

23 things you say  all of those things you say the Plan

24 can do, though, are  are a lot more complicated than

25 simply saying they should be able to recover that to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 which they're entitled under the agreement.  And when 2 you get into  we've noted before that we try to avoid 3 complicating the procedures in this area, for the simple 4 reason that nobody has to set up one of these plans. 5 And if they don't know, you know, how much it's going to 6 cost in advance and all of them just say, well, it's not 7 worth it, and if I've got to go and file injunctions or 8 this or that every time somebody makes a  has a tort 9 recovery, you know  but I'm not going to do it.  I 10 won't set up one of these plans. 11             MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think  I think an 12 important point, Your Honor, is that no matter how the 13 Court rules here, the Plans are going to have those 14 obligations and they're going to have those burdens, 15 because GreatWest permits beneficiaries to structure 16 their settlements to avoid paying reimbursement to the 17 Plan. 18             So because of that, ever since GreatWest, 19 Plans have taken these measures and  and they will 20 continue to take them even if the Court rules for 21 Respondents. 22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What are the concerns on 23 the other side, which you have mentioned and  and 24 which your  your friend also mentioned?  What are 25 they?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1             MS. ANDERS:  So one concern, as you said, is 2 that  that whatever rule the Court announces, it's 3 going to apply in the pension and disability benefit 4 context too.  And in that situation, the Plan may be 5 making overpayments to beneficiaries over a long period 6 of time.  And the beneficiary may spend the money 7 without knowing that she's going to be responsible for 8 reimbursing it later, or  or that it's not her money 9 to spend in a sense.  And so in that situation, I think 10 a policymaker could be concerned that  about a plan 11 being able to go  go back months or years later and  12 and get reimbursement from the beneficiary. 13             So I think, you know, this is really a 14 question for Congress.  But what Congress could do is it 15 could weigh that potential against the downside to the 16 Plan, the fact that, since GreatWest, they have  they 17 have had these obligations, they have needed to 18 diligently protect their rights, and, I think, in the 19 minerun of cases, they've been able to do so. 20             So I think those are the things that 21 Congress could weigh in looking at the policy  policy 22 concerns on either side of this. 23             And that's why we think those concerns 24 really shouldn't drive the analysis here.  The  25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Anders, could I  could
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 I shift gears a little bit and  and just ask:  The

29

2 test that we've set up is whether a remedy is typically

3 available at equity.  And there's been some

4 backandforth, I think, about what that means.

5             What does it mean?

6             MS. ANDERS:  I think "typically available in

7 equity" meant remedies that were considered to be

8 equitable in nature.  And so it certainly did not

9 include, as this Court said in Merten, the type of 

10 Mertens, the type of  relief, such as deficiency

11 judgments or lien destruction damages, that that Court

12 thought of as legal to the end of the  the time of the

13 divided bench.

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

15             Mr. Katyal.

16              ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

17                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18             MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

19 and may it please the Court:

20             Three things are undisputed.

21             First, that Montanile signed a form saying,

22 quote, "I agree to reimburse in full the Plan from any

23 settlement."

24             Second, the Plan provides that such funds

25 are, quote, "Assets of the Plan not distributable to any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 person without the Plan's written release."

30

2             And third, under Sereboff, that the Plan

3 would have an enforcement claim under 502(a)(3) if

4 Montanile still possessed the funds.

5             What we're disagreeing about is whether

6 Montanile's decision to commit a second wrong of

7 spending the Plan's money himself has made him

8 judgmentproof.  And the answer is no for a very simple

9 reason:  When a right under equity has attached and a

10 defendant then knowingly frustrates that equitable

11 claim, it is absolutely part of equity to permit that

12 claim.  This reflects the cold reality that the

13 defendant took actions that blocked an otherwise valid

14 claim in equity.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  I have no idea

16 where you think this lien attached.  Do you think it

17 attached at the fund, immediate  the whole 500,000, or

18 the amount of that 500,000 that ended up in his pocket,

19 or that 500,000 minus what, if anything?

20             MR. KATYAL:  So it  it's  Barnes says

21 that the  that the lien attaches at the moment that he

22 is  that he has gotten title to the thing.  He gets

23 title to the thing when there is a $500,000 settlement.

24 Settlement, of course, that we didn't know about, but

25 that he nonetheless did.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             Our only 

31

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your position is at

3 that moment it goes to the lawyer, it's his money, all

4 500,000.  You're entitled to whatever 

5             MR. KATYAL:  To a  to a lien of $121,000

6 on it.

7             And so our claim is not that we have some

8 general remedy at law that we can get compensatory

9 consequential damages or punitive damages.  It's limited

10 by the lien itself.

11             And that is the rule in equity, that when

12 someone frustrates a valid claim in equity by taking

13 actions to dissipate the fund, you can get 

14 recover the value of that fund.  You can't recover more

15 than that.  So this is the bitter with the sweet that

16 when  when you make an equitable claim like this, you

17 have to be limited by all the rules of equity.

18             So in addition to that, Justice Sotomayor,

19 we couldn't, for example, try and attach the asset, try

20 and attach and file a lawsuit, until he actually took

21 possession of the funds.

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  So I  I found a list.  On

23 this list I have, one, there is the fund, 500,000 in it.

24 It belongs to the company, not to him.

25             Now, he takes the fund and he begins to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1 distribute it with the aid of his lawyer.  Some of the 2 money goes to the lawyer.  If that money is still there, 3 I imagine you could get it. 4             Some of the lawyer's goes to his bank 5 account.  If, in fact, that bank account has not gone, 6 from the time he put it there to the time you sue, below 7 $121,000, you can get it.  Indeed  and if it has gone 8 below, you can still get it even if there's a penny, but 9 you can only get the penny. 10             If he has taken the 121,000 out of it and 11 given it to a person with knowledge, for example, his 12 wife or children, and it is in their bank account, I 13 guess you could get it. 14             And indeed, if they have got and bought with 15 it some tangible item that you can trace it to, I guess 16 you can get it. 17             But what we could not find and, in fact, if 18 you can't find any of those, you could still sue him 19 under State law, under State fraud statutes, and recover 20 in damages.  That's at law.  And maybe you can do it 21 even under such a remedy where it's much more mixed up 22 than the other side was prepared to give you credit for, 23 in which case, you have State law remedies at law. 24             Now, what I could not find is a case 25 embodying the theory you are now advancing, that he
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 simply gets the damages even where he doesn't have any 2 of the remedies that I just mentioned. 3             MR. KATYAL:  So  so first of all, we're 4 not advancing that theory, Justice Breyer.  You cannot 5 get  we're not advancing a damages theory whatsoever. 6 All we're saying is that you can recover the value of 7 the lien itself when someone frustrates an equitable 8 claim that otherwise exists. 9             And we point to three different traditions 10 in equity that permit you to do that:  substitutionary 11 monetary decrees, deficiency judgments, and swollen 12 assets.  All of those reflect the basic idea that 13 someone shouldn't profit from their second wrong, their 14 wrongdoing of dissipating a fund. 15             So look, there is a  they're absolutely 16 right.  The general rule is that you can't recover from 17 general assets.  That is absolutely right.  But there's 18 an urban legend that  that I think the briefs try and 19 spin around that rule, to say that that general rule 20 encompasses a situation when someone acts wrongfully to 21 dissipate a fund, as to which someone has a claim. 22             And that circumstance, Justice Holmes's 23 opinion in Otis says, he says, if the complaint, quote, 24 "seeks the recovery of an identified fund, that 25 complaint will not fail because the fund is gone and
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1 misappropriated by the defendants.  Rather, under those 2 circumstances, the plaintiff has a right to compensation 3 as alternative relief." 4             That's not damages  5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That would be wonderful, if 6 he said "has an equitable right to compensation."  I 7 mean, you know, that sounds like cleanup to me. 8             MR. KATYAL:  No, it's not, Justice Scalia. 9 I think it's not, for several reasons. 10             Number one is, of course, in that case, the 11 entire fund was gone.  So if it were cleanup 12 jurisdiction, there had to be something to pend to. 13 There had some ancillary jurisdiction, some equitable 14 claim.  There had to be some fund that was still 15 remaining in order for there to be something to pend to. 16 There wasn't there.  The entire fund was gone. 17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is  is  is that the 18 requirement? 19             MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that otherwise  20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  There has to be some of the 21 fund there. 22             MR. KATYAL:  Otherwise, Your Honor, there 23 wouldn't have been any reason  there is a requirement 24 that, in order for  25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  There was an equitable
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
35 1 jurisdiction, so long as the person had possession of 2 the fund at one point. 3             MR. KATYAL:  I don't think that there's  4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And then  and when the 5 suit is completed, it's discovered that all of the fund 6 is gone. 7             MR. KATYAL:  No, your Honor.  If  if their 8 argument is right, and this is something that Judge 9 Posner has said, for example, in  in describing this 10 in the Medtronic case.  In order for ancillary 11 jurisdiction to exist, there has to first be a valid 12 equitable claim.  And then, for the convenience of the 13 parties, you can resolve a legal claim. 14             In Otis there was no equitable claim under 15 their theory, which  which is, you  you know, if the 16 fund is gone, there's no lien that it's attached.  It's 17 gone.  It's dissipated. 18             So  and then it also say, you know, it's a 19 remarkable that they say that all of these cases are 20 cleanup jurisdiction. 21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  If  if  if 22 there's no equitable cause of action for them, why is 23 there for you? 24             MR. KATYAL:  Because we think that the 25 proposition that they're trying to say is wrong, the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 idea that when you dissipate a fund, you lose your

36

2 equitable claim.

3             Our point is that is  that's generally

4 true; not true in a circumstance when a defendant

5 frustrates an otherwise valid equitable claim.

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So  so you ought to be

7 able to bring suit in equity without asserting that the

8 person ever had the fund in his hands.

9             MR. KATYAL:  Well, you can't do that, of

10 course.

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say, he owes me the

12 money.

13             MR. KATYAL:  You can't do that, of course,

14 as Knudson says.  And  and that's a standard rule.

15 We're not here 

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying even if you

17 know the person has dissipated all the funds, you can

18 sue for the equitable lien, even if you know the funds

19 are all gone?

20             MR. KATYAL:  Correct, Your Honor.  As long

21 as that was a knowing dissipation, that that's what

22 happened.  And that's what the substitutionary momentary

23 cases 

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have any cases?

25             MR. KATYAL:  Sure.  Otis itself is a case

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
37 1 that does that.  Justice Homes's opinion, Justice Story 2 has a description of other cases in his treatise. 3 Our  our brief talks about the Baxter case and the  4 and the Bank of Marin case.  These are the closest 5 analogue to this case, because they're not the general 6 rule about can you recover from general assets; they're 7 about the specific rule, can you profit from your 8 wrongdoing when an equitable lien by attachments is  9 or an equitable lien by agreement is already attached. 10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It has to be pretty 11 easy for you to protect yourself, doesn't it, as soon as 12 at some suitable time after the injury you do write a 13 letter to the person and say, look, you need to know 14 that if you sue somebody, the money is ours, and because 15 we have these rights of subrogation, or let us know if 16 you're going to, and we'll show up in court with you 17 and  and  and help you? 18             Where  see, I guess it would probably be 19 pretty easy to  to monitor it yourself.  I mean, the 20 court's computerized dockets, you just punch in 21 "Montanile," and  and whenever that pops up on the 22 docket and you find out right away.  It's certainly long 23 before the case is resolved.  It  it doesn't  24 I mean, I  I think your friend has  has a 25 significant point that it's actually not as hard as it

2             MR. KATYAL:  So  so three things, Your

3 Honor.  First, we're not grounding our argument in the

4 policy of things.  We do think that the policy

5 consequences are  are important, but we think that if

6 the test is what's traditionally available in equity,

7 these three specific lines of authority that we're

8 pointing to answer that question.

9             But as to the policy concerns, we think

10 exactly as you said to my friend on the other side.

11 There are two big problems with that.  Number one is

12 Plans don't get noticed about when settlements occur.

13 In the amicus brief from NASP explains most auto

14 accidents, for example, are settled without any public

15 record, without any lawsuit being filed whatsoever.  So

16 you can't exactly type it into Westlaw or something like

17 that.  So that's one problem.

18             The other is that it becomes very expensive

19 for Plans to monitor this stuff.  And Plans are, you

20 know, some for profit entity.  Every dollar that you

21 spend that the Plan has to spend on monitoring or

22 writing these letters or filing lawsuits or filing TROs

23 is a dollar that is taken away from innocent Plan

24 beneficiaries, people who have done 

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  I mean,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 that's the point we have made in our precedents, but it 2 can't  you can't carry that so far that otherwise you 3 would say, well, the Plan always wins. 4             MR. KATYAL:  Right.  I'm certainly not 5 trying to do that.  All I'm saying is that the policy 6 arguments here, I do think, are substantial and have 7 weight.  The amicus briefs, before you say, over a 8 billion dollars each year is recovered through these 9 reimbursement actions.  And  and if you adopt their 10 plan, then as you were saying as to my friend, you're 11 going to just tell the client  you are  telling the 12 Montaniles of the world, spend that money right away. 13 Settle the case at 10:00, and by 10:01 spend all the 14 money.  And in that circumstance, then Plans are out of 15 luck.  Innocent beneficiaries, that means, are out of 16 luck, and people like Mr. Montanile get a double 17 recovery.  And equity is not so brittle.  There is no 18 tradition in equity that supports this idea. 19             As, Justice Alito, you were saying, how 20 could this make any sense?  It didn't make sense at 21 equity.  Equity has always been more flexible than that. 22 It's always recognized the idea that people shouldn't be 23 able to profit from their wrongdoing, and that rights 24 have remedies, and avoiding formalistic distinctions. 25             And speaking of formalistic distinctions,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the Solicitor General's rule is as formalistic as it

40

2 gets because they say you can get the remedy out of

3 general assets as long as the lawsuit is filed in time

4 for  the lawsuit is filed  is filed at a time when

5 there was possession of the fund.  That is 

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Katyal, equity itself

7 is a formalistic distinction.  I mean, to  to argue

8 that  that we shouldn't make formalistic distinctions

9 in trying to figure out whether particular relief is

10 equitable relief or not, I don't  that's

11 incomprehensible to me.

12             MR. KATYAL:  Well, Justice Scalia, as

13 Justice Frankfurter says, equity, quote, "assures

14 mechanical rules and depends on flexibility."  Every

15 equity treatise  look at Pomeroy, for example, of

16 Section 111.  All the other treatises say 

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Pomeroy doesn't  doesn't

18 support you as 

19             MR. KATYAL:  I think very much 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:   Pomeroy's quotes are

21 contrary to what you 

22             MR. KATYAL:   very much it does.  There is

23 not a quote from Pomeroy or from any of the other

24 treatises that deal with this situation when someone is

25 trying to profit from their second wrong, when there is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 already an equitable lien by attaches.

41

2             And, you know, for example, Pomeroy, just on

3 the flexibility interchange, were saying, Section 111,

4 "Equity has followed the true principle of contriving

5 its remedy so they shall correspond both to the primary

6 right of the injured party and to the wrong by which

7 that right has been violated.  It has therefore never

8 placed any limits on the remedies it can grant either

9 with respect to their substance, their form or their

10 extent, but it's always preserved the elements of

11 flexibility and expansiveness so that they can be

12 modified to meet the requirements of every case."

13             And this is a perfect example 

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't know

15 that you can read our precedence in this area to say

16 that they're very flexible.  I mean, Sereboff, the

17 difference between equitable lien for restitution and

18 equitable lien by agreement, you  you know, you can

19 get, you know, deficiency judgments as opposed to legal

20 judgments, and whether one's sort of an adjunct to the

21 equitable action or freestanding.  It's an area where

22 the  the equity rules strikes me as very technical.

23             MR. KATYAL:  Well, they are technical when

24 it comes to that first question, is there an equitable

25 claim in the first  first instance.  And so Knudson,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 for example, says no, because there's no possession of 2 the fund.  Sereboff says here there is possession; 3 therefore, there is. 4             We don't quibble with any of that.  Here as 5 this case comes to the Court, everyone agrees  that's 6 the third point I made at the outset  everyone agrees 7 there was an equitable lien by agreement.  The only 8 thing we're disagreeing about is whether or not by 9 spending all the funds we've lost our remedy. 10             And with respect to that question, they have 11 general precedents which say you can't go after general 12 assets.  We agree with that.  The relevant question is, 13 when someone has wrong  when  when  when a valid 14 equitable lien by agreement attaches and then someone 15 acts to dissipate that, can they profit from their 16 wrong. 17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The  the essence of 18 GreatWestern  I don't know if I'm reading it rightly 19 or not.  I'll certainly be corrected by the author and 20 dissenters if I'm not.  But it seemed to me that they're 21 basically saying, whatever remedy you have has to be an 22 equitable remedy. 23             MR. KATYAL:  Right. 24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The most that I read 25 about a substitution decree or deficiency decree is that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it's an ancillary jurisdiction to issue those.

43

2             Is that consistent with saying it's

3 equitable?  Isn't it just a legal claim that equity

4 sometimes permitted an  an equitable court to

5 exercise, but wouldn't it still be legal 

6             MR. KATYAL:  Right.  Justice 

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   and not within 

8 within the  the scope of ERISA?

9             MR. KATYAL:  Justice Sotomayor, this is,

10 again, part of the urban legend that  that's being

11 developed around this.  There is no case that says that

12 a substitutionary monetary decree is a legal judgment or

13 is ancillary.  To the contrary, cases that we're citing

14 such as Baxter and Otis suggest that it is an equity not

15 in that.  And  and indeed, if there's any doubt about

16 this, I  I suggest that you'd have to say it's equity,

17 because the tradition for ancillary, which was pendent

18 jurisdiction was, if an equity court was going to decide

19 a legal claim, they had to label it as a legal claim

20 because of the Seventh Amendment reasons, because

21 otherwise, they might, you know, there's  there's all

22 sorts of jury trial issues that come up.

23             So that's why the tradition for cleanup

24 jurisdiction was to label those claims specifically to

25 say, okay, first we're going to solve our  our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 equitable claim, and now we're going to turn as part of 2 our pendent jurisdiction  3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm still a little bit 4 confused by all of this.  In my mind, you get money when 5 somebody gives it to you.  And I  I know that a lawyer 6 is an agent, but the agent is keeping a piece of the 7 money.  You can still go after the client for the piece 8 the lawyer took? 9             MR. KATYAL:  So with  with respect to 10 the  the lawyer piece is much more complicated.  And 11 this goes to Justice Breyer's question.  I mean, there's 12 actually a circuit split on this question about can you 13 go after the lawyer, and the reason why you may not be 14 able to go after the lawyer is the lawyer is not a party 15 to the underlying agreement. 16             And that's what I think the Eighth Circuit 17 says in contradistinction to others.  And so that's  18 that  that it is  that is not a great remedy.  And, 19 of course, it requires the lawyer to be on notice of the 20 Plan and all the reimbursement obligations and the like. 21             Under equity, Justice Sotomayor, I think the 22 idea is that when someone has made a valid promise to  23 for these funds, such as here, Montanile knew that he 24 was playing with house money.  He knew that these 25 weren't his  this wasn't his money; it was the Plan's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 money from the start.  And then he goes and spends that 2 money on other things.  Yes, you can go after his 3 general assets to recover that spending on other things. 4             And that is something amply supported by 5 these three different traditions in the case law.  Those 6 are the closest analogs to what's going on here when 7 someone has dissipated and frustrated a  an action 8 that  that otherwise existed. 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you say again, when 10 does the lien attach?  Is it when the tortfeasor pays  11 gives it  the check to the lawyer, or is it when the 12 beneficiary actually gets the 200,000? 13             MR. KATYAL:  Well, I don't think that the 14 answers are clear on that, but I do think it's when 15 he takes  I think the most this Court has said it's 16 when he takes title to the thing.  And presumably, he 17 takes title to the thing at the moment that the check is 18 given to the lawyers. 19             Now if, at that moment, Justice Ginsburg, 20 say the bank account of the lawyer was hacked and the 21 $500,000 settlement was gone, our view is his general 22 rule then kicks in.  In that circumstance, we cannot 23 recover.  The only thing we're saying is that when a 24 defendant knowingly dissipates a fund as to which 25 someone else has a claim, it's in that circumstance that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the exception  as Justice Story called it, that

46

2 peculiar exception applies to try and basically make

3 sure that he isn't profiting a second time from his

4 wrongdoing.

5             That's why the claim is a very limited one

6 at equity.  It's just a  it's a  and again, it's

7 only limited to the amount of the lien.  You can't go

8 more than that.  You can't have punitive damages and the

9 like, and it's encumbered by all the defenses in the

10 equity.  We have to take the bitter with the sweet, so

11 laches and unconscionability.  All of that would be

12 standard defenses that are available to such an action.

13             Now, my friend on the other side has said,

14 well, this is going to reach disability situations.

15 Absolutely not.  I mean, I think you have a variety of

16 amicus briefs before you that say that there's a

17 specific statute, 407(a), which prohibits liens against

18 Social  Social Security Disability overpayments.  He

19 says it's going to reach pension overpayments.  Again,

20 that's not our rule.  Our rule in  in those  in

21 those circumstances, a pension plan is overpaying a

22 beneficiary.

23             And if the beneficiary spends that, well,

24 that's not something that they're knowingly dissipating.

25 That's very different than a circumstance like this in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
47 1 which someone is dissipating a fund as to which they  2 someone  as to which the Plan has an underlying lien 3 against.  And that's why it's a  it's a very limited 4 rule.  It's one that tracks the tradition at common law. 5 Both Otis talks about misappropriation, and Baxter talks 6 about wrongful dissipation when someone has a valid lien 7 against you.  And as well, the Orr case, for the swollen 8 assets theory and the like. 9             Now, my friend on the other side says in his 10 brief, well, then why in the world are we spending so 11 much time  are all these equity cases spending so much 12 time on tracing?  And our view is very simple on that. 13 Tracing makes a lot of sense.  In the lion's share of 14 cases, tracing becomes very important because you don't 15 have a defendant who is acting wrongfully and knowingly 16 dissipating a fund.  And so the Plan or whoever the 17 trustee is wants to  wants to go after general assets 18 but then can't, unless they can trace them to a specific 19 asset. 20             Tracing is just a lienpriority doctrine. 21 It's nothing more than that.  The Restatement that my 22 friend cites on the other side that is cited in Knudson 23 in Section 215 is as clear as day.  It just talks about 24 lien priority.  It doesn't say that there is no claim if 25 general  if  if someone dissipates a fund.  It says
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1 that they are not entitled to lien priority.  That is 2 it. 3             And look, we agree with that.  We're not 4 here trying to say we have a priority over other 5 asset  over other creditors.  We're just simply saying 6 we are to use the language of the Restatement, a 7 "general creditor." 8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you don't have 9 priority over other creditors.  So if Mr. Montanile owes 10 somebody money, he  it's all right if he takes money 11 from the fund and pays that debt? 12             MR. KATYAL:  Well, we are then  you know, 13 as long as we can't trace it in a world of no tracing. 14 So there's obviously some funds here that we may able to 15 trace, because as the interchange with Justice Ginsburg 16 was suggesting, it's not totally clear what was spent 17 and what isn't. 18             But with respect to the rest, yes.  I mean, 19 we have to take the bitter with the sweet, and that 20 means we are a general creditor out of general assets. 21 It's not like we get first priority over those assets, 22 which is why this remedy is at best a secondbest one 23 for us.  I mean, the ideal is, of course, to prevent 24 someone from dissipating the funds altogether. 25             And we do think, if this Court recognized,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 as I think most of the circuits have, that we have a

49

2 cause of action here, then I think it would deter people

3 from engaging in the kind of behavior that Mr. Montanile

4 did.

5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just want to be clear:

6 I understand your position and your answer.

7             Fund has  has a claim for reimbursement

8 from the accident proceeds.  Accident proceeds put into

9 the bank account of the Plan beneficiary, the injured,

10 the person who was injured in the accident.  He also has

11 another creditor.

12             You're  you stand evenly with that

13 creditor?

14             MR. KATYAL:  So if 

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Was that your answer?

16             MR. KATYAL:  Well, it is in the situation of

17 a dissipated fund.  So obviously, if we can trace  and

18 this is why tracing is still important.

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's  it's your

20 example.  The case is settled at 10:00 in the morning.

21 At 10:30 in the morning, it's in the bank account.

22             MR. KATYAL:  Yes.

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Nothing has been spent,

24 but there's a creditor.  And the creditor's claim is

25 equal to the Plan's claim, and there's only enough money

Alderson Reporting Company

1 for one.

Official

50

2             What happens?

3             MR. KATYAL:  Well, Justice Kennedy 

4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought you would have

5 priority.

6             MR. KATYAL:  I would if  it sounds like we

7 could trace that fund.  That is, the fund hasn't been

8 spent in that circumstance.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's traceable.  It's in

10 the bank account.

11             MR. KATYAL:  Right.  So then  and that 

12 that's exactly right.  So we would have priority over

13 that $500,000, in that circumstance, over other

14 creditors.

15             My only point is if we're in the

16 Montanilelike situation in which he has  let's say he

17 spent down that entire fund and there's another creditor

18 who also  Montanile owes money to.  Once that happens,

19 we are  we can only recover just like the other

20 general creditor.  And that's what the Restatement says.

21 That's all it says.

22             It does not say that if a fund is

23 dissipated, that there is no claim anymore.  That would

24 be contrary to the whole idea as Justice Alito's

25 question was, about what equity is all about.  That

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 makes  that makes no sense.

51

2             An equity is not that brittle, Justice

3 Scalia.  I understand that there are traditions in

4 equity and there are certain rules.  But at the end of

5 the day, there  it was never that formalistic and 

6 and  and have the idea that someone could profit so

7 much from their wrongdoing in frustrating an equitable

8 claim that otherwise exists.

9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it seems, Mr. Katyal,

10 that you are relying on remedies that really developed

11 very late in equity's life.  In other words, you know,

12 equity was going along, and there were these very formal

13 rules distinguishing it from the legal world.  And then

14 as it progressed, there were  people thought we need

15 some cleanup authority, or maybe even people just

16 thought these rules aren't working in the way that we

17 want them to work.  So equity got a little bit less

18 equitable as it approached the merger with law.

19             But that, I think, is not really what we've

20 meant when we've said we're looking to things that are

21 typically equitable.  You know, not like the last throes

22 of equity as it was becoming a legal system.

23             MR. KATYAL:  So, Justice Kagan, I'd spot you

24 that with respect to swollen assets, you know, which

25 does come around in the 1930s, and so maybe there's an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1 argument there.  But  but for example, substitutionary 2 monetary decrees, Justice Holmes's opinions in 1897, 3 exactly the same year as Barnes, the Chief Justice's 4 opinion that was the foundation for Sereboff.  And 5 indeed, it has a tradition that goes back to 6 Justice Story's 1828 treatise, which cites earlier cases 7 even still. 8             So I don't think that we're relying that. 9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you take the  the 10 deficiency judgments, which, I take it, was a rule was 11 needed to give equity that authority, because everybody 12 thought equity didn't have that authority. 13             MR. KATYAL:  Well  well, even if you can 14 make that argument about deficiency judgments, which 15 I'll respond to in a moment, you can't make it about 16 substitution or monetary decrees, which is a distinct 17 body in equity. 18             And with respect to that, in 1864, 19 absolutely.  This Court promulgated Equity Rule 92, 20 which allowed for deficiency judgments.  But I think the 21 fact that they had to issue a rule doesn't somehow make 22 it a law claim, as my friend says.  I mean, after all, 23 Rule 73, promulgated in 1864, was a rule about 24 preliminary injunctions.  And I certainly think 25 preliminary injunctions were available in equity, and,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
53 1 you know, the fact that there was a rule about it didn't 2 somehow convert it into a law claim. 3             So I think the very fact that this Court 4 issued a rule called Equity Rule 10 is suggestive of the 5  of the fact that this is a tradition in equity. 6             Now, look, if there's some doubt about this, 7 if there's some doubt on the traditions, and they've 8 got  I don't think they have a single case, but even 9 if you thought they did, that said that we were 10 prohibited  that we were prohibited from making these 11 claims at equity, I think you should err on the side of 12 recognizing the claim. 13             Why?  For three reasons.  One, because as 14 the Solicitor General's brief in Sereboff said, the 15 point of ERISA is to try and give effect to written 16 plans and their determinations.  And if there's doubt 17 into the  as to what the equity tradition is, you 18 should read it in light of trying to enforce Plan terms. 19 That is the pages 23 and 24 of their brief.  It is 20 consistent with the way this Court approaches, for 21 example, Title VII cases and the like. 22             The second is that, again, all we're seeking 23 here is a remedy.  We're not trying to get more than 24 what would have been otherwise available at equity. 25 Our  our view is that when someone frustrates an
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
54 1 otherwise equitable claim, we can only try and reinstate 2 that claim.  You can't get more from it because of their 3 second wrongdoing.  So I think we're giving effect to 4 what equity is all about. 5             And then, third  and this goes back to 6 your last question to Ms. Anders, you said, you know, 7 what was  what was the  what does "typically 8 available at equity" mean?  And you know, that test 9 comes from Mertens.  Mertens isolates three examples of 10 what was traditionally available as equity  at equity: 11 mandamus, injunction, and restitution. 12             Now, if you look at mandamus, for example, 13 there are precedents from this Court making  that  14 that suggest that equity  that equity didn't recognize 15 mandamus.  You know, this Court twice in the nineteenth 16 century in Hine and Downs both said that  said that 17 twice. 18             And I think that's a good textual clue that 19 when there's doubt as to whether something is actually 20 traditionally available at equity or not, you should err 21 on the side of recognizing it as traditionally 22 available, as this Court did in the foundational Mertens 23 test. 24             We're not quibbling with Mertens.  We're 25 simply saying we're at least as strong as to whether

1 something was traditionally available at equity as

55

2 mandamus.  Because in mandamus, two cases from this

3 Court suggested it wasn't traditionally available, and

4 yet, the Court still, in Mertens, used that as one of

5 its three examples.

6             If there are no further questions.

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

8             Mr. Stris, you have four minutes remaining.

9            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

10                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11             MR. STRIS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

12             I'd just like to make two brief points.  The

13 first one is that the historical authorities are

14 unquestionably on our side.  And it was interesting

15 hearing my  my friend Mr. Katyal go straight to the

16 substitutionary monetary remedy.  I want to say a couple

17 things about this:

18             First, if you look carefully, the exact

19 argument he's making was rejected by the holding of this

20 Court in GreatWest.  This is Section II C of the

21 Court's opinion.  It's kind of a lesserknown part of

22 the opinion.

23             The  the argument was made that a

24 beneficiary of a trust commits that second wrong that he

25 was talking about when they get a loan contractually and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
56 1 refuse to pay it back.  And what this Court said is, no, 2 that's not typically available in equity.  And, you 3 know, it's precisely the distinction that he's trying to 4 now push upon you to squeeze this remedy through. 5             So let's look at the substitutionary 6 monetary decree cases he talks about. 7             Not a single one of them involves an 8 equitable lien by agreement.  They  they don't involve 9 an agreement.  They're restitutionary cases.  So that's 10 also interesting to me that he criticizes our side 11 talking about the  the Restatement of Restitution, 12 Section 215, whereas we talk about Pomeroy.  We talk 13 about Jones on liens.  We talk about the Person case. 14 It's an 1880 case on page 35 of the Blue brief.  It's an 15 equitable lien by agreement case. 16             The historical authority here is beyond 17 dispute. 18             And  and I guess the last thing I'll say 19 on this is look at the Shafer's Appeal case.  It's one 20 of his lead cases on page 37, note 6.  It says that 21 substitutionary monetary relief is legal. 22             So I  I think if you look at the cases, 23 not that I would wish that upon anyone, they  they 24 really do not even credibly support the proposition 25 historically.

1             So where does that leave us?  I mean, I

57

2 think I was honest from minute one when I got up here.

3 The only reason that you would contort the standard that

4 you've developed  let's be honest; you know, spot me

5 this  you have to believe our position is

6 fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose of ERISA.

7 If you do, then I have a problem.

8             But here's where we're at.  Mr. Chief

9 Justice, you made a very strong policy argument about

10 why my rule is no good.  With respect, I think I could

11 make a very strong policy argument about why

12 participants who prove a clear badfaith breach by a

13 plan should get consequential damages.  I could make

14 that argument.  I think I could make it very

15 persuasively.  But that's not what we're here to do.

16 We're here to apply the historical test.

17             So let's end, essentially, with, I think, a

18 key concession that Mr. Katyal makes about the

19 disability context.

20             So if you look at this case and you say,

21 well, all this subrogation, I don't know.  These

22 arguments that the Plans have ways to protect

23 themselves, maybe they're right, but maybe they're

24 onerous.  And, you know, I'm just not sure if it's going

25 to add to the cost of plans.

58 1             Go look at the disability cases.  Because I 2 was stunned when Mr. Katyal got up here and said, oh, 3 well, the disability cases are different, like this 4 doesn't extend to them.  He filed a cert petition with 5 respect with this Court in the Bilyeu case, which was 6 one of the circuit split cases that's here.  Half of the 7 circuit split cases involve the disability context. 8             So I'll end with this:  What does that tell 9 you?  The fact that you look at these disability cases 10 and you see that money is being advanced and it's being 11 spent before the lien even attaches, and yet they're 12 made part of the circuit split, and in this case 13 Respondent is not willing to defend that as a policy 14 position, I think what it tells you is that fairminded 15 people could disagree as to where you want to place the 16 risk. 17             And so when we go and look at this and we 18 think about it in terms of burdens, if there is any 19 reasonable position, as you look at this, that a rule 20 that says you can essentially go after general assets, 21 means that some meaningful number of fiduciaries will 22 abuse that to assert rights they don't have or to delay, 23 then I think you need to go with the clear line of 24 historical authorities. 25             Thank you.

59 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, counsel. 2 You say he filed a cert petition.  Is that on behalf of 3 the same client this year? 4             MR. STRIS:  It's not on behalf of the same 5 client, no.  But it  it shows that the disability 6 cases are governed by precisely the same legal rule, 7 since for him to suggest that the legal rule that you're 8 going to decide here would not also  also apply in 9 disability cases, flies in the face of the precise 10 position he took when he filed the cert petition  11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm just 12 trying to  13             MR. STRIS:   in the Bilyeu. 14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you saying that, 15 because he represented a different client and took a 16 position in that case, he's somehow bound by that here? 17             MR. STRIS:  Oh, no, no.  Certainly not. 18 What I'm saying is we have a circuit split.  And half of 19 the cases are subrogation, and half of them are 20 disability.  So the Court's recognized that the legal 21 principle in this case will not only apply in 22 subrogation cases but they'll apply in disability cases. 23             And Mr. Katyal recognizes that because he 24 represented a party in one of those cases. 25             So my  my point only is, don't accept the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 representation that the rule here can somehow be

60

2 confined to subrogation cases.

3             Because, as an empirical matter, it cannot.

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I would be

5 surprised by the proposition that lawyers are somehow

6 collaterally estopped if they take a particular position

7 on behalf of one client from taking a different position

8 in a different case.

9             MR. STRIS:  No.  Most certainly that's true.

10 And perhaps I've miscommunicated.

11             We have a circuit split which led to the

12 Court granting this case, and all of the cases purport

13 to resolve the same question presented.  Half of them

14 are in the subrogation context; half of them are in the

15 disability context.  So I don't  I don't see how one

16 could credibly take the position that you can decide

17 this case and it would not affect the mine run of

18 disability cases, because they're part of precisely the

19 same circuit split.  It's the same issue.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

21             The case is submitted.

22             (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the

23 aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
