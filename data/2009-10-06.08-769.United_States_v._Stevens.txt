1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear, first, 4 this morning, Case 08-769, United States v. Stevens. 5 Mr. Katyal. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 9 and may it please the Court: 10 Ten years ago, in Section 48 of Title 18, 11 Congress crafted a narrowly targeted restriction against 12 certain depictions of actual animal cruelty. Yet the 13 Third Circuit struck the statute down on its face 14 without even attempting to apply substantial overbreadth 15 analysis. The statute has four critical features and, 16 just as the Court last year in United States v. Williams 17 began with statutory construction, analysis should begin 18 there. 19 First, like the statute at issue in the 20 United States v. Ferber, this statute only reaches 21 depictions of cruelty to actual living beings -22 animals, not simulated ones or the written word. 23 Second, the statute only applies to 24 commercial messages, ones that Congress found drove the 25 market for animal cruelty.

1 Third, the statute examines the work as a 2 whole -3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What record do you have 4 of that fact? 5 MR. KATYAL: Before Congress? 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. 7 MR. KATYAL: Before Congress -- Congress had 8 a bunch of testimony that showed that there were 9 extensive -- there was a robust market in animal cruelty 10 videos, largely focusing on crush videos -- 2 to 3,000 11 crush videos that were in -- that were -- that were 12 being sold at the time. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That I understand, but 14 crush videos is only one species of cruelty to animals. 15 What evidence was there that, for example, dog fighting 16 had as large and robust a market or that hunting videos 17 in those States in which hunting was illegal had a 18 robust market, et cetera? 19 MR. KATYAL: Well, hunting we think is 20 excluded, and I could talk about that in a moment, from 21 the reach of the act. Congress spoke in general terms, 22 and I don't think that Mr. Stevens's statement at page 23 13 of his merits brief, which is to the effect that 24 Congress repeatedly disavowed any attempt to regulate 25 animal fighting -- dog fighting -- I don't think that is
4

Alderson Reporting Company

1 correct and the record does not support that. 2 Congress spoke in general terms. They had a 3 for-profit commercial market about animal cruelty, and 4 the statute dealt with it in general terms. And they 5 reasoned that by -- by punishing the sale of these 6 videotapes, they would get at the underlying clandestine 7 market -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean by a 9 "for-profit commercial market"? You mean anything that 10 is sold, right? 11 MR. KATYAL: That is -- that is correct. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 13 MR. KATYAL: Yes. 14 And the Third Circuit's decision in this 15 case struck down the statute with respect to crush 16 videos, with respect to the sale of video -- the 17 creation of dog fighting videotapes, because, remember, 18 the statute, Section 48, doesn't just encompass the -19 the sale of videotapes. It also encompasses the 20 creation of dog fighting videotapes. And, yet, the -21 the Third Circuit struck that down as well. That, I 22 think, was a fundamental error under this Court's 23 principles, most particularly, United States v. 24 Williams, which says that the statute should only be 25 struck down if there is a substantial -- if there is
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 substantial overbreadth and only if it is a last resort 2 of the Court, not the first. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would you -- if 4 you could do it in one sentence, what is your test for 5 determining which categories of speech are unprotected 6 by the First Amendment? 7 MR. KATYAL: In one sentence, if -- if -- if 8 Congress sees a compelling interest in regulating the 9 means of production and does not target the underlying 10 content, they can -- they can regulate a depiction, so 11 long as it leaves alternative mechanisms for that 12 expression in -- in place, and that is I think what 13 Ferber -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. And what case -15 what case do you have for that proposition? 16 MR. KATYAL: United States v. Ferber -- New 17 York v. Ferber. In Ferber, the Court -- the Court 18 dealt, as modified or as glossed by your decision in 19 Free Speech Coalition, because what Ferber and Free 20 Speech Coalition together say is that Congress was 21 not -- or the legislature, was not targeting the 22 contents of a depiction; rather, it was trying to get at 23 and dry up the underlying market, child exploitation in 24 that case. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Katyal, the Court
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 summarily dealt with a case some years ago, American 2 Booksellers v. Hudnut, where cities attempted to make 3 not even a criminal offense, but the subject of a civil 4 suit, a violent depiction -- depictions of women as 5 sexual objects enjoying pain and humiliation and 6 degradation. 7 The Seventh Circuit said that that was a 8 blatant violation of the First Amendment, to go after 9 purveyors who show these women in the shocking, 10 degrading photographs, and I believe we summarily 11 affirmed. 12 MR. KATYAL: And this case is fundamentally 13 different from all of those because here Congress is not 14 aiming at the underlying communicative impact. It's not 15 saying, as it was in the -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, of course it is. I 17 mean, you can't separate the means from the end and say, 18 since its end is simply to prevent the -- the activity, 19 the means, which is to prevent the communication, is 20 okay. It is targeting the communication of videos that 21 depict this conduct. 22 MR. KATYAL: Quite to the contrary, Justice 23 Scalia. The bona fides of this statute are evident 24 right on its face, because the very same depictions that 25 Mr. Stevens or anyone else swept up under the statute
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 wants to portray, they can -- they can do it, so long as 2 they use simulated or images. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but to say 4 that they are not concerned with the content, I -- I 5 think is contradicted by the exceptions. You have to 6 look at the content and make a decision, is this bona 7 fide scientific, journalistic, educational, historical? 8 So you have to look at the content to determine whether 9 or not the speech is prohibited. 10 MR. KATYAL: I don't think so, for two 11 reasons. I think what Congress is dealing with with the 12 exemptions clause in this statute was just reflecting 13 the underlying nature of the market that they saw in 14 1999, a for-profit commercial market in cruelty. 15 And so they exempted educational depictions, 16 religious, and so on, because that wasn't what was 17 driving the underlying market for crush videos -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can you tell 19 these aren't political videos? You do have, with 20 organizations, PETA and others, depictions of the same 21 sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support 22 for efforts to prohibit it. Why aren't these videos the 23 exact opposite, you know, efforts to legalize it, and, 24 in each case, it would fall under the political 25 exemption?
8

1 MR. KATYAL: And often they will fall under 2 that exemption. My point is that Congress carved a 3 broad exemption in Section 48 precisely to make sure 4 that expressive messages aren't swept up. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- could you 6 tell me what the difference is between these video and 7 David Roma's documentary on pit bulls? I mean, David 8 Roma's documentary had much, much more footage on the 9 actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here, 10 greater sections of the film, and more explicit. 11 In this film, the -- the Respondent didn't 12 let the video show the actual tearing of the jaw. David 13 Roma's did much more than that, showed much more than 14 that. So isn't -- doesn't there have to be a judgment 15 inherent in this statute? 16 MR. KATYAL: The line will sometimes be 17 difficult to draw, just as its difficult to draw in 18 child pornography -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not in child 20 pornography because, there, Congress says the very 21 act -- it doesn't matter how artistic it is. That very 22 act of child pornography is illegal. 23 MR. KATYAL: Quite to the contrary, Justice 24 Sotomayor. In this -- this Court approved, in Osborne 25 v. Ohio, a statute that's on child pornography, that had
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the following exemption: For a, quote, "bona fide 2 artistic, educational, religious, governmental, 3 judicial, or other purpose by or to a physician, 4 psychologist, sociologist, persons pursuing bona fide 5 research studies, a judge or other persons having a 6 proper interest in the material or performance." 7 And this Court pointed to that exemptions 8 clause to make the statute constitutional at two -- at 9 two pages in that opinion. And so this Court has 10 already gone down the path of saying these decisions are 11 tough to make on a case-by-case basis, but nonetheless 12 the legislature should have a freer hand to act when it 13 is regulating, not the expressive message, but targeting 14 the underlying content, the -- targeting the underlying 15 production, not the content. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Child -- child pornography 17 is obscenity as far as I am concerned, and it has been 18 treated as part of that same traditional classification 19 which there has always been permission for the 20 government to prohibit. This is something quite 21 different. 22 I mean, you know, what if -- what if I -- I 23 am an aficionado of bullfights and I think, contrary to 24 the animal cruelty people, I think it -- they enoble 25 both beast and man, and I want to persuade people that
10

1 bullfights are terrific and we should have them. 2 I would -- I would not be able to -- to 3 market videos showing people how exciting a bullfight 4 is. Right? I would be able to talk and say, oh, you 5 should really allow bullfights, but I cannot make the 6 most significant point that I want to make, get people 7 to watch it. 8 MR. KATYAL: I want to answer your 9 hypothetical, but if I could just have 20 seconds or so 10 to -- to respond more generally to all of these 11 hypotheticals which I think are going to reoccur in the 12 course of our conversation. 13 We believe that Section 48 will have 14 as-applied constitutional challenges that will be 15 inferred from case to case. But what this Court has 16 said is that, in your decision, Justice Scalia, in 17 United States v. Williams, is that we should be careful 18 about that endless stream of fanciful hypotheticals 19 precisely because the test under substantial 20 overbreadth, which knocks an entire act of Congress out 21 on its face, is that there must be a realistic danger 22 that the statute will be applied in -- in the manner the 23 hypothetical suggests. 24 With respect to your bullfighting 25 hypothetical, there is no realistic danger.

1 We have had ten years of experience under the statute. 2 Congress itself said -- the legislative history, which I 3 know will not be of relevance to you but may to others 4 on the Court -- they explicitly exempted Spanish 5 bullfighting and said that is the paradigmatic case of 6 what is educational and artistic and the like. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: What if I made -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Wait. I don't 9 understand that. Any depiction of bullfighting is 10 educational? 11 MR. KATYAL: Spanish depictions of 12 bullfighting -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that is true because 14 Congress said so? 15 MR. KATYAL: Well, that is true because it 16 is educational, and -- and a prosecutor would bear the 17 burden of proof. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess a dogfight is 19 educational, too. 20 MR. KATYAL: And some dogfights certainly 21 are, which is my answer to Justice Sotomayor's question. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, look what you have 23 done, and this is what is bothering me. You take these 24 words, which are a little vague, some of them, "serious 25 religious, political, scientific, educational,
12
Alderson Reporting Company

1 journalistic, historical, or artistic value," and you 2 say that's a standard that a judge or prosecutor will 3 apply. And people have to understand it because they 4 have to know what to do to avoid the risk of being 5 prosecuted. 6 Now, as I have gotten out of these briefs, 7 you then require people to apply that standard, not 8 simply to the crush videos or to the dogfighting, but 9 also to, as Justice Scalia pointed out, bullfighting, 10 sheep hunting, bear hunting, deer hunting, fox hunting, 11 humane slaughter, and for, I think somewhere I found, 12 the stuffing geese for pate de fois gras. 13 All right, so there is a whole long -- quail 14 hunting. There's a whole long list in here of things 15 that people might want to do. They won't know if it 16 falls within this exemption. Nobody in every State 17 wants to forbid these things. Sometimes they are, 18 sometimes they are not. They won't know whether or not 19 they can make this particular film, picture, or other. 20 That's the overbreadth argument. And I would like to 21 hear your response. 22 MR. KATYAL: We have had ten years of 23 experience, Justice Breyer, under the statute, and we 24 haven't seen those things being chilled. Indeed, 25 Respondents --

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an example 2 of a case where we said a statute which might otherwise 3 be overbroad is not overbroad because prosecutors have 4 been restrained? Can you give me one case where we've 5 said that? 6 MR. KATYAL: Last year in United States v. 7 Williams, an opinion that virtually every member of this 8 Court joined, including you, Justice Kennedy, this Court 9 said that it would look to the experience, the 10 post-Ferber experience, in prosecuting cases to decide 11 whether or not a -- two terms in the statute, "promotes" 12 and "presents," were vague and would raise the -13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was a case where 14 we knew what the content was. The content was not 15 subject to an -- to an overbreadth challenge. The 16 content was not. 17 MR. KATYAL: Well, actually, Justice 18 Kennedy, the reason that came up in the case is because 19 there were hypotheticals being advanced such as 20 police -- a man who wants to call the police that says 21 that child pornography arrived in my -- in the mail and 22 so on. And what the Court said is that even though the 23 words in the statute, just as the words in this statute, 24 could be read broadly or narrowly -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that -- that
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 went to intent. It seems to me that -- let me tell you 2 what I think your framework is and if it is wrong, tell 3 me that it is wrong. This statute without the 4 exceptions clause would be wildly overbroad. So you say 5 it's not overly broad because of the exception or the 6 savings clause. I will call it the exceptions. But it 7 seems to me that the exceptions must be then tested as 8 to whether or not they are vague. 9 MR. KATYAL: We do think that the -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you have you to show 11 that they are not vague. 12 MR. KATYAL: We do think that the exceptions 13 clause does some of the constitutional work to exclude 14 some of the hypotheticals like bullfighting and the 15 like. We do think the statute itself has a number of 16 restrictions built into it on its face to -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is a -- what is 18 "and the like"? How about cockfighting? What is the 19 difference between -- perhaps I missed something a few 20 moments ago -- between bullfighting, cockfighting, 21 dogfighting? You say dogfighting is included, but 22 bullfighting -- and I don't know where you put 23 cockfighting. 24 MR. KATYAL: Dogfighting and cockfighting 25 are illegal in all 50 States and therefore would be
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 swept up. Some certain depictions of dogfighting and 2 cockfighting would be swept up, not all. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about 4 bullfighting? Isn't that illegal in -5 MR. KATYAL: It may or may not be. There 6 aren't, at least, specific statutes generally dealing 7 with it, but -8 JUSTICE STEVENS: What about hunting with a 9 bow -- What about hunting with a bow and arrow out of 10 season? 11 MR. KATYAL: Okay. So -12 (Laughter.) 13 MR. KATYAL: In hunting, as well as -14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we -- have we 15 finished with the category of fights? 16 MR. KATYAL: So let me just, to Justice 17 Ginsburg's question. Not all dogfighting videos are 18 swept up by Section 48. There may be educational 19 videos, along the lines that Justice Sotomayor said, 20 raised which are not swept up. Bullfighting is the same 21 basic thing. It's not that there is a categorical -- a 22 categorical exemption on bullfighting; it is rather that 23 there are certain ones that are educational and not, 24 just like in child pornography. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the --
16

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: So noneducational 2 bullfighting would be prohibited? If I market this just 3 because I think, boy, bullfighting is really exciting? 4 MR. KATYAL: If it meets the other terms in 5 the statute, right. So commercial and things like that. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. It is covered. 7 MR. KATYAL: Now, with respect to hunting, 8 hunting is generally not considered animal cruelty. And 9 it doesn't -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but hunting with a bow 11 and arrow, and some depictions of hunting are pretty -12 are pretty gruesome. 13 MR. KATYAL: That's correct. And to the 14 extent that it is something that resembles the terms of 15 the statute, the language of which is "maimed, 16 mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed" -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: "Or killed." How do you 18 limit "killed" to cruel -- you say in your brief that 19 it's noscitur ex sociis. But that's a doctrine that 20 says when you have a string of words, one of which has 21 various meanings, which meaning it has depends upon the 22 words with which it is associated. So if you speak of 23 staples, staples -- what, thumb tacks, nails, and other 24 fasteners, "nails" obviously doesn't mean toenails. It 25 means a nail that is a fastener, the word "nail" having
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 various meanings. 2 "Kill" has one meaning, which is kill. And 3 you can -- you cannot limit that meaning just because in 4 addition to killing you also prohibit torturing and 5 other things. Do you have a single case where -- where 6 that doctrine is used not to give meaning to an 7 ambiguous word, but to limit the meaning of a word which 8 on its face is absolutely clear? 9 MR. KATYAL: Yes, sir, Your Honor. I do. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is that? 11 MR. KATYAL: That is the decision you wrote 12 last year in United States v. Williams, which interprets 13 the words "promotes and presents," which you yourself in 14 the opinion said are capable of a wide variety of 15 meanings. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. 17 MR. KATYAL: And -- and here the word "kill" 18 in context is a term that the statute -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it's not susceptible to 20 a wide -- that's my whole point. It means kill. 21 MR. KATYAL: It means killed in the context 22 of a statute that is defining the words "animal 23 cruelty," and this Court has consistently said that the 24 definition that is being defined by the legislature -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Some people think eating an
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 animal is animal cruelty. These people don't eat meat 2 because it is the product of killing animals. 3 MR. KATYAL: And the legislature under no 4 way, shape, or form was targeting that. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it shouldn't have 6 said that, then. 7 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that it basically 8 did say that by using the words "animal cruelty" in the 9 statute. Now, if there's a disagreement about that -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have a single 11 case in which a -- an absolutely clear word like "kill" 12 is given a more narrow meaning because of other words 13 that are different from that word. 14 MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, in Leocal, this 15 Court defined the term "crime of violence," which the 16 INA had -- that the INA interpreted wrongly. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: So you want to say "cruelly 18 kill"? 19 MR. KATYAL: That's -20 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, "cruelly kill" is not 21 exactly crystal clear. And therefore my question is 22 why, given the need for you to save this statute to read 23 so many words that are so general, those contained here 24 that I've read, cruelly kill, cruelly wound as opposed 25 to just wound or kill. You are doing that in order to
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 prevent chilling people who are engaging in activities 2 that aren't intended to be covered by this statute. 3 Why not do a simpler thing? Rather than let 4 the public guess as to what these words mean, ask 5 Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those 6 frightful things that it was trying to prohibit. Now, 7 that can be done. I don't know why they couldn't do it. 8 MR. KATYAL: And it could have been done in 9 Williams. It could have been done in the child 10 pornography cases, which also have vague terms. But 11 what this Court has said is that using the substantial 12 overbreadth doctrine to do that leaves gaping holes in 13 place. If we followed your invitation, Justice Breyer, 14 we would leave crush videos unprotected. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? You say a crush 16 video, my description that I read of it, you would have 17 a strong case. I'm not saying you would win, I don't 18 have to decide that. But you have a very strong case. 19 So you say to Congress, write a statute that focuses on 20 that. You are worried about dog fighting, write a 21 statute that focuses on that, and moreover, talks about 22 something unlawful in every state. I am not giving 23 Congress advice, though I seem to be. 24 (Laughter.) 25 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just saying why -- why

1 can't you here write a statute that does not force the 2 courts into the work of interpreting these very vague 3 words to prevent the statute from being held 4 unconstitutional? 5 MR. KATYAL: Well, here I think we should 6 give Congress some credit, because what it actually did 7 in the exemption clause was borrow this Court's own 8 jurisprudence from the obscenity context on exceptions 9 like literary, artistic, political and scientific. It 10 had found that -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, would 12 this -- would a statute like this apply to humans be 13 constitutional? You can't depict videos of, say, 14 violent muggings or things of that sort? 15 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think it would be 16 complicated because Congress would have to find that by 17 targeting the underlying videos but leaving alternative 18 simulated mugging videos in place, somehow it would have 19 reduced the market for muggings or something like that. 20 I think that's very hard. And it goes to Justice 21 Ginsburg's question about whether this statute is aimed 22 at the communicative of impact, which we don't think it 23 is, or it is aimed at just reducing the first order 24 problem which is -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the first order problem

1 occurs in states where it is not illegal. These videos 2 are taken in states where bullfighting or dog fighting 3 or cock fighting is entirely legal. So, I don't know 4 how you distinguish a -- a movie which many people think 5 that violence in movie brutalizes people and causes 6 violence in people's action. 7 Why couldn't Congress, persuaded by these 8 people say, you know, you can't have -- cannot depict 9 torture? You know, these horror films that come out 10 around Halloween, you can't depict that anymore. What 11 is the difference between that and what you have done 12 here? 13 MR. KATYAL: So dog fighting is illegal in 14 all 50 states along with crush videos. I don't think 15 that -- there may be -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't -- it 17 isn't -- illegal in Japan, and part of the video here 18 were dog fights in Japan; legal where it occurred, no 19 different from bull fighting. 20 MR. KATYAL: Right. This Court has dealt 21 with that in footnote 19 of Ferber in which it said that 22 just because something is legal somewhere else, it's 23 often very hard to figure out where the underlying 24 material is made. It doesn't have a GPS component. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that wasn't --

1 information. 2 Now, Justice Scalia, you said who knows. I 3 think the answer to that is that this statute places the 4 burden of proof on the government in order to -- in 5 order to prove that there is no historical or 6 educational value. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you dress up like an 8 ancient Roman, the whole thing is of historical 9 interest? 10 (Laughter.) 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that it? 12 MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, I do think that 13 is the Court's own jurisprudence with respect to, for 14 example, obscenity and child pornography, both of which 15 this Court has accepted precisely those types of 16 exceptions. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: A different category. That 18 is traditional First Amendment law that obscenity is not 19 protected. And child pornography, as far as I am 20 concerned, and I think as far as the Court is concerned 21 is obscenity. 22 MR. KATYAL: Well, I don't believe the Court 23 has actually read child pornography to be obscenity. 24 The rationale of Ferber -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Katyal, there is

He was just filming them. And so the -- the -5 the simultaneous abuse of the child, it occurs only 6 because the picture is being taken. The dog fight goes 7 on whether Mr. Stevens is there with his camera or not. 8 MR. KATYAL: Let me say two things about 9 that. First Mr. Stevens, of course, even in the Japan 10 videos you mentioned, he sent his dogs to Japan to -- to 11 fight. And this statute encompasses real time 12 transmissions of -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where it was legal for 14 him to do that. 15 MR. KATYAL: It was, just -- again, like 16 child pornography and the like. The second -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It even -- what I would 18 like you to confront is that the very taking of the 19 picture is the offense. That's the abuse of the child. 20 The abuse of the dog and the promotion of the fight is 21 separate from the filming of it. 22 MR. KATYAL: I agree with that. And I don't 23 think that's what underlay either this Court's Ferber 24 decision or the free speech coalition. The move that 25 Ferber makes is to say that the legislature can target

1 the underlying loaded production, so long as it leaves 2 alternative mechanisms for that same exact message to be 3 spoken. And this statute does that. Mr. Stevens can 4 produce the exact same message, just as long as he 5 doesn't involve the torture or mutilation to an actual 6 living animal. And to compare this -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: His message is that getting 8 animals to fight is fun. That's his message. 9 MR. KATYAL: And Congress hasn't stamped 10 that out. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: To say he -- you know, he 12 can convey that message in some other way, how else does 13 he do it? 14 MR. KATYAL: With simulated messages, the 15 written word. He has written an entire book about that. 16 He has a whole variety -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Simulated dog fights would 18 be okay under this statute? 19 MR. KATYAL: Simulate -- absolutely. This 20 statute leaves that in place, Justice Scalia. That's 21 the key to understanding why this statute is not like 22 the traditional statutes that come before this Court in 23 which the government asserts some paternalistic interest 24 and says viewers can't see this because of the offense 25 of the message.

1 This statute has nothing to do with the 2 offense of the message. It has to do with trying to dry 3 up an underlying market for animal cruelty. 4 If the there are no questions, I would like 5 to reserve the balance of my time. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 7 Ms. Millett. 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT 9 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 10 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 11 please the Court: 12 It is not the exact same message, if you are 13 forced in a popular debate that is going around this 14 country now about the treatment of animals. To require 15 one side to engage -- to use simulated images, which is 16 exactly what the government's reply brief at page 3 17 insists upon, while those who want to ban conduct are 18 allowed to use real images. That puts the government's 19 censorial thumb on the scale of public debate. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: What about crush videos, 21 which apparently were the focus of Congress's attention 22 when it drafted these? Now, I suppose by an analogy to 23 what Justice Scalia just said about the message of dog 24 fighting videos, the people who produce crush videos 25 think they have a message, and the message is that this
27

1 is -- this is sexually exciting or it's exciting in some 2 way to see a woman in high heeled shoes crushing a 3 little animal to death. 4 Do you think that is constitutionally 5 protected? 6 MS. MILLETT: I think -- I think there's 7 a -- that a properly drawn law could very well, at least 8 in my humble opinion, this Court would have to decide, 9 survive strict scrutiny. 10 There is also, I suppose, some argument 11 whether it would fit into -- you wouldn't need strict 12 scrutiny, you would fit it into an unprotected category 13 of speech like obscenity or it would be the production 14 issue that would -- like you have in Ferber. 15 But what -- beyond that I do think we need 16 to keep in mind a couple of things -17 JUSTICE ALITO: You are not -- you are not 18 even willing to say that that could be prohibited? 19 MS. MILLETT: No, no. I think -- I'm saying 20 that there are three alternative ways in which to get to 21 it. My first if one is that not this statute, but under 22 a properly drawn statute -23 JUSTICE ALITO: Under a properly drawn 24 statute -25 MS. MILLETT: -- that might survive
28

1 scrutiny. I'm not sure you would -2 JUSTICE ALITO: Might. I would really like 3 you to tell me whether it would; whether you are willing 4 to concede. Because we are trying to determine whether 5 this is overly broad. And this is the category of 6 activity that Congress particularly targeted. So to me 7 at least it's important to know whether at least as 8 applied to what Congress principally had in mind, the 9 statute could -- could pass constitutional muster. If 10 it were, you know, as applied. 11 MS. MILLETT: I don't -- I don't want to, 12 say this statute, because I don't think this statute -13 but if the statute said, this -- I think this Court 14 disagree -- it disagrees with me sometimes -- but I 15 think this could pass constitutional muster. A statute 16 that says the patently offensive intentional torture and 17 killing of an animal for -- designed to appeal to the 18 prurient interest for the purpose of producing the 19 image, I think that would satisfy -- I think it would 20 satisfy strict scrutiny. The Court might also decide 21 that it's close enough to obscenity or it's like the 22 Ferber production rationale. That's my position; there 23 are sort of three ways it could be analyzed, a statute 24 like that. 25 That's not this statute and I don't think we

1 can say that this statute, because Congress has the 2 authority to reach something, that when it throws a 3 blanket net as wide as this one has that this means this 4 statute is the mechanism, a lawful mechanism for getting 5 -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one more -- one 7 more question along the lines of Justice Alito. Forget 8 this statute. Under a properly drawn statute, suppose 9 that bull-fighting or pitbull-fighting is unlawful in 10 every State. Could a theater have a live broadcast of a 11 pitbull fight in Japan and charge ten dollars? And 12 let's add the hypothetical fact that a lot of the 13 revenue goes back to Japan and promotes more 14 bull-fighting. Could a properly drawn statute prohibit 15 that? And then perhaps Justice Scalia, Alito, has a 16 follow-up question on his own hypothetical. Could a 17 properly drawn statute prohibit that, that speech? 18 MS. MILLETT: A properly drawn statute with 19 the requisite congressional findings or record of a need 20 to attack -- it sound to me like this is a need to 21 attack production. As in child pornography, the fact 22 that the image taking is legal overseas does not mean 23 that it can't be prohibited here. And if you had the 24 type of record of a statute that says we want to stop 25 the production; it's not the content, it is the
30

1 production, as this Court explained in Free Speech 2 Coalition for Child Pornography. 3 But that is a statute that then wouldn't 4 have -- either you would have to decide which things are 5 in and out -- if you started saying animal cruelty 6 production, but we we'll let the bullfights in but the 7 pitbull fights out and the cock fights, then you'd have 8 problems. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We are asking whether or 10 not that specific instance could be prohibited under a 11 properly drawn statute, just like Justice Alito's 12 hypothetical was under a properly drawn statute you 13 could prohibit the conduct, the speech broadcast in that 14 conduct. 15 MS. MILLETT: The theory -- I mean, 16 ultimately this Court would have to decide whether 17 Ferber is limited to an obscenity that's historically 18 unprotected by the First Amendment. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So your answer to my 20 hypothetical is yes it could be prohibited under a 21 properly drawn statute? 22 MS. MILLETT: If this Court -- two things. 23 It would have to be a very, very narrowly drawn statute, 24 I think going to the production theory like Ferber; and 25 the question I think before this Court would be, given
31

1 the nature of the harm that presumably would be found, 2 the nature of the market, the synergistic effect, where 3 the -- I am assuming the findings here would be that the 4 crime and the image are one and the same, inextricably 5 intertwined -- then maybe, although I still think it 6 would be a bit harder because we are dealing with the 7 First Amendment here. We don't make it up as we go 8 along. At the time that the First Amendment was written 9 dog-fighting was legal in this country. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: But the point -- the point 11 I guess is when you say yes to this, what you are 12 thinking is that, just as real obscenity when depicted 13 does nothing communicative but rather appeals to the 14 instinct of lust, so Congress could find a category of 15 things that do not communicate, but appeal to the 16 instinct of sadism; and that is true when other 17 creatures are killed for the pleasure of the people who 18 want to see them killed. 19 Now, that's what you are saying. Now -- and 20 I think maybe that's true. We don't have to decide 21 that, perhaps. But the government says that is this 22 statute, that is this statute read in light of its basic 23 intent, and it is up to the Court to interpret it so as 24 it achieves that objective. And you say that's not 25 possible. Why not?

MILLETT: Alchemy, alchemy. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. 8 MS. MILLETT: There's construction of -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's such an unusual word. 10 I haven't heard it in a legal argument in a long time. 11 MS. MILLETT: We don't often get statutes 12 that are so far off base that we're going, I think in my 13 opinion, so far beyond construing ambiguity and doing 14 instead what was asked of this Court and the Court 15 declined in Reno v. ACLU, and that is to write the 16 statute for Congress. 17 The ambiguity, as, Justice Scalia, you 18 explained -- you would have to excise this statute in 19 and out, sever so many things. I don't know what you'd 20 have left unless it's the statute I posited to Justice 21 Alito, which might have a couple of words that overlap 22 with this statute. But that is not statutory 23 construction. This Court's job is not to write the 24 statute for Congress. 25 And also keep in mind, in the past this

1 Court consistently under the First Amendment has 2 required, not just the right words, but a record from 3 Congress. In the First Amendment area we can't just 4 posit the problems; we have to really have confidence 5 that -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does this -- would this 7 record support any ban? I mean, there was a real 8 concentration on crush videos. So there is that. Is 9 there anything else in the current record other than the 10 crush videos? 11 MS. MILLETT: No, there is not. And in fact 12 they spent their time, as we said in our brief -- and 13 this is perfectly accurate. Members of Congress, to the 14 extent they discussed other things, kept saying in the 15 floor debates: That's not in; bull-fighting's not in; 16 dog-fighting's not in; hunting's not in; these things 17 are not in. So they mentioned them in the context of 18 saying these are not in. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I think -20 I think Ferber analytically is the hard case for you, 21 because the Court in Ferber did said -- and I am quoting 22 from page 763: "The evil to be restricted so 23 overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interest at 24 stake." That was their articulation of the test. Now, 25 why shouldn't we apply that test to this statute?
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MS. MILLETT: I don't think that is a legal 2 test that is adopted under the First Amendment. I think 3 that is a description of the types of categories that by 4 history and tradition had been outside the First 5 Amendment and the rationale for why Ferber came in, 6 which was, yes, there's overlap, but I think it actually 7 bridges the world of obscenity and virtual incitement 8 because you have the crime and the image one and the 9 same wrapped up together. 10 There is in this instance -- there are about 11 five different ways that this is different from child 12 pornography. The first is that there has never been any 13 finding, any assertion, even by the government, that 14 creating the image is the primary or sole motive for 15 creating these images. It's not if you lock Mr. Stevens 16 up -- if you throw away every dog-fighting video in the 17 country tomorrow, dog-fighting will continue. It -- no 18 one thinks that it will go away. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think the government 20 does. It says that is how you dry up the market. 21 MS. MILLETT: But you don't dry up the 22 market by having a sweeping value exception like they 23 have here. If Congress wants to dry up the market, what 24 Ferber says is there's two things that have to happen: 25 One, you've got to prove causation. You can't simply
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 say, we got a problem, let's go first to the speech and 2 cut that off as our first prosecutorial tool when we are 3 not even ready to make the crime itself a felony, but we 4 will make the speech a felony. 5 You've got to prove causation, that these 6 images cause the harm, they are one and the same with 7 the harm as they are with child pornography. You also 8 have got to prove that Congress is acting in an 9 evenhanded way. It is not leaving, as Justice Scalia 10 said, appreciable damage to the interests that its 11 asserting uncovered by its many, many exceptions. 12 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question 13 about your view of the breadth of the statute. I didn't 14 yet really get an answer out of your opponent. Do you 15 think the statute would prohibited depictions of hunting 16 if it involved killing in the District of Columbia, 17 because hunting as I understand it is not allowed in the 18 District of Columbia, it's prohibited. Does that mean 19 that any depictions of hunting that show the killing and 20 cruelty are prohibited by this statute? 21 MS. MILLETT: Well, they are prohibited 22 subject to the value police and the value trial like we 23 had here, which I think is antithetical to the First 24 Amendment. It's a very different rule under the 25 obscenity statute. So it would all depend on whether a
36
Alderson Reporting Company

1 jury decided that that had serious value, which was 2 defined as significant and great import in this 3 particular case. That would decide whether -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's just not significant 5 value; significant artistic, educational. What are the 6 others? Scientific? 7 MS. MILLETT: Scientific, social, artistic, 8 journalistic -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Strictly entertainment 10 value doesn't count, does it? 11 MS. MILLETT: No, it does not. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: And most of the hunting 13 videos I have seen people watch for the entertainment. 14 They like to see a hunt. 15 MS. MILLETT: I think that's exactly right 16 and that's what the Safari Club and the NRA have told 17 us. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, but 19 this definition or these exceptions are not drawn out of 20 thin air. They are drawn from Miller, and the Court in 21 Miller recognized that they were significant in causing 22 the restriction of obscenity to pass constitutional 23 muster. 24 MS. MILLETT: First of all, this is about 25 -- this is Miller doubled -- there's a lot more here
37

ACLU 4 that Miller only works if you have all three prongs. 5 You can't just use the serious value prong to take 6 care of your constitutional problem. Second, you were 7 dealing in an area that by history and tradition is 8 unprotected speech. Milller -9 JUSTICE ALITO: But in determining whether 10 this is over -- overly broad, do we -- do we think of all 11 of the hypotheticals that we possibly can think of that 12 might fall within this statute: somebody hunting in the 13 District of Columbia, somebody producing fois gras with 14 a goose and say, "Well, we've thought of a lot of 15 hypothetical situations where this statute might apply 16 and therefore it's overly broad"? Or do we look at 17 what's going on in the real world? 18 MS. MILLETT: I think what you do is you 19 look at text of the statute, and then you ask yourself, 20 how much of a strain is it to come up with a factual 21 pattern that will fit into it? In Williams you had to 22 first of all read the -23 JUSTICE ALITO: So we really think of all 24 the hypotheticals.

1 doctrine? 2 MS. MILLETT: I think at some level Congress 3 has a job to write with a scalpel and not a buzz saw in 4 the First Amendment area, and the only way to ensure 5 that happens is to look at the text and say, does this 6 text fit the purpose, does it fit what the Constitution 7 will allow? And when the -8 JUSTICE ALITO: If it's the fact that during 9 the ten years when this statute has been in effect there 10 has been no decrease in hunting videos and hunting shows 11 on TV, and all of the rest -- the only perceptible 12 change in the real world is that these -- is that the 13 market for crush videos dried up, at least until the 14 Third Circuit's decision, does that have any relevance? 15 MS. MILLETT: I don't -- I don't think it 16 does for this reason. People -- and this gets a little 17 bit to Justice Kennedy's vagueness concern. People have 18 a right to know how to -- outside the courtroom how to 19 conform their conduct to the law. If I got a call from 20 the general counsel of Outdoor Channel or someone making 21 hunting videos and they said, "Does this fall within 22 this statute," I wouldn't have to come up with a 23 strained factual scenario. I would say yeah, it falls 24 squarely in, subject to a prosecutor or jury anywhere 25 where you market in this country, deciding that it has
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 serious -- one of the adjectives -- value. I would have 2 to say that to that person, and that would be accurate 3 legal advice. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could be that the reason 5 hunting videos are still out there is that the producers 6 were quite confident that this Court would not allow 7 them to be prohibited on the base of a statute such as 8 this. 9 MS. MILLETT: One would hope, and I think 10 quite frankly the NRA has been quite honest when it 11 recently said you know, this -- this is not an actively 12 enforced statute. People were shocked to learn -- to 13 become aware of it. 14 Now maybe everyone's supposed to know the 15 existence of laws, but I think the reality is that once 16 people looked at what this said, they became very, very, 17 very concerned, and I think when you're talking about a 18 criminal prohibition here -- this is not a civil suit, 19 this is criminal prohibition with severe penalties. The 20 penalties for speech are higher than most animal cruelty 21 statutes. And the whole point of the criminal law is to 22 deter conduct and to make people stay wide of the 23 margins here, wide of the borders. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -25 MS. MILLETT: You can't do that in the First
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Amendment. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood your 3 answers to Justice Alito to acknowledge that there would 4 be situations where this statute could be 5 constitutionally applied, or as you put it, you could 6 draft a statute. 7 MS. MILLETT: Not this statute. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not this statute. 9 But -10 MS. MILLETT: That's different. I think 11 that's very different. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if in fact there 13 were situations where we thought a narrowly drafted 14 statute could be applied to particular instances, 15 perhaps the crush videos, perhaps others, why isn't that 16 enough to say that this statute is valid on its face and 17 then we will consider as-applied challenges? 18 MS. MILLETT: I think in the First 19 Amendment -- I'm not talking -- if I heard you right we 20 were not talking about this statute. If you have 21 another statute -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I am just 23 trying to get at what your understanding of what the 24 test is for overbreadth in this area. How much of an 25 area of constitutional application is necessary before
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you decide that a statute is not unconstitutional on its 2 face, but will consider as-applied challenges? 3 MS. MILLETT: Right. And this Court has 4 been clear that the overbreadth has to be both 5 quantitative and qualitative. It hasn't set a 6 particular ratio. I think this one is easy. We are 7 talking about 2,000 crush videos and tens if not 8 hundreds of thousands of other images that are captured 9 by this statute. I think normally when this Court says 10 it wants to -- to apply overbreadth, it has been dealing 11 with situations for the most part in two contexts. One 12 where Congress has already regulated in an area that is 13 unprotected under the First Amendment, unprotected in 14 the sense that they are allowed to ban, regulate 15 heavily. They are already there, and the question is 16 did they draw the margins too broad? 17 That is not this case. We are dealing in an 18 area that was never until December 1999 barred by 19 anybody, never considered to be outside the conception 20 of the First Amendment's freedom of speech. The other 21 scenario where we see substantial overbreadth is when 22 Congress is regulating conduct. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't that -- isn't 24 that due to changes in technology? Before people could 25 show -- could watch videos at home, this sort of thing
42

I'm not sure 4 it wouldn't cover a sketch artist or a hieroglyphic, for 5 all I know. All it requires is that it be a depiction 6 in some form. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: And is there -- in the real 8 world is there a market for sketches of dog fights? 9 MS. MILLETT: I don't know if there's a 10 market -11 JUSTICE ALITO: People get a thrill from 12 seeing that? 13 MS. MILLETT: With respect, I can't answer 14 that. I'm not -- I don't know if there is a market for 15 dog fighting videos. There is a few, but it depends on 16 what you mean by a market. Will somebody buy something? 17 I guess somebody in this world will buy anything. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any indication 19 that there has been any dry-up of the market for dog 20 fights as a result of this statute? 21 MS. MILLETT: There -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Alito suggested 23 that until the Third Circuit's decision, that there were 24 fewer crush videos produced. But with respect to dog 25 fights, animal fights, is there any indication that
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there has been -- there have been fewer animal fights as 2 a result of this statute? 3 MS. MILLETT: None whatsoever, and in fact 4 what we've seen is robust enforcement, and we cite the 5 article in our case, we have seen robust enforcement; 6 there was just an arrest a few weeks ago for I think a 7 couple hundred people involved in dog fighting rings. 8 So the dog fighting rings are going on unabated and they 9 are getting found and discovered and prosecuted 10 successfully, and in fact the images sometimes help with 11 the prosecution. 12 This is a place, when we start talking we 13 are going to take something outside the First Amendment, 14 one of the other things that unifies the categories of 15 speech outside the First Amendment is a judgment that 16 more speech doesn't work. This is an area where we know 17 speech works powerfully. Speech about these ugly images 18 produced this statute. It informed people. Unlike 19 children and child pornography, people need to see 20 images to understand what's going on with animals, and 21 to make these important decisions and engage in these 22 important debates that our society is having. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose an argument -24 excuse me. 25 Suppose an argument had been made to the

That's it seems to me what the problem is 11 here. Not -12 MS.

1 about what the government calls the "snuff video 2 situation." 3 This whole reason that this is created is 4 for purposes of creating the image. If you establish 5 the causation -- and I don't think we -- the Court does 6 just defer to Congress on these things. 7 It looks carefully at factual records in -8 as it has in the child pornography are under the First 9 Amendment, Justice Kennedy. If Congress proves the 10 causation and shows that it is -- it's the least 11 restrictive means -- compelling and least restrictive 12 means, the strict scrutiny that Congress -- the 13 government never wanted this statute to march through. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: And what if there is no 15 chance of drawing up the activity? Suppose you have the 16 ethnic cleansing channel on cable TV, and there is no -17 this is taking place in a country that's beyond our 18 power to influence. Congress couldn't prohibit that? 19 MS. MILLETT: The -- the fact that conduct 20 is repulsive or offensive does not mean we automatically 21 ban the speech. You would have to have -- it would have 22 to follow this Court's patterns, either it would be an 23 even-handed ban on production, under the Ferber theory, 24 or you would have to establish if those images were 25 never within the constraints.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: I think what -- I think 2 what's going on is -- is not -- your conflating two 3 things. One is you are trying to produce education 4 about something that has no communicative value. 5 In so far as you are trying to make an 6 argument or educate, of course, it is protected, but the 7 government, here, is saying I think the statute is 8 intended to forbid a different thing entirely, and it's 9 hard to draw a line. 10 Maybe it's impossible; but promoting a thing 11 which communicates nothing, but appeals to people's 12 worst instinct, that is not to advocate it or not to 13 advocate it. 14 It is to try to make money out of it, and 15 that's what they think, I believe, the statute is aimed 16 at. 17 MS. MILLETT: Well -18 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's why they have the 19 journalistic exception. 20 MS. MILLETT: The -- when it comes to 21 promoting illegal conduct, we have the Brandenburg Test, 22 and, if you are close enough to be inciting it, to be 23 causing it -- which I think is where Ferber, largely, 24 is. They are just intertwined. That's one thing. But 25 if it's not -- just because we have the really

1 disgusting, despicable channel doesn't mean that we 2 automatically ban it. Maybe it will be educational. 3 Maybe we will learn from it. 4 I think Congress is going to have to show, 5 before it goes to speech as its first tool of repression 6 to attack conduct with, very specialized, narrow 7 circumstances. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: We are going to advertise a 9 drug that is known to kill people. 10 MS. MILLETT: That is commercial -11 JUSTICE BREYER: We are advertising -12 MS. MILLETT: That is commercial speech. 13 The fact that you want to get paid for speaking does not 14 make it commercial speech. 15 Samuel Johnson, himself, said that no one 16 but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money. I don't 17 necessarily agree with that, but it is -- it would be a 18 shock to him, to Thomas Payne, who sold his tracks of 19 "Common Sense," that the First Amendment would go all -20 leap all the way from commercial speech and say, just 21 because you are doing it for money, you need to make a 22 buck. 23 Your Honor -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought that 25 your response to Justice Breyer's comment about catering

1 to people's worst instincts in the area of the First 2 Amendment, at least, would have been that it's not up to 3 the government to decide what are people's worst 4 instincts. 5 If -- if the First Amendment means anything, 6 that's what it means. 7 MS. MILLETT: Well, it means -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not up to the 9 government to tell us what our worst instincts are -10 MS. MILLETT: It means -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except for those areas that 12 have traditionally been outside the area of -- of 13 protected speech, and -- and once you allow this one, 14 what other -- what other base instincts do people have, 15 besides this one? 16 One can contemplate a lot of other areas, 17 where government could say, You are appealing to 18 people's worst instincts, and, therefore, the -- the 19 movies cannot be made. 20 MS. MILLETT: I agree, Justice Scalia. The 21 answer to that instance is more speech under the First 22 Amendment. The answer -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I'm sorry.

MILLETT: If it did, it would have to be 11 even-handed and have narrow tailoring, but the problem 12 is -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you mean by 14 "even-handed," please?

1 movies -- snuff movies. I don't know if they really 2 exist, but they have been described. 3 MS. MILLETT: No one has ever found one, 4 but the point I'm trying to get -- there are two 5 theories -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Adolf Hitler, can we keep 7 him off the screen, too? 8 MS. MILLETT: It's a dangerous proposition. 9 That's what the First Amendment says we won't do. There 10 is -- so if it's just that we don't like the content, 11 outside obscenity, we -- Congress doesn't get to ban it. 12 The answer is more speech. 13 If you have got -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we don't like -15 we don't like human sacrifice, and so Congress passes a 16 law saying you cannot have a channel that shows human 17 sacrifice -- real human sacrifice. You think that is 18 unconstitutional? 19 MS. MILLETT: I think, if the point is that 20 we don't like the could content, we don't -- we want to 21 protect people from these images, the First Amendment 22 says a lot about that. 23 If it's a different -- snuff video, because, 24 like child pornography, like I said, it's not the 25 content that we are concerned about, where obscenity is

1 a pure content baseline. 2 It is -- we got to stop -- we can't stop the 3 conduct. The conduct and the speech are inextricably 4 intertwined. The only way we can stop human sacrifice 5 is to stop the image because the sacrifice is solely 6 for the image. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right, but, I 8 mean, the hypothetical is we can't do anything about it. 9 It is beyond our reach to stop the human sacrifice 10 taking place wherever in the world, so that that 11 argument -- the Ferber argument is off the table. 12 In that situation, you think it's 13 unconstitutional for Congress to pass a law saying there 14 can be no human sacrifice channel. 15 MS. MILLETT: I -- I think the fact that -16 I think it would be a lot harder under the First 17 Amendment to say why Congress is doing that. 18 If it's not something -- if it's not conduct 19 it has any authority to regulate, I don't -- then the 20 only compelling interest is -- I'm trying -- I mean, I 21 don't want to watch this channel, and people should 22 fight with their wallets and their votes and not support 23 these things, but -- I'm sorry. 24 May I finish? 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Go ahead.

1 MS. MILLETT: But, under the First 2 Amendment, if the only rationale Congress is giving is 3 we are here to shield your eyes for you, we will make 4 this censorial decision, it has got to find some basis 5 to think that was never freedom of the speech under the 6 First Amendment, in the way that obscenity was. 7 You don't get to make it up as you go along. 8 We are interpreting a constitution. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 10 Mr. Katyal, you have three minutes 11 remaining. 12 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 13 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 14 MR. KATYAL: There is one analytic move 15 Congress made in Section 48, which is simple and 16 obvious, and it explains why both the human sacrifice 17 channel is constitutional, as well as Section 48 itself. 18 That is the logic of Ferber. When Congress 19 tries to dry up a market for underlying cruelty by 20 targeting depictions and leaves alternative mechanisms 21 for that expression in place, the legislature has 22 latitude. 23 When the statute is not aimed at the 24 communicative impact of the message, like the Hitler 25 video, but, rather, is aimed at reducing underlying acts

1 of exploitation, that is an area which Congress has 2 great leeway. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. Are 4 you saying, since there is no human sacrifice in this 5 country and no market to be dried up, the videos would 6 be okay? 7 MR. KATYAL: I'm saying that, if Congress 8 identified a market and if a video -- if the snuff video 9 market was driving, somehow, people to get killed, 10 Congress would be fully within its power to regulate it. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah; but we don't have any 12 human sacrifice. Nobody's doing that stuff. So you 13 could not proscribe the human sacrifice channel. 14 MR. KATYAL: That's precisely correct, but, 15 here, Congress did find an overwhelming market in animal 16 cruelty, and the State attorney's general that filed a 17 brief before you saying that Section 48 is a success 18 story, that it dried up 3,000 crush videos, that it has 19 reduced the market for animal -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many prosecutions 21 have there been for crush videos? 22 MR. KATYAL: There -- there haven't been any 23 prosecutions for crush videos, and I think the reason is 24 because the market dried up very quickly after the 25 enactment of Section 48.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did I just 2 understand you to agree with your colleague on the other 3 side, that Congress could not ban the human sacrifice 4 channel because there would be no connection between 5 drying up the underlying activity? 6 MR. KATYAL: Oh, no. If there is an 7 underlying argument -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I'm saying there 9 is no connection. We can't reach the activity where it 10 is taking place. 11 MR. KATYAL: I think that does start to 12 reach into questions about obscenity and expressive 13 impact on viewers, which is not before this Court. 14 Congress is not resting its judgment here on something 15 saying these images are repulsive and can't be seen. 16 Rather, it is saying -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if Congress is -18 and we will give you sufficient rebuttal time. 19 So, if Congress is saying, Look, we just 20 don't like what -- is being shown on the human sacrifice 21 channel, we don't want people to see it, they can't do 22 that? 23 MR. KATYAL: Again, that raises a whole 24 different set of questions under obscenity and 25 expressive impact that isn't before the Court here.

1 Now, if I could return to, Justice Stevens, 2 you had he wasn't clear on the position on hunting. I 3 want to be very clear on this. 4 Hunting, like the other hypotheticals, is 5 not covered by section 48 for two reasons: First, the 6 statute -- the statute's term "animal cruelty" should be 7 defined to encompass torture, mutilation and the like, 8 and not simple acts of ordinary hunting, most of which, 9 by the way, are legal anyway under animal cruelty. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: How about the statute's 11 term, "kill" -12 MR. KATAYAL: And again -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what should that be 14 interpreted to mean? 15 MR. KATYAL: And again, Justice Scalia, as I 16 said before, I think that comes within a definition of 17 animal cruelty. That's the term being defined. And 18 just as this Court has defined, for example, crimes of 19 violence to exclude certain things that otherwise would 20 be within the statute, such as drunk driving offenses in 21 the context of the IMA, a similar result is possible 22 here, particularly because of the doctrine of 23 constitutional avoidance. 24 And, so, we are saying that if this Court 25 were to write an opinion that made clear that these
58

1 things are outside of the purview of section 48, there 2 would be no chilling effect, and you wouldn't have to -3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Wait, I want to just be 4 sure I understand you. Even if the hunting depiction is 5 very offensive and cruel and all the rest, and that the 6 cruelty to the animal using bow and arrows or knives or 7 something, you say it's not -- and even if it's illegal 8 in this particular jurisdiction, you say the statute 9 still does not apply at all? 10 MR. KATYAL: It would have to be for a 11 reason of animal cruelty or something like torture, 12 mutilation and the like. So there may be certain 13 hunting examples that fall within it -14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the hunting would 15 never qualify, because the hunter's motive is benign; is 16 that what you are saying? 17 MR. KATYAL: No, it has nothing to do with 18 the motive, it has to do with what happens to the 19 animal. And, so, there could be images of hunting which 20 are not really hunting, like the images in this case. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you shoot a little low 22 and wound the animal, that is cruelty even though you 23 didn't intend that. 24 MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, with all due 25 respect, I think the images in this case and what

1 Congress was getting at was not shooting a little low. 2 These are the most horrific images that you can imagine 3 of cruelty to living animals. And that's what 4 Congress -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what about your 6 response to Justice Stevens on the hunting matter? I 7 understand Congress wasn't directed at -8 MR. KATYAL: And my point if those -- if 9 there are those cases at the area -- at the gray areas, 10 that is perfect for as applied challenge, but it's not 11 what this Court -- this Court shouldn't be blessing the 12 Third Circuit's decision to in toto invalidate an entire 13 statute which has produced -- which has produced 3,000 14 crush videos and the like. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel, 16 both counsel, for very able presentation.
