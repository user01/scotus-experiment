1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:09 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 4 argument this morning in Case 09-337, Krupski v. Costa 5 Crociere, S.p.A. 6 Mr. Bendure. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. BENDURE 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. BENDURE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 This case revolves around Rule 15(c)(1)(C) 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In pertinent 13 part, if two subsections are -- are satisfied, the rule 14 permits relation back of an amendment adding a new 15 defendant after expiration of the limitations period. 16 The courts below found, and Respondent does 17 not question, that we satisfied the first subsection: 18 Notice and no prejudice. That arose from the service of 19 the original complaint upon Costa Cruise, the agent and 20 corporate affiliate represented by the same attorney as 21 Respondent Costa Crociere. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know, Mr. Bendure, 23 what exactly the corporate relationship was between the 24 two? 25 MR. BENDURE: No, Your Honor, not the
3 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 corporate relation. The functional relationship as 2 described in the affidavit is that Costa Cruise is the 3 booking agent for Costa Crociere. And for the notice 4 procedure, according to the affidavit of Mr. Klutz, 5 Costa Cruise engaged the IRSI adjustment service to 6 resolve claims arising on the ship. So in that respect 7 it was also, in our view, an agent of Costa Crociere. 8 But the specific corporate relationship is not known. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you. 10 MR. BENDURE: Because of that timely service 11 on Costa Cruise, we satisfied the first subsection. And 12 as this Court noted in Schiavone, timely service on one 13 defendant may serve to give imputed notice to a related 14 defendant, which is what we have here. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your -16 your client tripped over the cable, right? 17 MR. BENDURE: Correct. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the case 19 were there were two people behind her and she was 20 pushed? And she didn't know which one pushed her, Jones 21 or Smith. So she sues Jones, and Smith knows all about 22 it because, of course, he's a key witness or whatever. 23 Can he be substituted later on because he was the person 24 she should have sued? 25 MR. BENDURE: If you're talking about a lack
4 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of knowledge of the real name, probably -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just the real 3 name. It's not that Jones pushed her, but his real name 4 is Johnson. It's that Jones -- whoever pushed her; I 5 forget -- but one guy -6 (Laughter.) 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the people pushed 8 her, and she named that -- she named the other person. She 9 made a mistake about who pushed her. Can they have 10 substitution in that case? 11 MR. BENDURE: I would say yes, because -12 again, assuming that all of the other criteria are 13 satisfied. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. The non-pusher 15 has notice -16 MR. BENDURE: Yes. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and everything else. 18 But there's no relationship between the two of them. 19 MR. BENDURE: It's -- it's obviously a 20 slightly different and more difficult case from our 21 perspective, but what I think is critical is the status 22 that's involved. In this particular case, the suit was 23 filed against the vessel operator, and that vessel 24 operator was identified as Costa Cruise, when we know 25 that the actual identity was Costa Crociere.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the first -2 when was your first notice of that? I mean, it was on 3 the first page of the ticket, but the answer came after 4 the statute of limitations. Was that your first notice 5 that there was this different entity, or did you know 6 that earlier? 7 MR. BENDURE: It was -- we say that was the 8 first notice. Now, the circuit court used an imputed 9 knowledge rationale to suggest that the inclusion of the 10 name "Costa Crociere" within the definitions section 11 gave us what I would call constructive notice. But in 12 terms of actual knowledge that -- that we had sued the 13 wrong party, it was the answer which was filed after -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't -- I didn't 15 understand you to deny that the ticket made it very 16 clear who operated the ship. 17 MR. BENDURE: I'm not sure -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you contest that? 19 MR. BENDURE: I contest that it makes it 20 very clear, but I don't contest that one could conclude 21 that that provided constructive notice, that if read 22 carefully one might infer. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why not? Don't you 24 read the contract carefully before you bring a lawsuit? 25 MR. BENDURE: Well, actually it was under
6 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 definitions. And according to the definitions, Costa 2 Crociere fell within the same definition of "carrier" as 3 the steward, the ship itself, any -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you are -- you either 5 are contesting or you're not contesting that it's clear 6 from the ticket. I had assumed it was clear from the 7 ticket. 8 MR. BENDURE: I'm not -- I am not agreeing 9 that it's clear. I am agreeing that it provides 10 constructive notice from which one might infer that. 11 Not clear, but discernible. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you had -- so then you 13 had notice even before the suit was filed. It was on 14 the -- it was on the ticket. 15 MR. BENDURE: We had what the circuit court 16 referred to as "imputed knowledge." Now, I think there's 17 a -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the -- did the name 19 show up any place other than page 1 of the general 20 conditions of passage? 21 MR. BENDURE: I don't believe so, Your 22 Honor. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- and this is 24 what? An 11-page, very small print -25 MR. BENDURE: It's an 11-page, small print
7 Alderson Reporting Company

1 document. And one thing that bears mention is that 2 reference is under the designation "Definitions," 3 because Respondent makes some hay out of the fact that 4 we complied with other requirements which are under a 5 different heading which says "Limitations of liability." 6 But what we also had was that we purchased 7 the ticket from Costa Cruise; it was sent by Costa 8 Cruise. We had the pre-suit notice sent to Costa 9 Cruise, responded by the -- the gentleman under the 10 heading "Costa" that says "claims administrator for 11 Costa Cruise." So there was certainly what I would call 12 conflicting information at best about which was the name 13 of the actual vessel operator. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not if you read the 15 definitions on page 1. And if you are not going to read 16 all 11 pages before you file suit, I would think you 17 would at least read page 1. And that, it seems to me, 18 made it clear. 19 MR. BENDURE: Well, it -- well, under the 20 same definition, the steward would be a carrier every 21 bit as much as Costa Crociere, S.p.A. So it seems to me 22 by that reasoning you could conclude that the steward or 23 the janitor is the vessel operator because they are 24 likewise defined as the carrier in that definitional 25 section.

1 And, in fact, it also includes the vessel 2 itself within the definition. So let's assume that my 3 client had, instead of suing Costa Cruise, sued Costa 4 Magica, the name of the vessel itself. Most of the 5 cases would say that an amendment like that to add the 6 actual name, once you have identified the status of the 7 defendant you seek to sue, falls within the 8 subsection (ii), which is addressed primarily to the 9 constructive notice of the defendant, that they knew or 10 should have known that they would have been brought in 11 the suit but for a mistake concerning the proper party's 12 identity. 13 But the general focus of that second subsection, 14 I think, is to look to whether this defendant knew or 15 should have known that it was the intended target. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me -- I've been 17 thinking about the Chief Justice's question where the two 18 people are pushed and you don't know which person -- or 19 two people fired the shotgun, and there's only one pellet, 20 and you don't know which gun the pellet came from. In 21 that case, I think we could stipulate that even by 22 reasonable inquiry, you wouldn't know. 23 In your case, I think the -- and I think the 24 difference in the case is that "reasonable inquiry" 25 means you should have known. So now we have a rule that
9 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 excuses something you should have known but doesn't 2 excuse something you -- you couldn't have known, which 3 seems odd. And because it's odd, therefore, maybe 4 that's why it only applies to clerical errors. 5 MR. BENDURE: Well, actually when it talks 6 of mistake, it seems to me that the very notion of 7 mistake connotes error. I looked at a couple of 8 definitions, dictionary definitions. Merriam Webster's 9 defines a mistake as, quote, "a wrong judgment" or, 10 quote, "a wrong action or statement proceeding from 11 faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or inattention." 12 So, at least in that colloquial sense, the very nature of 13 mistake implies some measure of blameworthiness. 14 And, indeed, it's hard to conceive of a 15 mistake that couldn't be avoided. And I think that's 16 the problem with looking to the ticket, because what the 17 definition on the ticket essentially says is: With due 18 diligence, you might have avoided the mistake. 19 But in my view, and I think in the view of 20 the language of the rule, that doesn't change the very 21 nature of it as being a mistake. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -23 MR. BENDURE: Certainly. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- assume I accept 25 your argument, and I am the cruise operator -- the
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 cruise owner, cruise ship owner, and I look at the 2 complaint, and I say: I think they really meant me, 3 but -- I think. Now, within the 4(m) period, which is 4 the period in which I am supposed to reasonably know 5 that I would have been named absent a mistake, here an 6 answer is filed, and you are told there is a mistake, 7 and you don't correct the mistake. What conclusion 8 would a reasonable person at that second juncture make 9 about whether you made a mistake or not? 10 MR. BENDURE: I think -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I think that's what 12 the issue is here, which is, assuming the complaint 13 could be read as a mistake during the 4(m) period, 14 wasn't that mistake corrected, and you refused or failed 15 to act? 16 MR. BENDURE: Let me respond both legally 17 and factually. Legally, I submit that it doesn't make a 18 difference because under the text of the rule if during 19 that 4(m) period they had the knowledge that you're 20 suggesting and which would be suggested by the 21 Respondent when they say, I think, if you had filed the 22 amended complaint and served it a month after the answer, 23 it would have been timely, we would have done it. 24 That acknowledges that there was a mistake, 25 and once there is a mistake, if during that 120-day
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 period they knew or should have known that it would have 2 been brought against them but for the mistake, that 3 knowledge doesn't evaporate by later events, as long as 4 there is knowledge during that period. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That makes so little 6 sense to me. Here I think -- and for the following 7 reason: You seriously I don't think could contend that 8 if you had sought to amend a year later, that that would 9 have been timely, correct? 10 MR. BENDURE: Correct. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But putting 12 aside prejudice -13 MR. BENDURE: Okay. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what the lower court 15 said was because your delay speaks to a choice, that 16 that's the only thing a reasonable defendant would have 17 assumed, that having been told that you sued the wrong 18 party and you continued in that action, that that's what 19 you intended to do, to sue that wrong party. 20 MR. BENDURE: Let me point out factually -21 and I did not stress it in my brief. The answer was 22 filed on February 25th. Twenty-three days later, on 23 March 20th, the court entered a scheduling order which 24 said: You have until the end of June to amend your 25 complaint to add parties.
12 Alderson Reporting Company

1 So it seems to me that a defendant faced 2 with a court order that says the time for amendment 3 extends till the end of June would not be drawing any 4 conclusions that the plaintiff's state of mind had 5 changed. And one difficulty with trying to look at 6 different points during the 120-day period is that it 7 seems to me you'd have a constantly moving target. 8 If you say that we satisfied 120(m) at one 9 point in time but somehow that's not enough and at a 10 later point in time maybe they didn't know it any more, 11 and then perhaps I guess in theory you could have them 12 again -- if we had sent them a letter even after that and 13 said, you know, we really did mean it, and then for some 14 reason they concluded otherwise, you'd have a constantly 15 moving target. And that's -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bendure, would you 17 explain one factual matter to me? I might have gotten 18 this wrong, but I thought the answer was filed after the 19 1 year had run. 20 MR. BENDURE: It had. It had. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So when the answer was 22 filed it was too late for you to come within the statute 23 of limitations. 24 MR. BENDURE: Absolutely true. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I thought that would be
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the answer that you would give to Justice Sotomayor, 2 because when you got the answer -- which was filed after 3 how many days? 4 MR. BENDURE: It was filed I think 24 days 5 after the complaint. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had gotten that a 7 few days earlier, you could have amended, and then we 8 wouldn't be here. 9 MR. BENDURE: That's certainly true, Your 10 Honor. And I think it also -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You have 12 120 days to amend, don't you, from the filing of the 13 complaint? 14 MR. BENDURE: No, Your Honor. The 120 days 15 is the time frame for the notice to the defendant. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. 17 MR. BENDURE: It -- 120 days after the amended 18 complaint is our time for service of the amended -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Complaint. 20 MR. BENDURE: -- complaint on the new defendant. 21 But I think the point that is raised by Justice Ginsburg is 22 this: Once we find out and the limitation period has already 23 expired, school's out. If we tried to amend immediately 24 thereafter -- if we hadn't made a mistake -- we couldn't 25 amend 1 day after expiration of the limitation period.
14 Alderson Reporting Company

1 So if we had acted immediately, we still 2 don't get relation back unless we've satisfied the two 3 criteria of the subsections. But if we do satisfy those 4 within the 120-day period, then we fall in the safe 5 haven provided by the rule whether the amendment itself 6 occurs 1 week, 3 weeks, or 7 weeks afterwards. That -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the basic point is 8 the answer didn't come in until you were already out 9 under the statute of limitations. 10 MR. BENDURE: Correct. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So from their point of 12 view, nothing else matters; you were out when they filed 13 their answer, and you could do nothing to cure that. 14 MR. BENDURE: We could do nothing to, as a 15 matter of right, file within the limitation period. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did your amended complaint 17 contain any new and material allegations other than the 18 name correction? 19 MR. BENDURE: It actually was a second 20 count, but it was the same allegations against Costa 21 Crociere that had been made against Costa Cruise. We 22 did not amend the theories of liability. And, again, 23 getting back to the question of status and theories, I 24 think that's the critical distinction between this case 25 and the cases they rely upon, Ish Yerushalayim and
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 things like that, where you're changing from an 2 individual defendant to an institutional defendant or 3 vice versa on a different theory. And, of course, you 4 couldn't mistake an individual for an institution. 5 And that I think is the line of demarcation 6 that we're asking the Court to draw, and it explains 7 why in the lower courts the decisions which present our 8 paradigm all or virtually all allow relation back; 9 whereas, those that seek to amend a change from an 10 individual to a corporation or vice versa often don't 11 permit relation back. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the only 13 condition was that it had to arise out of the same event 14 or transaction, which would give you much more running 15 room than -- than what you assert. 16 MR. BENDURE: Only if you're amending 17 against the same defendant. If you are adding a new 18 defendant, you have to satisfy (i) and (ii), which look 19 to the notice and reason to know of the new defendant. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bendure, in addition 21 to the mailing of the ticket -- the mailing of the 22 ticket came; it said "Costa Cruise" -- were there any 23 other connections between the plaintiff passenger and 24 Costa Cruise beyond the ticket coming in an envelope 25 that says "Costa Cruise"?
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. BENDURE: There was the -- the pre-suit 2 claims notice which was sent to Costa Cruise at the 3 Florida address, in attempted compliance with the 4 provision of the ticket which says you must file notice 5 to the carrier before filing suit. And you have to do 6 that within 185 days. 7 So we not only got the ticket from Costa 8 Cruise -- we bought it from Costa Cruise -- the ticket 9 itself, if you look at I think it's 25a of the 10 appendix to the petition for certiorari, there is a 11 prominent page which says "Costa Cruise, cruise company" 12 next to a picture of the vessel. So we have that. 13 Then when we filed the notice, we sent it to 14 Costa Cruise, we get a letter back from a person who 15 claims to be in a position to resolve the liability of 16 the vessel over -- owner, signed by him as claims 17 administrator for Costa Cruise. 18 Those are the things -- oh, and then we 19 have, prior to the commencement of suit, the 20 Internet investigation about which Florida company is 21 registered to do business in the State of Michigan, and 22 we look at the Costa Cruise Web site, which says: "Costa 23 Crociere with several offices in several countries, 24 United States office, Costa Cruise, Florida." 25 So those are some of the things which give
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 rise to the mistake -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bendure, can -- can I 3 come back to your -- I'm not sure why it matters, but it 4 seems to me you're giving too narrow an interpretation, 5 and I would not like our opinion to read any more 6 narrowly than the statute allows. 7 It seems to me that if you assert a 8 different claim arising out of the same transaction, you 9 would be able to amend. If you will look at (c)(1)(C), 10 which is what you're asserting here, right? (C)(1)(C) 11 says, "the amendment changes the party or the naming of 12 party against whom the claim is asserted, if Rule 13 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied." Then you go back to (1)(B) 14 and it says, "the amendment asserts a claim or defense 15 that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence 16 set out." 17 It doesn't say it has to be the same claim. 18 MR. BENDURE: There's no question we 19 satisfy that. Everybody agrees. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. That's 21 why I don't understand why you're arguing a more 22 narrow -- a more narrow interpretation. 23 MR. BENDURE: Because I'm forced to -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you're home 25 free with (B).
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. BENDURE: Unfortunately, (C) then goes 2 on and says: "And if, within the period provided," (i) 3 and (ii). So -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, but -- but those 5 are the only things we -- we have to argue about. 6 MR. BENDURE: That's correct. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: There's no doubt that you 8 are asserting -- even if you were asserting a different 9 claim, it certainly arose out of the same transaction or 10 event, didn't it? 11 MR. BENDURE: Certainly. No question about 12 that. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 14 MR. BENDURE: If the Court doesn't have any 15 additional questions at this time, I'd like to reserve 16 the remainder of my time for rebuttal. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 18 Mr. Glazier. 19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. GLAZIER 20 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 21 MR. GLAZIER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 22 please the Court: 23 There are, we suggest, two issues before the 24 Court: The first is the legal question of whether a 25 plaintiff's knowledge about the identity of the proper
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 party can preclude a finding that there was a mistake 2 concerning the identity of the proper party. That, we 3 suggest, is in some ways the easier issue, because there 4 are -- there's abundant authority from the circuit 5 courts of appeal and from this Court in Nelson v. Adams 6 USA, where the Court said the rule requires a mistake. 7 In that case, there was no mistake. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Glazier -9 JUSTICE BREYER: It's no mistake if you 10 happen to know it, if you happen to know who the right 11 party is? 12 MR. GLAZIER: Correct. And -13 JUSTICE BREYER: Ever? 14 MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Have you ever driven a car 16 where your wife has said turn left and you've turned 17 right? 18 (Laughter.) 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Has that ever happened to 20 you? 21 MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Was there anything you 23 didn't know? 24 MR. GLAZIER: What the facts are here, Your 25 Honor --

1 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm asking about this 2 question, my hypothetical. 3 MR. GLAZIER: You know -4 (Laughter.) 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Was there anything you 6 didn't know? 7 MR. GLAZIER: There is nothing that you did 8 not know. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. Did you do it by 10 mistake? Yes, of course, you did. It's happened to 11 every human being. There are millions of instances in 12 which people do things by mistake where, in fact -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think your wife made a 14 mistake. I don't think you made a mistake. 15 (Laughter.) 16 JUSTICE BREYER: No, my wife does not make 17 mistakes. 18 (Laughter.) 19 MR. GLAZIER: I think -20 JUSTICE BREYER: I make mistakes, and 21 sometimes I make mistakes knowing all the facts, and so 22 do you and so does everybody else. So I never heard of 23 this thing that you can't make a mistake knowing all the 24 facts. But anyway, here we have a person who didn't 25 know all the facts. What the judge says is he should

GLAZIER: The circuit court refers -15 talks about imputed knowledge. We disavow that. There 16 was no need for imputed knowledge in this case. What 17 imputes knowledge is someone who does not have 18 knowledge. Courts and lawyers make that up. If you 19 don't have knowledge -20 JUSTICE BREYER: I just want the citations 21 to the page. I wasn't challenging you. I just wanted 22 the citations to the page -23 MR. GLAZIER: There are -24 JUSTICE BREYER: -- where there's a finding 25 that, in fact, he knew that this company called "Costa

1 Cruise" in Italian is the same as the company called 2 "Costa Cruise" in English? I take it "Crociere" means 3 "cruise." 4 MR. GLAZIER: They are -- they're separate 5 corporations. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. One is called 7 "Costa Cruise" in Italian and one is called "Costa 8 Cruise" in English. And I just want to know where it 9 says in the record that the client or he, the lawyer, 10 actually knew, actually knew that he should have sued 11 the one that spells its name in Italian? 12 MR. GLAZIER: They are separate 13 corporations. There's nothing in the record that says -14 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't ask you that 15 question. I'm asking for a record citation as to where 16 there is a finding that this particular plaintiff knew 17 that the Italian company called "Costa Cruise" was in 18 fact the one he should have sued? 19 MR.

1 says "Her failure to timely naming Costa Crociere, 2 S.p.A. as defendant." 3 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought what the district 4 court said was "impute" the knowledge. 5 MR. GLAZIER: No. No, the district court 6 did not impute knowledge, and this is an important 7 point. The circuit court imputed knowledge, and -8 JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that? 9 Where does it say that on 19a? 10 MR. GLAZIER: 19a -- it's not precisely it, 11 but it says, "Her failure to timely named Costa Crociere 12 as defendant was not the result of a mistake." It does not 13 specifically say -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- I know. I would 15 say in reading this, that both courts have made the most 16 elementary mistake of the English language in thinking 17 that when a person doesn't know something but should 18 have known it, that that's inconsistent with a mistake. 19 That's the very definition of a mistake. 20 MR.

1 ticket. There is no doubt, no doubt whatsoever, that 2 the plaintiff or her attorney read -3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any other than 4 that one page on the ticket, that against the mailing 5 envelopes that she got that say "Costa Cruise" -- is 6 there anything in the entire record other than that 7 definition page that includes carrier, that includes 8 steward, anything else that tips her off that this is a 9 different corporation? 10 MR. GLAZIER: There are three different 11 pieces of evidence. The first is the ticket. The 12 ticket defines carrier as Costa Crociere. It is the 13 only entity stated by name -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: It says it includes 15 stewards. What do you -- what do you say to that? 16 MR. GLAZIER: I'm sorry. I didn't -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: It includes the stewards on 18 the boat, according to your -- your friend. 19 MR. GLAZIER: It lists one entity by name, 20 Costa Crociere, and lists others by role. Now, there 21 may be some dispute over whether -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't Costa 23 Cruise be perceived to hold one of those roles? 24 MR. GLAZIER: Well, one might argue that 25 there might be a number of different entities that might
26 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 be a carrier, but there is only one entity which is 2 clearly the carrier, indisputably a carrier. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the relationship 4 between those corporations? 5 MR. GLAZIER: Costa Crociere is, I believe, 6 one level removed an owner of Costa Cruise Lines. Costa 7 Crociere operates around the world. They have different 8 companies that operate as sales and marketing agents in 9 different regions. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are they -- are they 11 sister corporations, a parent-sub -12 MR. GLAZIER: No. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- or what? 14 MR. GLAZIER: Costa Crociere is parent, and I 15 believe there's a corporation below them, and then that 16 corporation owns Costa Cruise Lines. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: When it's below them, you 18 mean it owns all the shares in its -- in its subsidiary 19 company? 20 MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the -- the 22 definition of carrier includes independent contractors. 23 I mean -- I -- I would -- other than that they are more 24 closely related, I can see someone thinking, well, Costa 25 Cruise is at least an independent contractor with which
27 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Costa Crociere does business. 2 MR. GLAZIER: There might be more than one 3 carrier, but there is one carrier identified by name. 4 It is the first -- it is the first person listed. Costa 5 Crociere is the carrier. I -- I suggest that if one 6 reads the first page of the ticket, one might have 7 questions about whether there might be some other 8 entities that are carriers, but there is simply no doubt 9 that Costa Crociere is the carrier. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if you went to -11 MR. GLAZIER: Now, there is no -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you went to the Web site, 13 which was mentioned, for Costa Cruise, there would be a tab 14 that says "Our ships" "Our ships" -- and one of those ships 15 is Costa Magica, whatever. 16 MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: "Our ships," and it 18 identifies Costa Cruise as the cruise operator. That's 19 the information that's given to passengers in the United 20 States who are going to book on these ships. It says 21 Costa Cruise, our ships, Costa Cruise is the operator. 22 That's what was being put forth to the public. 23 MR. GLAZIER: What -- what -- the relationship 24 between the parties was governed by the ticket. The 25 ticket says, for example, the claim against the carrier
28 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 has to be filed within the Southern District of Florida. 2 This claim was filed in Southern District of Florida, 3 but they did not sue the carrier as identified on the 4 ticket. And the question is was there a mistake 5 concerning the identity of the proper party -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it shouldn't matter 7 that this confusion was caused in large part by this 8 entity that advertises in English under the name "Costa 9 Cruise" and identifies Costa Cruise as the operator. 10 "The largest European cruise operator" is how Costa 11 Cruise is -- is identified in -- in the advertising. 12 MR. GLAZIER: We -- we believe that the 13 ticket is clear, and that governs. But even if one would 14 disagree with that, then we move forward. If there were 15 any confusion, there's an answer filed. Costa Cruise 16 Lines is sued. Costa Cruise Lines denies that it can be 17 held liable, says it wasn't the carrier, it wasn't -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the answer is filed 19 conveniently after the 1-year period has run. 20 MR. GLAZIER: The answer is filed, but the 21 question of whether the defendant knew or should have 22 known that there -- it -- it would have been sued but 23 for a mistake, the inquiry there is not within the 24 limitations period. It was until the 1991 amendment, 25 which followed the Schiavone case.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I don't -2 I mean, there's some sharp practice going on here. 3 Paragraph 10 of their complaint sues Costa Cruise Lines 4 because -- saying they owned, operated, managed, 5 supervised, and controlled the ocean-going passenger 6 vessel. And it's the same lawyer for Costa Cruise as 7 for Costa Crociere, right? 8 MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So that 10 lawyer looks at this and says: Aha, they made a 11 mistake; they named the cruise line rather than the name 12 in Italian. So I'm going to wait until the statute of 13 limitations runs, and then a couple of days after, I'm 14 going to say aha. 15 MR. GLAZIER: The statute of limitations is 16 not the measuring period. It was before the 1991 17 amendment. Now, what happened here is the answer is 18 filed, which makes clear the defendant -- the defendant 19 Costa Cruise Lines denies it was involved with the 20 ownership, operation, or management. That's Joint 21 Appendix 30. Joint Appendix -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the answer say the 23 statute -- the 1-year period has run? Was that raised 24 as a defense in the answer? 25 MR. GLAZIER: It was not raised in the -- in

1 the defense -- it was not raised as defense in the 2 answer. It -- it was not. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When was it raised as a 4 defense? 5 MR. GLAZIER: It was raised 10 weeks later 6 in a motion for summary judgment, which was still within 7 the Rule 4(m) period, and that is the crucial period. 8 If upon reading the answer, which says the -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- the Rule 4(m) 10 period concerns when you can serve. It doesn't say that 11 the statute of limitations is any more than what was the 12 term of the -- of the passage, was 1 year. 13 MR. GLAZIER: Well, the Rule 4(m) period is 14 awfully important because Rule 15(c) turns on, since 15 1991, on the Rule(4)(m) period. If during the Rule 4(m) 16 service period, the -- it became clear to Costa Crociere 17 that it was an intended defendant, that it would have 18 been sued but for a mistake, then the complaint against 19 Costa Crociere would relate back, even though it was not 20 timely filed. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, that -- that 22 assumes -- that assumes -- when, what is it, 1(C)(ii), 23 "knew or should have known," it says within the period 24 provided by rule 4(m). Now, in the early part of that 25 period, at -- at one point in the period you should have

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 known. And at another point, because the answer was 2 filed, you shouldn't have known. 3 MR. GLAZIER: Well -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're relying on the 5 fact that they filed an answer which -- I'm sorry -6 that -- that you filed an answer which made it very 7 clear to them what the situation was. But was there any 8 point, any -- and all it takes I think is any point 9 within that 4(m) period -- when you -- you knew or should 10 have known? 11 MR. GLAZIER: The answer, we submit, is no. 12 When they filed the complaint, the complaint indicated a 13 couple of things. First of all, they were suing Costa 14 Cruise Lines, but they had read -- the complaint made 15 clear that they had read the ticket. They specifically 16 relied on the venue provision of the ticket. So we knew 17 that they had read the ticket, which clearly identifies 18 Costa Crociere as being the carrier, yet they still -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is the 20 defense -- I mean, the ticket says suit must be filed 21 within 1 year of the date of any alleged injury. And 22 where is the -- that defense stated? You said it comes 23 up 10 weeks -24 MR. GLAZIER: In the motion for summary 25 judgment, which -- which is not in the joint appendix.

GLAZIER: -- but there was no change. 9 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- being realistic 10 about it, as I understand it you're relying entirely on 11 the condition, general conditions of passage in the 12 ticket, the fine print describing the term "carrier." 13 That's -- but do you take into account that 14 the cover of the ticket, which is what the passenger 15 would look at, uses "Costa Cruises," blah, blah, blah -16 "Costa Cruise Lines" and so -- and doesn't even mention 17 the carrier? 18 MR. GLAZIER: The -19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Don't you think, looking 20 at that ticket, if you were a passenger you would think 21 you were doing business with Costa Cruise? 22 MR.

GLAZIER: We know -- if this were a 14 question of uncertainty whether the lawyer read the 15 ticket, that would be one thing, but we know that the 16 lawyer read the ticket. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't understand 18 what the lawyer reading the ticket has to do with this 19 question. 20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the question is 21 whether the lawyer made a mistake.

In 5 the English language, it's not true? I mean, that's why 6 I was giving you some examples. I don't know; maybe 7 there's some special legal language somewhere written 8 in Blackstone, or maybe it's Lord Coke, I don't know, 9 that says when you use the word "mistake" don't use it 10 in English, use -- use it in Italian. 11 (Laughter.) 12 JUSTICE BREYER: But I mean, if we're going 13 to use it in English, there -- it's not hard to find 14 instances where a person would know, but he'd still make 15 a mistake. 16 MR.

All right, did this plaintiff really not -2 JUSTICE BREYER: What possible reason is 3 there that somebody who is hurt on a ship and has a 4 lawyer, and she has a broken leg, and she'd like to get 5 recovery, would deliberately sue the wrong person? 6 MR. GLAZIER: The plaintiff -7 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there such a reason? 8 MR. GLAZIER: The evidence in the record is 9 that the plaintiff's lawyer looked at the Web site and 10 chose a United States corporation instead of -11 JUSTICE BREYER: And I'm just saying, did he 12 do it by mistake? If you were representing this person, 13 would you want to sue the company that could give you 14 some money if they are liable? Or would you rather sue 15 the Bank of America that has nothing to do with it? 16 (Laughter.) 17 MR. GLAZIER: Well, if it were -- if I had 18 to sue Costa Crociere through the Hague Convention in 19 Genoa, maybe a lawyer -20 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I want to ask you 21 about that, because in your brief you refer in your 22 footnote on page 6 to requirements of the Federal 23 Government 44101-44103. So I looked those up. I 24 discovered that 44103 says that it is a requirement, and 25 you say you follow these requirements, that you shall
36 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 establish under regulations of the FMC financial 2 responsibility. 3 And those regulations tell you that, at 4 least as best I could read them, that you must furnish a 5 written designation of a person in the United States as 6 a legal agent for service of process, and they are 7 referring to instances in which somebody on a ship 8 suffered an accident. 9 So since you say that you are complying with 10 that, I would like to know the name and address of that 11 person in the United States for whom you must send legal 12 process, because if obviously that had been on the 13 ticket, that is precisely the man to whom this plaintiff 14 would have sent the notice. 15 MR. GLAZIER: I cannot answer the question 16 now. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, were you correct 18 when you said in your -- in your brief that this company 19 which you represent does comply with 44103? 20 MR. GLAZIER: My understanding is the answer 21 is yes, but I cannot address the specific question. 22 I submit -23 JUSTICE BREYER: It is relevant, I think, 24 because it adds to the confusion if they are under a 25 legal requirement to have a service -- an agent to
37 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 receive service, and then they not only don't do it, but 2 they don't have it printed on the ticket. And they get 3 everybody mixed up by having the same name in English, 4 or a very similar one, and announcing someone you're 5 supposed to serve, and then it turns out to be not that 6 person you're supposed to serve. It's a mysterious 7 person that you can't find. 8 MR. GLAZIER: But the question, though -9 JUSTICE BREYER: It seems odd. I'd like 10 to know what the explanation is of this. 11 MR. GLAZIER: Well, the question is not a 12 more generalized blame explanation, but under the rule, 13 the language of the rule, whether Costa Crociere knew or 14 should have known that the action would have been 15 brought against it but for a mistake concerning the 16 proper party's identity. 17 And the most problematic case -- part of the 18 case for the plaintiff is why, when they were told in 19 the answer that they had not sued the proper party, that 20 Costa Cruise Lines was not the carrier, was not the 21 operator, but Costa Crociere is, why did the plaintiff 22 not do anything? 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we -- let's clarify 24 that point now. I am looking at 3a, which is the court 25 of appeals opinion, and it says that "Costa Crociere
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 moved to dismiss, arguing that it had been sued after 2 the 1-year ticket period allowed for claims set 3 forth" -- as set forth in the ticket. Then the rule 4 tells us that you have this much time to serve, and 5 then the complaint will -- the -- the amendment will 6 relate back to the date of the original filing. 7 It doesn't change your statement, your 8 defense. The 1-year statute of limitations isn't 9 affected. What is affected is the complaint will 10 relate back if there's an amendment filed. But the 11 1-year statute of limitations remains, and you didn't 12 bother to answer until the -- that time had run. 13 MR. GLAZIER: But if -- if, during the 14 120-day period -- you know, the Rule 15(c) happens to 15 rely upon the measuring point, but service is not the crucial 16 point. Within that 120-day period, if the plaintiff had 17 done anything, anything at all, to indicate that she had 18 not sued Costa Crociere because of a mistake, then the 19 complaint would have related back, a very easy case. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the relation 21 back is different from the point at which the statute 22 has run. The statute runs after 1 year. Then, if she 23 does what the rules say, it can relate back to the date 24 of the original filing. The fact remains that you 25 didn't file your answer until after the limitation

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 period had run. 2 MR. GLAZIER: Yes. Yes, we did not file the 3 answer. They filed the lawsuit on the eve of the -4 JUSTICE ALITO: Why does that even matter? 5 I'm not really sure I'm following this argument. Let's 6 say that the answer was filed during the limitations 7 period, and the lawyer -- the plaintiff's lawyer is a 8 solo practitioner, and he or she is out of the office 9 because the lawyer's on a cruise -10 (Laughter.) 11 JUSTICE ALITO: -- and doesn't come back 12 for 2 weeks. And by that time, the limitations period 13 has run. It's still a mistake. 14 MR. GLAZIER: If -15 JUSTICE ALITO: Where do you see in -16 the question on which cert was granted has to do with 17 imputed knowledge. Where do you see in the text of this 18 rule anything that picks up the concept of either imputed 19 knowledge or actual knowledge? It just talks about a mistake. 20 MR. GLAZIER: We do not rely at all upon 21 imputed knowledge. The Court granted review, but we 22 don't think there is imputed knowledge here. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, where -- just -- where do 24 you -- where in the rule is there anything that relates to the 25 reasonableness of the mistake? What if it is the most
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 foolish, negligent mistake you can possibly imagine? Is 2 it not still a mistake? 3 MR. GLAZIER: The rule contemplates by its 4 structure that the mistake will be the cause of the 5 reason why the -- the plaintiff did not sue the parties. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not what the 7 rule says. That's not what the rule says. The rule 8 doesn't talk about what kind of mistake or why. The 9 rule says what the defendant should have known. And so, 10 when you read this complaint, it's very clear you know 11 you're the carrier. 12 MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You know cruise -- the 14 other line, the sales agent, can't be the carrier, 15 correct? 16 MR. GLAZIER: We -17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's either a factual 18 or a legal mistake. There is no other way to read that 19 other than that there is a mistake. 20 MR. GLAZIER: And then -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because -- then have you 22 to answer Justice Breyer's question, which is: What 23 conceivable reason that is not either negligence or 24 unintentional or inadvertent or just plain stupidity, 25 however you want to define it, that someone who is
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 injured would want to name a party who wasn't 2 responsible for the injury? 3 MR. GLAZIER: The most powerful evidence is 4 simply when they were informed of the claimed mistake, 5 they did nothing for 95 days to indicate in any manner 6 whatsoever that it was a mistake. They had -7 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's evidence from 8 which the absence of a mistake might be inferred. I 9 agree with that, but that doesn't establish that it 10 wasn't -- it wasn't a mistake. 11 MR. GLAZIER: Well, this -- whether 12 something is a mistake ultimately is a factual issue. 13 There's a legal question of whether a plaintiff's 14 knowledge of the identity of a proper party can preclude 15 a finding of mistake. But once we get past that -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But, counsel, don't -17 what you're really talking about is whether once the 18 answer was filed, they were dilatory in making their 19 motion. I don't understand how you can argue that the 20 day you received this complaint, you didn't understand 21 that some sort of mistake had been made. 22 The day that the answer came in, you might 23 start to have a doubt because of their delay in the 24 motion to amend, but doesn't that go to a 15(a) 25 question, whether the judge should have given leave to
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 amend because of dilatory tactics? Isn't that a 15(a) 2 question, not a 15(c) question? 3 MR. GLAZIER: Well, delay in moving to amend 4 via 15(a). But 15(c) requires the judge to determine 5 whether there was a mistake. And here, in essence, we 6 have a test case: Well, the plaintiff is claiming that 7 the reason why she did not sue Costa Crociere -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there anything in the 9 face of the complaint that would suggest anything but a 10 mistake? Now, forget -- I'm being very specific. On 11 the face of the complaint. You read that. 12 MR. GLAZIER: Yes, I believe there is. The 13 complaint specifically makes clear that the plaintiff's 14 lawyer read the ticket. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where does it say that? 16 Where does it say: "I know that the carrier is Costa 17 Crociere"? Where does it say that? 18 MR. GLAZIER: The complaint certainly does 19 not say that. What -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What the complaint says 21 is that Costa Cruise, the operator of the vessel, 22 injured me, correct? 23 MR.

So you know they read the ticket. 8 MR. GLAZIER: Right. And in the paragraph 9 before, venue is proper in Broward County; defendant's 10 passenger ticket contains a forum selection. So we know 11 when Costa -- Costa Cruise Lines, or Costa 12 Crociere learns of this, we know that the plaintiff 13 decided -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, which is it? 15 Is that a Freudian slip? 16 (Laughter.) 17 MR.

GLAZIER: But, again, if we move past -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I object to your relying 13 upon the -- the answer as -- as establishing compliance 14 with (C)(ii), because (C), in the prologue, says "is 15 satisfied, if within the period provided by Rule 4(m)." 16 And there is at least some point within that 17 period before the answer was filed. And if, within that 18 period before the answer, you knew or should have known 19 that it was a mistake, it seems to me you lose. 20 Do you understand what I'm saying? 21 MR. GLAZIER: I understand what you're 22 saying, but there's nothing in -- just the point -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the -- the only 24 thing you could rely on for that short period before the 25 answer is filed is simply the ticket, right?

It is throughout the certain -6 within the period -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are reading 8 "within the period" to mean "throughout the period." It 9 doesn't say "throughout the period." It says "if within 10 the period." 11 MR. GLAZIER: Well, the district court, 12 which is serving as the fact-finder there, looked at all 13 the evidence.

That's one of the issues here. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one -- one question 20 about the face of the ticket, the one with the picture 21 on it. Is it Costa Cruise or Costa Crociere that got 22 this big award for "B.E.S.T. 4"? 23 MR. GLAZIER: I -- I don't know the answer 24 to that. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Pardon me.

GLAZIER: Here, you only have to read 16 one. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is the first one. 18 MR. GLAZIER: Well, this is -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The one I pointed out to 20 you with the mistake, that's the first one. 21 MR. GLAZIER: It's -- it's on the cover. 22 The ticketing agent here, Costa Cruise Lines, adds the 23 cover. The first page of the provisions say Costa 24 Crociere is the -- is the vessel operator. 25 But, again, if one looks at the answer,

1 there's no response. No response, and then a motion for 2 summary judgment. Still nothing. If the plaintiff had 3 merely said in an e-mail or a phone call, hey, I made a 4 mistake, then it would be clear. An easy case. But 5 they did not act despite being informed. Despite being 6 informed in the answer of the identity of the proper 7 party and in the motion for summary judgment. The trial 8 court, serving as the trier of fact here on this issue, 9 had to make that decision. Maybe the court with another -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm still puzzled, because 11 Rule (C) just requires -- describes the state of mind of 12 the defendant, correct? C(i) and (ii); isn't that 13 right? 14 MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 15 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it not true that 16 under (i), the defendant did receive such notice of the 17 action, would not be prejudiced? That's clear, isn't it? 18 MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 19 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it also true that 20 at the time they received the complaint, they knew or 21 should have known that the action would have been 22 brought against the carrier instead of the broker? 23 MR. GLAZIER: The answer -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: I just don't understand 25 how you get around the plain language.

1 MR. GLAZIER: Our answer is no, and 2 especially considering, within the events, they don't 3 show that there's -4 JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think -- you 5 don't think that the agent didn't realize that they 6 would have sued the carrier if they had known the 7 identity of the right party? 8 MR. GLAZIER: What is known is that they had 9 the ticket. They still decided -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand all that. 11 MR. GLAZIER: -- to sue Costa Cruise Lines -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: But we're talking about the 13 -- about mindset of the defendant, and to say that they 14 wouldn't have sued -- they would have sued the broker 15 instead of this carrier? It's absurd. 16 MR. GLAZIER: Well, the events played a role and 17 demonstrated that even after the plaintiff was informed 18 of the identity of the proper party, they continued to 19 pursue the claim against the ticketing agent. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 21 Mr. Bendure, you have 9 minutes remaining. 22 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. BENDURE 23 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 24 MR. BENDURE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 25 Obviously, from the questions, the Court has
49 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 a good grasp of the facts and the issues in our 2 arguments. I'd just like to clarify a couple of 3 factual points. 4 The district court ruling didn't rely on the 5 ticket at all. What the district court said was: I 6 adopt the legal premise that if you knew before the 7 filing of -- before the running of the statute of 8 limitations but didn't sue, that would not be a 9 mistake. And here, says the district court judge, they 10 filed their answer after the statute of limitations, and 11 that's why you lose under a rule that requires that 12 notice before the statute of limitations expires. That 13 was the district court rationale. 14 The circuit court was the one who relied 15 upon the imputed knowledge notion that is now, I think, 16 disavowed by Respondent himself. 17 With regard to the -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is sort of an 19 equitable rule, isn't it, this mistake? We're going to, 20 you know -- equity takes account of such things. It 21 seems to me very reasonable to say: If the mistake is 22 egregious, it doesn't apply. 23 MR. BENDURE: I think now one gets into a 24 wonderful process of trying to identify mistakes on a 25 scale of egregiousness. Like, how many points of
50 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 egregiousness would it take? And I think that's beyond 2 the statute, or the court rule itself, which just uses 3 the plain language "mistake." 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 5 your answer would have been: This has nothing to do 6 with equity at all. It's just the interpretation of a 7 legal rule. 8 MR. BENDURE: Certainly. And the rule 9 itself -- I understood Justice Scalia's point to be that 10 the interpretation of the rule is designed to be liberal 11 in its application to avoid the forfeiture of 12 potentially meritorious causes of action over technical 13 mistakes which have nothing to do with the merits. I 14 thought that was the sense in which you used the word 15 "equitable." 16 The other point I'd like to make, even 17 though it's, in my view, legally insignificant, is their 18 argument regarding the nature of the delay. Their 19 motion for summary judgment was filed on May 6th. Two 20 days later, the court erroneously dismissed the lawsuit 21 for a period of approximately a month. It was then 22 reinstated on June 5th, and our response, which sought 23 relation back, was filed on June 13th. 24 So in addition to the scheduling order, 25 there is a 1-month period of time in which the case was
51 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 erroneously dismissed. So if it were significant, we 2 could say there's not significant delay. But the 3 ultimate point is it's legally beside the point. 4 If the Court has no further questions, 5 I'll -6 JUSTICE BREYER: This might be tangential, 7 but is there a reason to suggest the Federal Maritime 8 Commission look into this? Because I read the regs. I 9 don't understand quite what's going on, because it seems 10 to me they have a rule that is designed to prevent this 11 situation. 12 MR. BENDURE: It may well -13 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that true, what I'm suggesting 14 or not? You know the area better. 15 MR. BENDURE: I don't know. I'm not a 16 maritime lawyer, Your Honor. But I think certainly if 17 the Court's opinion were to note it, the Maritime 18 Commission might well take a hint from the opinion and 19 look into it. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 21 MR. BENDURE: Thank you. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is submitted. 23 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 24 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 25
