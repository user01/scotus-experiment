2 [10:03 a.m.]

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument first

4 today in Maryland versus Blake.

5 Ms. Graeff.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHRYN GRILL GRAEFF

7 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8 MS. GRAEFF: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9 the Court:

10 In Edwards versus Arizona, this Court held that a

11 suspect has a choice, after invocation of the right to counsel,

12 to change his mind and initiate further contact with the

13 police. The question in this case is whether that choice

14 should be taken away, and a suspect's decision to speak

15 presumed involuntary, when a police officer first makes an

16 improper comment.

17 The answer should be no when the impropriety is

18 cured. When, under all of the circumstances, a reasonable

19 person in the suspect's position would understand that it was

20 the suspect's choice whether to speak or remain silent and that

21 the police would honor that choice and stop questioning, a

22 decision to speak should be deemed initiation, under Edwards.

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, what has to be considered,

24 by way of evidence, in evaluating whether the suspect has

25 initiated the additional conversation? Is it appropriate, in

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 this case, to consider the age of the person?

2 MS. GRAEFF: Yes. I think you would look at a

3 reasonable person in --

4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And --

5 MS. GRAEFF: -- the suspect's --

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- and the fact that, on the

7 charges which he saw, it said he was subject to the death

8 penalty, but that was not correct?

9 MS. GRAEFF: That would go to whether the statement

10 was voluntary, it would not go to --

11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It would not --

12 MS. GRAEFF: -- the degree --

13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- you would not consider it in

14 connection with the initiation --

15 MS. GRAEFF: No, the --

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- question?

17 MS. GRAEFF: No, the purpose of Edwards was to

18 prevent police badgering. To prevent police conduct that,

19 conveys, directly or indirectly, that the police are going to

20 continue questioning until they get a statement, despite the

21 invocation of the right to counsel.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I --

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Counsel --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I suppose that if they

25 knowingly put death on in order to get him off his balance,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that would be badgering, wouldn't it?

2 MS. GRAEFF: The -- the purpose of Edwards was to

3 prevent police questioning. So, when a curative measure

4 conveys that, the police are not going to question any longer.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but --

6 MS. GRAEFF: The --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the initial question Justice

8 O'Connor asked is, Do we consider these other factors? And

9 then -- but you're talking now about curing.

10 MS. GRAEFF: And my answer is no, that we do not

11 consider what -- the death sentence. There's two. In Bradshaw

12 --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why consider age? I mean, the

14 -- both of them go to the same point, and that is, What would a

15 reasonable person suppose the suspect's understanding was at

16 that point? And would it be fair to conclude that the suspect

17 was, in fact, initiating conversation, rather than responding

18 to the police or doing something irrational? And I don't see

19 why the -- in effect, the false statement about the death

20 penalty -- or true statement about the death penalty, for that

21 matter -- doesn't go to the same point, just as the suspect's

22 age goes to it.

23 MS. GRAEFF: Because the critical inquiry is whether

24 the suspect understood that it was his choice and that the

25 police would stop questioning.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, the --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- but the trial judge made

4 certain findings. He heard these witnesses. He heard the

5 police officers. And he suggested that the -- Police Officer

6 Reese was playing a good-cop/bad-cop game with Detective Johns.

7 And so, that this -- the statement made by Reese, "You'll want

8 to talk to us now, huh?" was designed to elicit an answer. And

9 the trial court also said there is an additional factor, and

10 that is this charge, that was intimidating even if it didn't

11 have death on it, wasn't presented to Blake immediately. It

12 could have been presented when he was put in the cell,

13 initially. So, there were those factors. Those are relevant,

14 are they not, to the character of what Blake said?

15 MS. GRAEFF: I think what -- you look at -- the

16 relevant factors are the factors that go to whether a

17 reasonable person would understand that questioning was going

18 to stop. This Court has said that there were two --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the factors that I

20 mentioned? Would they be relevant to a factfinder's

21 determining what a reasonable person in that situation -- with

22 the two police officers appearing, with the charges not being

23 presented immediately, not being presented at the time the

24 Miranda warnings were given, but only after -- would those be

25 -- would those be relevant factors to decide if this was a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 voluntary initiated request to talk to the police?

2 MS. GRAEFF: No, because I think what you're looking

3 at is not voluntariness. You're looking at knowing. Did this

4 suspect know that the questioning was going to stop?

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but you're --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it has to be --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- you're making --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- voluntary at some -- if you

10 held the man's hand to a burning iron, we would -- we'd say

11 that's not voluntary.

12 MS. GRAEFF: It's involuntary.

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, it has to be voluntary,

14 certainly, in the lay sense of the term. Then the law has

15 certain accretive force when we talk about, you know,

16 involuntary as a matter of law. But what we're -- what we're

17 talking about, it seems to me, is, rather, a commonsense

18 inquiry as to whether or not it was voluntary, as to which I

19 don't think you necessarily lose your case, but it seems to me

20 that at least these have to be considered in determining

21 whether or not it's voluntary.

22 MS. GRAEFF: Well, I think that's the second step of

23 the analysis. The first step of the analysis, which is what

24 this case is -- before the Court is, on initiation. Now,

25 voluntariness --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I -- you can't initiate

2 something involuntarily and have that count, can you? You say

3 --

4 MS. GRAEFF: Our --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- let's say involuntarily, in the

6 lay sense of the word, in the common sense of the word, where

7 it was actually physically coerced. That wouldn't count.

8 MS. GRAEFF: It would be an involuntary statement

9 under the second --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.

11 MS. GRAEFF: -- step of the analysis.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but what about --

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, it's the --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the first step?

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- first part of the analysis.

16 MS. GRAEFF: In the first part of the --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How --

18 MS. GRAEFF: -- analysis, our --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The first part of the analysis is

20 whether or not he initiates.

21 MS. GRAEFF: Yes.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you're trying to tell us that

23 the initiation can be involuntarily? I just don't -- I just

24 don't agree with that.

25 MS. GRAEFF: Well, what we're trying to say is that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the purpose of Edwards was to prevent badgering, where the

2 police convey --

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. But suppose the

4 police are twisting his arm behind his back until he initiates

5 a further discussion. You would say that's fine?

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you have to concede --

7 MS. GRAEFF: Well, if they're twisting their back,

8 you're not thinking they're going to stop questioning. I mean,

9 what you're looking --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, you're --

11 MS. GRAEFF: -- at is, Did --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't you -- aren't you confusing

13 Miranda, which is a question of comprehension followed by

14 voluntary waiver, with the question of initiation? They are

15 separate questions. And what our -- what we are trying to get

16 at is: If there is going to be an initiation on the suspect's

17 part, doesn't it have to be a voluntary initiation? Your

18 answer consistently is, Did he know that questioning would

19 stop? And those are two different issues. One is

20 understanding Miranda warnings. One is voluntarily initiating

21 a further conversation with the police. So, I don't see it --

22 let's assume he perfectly understood the Miranda warnings. But

23 if the initiation was not a voluntary initiation, or an

24 initiation at all, it seems to me you lose.

25 MS. GRAEFF: Well, Maryland's position is that if

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you look at the analysis in Elstad and Seibert, where what this

2 Court said is, you don't look at whether something caused

3 something else, you look at whether there was a cure in the

4 sense that the suspect understood his rights --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Graeff, is there any case which

6 says that an initiation is not voluntary, as opposed to a

7 confession being not voluntary, because the suspect has been

8 charged with a crime greater than what the police believe they

9 can prove, or if the police advise him that he's been charged

10 with a greater crime than what he's really been charged with?

11 Is there any case which says that the effect of that is to

12 cause his initiation of discussion to be involuntary?

13 MS. GRAEFF: Not that I'm aware of.

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you take --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ­-

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the position that initiation is

17 a purely formal inquiry, a matter of magic words? If he says

18 the equivalent of, "I guess I'll talk to you," that's all you

19 look at?

20 MS. GRAEFF: What you look at as, in Seibert, is,

21 Was he --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but ask --

23 MS. GRAEFF: -- given a genuine choice?

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- answer my question. Is that all

25 you look at?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. GRAEFF: You look at whether he understood that

2 the questioning was going to cease, and it was up to him --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, you're --

4 MS. GRAEFF: -- whether to speak.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- you're avoiding my question.

6 MS. GRAEFF: I'm sorry.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: My question is, Is the act of

8 initiation a purely formal act on your view, so that so long as

9 the suspect says the magic words, it doesn't matter what is in

10 his mind or what he understands? Is it formal or not formal?

11 MS. GRAEFF: No.


12 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's not formal.


13 MS. GRAEFF: What you need to look at is whether an 


14 objective person in the suspect's position would understand

15 that questioning was going to cease, and there was -- would be

16 no more questioning. Edwards --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, can I interrupt with --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think we can --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- with one --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I think that's a given. The

21 question is whether or not he agrees -- he indicates

22 affirmatively that he wants to begin talking.

23 MS. GRAEFF: And here, there's no question he wanted

24 to --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. GRAEFF: -- begin talking.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the issue, it seems to me.

3 MS. GRAEFF: And there's no question here that he

4 wanted to begin talking.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, now suppose -- I don't

6 understand all these legal terms here. Imagine.

7 [Laughter.]

8 JUSTICE BREYER: It may be close to the truth. Now,

9 we have a case, a hypothetical. The defendant is sitting

10 there, the police say, "Question?" And he says, "I want to see

11 my lawyer." And the policeman says the following, "That's

12 fine, go ahead, we'll get him. By the way, if you see him,

13 we'll execute you. Are you sure you don't want to talk to us?"

14 That's plainly unlawful, isn't it?

15 MS. GRAEFF: Involuntary. Under --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine.

17 MS. GRAEFF: -- the second step --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Now --

19 MS. GRAEFF: -- of the --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Now --

21 MS. GRAEFF: -- analysis --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the same thing happens, but

23 what he says is, "You'd better talk to us, or you'll be

24 executed. Think about it." Equally unlawful, right?

25 MS. GRAEFF: It would be involuntary --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.


2 MS. GRAEFF: -- under the second -
-

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, a minute -
-

4 MS. GRAEFF: -- test.


5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- passes while he's thinking about 


6 it. Okay? Is it -- is it unlawful now, because a minute has

7 passed before he says yes?

8 MS. GRAEFF: It would make it unlawful --

9 unvoluntary. But, again --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: I just --

11 MS. GRAEFF: -- with -- There's a two-step process.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't -- I don't want legalism.

13 I just want the conclusion. A minute has passed before he says

14 yes. Has that changed everything, and it becomes lawful?

15 MS. GRAEFF: No.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: No. Now it's 15 minutes. Now it's

17 30 minutes. Okay? Now, a court says 30 minutes is the same as

18 one minute, "We don't think the passage of 29 extra minutes

19 made a difference." And what's your reply? Not in legalism.

20 You're going to say, "Oh, no, the passage of 30 minutes, rather

21 than 1 minute, makes all the difference." And I would like to

22 know why.

23 MS. GRAEFF: Actually, our position is more

24 Detective Johns' actions rather than -- the passage of time was

25 a factor, but the more significant --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: I --

2 MS. GRAEFF: -- thing here --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's fine. I'm not -- I'm -

4 - I want you to say that kind of thing. You're saying it's not

5 just 30 minutes, it's "also some other things happened." What?

6 MS. GRAEFF: Significantly, Detective Johns' conduct

7 and his words, when -- when Office Reese made the improper

8 statement, Detective Johns immediately and firmly --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: The --

10 MS. GRAEFF: -- reprimanded --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- improper statement was, "I bet

12 you want to talk now, huh?"

13 MS. GRAEFF: Yes.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right? And --

15 MS. GRAEFF: Yes.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- immediately, the other

17 detective, Johns -- immediately?

18 MS. GRAEFF: Yes. Immediately --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Said what?

20 MS. GRAEFF: -- immediately said, "No, he doesn't

21 want to talk to us. He already asked for a lawyer. We cannot

22 talk to him now" --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: So, that's --

24 MS. GRAEFF: -- and pushed him.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: -- possible. That definitely cuts

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in your favor, unless, of course, it sounds like a good-

2 cop/bad-cop routine. And --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- people --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- there was no finding that

6 this was a good-cop/bad-cop --

7 MS. GRAEFF: No.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- routine, was --

9 MS. GRAEFF: In fact --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In fact, there was a finding that

11 Johns' testimony was credible.

12 MS. GRAEFF: Yes, that Johns' testimony was

13 credible, and that Johns did not intend this to happen.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's --

15 MS. GRAEFF: This was --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- subjectively true. And so, I'd

17 simply wonder if the fact that it's subjectively true, and

18 there is a finding that the defendant -- here, we have 30

19 minutes, and we have the fact that the other detective said,

20 "He said he can't talk to us. We can't do anything about it."

21 We have that. Is there anything else?

22 MS. GRAEFF: We have that Detective Johns then

23 pushed him out of the cell --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

25 MS. GRAEFF: -- and they left. So the police

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 initiation was terminated. And --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

3 MS. GRAEFF: -- then when Detective Johns came back,

4 28 minutes, he didn't say anything.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

6 MS. GRAEFF: He didn't ask any questions. And it

7 was Blake who initiated and said, clearly, he wanted to talk to

8 the police.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Right. So --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- we have a passage --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you two rather

13 elementary questions?

14 MS. GRAEFF: Yes.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: One of the issues is whether --

16 when he spoke and said, "Can I talk now?" -- was that voluntary

17 or not? Who has the burden on whether it was, or not,

18 voluntary, the State or the defendant, in your view?

19 MS. GRAEFF: The state has the burden to show that

20 he initiated.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: And so, the State did have the

22 burden. And what is your view on the fact that the trial --

23 the judge who heard the evidence said they had not met the

24 burden? What kind of deference is owing to that finding?

25 MS. GRAEFF: We think none, because the trial court

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 did not focus on the proper analysis. The trial court focused

2 on a causal connection analysis that this Court has --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I --

4 MS. GRAEFF: -- rejected in Seibert --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- before we get to that, I

6 read the trial court's opinion, and it didn't seem to me that

7 it was playing, as Justice Breyer said, this game of legal

8 words and labels. It was saying, "There are things to suspect

9 here. Yes, I credited Detective Johns. But he was asked, 'Why

10 did you bring along Reese? You didn't need him?'" And there

11 was no answer to that.

12 And there was also no explanation, after they left

13 Blake in his cell, Reese just having said, "I bet you want to

14 talk to us now, huh?" -- there was nothing said to assure Blake

15 that that was not a "You'd better talk to us, or you're going

16 to be in trouble" kind of thing. There was just the statement

17 by Blake and another Miranda warning. All of those things, the

18 judge said, weighed on his mind, and he reached the conclusion

19 that the Government hadn't sustained its burden on the basis of

20 those factors.

21 So, is that clearly erroneous? I mean, don't we

22 defer to the judge's findings?

23 MS. GRAEFF: If the inquiry is a -- clearly

24 erroneous, yes. But our position is that whether or not there

25 was initiation is a mixed question of fact and law, whether a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reasonable person would understand the questioning was going to

2 stop. And so, when you look at this reasonable-person

3 analysis, you don't give deference to the findings of the lower

4 court.

5 And if I could reserve the rest of my time, if there

6 are no more questions.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Graeff.

8 Mr. Feldman.

9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

10 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

11 IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER

12 MR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

13 the Court:

14 An improper question or comment under Edwards can be

15 cured if the police terminate the questioning and make it clear

16 to the suspect that they will honor his decision whether or not

17 to talk to them --

18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, tell us --

19 MR. FELDMAN: -- without counsel.

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- what factors, in your view,

21 can be considered. The --

22 MR. FELDMAN: I think --

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The defendant's age? The

24 improper charge? What else can be considered?

25 MR. FELDMAN: I think all of those things can be

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 present in any Miranda case, and are taken care of in a normal

2 Miranda analysis as to whether it was voluntary or not. The

3 problem here is that the --

4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but what we're trying to

5 determine is, What do you consider in determining whether he

6 has -- a reasonable person initiating --

7 MR. FELDMAN: Right, and I --

8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- further discussion?

9 MR. FELDMAN: -- I think you could say that all of

10 those voluntariness factors should be looked at, in terms of

11 initiation, although I just think the analysis would be exactly

12 the same as if you were asking whether he made a voluntary

13 waiver, that it's the same voluntary -- voluntariness analysis.

14 Now, in the --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure, because a

16 voluntary waiver is measured against a Miranda warning. And,

17 by definition here, you don't have a Miranda warning, because

18 we're asking about "whether initiation." So, it seems to me

19 there's a threshold inquiry of voluntariness to determine

20 whether or not there was a voluntary initiation, and that that

21 -- it does not comprehend or require a Miranda warning.

22 Otherwise, you're double counting.

23 MR. FELDMAN: But you never -- there's never --

24 first of all, he had gotten a Miranda warning, initially; and

25 that was when he said he wanted to see a lawyer. That was --

1 that had happened. Secondly, whenever there's an initiation

2 case, you've never had another Miranda warning before the

3 initiation. And what the police did here --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree with that. But I want --

5 what I think the Court is trying to find is some explanation of

6 the threshold test for determining whether or not there was a

7 voluntary initiation. Now, I think we agree -- or at least I

8 agree -- that there shouldn't be any Miranda warnings required.

9 That doesn't go into the mix.

10 MR. FELDMAN: But --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Any new Miranda warning.

12 MR. FELDMAN: Right, but I -- still, the -- there

13 has been, already, an -- a Miranda warning.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

15 MR. FELDMAN: But, still, the question should be

16 broken down into two parts. The -- as the Court said, in

17 Oregon against Bradshaw, you have to -- it's useful, at least,

18 to separate the question of initiation, which is a more limited

19 question, from the broader question of voluntariness of a

20 waiver --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. --

22 MR. FELDMAN: -- or voluntariness.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Feldman, do you agree that the

24 State had the burden of proving voluntariness at the second

25 stage?

1 MR. FELDMAN: Yes.


2 JUSTICE STEVENS: And why -- and why should we not 


3 credit the finding of fact by the -- by the trial judge --

4 MR. FELDMAN: Well, if the --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- who found it was not voluntary?

6 MR. FELDMAN: -- the middle-level -- what --

7 Maryland has --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: The middle level --

9 MR. FELDMAN: -- -- at the middle-level --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- said there was no Edwards

11 violation.

12 MR. FELDMAN: Right.

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, that doesn't contribute

14 anything to the dialogue.

15 MR. FELDMAN: But the State has argued that

16 actually, given the procedures in this case, the defendant

17 waived his voluntariness claim. But, in any event, the State -

18 - the Maryland Court of Appeals --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you just told me you agree

20 that the burden was on the --

21 MR. FELDMAN: Right. But --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- State to prove voluntariness.

23 But I still haven't heard your answer to why we should not

24 credit the finding of fact by the trial judge.

25 MR. FELDMAN: Well, I'd say -- well, two things.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 One is, the Maryland Court of Appeals itself explicitly --

2 specifically said that it did not --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't care --

4 MR. FELDMAN: -- voluntariness.

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- what the Maryland Court of --

6 MR. FELDMAN: Not the midlevel --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Appeals said.

8 MR. FELDMAN: -- court, but the --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: The highest court in Maryland also

10 credited the finding.

11 MR. FELDMAN: No, the -- I don't think so. The

12 highest court in Maryland said, "We are not going to decide

13 anything about voluntariness, we're only going to decide

14 something about initiation."

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, in any event, we have a --

16 MR. FELDMAN: And --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- a finding of fact by the trial

18 court before us, and I don't -- I still don't understand. From

19 your point of view, why shouldn't we credit that?

20 MR. FELDMAN: And I don't think -- oh, because I

21 don't -- the -- that court was relying on a -- on the -- on the

22 -- on the question of initiation. What -- what that court was

23 doing was saying, "We're going to do a kind of voluntariness-

24 lite here and take all the facts that might suggest it's not

25 voluntary, and count them, and say -- well, give -- those, plus

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

1 whatever" --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: You disagree with the --

3 MR. FELDMAN: -- means it's not --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- finding that -- the -- isn't it

5 -- aren't we entitled to give a -- some presumption of

6 validity?

7 MR. FELDMAN: Yes, but -- well, I think that the

8 trial -- what the trial court -- I think it -- no, I don't

9 think so, because I think the trial court was not operating

10 under the correct standard of what it was supposed to -- of

11 what initiation consists of.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because it's a mixed

13 question of law and fact --

14 MR. FELDMAN: Right.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and not a purely factual

16 --

17 MR. FELDMAN: Right.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- determination.

19 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: If you're going to the standard,

21 which is, I think, the -- actually, the difficult question

22 here, what's wrong -- should you say -- what's wrong with

23 saying -- which is what I was pursuing -- that, where there is

24 a question that's improper, as there was here, by the police,

25 the only real question is, Is a later initiation "the fruit"?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FELDMAN: I --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: And you say the State has to show

3 it wasn't the fruit. That would have the virtue of making the

4 law quite consistent here, as it is with Fourth Amendment/Fifth

5 Amendment cases. That's a well known concept.

6 MR. FELDMAN: The Court has consistently found, in

7 the Miranda context, that that kind of broad "fruits analysis"

8 doesn't apply in Elstad and --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not?

10 MR. FELDMAN: -- other cases.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- I understand that --

12 MR. FELDMAN: Because --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: -- there's a lot of language --

14 MR. FELDMAN: Because the -- the point of the fruits

15 analysis is -- has to do with the deterrence function of the

16 Fourth Amendment, which is nonexistent, or much, much reduced,

17 in the Fifth Amendment context, and --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the standard fruit analysis

19 is when you get something like a statement, and that statement

20 then leads to further evidence. We're not -- I mean, Justice

21 Breyer wasn't using the fruits analysis in that sense. He was

22 -- he was getting at the -- at the same question we're all

23 trying to get at: Was the later so-called initiation the

24 product of the improper police comment in the first place, or

25 was it voluntary?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FELDMAN: And I think the Edwards rule is an

2 important, but limited, rule. And the point of the Edwards

3 rule is to address the particular problem that's caused by a

4 question. It's not intended to address all of the other

5 problems that can arise in connection with voluntary --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize that. But you

7 concede -- I think you concede that the -- that the so-called

8 initiation has got to be a voluntary initiation. You don't

9 take the position that it's merely magic words. Isn't that

10 correct?

11 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. If that is correct, why

13 do we not give some deference to the conclusion of the trial

14 court that this was not voluntary?

15 MR. FELDMAN: And --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: You say there was a legal error.

17 What exactly was the legal error?

18 MR. FELDMAN: The problem was that the trial court

19 was not looking at all the factors that you would normally look

20 at to decide voluntariness. It thought that, in looking at --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: What did it --

22 MR. FELDMAN: -- initiation --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- overlook? What did it overlook?

24 MR. FELDMAN: It overlooked the fact that he had

25 been given the Miranda warnings, that, as far as anybody --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's always true in every Edwards

2 case.

3 MR. FELDMAN: Right. Well, it's --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. So --

5 MR. FELDMAN: -- so that's the case.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that's a wash.

7 MR. FELDMAN: It overlooked --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: What else did --

9 MR. FELDMAN: -- the fact that --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- it miss?

11 MR. FELDMAN: -- he knew that he had the right to

12 remain silent, and that the particular problem that had been

13 caused by the question --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, Mr. Feldman --

15 MR. FELDMAN: -- which was --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- I have to interrupt. They did

17 not overlook that he had been given the Miranda warning. She

18 expressly commented on the fact that an hour and 17 minutes had

19 lapsed since that time.

20 MR. FELDMAN: Right. She didn't overlook the fact.

21 She knew what the facts were. But she overlooked the

22 significance of that in the analysis. But, more importantly,

23 she overlooked the significance of the fact that the defendant,

24 at the time that he decided, a half hour later, that he wanted

25 to talk to the police, the police had terminated the earlier

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 questioning and had made it clear to him that they were going

2 to honor his decision whether or not to talk to them without

3 counsel present. And --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how --

5 MR. FELDMAN: -- those are --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- was it that she --

7 MR. FELDMAN: -- extremely ---

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- overlooked that? I just don't

9 get it.

10 MR. FELDMAN: We --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: They --

12 MR. FELDMAN: We -- well --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: You know, the evidence is

14 undisputed that one officer made the statement, another officer

15 said no, they left, 30 minutes went by. What exactly did she

16 overlook?

17 MR. FELDMAN: It -- she did -- what -- she did not

18 give the proper weight to those facts, which, in a proper

19 involuntariness analysis, are ones that are important.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that those facts

21 could not reasonably be found to be -- to produce a situation

22 in which the defendant believed he would be hounded to talk, so

23 he said, "What the heck, I'll talk."

24 MR. FELDMAN: Right.


25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what Edwards is directing.


1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FELDMAN: Right. And that Edwards was designed

2 to support --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: That no factfinder -- and this is

4 mixed fact and law -- could reasonably come to that conclusion.

5 MR. FELDMAN: That --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: When it -- when one of the -- the

7 last he had heard from the officers was, "No, he doesn't want

8 to talk. He already asked for a lawyer. We cannot talk to him

9 now."

10 MR. FELDMAN: Coupled --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying no reasonable judge

12 could find that that defendant thought he would be hounded.

13 MR. FELDMAN: Right. And the concern of Edwards --

14 as the court has repeatedly explained, the concern of Edwards

15 is that the court -- that the police will wear down or badger

16 the defendant. But once there's -- if there's been a --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't count --

18 MR. FELDMAN: -- single comment, as can happen --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feldman, it doesn't count as

20 badgering, or the equivalent, that the police -- the -- walk

21 in, and they present not only the charges, but they present the

22 application for the charges, which shows that the co-

23 perpetrator had talked to the police, talked his head off, and

24 put all the blame, at every step on the way, on this defendant?

25 That did weigh heavily in the trial judge's mind.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FELDMAN: But --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is -- was that improper to

3 take into account? How would a reasonable person in this

4 situation feel?" Would he feel that he was impelled to speak,

5 because the co-perpetrator had --

6 MR. FELDMAN: That -- I mean, there's two points I'd

7 like to make about that. One is, as far as I know under

8 Maryland practice, what they did is consistent with Maryland

9 practice as part of what's normally attendant on taking

10 somebody into custody. And it's -- and it doesn't count as

11 questioning, under Miranda. And it's a -- it's a different

12 problem. And, secondly, that issue of handing him that

13 charging document -- which I think is probably a sound

14 practice, because it lets the defendant know what he's charged

15 with -- that practice is one that can happen and can have its

16 influence on a defendant's decision whether or to talk, in any

17 case, and should be considered in a general involuntariness

18 analysis. But it's not a decisive factor in this case, and it

19 doesn't have to do with the particular concerns of Edwards.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: It has nothing to do with whether

21 the defendant thinks he is going to be hounded.

22 MR. FELDMAN: That's --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: It has --

24 MR. FELDMAN: -- correct.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to do with --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct.


2 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- with whether --


3 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct.


4 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the defendant thinks he will be 


5 badgered and badgered until he finally talks.

6 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct. They're all --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what Edwards is directed

8 at.

9 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct. They're already under

10 --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Edwards is directed at

12 avoiding badgering, but the issue before us is initiation.

13 That's not a question of badgering, it's a question of

14 initiation. And don't the points that Justice Ginsburg raised

15 go to whether the initiation is likely to have been a voluntary

16 initiation?

17 MR. FELDMAN: I don't think they do, because, under

18 the Court's decision in Bradshaw, there's initiation, and then

19 there's always a separate voluntariness inquiry to take care of

20 those problems.

21 Thank you.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Feldman.

24 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. RAVENELL

25 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. RAVENELL: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

2 Court:

3 It is our position that to allow so-called curative

4 measures would lead to police abuses. If curative measures are

5 allowed, intentional coercive violations should never be

6 allowed to be cured.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it --

8 MR. RAVENELL: In fact --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if, instead of the half

10 hour or so, 24 hours had passed and they got a call from the

11 defendant, said, "I want to talk now"? Still, is that -- is

12 that initiation on his part?

13 MR. RAVENELL: I think that if there had been 24

14 hours that had passed, then you would -- it would be a factor

15 that you would consider in deciding whether the defendant has

16 initiated the conversation.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that factor --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if you can --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- can work the other way. You

21 would be up here, saying, "Oh, he had 24 hours. He thought he

22 was going to get the death penalty. He knew the other man was

23 turning on him to implicate him in the murder. His agony was

24 increasing." I mean, I -- it seems to me the question is

25 whether or not the curative measures were adequate.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. RAVENELL: And --

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, you know, we can play

3 the game -- 5 minutes, 20 minutes --

4 MR. RAVENELL: Right.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- 30 minutes. We know that.

6 But, it seems to me, when 30 minutes passed here, there were

7 curative measures. Now, you say, at the outset, there can

8 never be a -- curative measures. That -- I don't think you

9 have anything to -- any support for that in the case law.

10 MR. RAVENELL: I certainly believe that the support

11 is, in Edwards versus Arizona, that there should not be a cure

12 unless the defendant himself initiates the contact.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: A cure --

14 MR. RAVENELL: So, I think there is.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: A cure of --

16 MR. RAVENELL: And if there is --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sorry, go on.

19 MR. RAVENELL: Sure.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought you

21 would have said, then, 24 hours doesn't make a difference. If

22 there can never be a cure, if there's a violation because the

23 question from Reese constitutes interrogation, and you're

24 telling us there's no cure, it doesn't matter how long it is.

25 MR. RAVENELL: Yes, I think what I'm -- with all due

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 respect, I think what I'm telling the Court is that the

2 practice should be, as it has been the last 25 years, that you

3 do not allow cures of Edwards versus Arizona by the police

4 intentionally violating one's rights and then attempting to

5 cure it. But, if this Court finds that there can be a cure, we

6 want to participate in what would be a proper cure.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: A cure of what? That's what --

8 MR. RAVENELL: Of a violation.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me, a lot of this

10 discussion has come down to. What are you curing? Are you

11 curing involuntariness of the confession, or are you curing the

12 police badgering? I thought that we were just trying to cure

13 the badgering and then let the voluntariness of the confession

14 be decided as voluntariness is normally decided, for which

15 purpose you would take into account that he's been --

16 erroneously said he was charged with murder, or whatever.

17 MR. RAVENELL: I disagree with Your Honor on -- for

18 two reasons. First, I think that, as several members have --

19 certainly have said so far, that we should focus on whether

20 there was a voluntary initiation. That has to be considered.

21 Secondly, I've heard mentioned several times that Edwards only

22 deals with badgering. I commit -- commend this Court to

23 Illinois -- Smith versus Illinois -- and Minnick versus

24 Mississippi, where this Court has said that Edwards is not only

25 about badgering, but the Court said it's about overreaching by

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the police, whether it's explicit or subtle. So, it's not

2 badgering, only. And when the Petitioner says that Edwards is

3 only about badgering, this Court has said that it's about more

4 than badgering. It is whether there is overreaching by the

5 police officers that is subtle, that is intentional, that is in

6 deliberate -- that is deliberate, any overreaching --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

8 MR. RAVENELL: -- that causes --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, assuming --

10 MR. RAVENELL: -- the person --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- there was --

12 MR. RAVENELL: -- to give up his rights.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- assuming there was

14 overreaching on the part of Officer Reese, my question is, Is

15 there any circumstance in which that overreaching can be cured?

16 And I thought your answer is that, yes, that with the

17 sufficient passage of time, it can be cured.

18 MR. RAVENELL: No, with all due respect, Your Honor,

19 that was not my answer. My answer is that -- and I will tell

20 Your Honor that I will not change that position -- it should

21 never be allowed to be cured.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, once Officer --

23 MR. RAVENELL: But --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- once Officer Reese made

25 his comment, there was no circumstance, even a week, a month --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 relatives come in and say, "We think you ought to talk," no

2 intervening circumstance -- once there is that one sentence of

3 overreaching, he can never initiate contact -- discussion with

4 --

5 MR. RAVENELL: The better --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the police.

7 MR. RAVENELL: In my opinion, the better policy, the

8 better practice, is that there should not be. Now --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not helping --

10 MR. RAVENELL: -- if the --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- defendants, you know.

12 MR. RAVENELL: -- if I --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: In some cases, you are not helping

14 defendants.

15 MR. RAVENELL: Well --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes, a defendant, after he

17 talks to his relatives, might conclude, "Boy, you know, I'd

18 better cooperate with the police and get a lesser sentence."

19 But you're saying that can't happen. Once --

20 MR. RAVENELL: In my --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- once the police make a

22 misstatement, he can never come forward and say, "I want to

23 confess."

24 MR. RAVENELL: In my 20 years of trial practice, I

25 have never found it to be at the defendant's best interest to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 communicate with the police without counsel. I have --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ravenell --

3 MR. RAVENELL: -- never found it to be --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you are defending a judgment

5 that no court in Maryland, as far as I know, ever made. All of

6 the courts thought that the law was, yes, the taint of an

7 improper question by the police can be removed.

8 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.


9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, let's take the case as it 


10 comes to us.

11 MR. RAVENELL: Sure.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The taint can be removed. That

13 is the law.

14 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Accepting that to be the law,

16 what, in your judgment, would it take to remove the taint? --

17 the taint here being the statement that Office Reese made.

18 MR. RAVENELL: I'll be happy to participate in that

19 conversation. And this is how we believe that taint can be

20 cured, if at all. Number one, you put the suspect back in the

21 position that he was in before the violation occurred. How do

22 you do that? This is a violation of a right to counsel. Not a

23 right to remain silent; a right to counsel. The suspect asked

24 for counsel. The best way to cure it is, give him counsel.

25 How else do you cure it? You tell him that he no longer -- "We

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 were wrong when we told you, you face the death penalty."

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose --

3 MR. RAVENELL: "You do not face the death penalty."

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- suppose, again, we do not

5 accept that position. You need another fallback position in

6 our -- in order to argue the case before us.

7 MR. RAVENELL: I don't agree that I need another

8 fallback position, because I believe that if the Court finds

9 that right to counsel -- giving him counsel is not enough,

10 other things I'm about to tell the Court, I think, will also be

11 a factor.

12 For example, telling the defendant that he, in fact,

13 does not face the death penalty. Very interestingly, this

14 Court -- and the Seibert case, in fact, Justice Kennedy's

15 opinion, said that one of the things you consider is, when

16 there is a violation of the right to Miranda rights, you tell

17 the suspect, "That was an improper violation of your right.

18 That statement may not be admissible" --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Johns -
-

20 MR. RAVENELL: --- "against you."


21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Johns, in effect, did that 


22 here.

23 MR. RAVENELL: We disagree.

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Certainly, one of the best

25 curative devices is immediate correction from a superior. And

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that is exactly what happened here.

2 MR. RAVENELL: Interestingly, what Your Honor said

3 in the Seibert case is that when -- and, in fact, the plurality

4 opinion -- when you give an alleged cure in the midst of the

5 violation, the defendant misses it. So, giving this alleged

6 cure in the midst of the violation creates the problem. What

7 you need to do is --

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, you think you'd have a

9 stronger case if Johns hadn't corrected Reese?

10 MR. RAVENELL: I think that -- I think --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's --

12 MR. RAVENELL: -- what we would have --

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But --

14 MR. RAVENELL: -- is a stronger --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's a --

16 MR. RAVENELL: -- case.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- far stretch. It's --

18 MR. RAVENELL: No. I think the case would be proper

19 if Johns did certain things. One is, give him counsel. Now, I

20 understand the Court says, "Maybe we won't go that far." But,

21 if you're not going to give him counsel, what else can you do?

22 You can certainly tell him that the comment by Officer Reese

23 was improper, "We will honor your right to an attorney. What

24 Officer Reese said was wrong." As we point out in our brief,

25 there was never a time when Detective Johns spoke to Blake

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 directly and made any efforts to clarify, or even resolve, the

2 alleged -- the violation. In fact, Detective --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

4 MR. RAVENELL: -- Johns --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't want the --

6 MR. RAVENELL: -- says --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you don't want the

8 officer talking to Blake directly. I thought that would be

9 another violation.

10 MR. RAVENELL: No. No. Now that there is a

11 violation, you have to cure it. You have to cure it. And the

12 only way to cure it is for someone to speak to him.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it seems --

14 MR. RAVENELL: One of the things --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to me that it's a bit

16 much to say that the problem is that the -- he didn't talk to

17 Blake directly, because that gets into another extended

18 dialogue with the defendant that the defendant has not

19 initiated. It seems it's much better, in the defendant's

20 presence, to do what Johns did here, which is to rebuke Reese

21 for the interrogation.

22 MR. RAVENELL: With all due respect, I couldn't

23 disagree more, because I think what has to be is that there has

24 to be a direct comment to the suspect so that the suspect

25 understands that this violation occurred, "It was a violation

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of your right, and we, the police, will not countenance what

2 Reese did. And here is what we will do. We will get you

3 counsel, if you wish to have counsel. You are not facing the

4 death penalty, young 17-year-old sitting in a cell in your

5 underwear. That is not correct. Here is what we can do for

6 you. We will" -- in fact, as this Court suggests in the

7 plurality opinion and Seibert, you change location. You change

8 the interrogator. You give him time. As this Court said -- in

9 fact, Justice Scalia's -- maybe dicta in McNeil said -- you

10 look at a lapse of time. You consider that there is a break in

11 time. All of those factors may be -- if all of those things

12 were done, then you could become -- begin to move closer to

13 putting Blake back in the position --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well --

15 MR. RAVENELL: -- that he was in before.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- what about just simple thing

17 like this, that there is an implication in what Reese said,

18 that he listens to in his cell, "I guess you'd -- he'll want to

19 talk to us now, huh?" The implication is that he faces death,

20 and he'll be better off by talking to them without a lawyer.

21 MR. RAVENELL: And --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: So, suppose Johns had said to the

23 defendant, "Mr. Blake, I want to tell you something. My

24 colleague here has implied that you will be better off, because

25 of the death possibility, in talking to us without a lawyer.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 We want to tell you, that isn't true. There is no way that

2 you'll be better off talking to us without a lawyer. You will

3 be at least equally, from your point of view, as well off if

4 you talk to a lawyer." Now, that might have cured it, I guess.

5 MR. RAVENELL: I think that if that was done, then

6 we are moving in the right direction. But --

7 [Laughter.]

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The right direction would be to

9 say, "Please don't talk to us."

10 MR. RAVENELL: The right direction would be --

11 [Laughter.]

12 MR. RAVENELL: I would -- I would -- as Mr. Blake's

13 attorney, I would have appreciated that.

14 [Laughter.]

15 MR. RAVENELL: Now, I will tell the Court that I

16 believe that when you add those factors, you really do get

17 closer to curing what we think should not be cured. Several

18 things this Court said earlier -- and I think is correct, from

19 some of the members of the Court -- is that we have to give

20 deference to the trial court's finding. The Government would

21 have you pay no attention to the trial court's finding when the

22 trial court heard Officer Reese -- in fact, heard Officer Reese

23 sit on the witness stand and lie under oath -- the court found

24 that Officer Reese was not worthy of belief. Not only did he

25 violate Mr. Blake's right, he then sat on the witness stand and

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 lied about it. Now, do we want to encourage that kind of

2 police abuse, where the police will abuse the rights of

3 someone, then sit on the witness stand and lie, and then we say

4 -- well, the trial judge, who had a chance to observe the

5 demeanor, to watch the witnesses, trial judge, Judge North, who

6 is actually present here, and who had a chance to observe each

7 witness testify --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, there's no dispute

9 about the historical facts found by the judge. Everybody

10 agrees this is the dialogue that took place, this is the time

11 that it took place.

12 MR. RAVENELL: Right.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are factual questions.

14 It's a very different question of what the significance of

15 that is under the Edwards initiation rule. So, it's not an

16 issue of deference to the trial-court judge. We know what the

17 facts are. We're deferring to those findings of fact. It's a

18 question of what the legal significance is.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what the Chief Justice says

20 was true in Bradshaw and in Edwards and in Elstad.

21 MR. RAVENELL: I will ask --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All questions, which were mixed

23 questions of law and fact, where this Court took the words,

24 took the facts, and made a rule. And that's this case.

25 MR. RAVENELL: I will direct the Court to two cases,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Salve Regina College versus Russell, 499 U.S. 225, where this

2 Court said the following, "Deferential review of mixed facts --

3 mixed questions of law and fact is warranted where it appears

4 that the District Court is better positioned than the appellate

5 court to decide the issue in question, or that probing

6 appellate scrutiny is -- will not contribute to the clarity of

7 legal doctrine." The Court further said, in Miller versus --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to -- stop there.

9 Why is the trial court better suited to apply the Edwards rule

10 to a set of facts that we would -- we accept based on deference

11 to the factfinder?

12 MR. RAVENELL: I find that interesting, Your Honor,

13 because the Court did the same thing Elstad. This Court, in

14 fact, gave every deference to the trial court's finding in

15 Elstad. So, there's absolutely no reason why this Court would

16 not give the same deferential treatment to Judge North's

17 decision, when Judge North, just as the trial judge in Elstad,

18 got a chance to observe the witnesses who testified, and found

19 that that violation of Elstad's right was not intentional, that

20 it was, kind of, a good-faith violation. That had an impact.

21 And, in fact, in Seibert, the Court again made reference to

22 that, and, in Justice O'Connor's dissent, made reference to

23 that. So, it is clear that this Court has given deference --

24 clear deference, on every the -- one of the cases I've

25 mentioned in the past, to a trial court's finding.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, are you --

2 MR. RAVENELL: There is no reason --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- arguing that --

4 MR. RAVENELL: -- to be different here.

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- are you arguing that trial

6 court, even though there's agreement -- understanding on most

7 of the historical facts, is still in a better position to make

8 the judgment call as to whether it was voluntary or not?

9 MR. RAVENELL: Yes, I am. And I will point the

10 Court to Miller versus Fenton, 478 U.S. 104, where this Court

11 said, "Equally clear, an issue does not lose its factual

12 character merely because its resolution is dispositive of the

13 ultimate constitutional question."

14 This Court has made clear that you give deference to

15 the trial judge's findings, even if it may have an impact on

16 the ultimate resolution, even where it is a mixed question of

17 fact and law. And that's all we ask for in this case.

18 I believe, Your Honor, that when we consider that --

19 in this particular matter, the evidence is clear that Mr. Blake

20 was responding to the comments by Office Reese. And the trial

21 court made that finding. The trial court made a finding that

22 Office Reese's comment was intended to elicit a response. Same

23 thing this Court has said in Innis.

24 When you get to the next step, the question is, What

25 that interrogation? The trial court made a factual finding it

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was interrogation. In fact, Petitioner concedes it was

2 interrogation.

3 Next step was, Was it a response, or was it new

4 initiation of a new conversation, by Blake? The trial court

5 found that it was a response by Mr. Blake to the comments by

6 Officer Reese.

7 The trial court also made a finding that there, in

8 fact, was no cure. That factual finding was given deference by

9 the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals considered several

10 things. It said you should consider the attenuation. This

11 Court said you should consider change in interrogation,

12 location of interrogation --change in the interrogator --

13 excuse me -- change in the location. And I believe that we add

14 the fact that there would have been no further advice to the --

15 to the suspect that he did not face the death penalty.

16 Parties agree here. In fact, in the SG's, Solicitor

17 General's, brief, on page 25, they say, "If there has been any

18 intentional coercive violation, there should be not be a cure."

19 The trial court found that the act of Office Johns was

20 intentional. I don't think anyone -- anyone, even under -- in

21 -- under any standard of review -- could find that Officer John

22 -- Officer Reese's -- excuse me -- comment was not intentional.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was the quote from the SG's

24 brief? I didn't --

25 MR. RAVENELL: Page 25.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what did they say?


2 MR. RAVENELL: If I may -
-

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe they said that. I'd be 


4 surprised if they said that.

5 MR. RAVENELL: I would be happy to read on --

6 "Police officers who engage in interrogation" --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us --

8 MR. RAVENELL: I --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- where you're reading from?

10 MR. RAVENELL: I'm sorry. Page 25 of the SG's

11 brief. I'm reading. "Police officers who engage in

12 interrogation after a suspect has invoked his right to counsel

13 also run the risk of a judicial finding that any statement

14 given was coerced," as we have here. If I may continue, "In

15 that event, the initial statement would be unusable for any

16 purpose" --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, if there was a judicial

18 finding that any statement given was --

19 MR. RAVENELL: Which is --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- coerced.

21 MR. RAVENELL: Which is what we have in the trial-

22 court finding, that there is -- and, in fact, it was coerced.

23 The trial judge made a finding that this was an intentionally

24 coercive act by Officer Reese.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking about the confession

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 being coerced, that the statement given was coerced --

2 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not that his decision to talk to

4 the police was coerced.

5 MR. RAVENELL: I disagree that if there, in fact,

6 was an initial -- if there was, in fact, coercion by the

7 police, that that coercion did not play a part in Mr. Reese --

8 Mr. Blake deciding to speak.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, we're --

10 MR. RAVENELL: And, in fact --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- only talking --

12 MR. RAVENELL: -- in State --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- about what the SG has conceded.

14 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: He has conceded that if the -- if

16 it is found by the court that the statement given was a --

17 MR. RAVENELL: Right.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- coerced statement, in that

19 event, it would be unusable for any purpose.

20 MR. RAVENELL: All right. I understand.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the -- and the Court of

22 Appeals of Maryland said, "We're going to look at this in the

23 legal sense, not the dictionary sense."

24 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's what we're reviewing

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 here.

2 MR. RAVENELL: And I think that when we review that

3 in a mixed question of fact or law, giving all deference to the

4 trial court's finding, as this Court has in the past in the

5 cases I've cited, that, in fact, there is -- was a violation,

6 the violation was not cured, and that, even if this Court

7 establishes curative measures, those measures must be designed

8 to put the suspect back in the position that he was in prior to

9 the police violation of his rights. We think that it is a

10 dangerous path to go down to allow the police to abuse a

11 suspect's rights, and then cure it.

12 One of the things I believe we learned from what

13 occurred in Elstad and then in Seibert is that -- and, in fact,

14 in the plurality opinion in Seibert, this Court pointed out

15 that after Elstad, some 20-something years, the police created

16 policies and strategies designed to violate what -- the first

17 question first. And, in fact, the plurality opinion pointed

18 out that not only did the police create that strategy, what the

19 police, in fact, started doing was omitting Miranda altogether.

20 And this Court made reference to that in U.S. versus Harris,

21 that what the police will do, if you give them the opportunity,

22 they will abuse the rights and attempt to cure --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but if you're looking -- if

24 you're taking your standard seriously --

25 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: The reason that my -- I was able to

2 give my hypothetical before --

3 MR. RAVENELL: Sure.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the reason that you'd have to

5 say, "You will not be better off -- you will not be worse off

6 in respect to the death penalty, by -- you know, we -- it

7 won't" --

8 MR. RAVENELL: Right.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- "make you any better off to talk

10 to the lawyer" --

11 Sorry. Strike.

12 The reason that the policeman, to cure, would have

13 to say, "Look, it's not going to help you, in respect to the

14 death penalty, to talk without your lawyer," is because that

15 was the implication of his question, that was the implication -

16 -

17 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: -- of the wrongful statement.

19 MR. RAVENELL: Exactly.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: The implication was, "You're not

21 going to get death if you talk to us without a lawyer."

22 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: But if it had been some other

24 questions, some questions, for example, about the crime, all

25 you would have had to do was eliminate whatever negative

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 implication came out of those questions, which might have been

2 nothing.

3 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: So timely --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there is no finding to support

6 the suggestion that it was just the death penalty that

7 concerned him. He was also concerned, I thought, about the

8 fact that his accomplice, Tolbert, had implicated him, and --

9 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.


10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- presumably implicated him --


11 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.


12 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.


13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- too far. So is -
-

14 MR. RAVENELL: And the trial -
-

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's just no finding that it 


16 was simply the death penalty that --

17 MR. RAVENELL: I agree. And the trial court made

18 clear that she was considering everything. But what's

19 important is that the trial court got a chance to hear Mr.

20 Blake testify. The trial court --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And --

22 MR. RAVENELL: -- understood --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- his concern with Tolbert was a

24 wholly legitimate reason for him to want to talk to the police

25 and --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- get things straightened away

3 right away.

4 MR. RAVENELL: We do not dispute that at all. But

5 what is important is that the trial judge got a chance to

6 assess all of those factors, and the trial judge, even after

7 assessing those factors, concluded that what impacted -- that

8 there was still a great impact on him. And it is the

9 Government's burden --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so --

11 MR. RAVENELL: -- it was their burden --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- maybe you should modify the

13 standard. Maybe the standard ought to be that where you have

14 an improper line of questioning, after the warning, that the

15 police either have to negative the implication of those

16 questions, the relevant implication, or the State has to show

17 that some other series of independent events, such as Justice

18 Kennedy mentioned, made the difference. That is, caused the

19 later request to talk without a lawyer. And if they can't show

20 the one or the other, then they lose.

21 MR. RAVENELL: Correct. And that is what the trial

22 judge did in this case. The trial judge considered those

23 factors. And that is what -- we leave it to the judges --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt --

25 MR. RAVENELL: -- to do.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you with a -- with a question?

2 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: You seem to have taken the

4 position that the State cannot cure an Edwards violation, which

5 seems to me quite different from the trial court's ruling,

6 because the trial court made a number of factual statements

7 that seem to me to be saying, "Had these things been done, the

8 violation might have been a -- cured." She referred to the

9 fact he was still undressed, still in a cold cell, that his

10 parent -- there was no parent present. He was scared, and --

11 he was scared and thought he was facing death. Now, it seems

12 to me the logical inference from the trial judge's statement

13 is, "Had each of those things been different, I might have

14 found a cure."

15 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: And, otherwise, why should -- why

17 would she go through these ventures?

18 MR. RAVENELL: I agree, Your Honor, that the trial

19 court considered that there can be a cure. And, in fact, the

20 Court of Appeals of Maryland said there --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, that --

22 MR. RAVENELL: -- can be a cure.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- it doesn't seem to me -- for

24 you to prevail, you have to take the extreme position that

25 there can never be a cure.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. RAVENELL: No. And that's why I think I -- I

2 hope I've made --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: And when the trial judge --

4 MR. RAVENELL: -- it clear that --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- said they did not cure because

6 they didn't do any of A, B --

7 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- C, D, E, or F.

9 MR. RAVENELL: I agree that I do not need this Court

10 to find that Edwards versus Arizona remains untouched for me to

11 win. We do not need that, because, when you consider what the

12 trial court's finding was, and the deference that was given to

13 by the Court of Appeals, we win, as well. What I am trying to

14 say is that I think the better practice is that we do not allow

15 the police to go down this line of starting to abuse rights,

16 and then curing them. But I'd just --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it seems to --

18 MR. RAVENELL: We don't -- I don't need that to win.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- it really seems to me you're

20 adopting quite an extreme position, because it does seem to me

21 perfectly obvious if, for example, they got a lawyer or brought

22 his parents in, and they talked it over for 20 minutes and

23 said, "We think he ought to do it." --

24 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you could -- you could surely

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 cure it in some fairness.

2 MR. RAVENELL: I certainly believe that, from the

3 teachings of Seibert and from other cases, that this Court

4 clearly seemed to be leaning towards cure, that there can be

5 cures. I know that the position on Edwards versus Arizona

6 remaining intact is probably, in many ways, not where this

7 Court is leaning. I understand that. But I certainly also

8 understand we don't need to get to that extreme position to

9 win, because the facts in this case are so clearly in our favor

10 from the trial court's finding that giving it the -- any

11 deference --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Ravenell --

13 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- let me tell you the problem --

15 the problem I have in the case --

16 MR. RAVENELL: Sure.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and with your reliance on the

18 trial court's findings. I do not see how the fact that he's --

19 he's there in the cell in his underwear, the fact that he's 17,

20 the fact that he thinks, and has been led to believe,

21 erroneously, that there's a death penalty in the offing, has

22 anything to do with the question that Edwards asks, which is

23 whether the police, or this individual, initiated the

24 conversation.

25 MR. RAVENELL: I think that the problem is --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is the issue in these cases --

2 MR. RAVENELL: I think the problem --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- whether the police initiated the

4 conversation that produced the confession.

5 MR. RAVENELL: And I think that all those things are

6 factors that the Court can consider in deciding whether Blake

7 voluntarily initiated the contact.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't think so. I think they

9 go to whether the confession he gave was voluntary, but I don't

10 see how they have anything to do with whether he initiated the

11 conversation.

12 MR. RAVENELL: Your Honor, with all due respect,

13 this Court, in Elstad and in Seibert, said that psychological

14 pressures, which are very similar to the fruits analysis, can

15 be considered on whether there's a Fifth Amendment violation.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I --

17 MR. RAVENELL: In fact --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I think -- tell me if I'm

19 wrong about this particular record. I thought that the trial

20 judge put it rather simply. He said, "There was an

21 interrogation by a police officer named Reese."

22 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's conceded, as I understand

24 it from Maryland --

25 MR. RAVENELL: It is.

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that the police asked the

2 question, and then the trial judge said the -- what Blake said

3 was an answer to that question.

4 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's how she read what

6 happened.

7 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a question implying,

9 "You'd better speak to us," and there was an answer to that

10 question. Not an initiation.

11 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's --

13 MR. RAVENELL: And --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that's what we're --

15 MR. RAVENELL: That's --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- we're dealing with in this

17 case.

18 MR. RAVENELL: And I agree. And that's why I said

19 earlier that when we look at what Innis says -- and I made

20 reference to Innis earlier -- that it's any comment, any

21 statement, designed to elicit a response. The trial court that

22 found that what Officer Reese did was designed to elicit a

23 response. This Petitioner agrees that it was interrogation;

24 therefore, designed to elicit a response.

25 The next question is, Was it -- did Blake respond?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

56
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The trial court found, after hearing Blake testify, hearing

2 other witnesses, that Blake was merely -- and I'd say merely,

3 but very importantly -- responding to what Officer Reese said,

4 not initiating a new conversation, that it was a continuous

5 matter of only 28 minutes.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, your position, I guess, is -- I

7 think it is, in your last answer -- that we really shouldn't be

8 phrasing the inquiry in terms of the voluntariness of the

9 suspect's statement, at this point. We, rather, should be

10 focusing it on whether the statement was, in fact, a

11 spontaneous initiation on his part or a response to the

12 preceding police statement.

13 MR. RAVENELL: Which is what the --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the way you would phrase the

15 --

16 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.


17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- issue for us.


18 MR. RAVENELL: And which is what the trial judge did 


19 below. And when the trial judge made that finding, that what

20 Blake was doing was responding -- because the trial court is in

21 that unique position that this Court or any other public court

22 can never be in, which is listening to the witnesses, we give

23 the trial judges the duty to hear those witnesses and to make

24 judgment calls based on what they hear from those individuals.

25 We --

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --

2 MR. RAVENELL: -- trust them with it.

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- absent of good-cop/bad-cop

4 finding, and I -- and I repeat that they've credited Johns'

5 testimony here -- this seems to me a very odd sort of

6 interrogation, to say, "No, no, you -- we can't talk to him

7 now." That's an interrogation? That's a stretch.

8 MR. RAVENELL: Well, I would say this. The trial

9 court certainly said it struck her as a good-cop/bad-cop

10 routine. I will say the following. If you do exactly what

11 Detective Johns and Officer Reese did in this case, and if the

12 person does decide to speak to you -- now, whether you phrase

13 it the same way Detective Johns did or not -- the police are in

14 no worse-off case -- position than they would be if the person

15 had continued to sit in that cell alone and not spoken.

16 Therefore, however you do it -- and the police will always come

17 up with a creative way to do it, we know that from prior

18 experience and past experience -- they will always find a

19 unique way to do it. It may not --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, is my --

21 MR. RAVENELL: -- be the same way.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is my understanding of

23 the Maryland law in effect when this happened correct that if

24 you prevail on suppression, your client cannot face charges, no

25 matter what the other evidence is?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

58
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. RAVENELL: Not if we prevail on suppression, no.

2 If we prevail on suppression, the State still had the right to

3 prosecute Mr. Blake. When the State chose to take an

4 interlocutory appeal, the law was -- no longer the law --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

6 MR. RAVENELL: -- but the law at the time was that

7 if the State was not successful on appeal, it would be barred

8 from prosecuting Mr. Blake. But they were not barred from

9 going forward with their case --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that --

11 MR. RAVENELL: -- at the time of suppression.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that law applies to this

13 case at this time, correct?

14 MR. RAVENELL: Correct. And I think that that

15 should have nothing to do with how the Court rules on this

16 particular matter, what the final result will be, whether we go

17 to trial or not.

18 I'll be happy to answer any other questions. Well,

19 I see my time's up.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Ravenell.

21 MR. RAVENELL: Thank you.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Graeff, you have 5

23 minutes remaining.

24 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHRYN GRILL GRAEFF

25 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

59
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. GRAEFF: Thank you.

2 With respect to the standard of review, this Court

3 said, in Thompson versus Keohane, that custody is a mixed

4 question of fact and law, and voluntariness -- in Miller versus

5 Fenton -- that voluntariness is a mixed question of fact and

6 law. And so, the historical facts are entitled to deference.

7 But there is de novo review of the ultimate question of custody

8 and voluntariness. And, given the questions here about what

9 constitutes a cure, shows that that same standard should apply.

10 It should be a legal standard, not a factual finding.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the trial judge's

12 determination? There was a question. Everybody agrees Reese -

13 - what Reese did was interrogate.

14 MS. GRAEFF: Yes.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the trial judge then finds

16 there was an answer to that question. Is that a matter of

17 fact? It didn't seem that the trial judge was treating that as

18 a matter of law.

19 MS. GRAEFF: Well, whether there was a cure, and

20 whether he initiated, it's the State's position to be a mixed

21 of question of fact and law. What was said is a historical

22 fact. Whether what -- Detective Johns cured it and allowed

23 Blake to initiate should be reviewed de novo.

24 And with respect to initiation, it's important to

25 note that, in Bradshaw, the Court said that there's a two-part

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

60
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 inquiry. You look at, one, did the defendant initiate? And,

2 two, if he did, that's when you get to the voluntariness

3 analysis.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it fact, or is it not fact, law,

5 in respect to the following? He's sitting there. And there is

6 a question of what motivated him. Did it motivate him totally

7 that his -- this thing about his codefendant, or was he moved,

8 in significant part -- moved, motivated -- by the earlier, 30-

9 minute earlier, improper questioning? That sounds like a fact.

10 Or do you think it's not a fact?

11 MS. GRAEFF: I think that is a fact, but, under

12 Seibert and Elstad, is not the proper analysis. You don't look

13 at -- in Seibert and Elstad, the court did not look at whether

14 the prior unwarned statement caused the second statement. The

15 court looked at whether the cure effectively advised the

16 suspect that he did not have to speak. And we're suggesting

17 that the same analysis applies in the Edwards context. You

18 don't look at whether the improper comment caused the

19 initiation. You look at whether the cure effectively conveyed

20 that there would be no more questioning, that the choice was up

21 to the suspect and the police were going to honor that choice.

22 And once that cure happens and the suspect indicates he wants

23 to speak, there's initiation. And then the court can go on to

24 the voluntariness analysis.

25 The Edwards presumption of involuntariness imposes a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

61
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 high cost to the truthseeking function of a trial, to society's

2 interest in having relevant evidence admitted at trial. And

3 when the purpose of Edwards is not served, when a suspect

4 understands that questioning will cease, that high cost is not

5 justified.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one question before you

7 sit down, if you're through? Is it your understanding that the

8 trial judge held that an Edward violation may not be cured, or

9 that she held that, on the facts here, it was not cured?

10 MS. GRAEFF: My reading is, she found, on the facts

11 here, it was not cured.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that, your -- the answer to

13 your -- the question presented in your cert petition really is

14 answered. We all agree, it can be cured.

15 MS. GRAEFF: Well, it depends what can --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the question you asked is

17 whether it can be cured.

18 MS. GRAEFF: Well, this Court has never addressed --

19 and, in fact, there is disagreement here as to whether it can

20 be cured. So, here, the trial court did look -- the trial

21 court really didn't look at the analysis in how you look at

22 whether --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree --

24 MS. GRAEFF: -- it's cured --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that the trial judge did assume

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

62
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it could be cured.

2 MS. GRAEFF: Well, she looked at -- she looked at --

3 I guess it's difficult to understand exactly. She was looking

4 -- she looked at Edwards, she looked at voluntariness, she

5 talked about attenuation. So, she did acknowledge that if it

6 was six months later, he could give a statement.

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: And so, there could have been a

8 cure.

9 MS. GRAEFF: Yes.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: If you lose this case, can the

12 defendant be prosecuted federally under the carjacking statute?

13 MS. GRAEFF: I'm not aware. He cannot be -- I'm not

14 aware of whether he can be prosecuted federally. He cannot be

15 prosecuted in State court, though. Under Maryland law at the

16 time, if we do not prevail in this appeal, he cannot be

17 prosecuted by --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

19 MS. GRAEFF: -- the State court.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the prosecutors were well

21 aware of that when they determined to appeal.

22 MS. GRAEFF: Yes.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But perhaps they were worried

24 that they didn't have a case without the defendant's

25 statements.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

63
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. GRAEFF: The statute puts the State in a

2 difficult position. It's been changed now. But, at this time,

3 the prosecution did have to decide whether to appeal the

4 statement, and that law has been changed. But with respect to

5 Blake, he will not be able to be prosecuted if the State does

6 not prevail in this Court.

7 Detective Johns cured the impropriety here. He made

8 it clear to Blake that there would be no more questioning. And

9 it was Blake's choice whether to speak or remain silent.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

11 The case is submitted.

13 above-entitled matter was submitted.]
