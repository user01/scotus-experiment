6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF TYLER R. GREEN

7                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8             MR. GREEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10             Courts typically apply the exclusionary rule

11 to suppress unlawfullyseized evidence.  The question

12 here is whether to suppress evidence lawfully seized in

13 a search incident to a warrant arrest because the

14 arresting officer found the warrant in a stop later

15 judged to be unlawful.

16             Under this Court's attenuation analysis,

17 such evidence is admissible when, as here, the predicate

18 stop was not flagrant but resulted from an objectively

19 reasonable miscalculation.

20             Extending the exclusionary rule 

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Tell me what was

22 objectively reasonable about it.

23             MR. GREEN:  Well, Your Honor 

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, the police

25 officer admits that the person he saw coming out of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
4 1 house in question wasn't doing anything.  He didn't know 2 that he lived there, he didn't know what he had done, if 3 anything.  He didn't even really know that there was 4 drug dealing going on in the house.  He was trying to 5 figure that out.  So what was objectively reasonable 6 about stopping this man? 7             MR. GREEN:  Justice Sotomayor, we've 8 admitted that this was a miscalculation, but it was a 9 close call.  If the officer here had stopped the first 10 person coming out of the house after receiving the tip, 11 that would have been objectively unreasonable under this 12 Court's case and decision in Alabama v. White. 13             But this person wasn't the first person he 14 saw come out of the house.  He had received the 15 anonymous tip and then had proceeded to corroborate it 16 through three hours of surveillance and observation over 17 the course of the ensuing week.  And all of the traffic 18 he saw during those three hours was the same shortstay 19 traffic that was reported in the tip. 20             Based on his training and experience, that 21 activity was consistent with drug  22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It would be interesting 23 if he waited to see whether this was also a shortstay 24 visitor. 25             MR. GREEN:  I think he would have

5 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't see how this is 2 any different than stopping the first person you see. 3             MR. GREEN:  I think, Your Honor, as  as 4 we've admitted, I think if he had seen it and it were 5 short stay, I think we may well beat the reasonable 6 suspicion, and I think that's why the prosecutor here 7 conceded that it wasn't. 8             But it was a close call based on everything 9 that he had seen to that point.  And in these 10 circumstances, we think that's why  where the 11 predicate conduct was a result of  of misconduct that 12 was not  13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's going to stop 14 police officers  if we announce your rule, and your 15 rule seems to be, once we have your name, if there's a 16 warrant out on you, that's an attenuating circumstance 17 under every circumstance.  What stops us from becoming a 18 police state and just having the police stand on the 19 corner down here and stop every person, ask them for 20 identification, put it through, and if a warrant comes 21 up, searching them? 22             MR. GREEN:  I think  Justice Sotomayor, I 23 think there are two answers to that question.  First, I 24 think that our rule  an officer can never count, under 25 our rule, on finding a warrant.  So there is no
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 incentive for him to make that stop.  If there's no

6

2 warrant and the stop is lawful 

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, if you have a town

4 like Ferguson, where 80 percent of the residents have

5 minor traffic warrants out, there may be a very good

6 incentive for just standing on the street corner in

7 Ferguson and asking every citizen, give me your ID; let

8 me see your name.  And let me hope, because I have an 80

9 percent chance that you're going to have a warrant.

10             MR. GREEN:  I understand, Your Honor.  And

11 that's the second part of my answer, is that officers

12 can't count  under our rule, a warrant by itself is

13 not sufficient.  There still must be a separate inquiry

14 into whether the predicate stop was flagrant, and an

15 officer can't count in any particular stop on a judge

16 later concluding that the stop 

17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I assume, Mr. Green,

18 that there are a variety of circumstances in which

19 police officers would really like to talk to somebody

20 and really like to search them but don't have reasonable

21 suspicion.  And I think that the question that

22 Justice Sotomayor is asking is if you're policing a

23 community where there is some significant percentage of

24 people who have arrest warrants out on them, it really

25 does increase your incentive to  to make that stop on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
7 1 the chance that there will be a warrant that will allow 2 you to search and admit whatever evidence you gained in 3 that search. 4             MR. GREEN:  What  Justice Kagan, I don't 5 think so.  I think, again, if the  if the inquiry 6 turns, as it does, on not only on finding a warrant, but 7 then a determination of whether the stop was flagrant, 8 the officer has no guarantee before he makes the stop 9 that a judge will later conclude the stop was not. 10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but this is an officer 11 who  you say this is a close call.  So let's say that 12 there are close calls.  But you don't think you have 13 reasonable suspicion, or you think you maybe do if you 14 find a good judge out there, but  but you  there is 15 a reason why you want to talk.  So this is not a 16 flagrant violation.  This is not a dragnet search or 17 something like that.  But you  if  if  I mean, it 18 does change your incentives quite dramatically, it seems 19 to me, if you're policing a community where there is 20 some significant percentage of people who have arrest 21 warrants. 22             MR. GREEN:  Justice Kagan, I think, with 23 respect, it doesn't.  Officers know that the only 24 surefire way  the incentive is always to comply with 25 the Fourth Amendment.  That's the only way they can be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1 sure that the evidence they are gathering is later used 2 in a prosecution. 3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's the only way they can 4 be absolutely sure.  But  but here, there's  there's 5 some chance that they're going to find the arrest 6 warrant and then they're going to be able to admit the 7 evidence that they're going to get, whereas before, 8 there was none.  And that some chance is not like a 9 onceinabluemoon kind of chance.  In these very 10 heavilypoliced areas, it's  I mean, I was staggered 11 by the number of arrest warrants that are out on people. 12 So it's, you know, a significant possibility that you're 13 going to find an arrest warrant and be able to admit 14 whatever drugs or guns or whatever it is you find. 15             MR. GREEN:  Well, I think, Your Honor, in 16 those circumstances, that's where the flagrancy inquiry 17 actually does the work of deterrence.  Because as this 18 Court has explained, to be appropriate, suppression must 19 yield appreciable deterrence.  There may be some 20 additional marginal deterrence that suppressing 21 everything following an event like this would yield, but 22 that's never been enough under this Court's precedence. 23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Don't you think it's 24 enough of a deterrence to say to a police officer in 25 this situation, you should have reasonable suspicion?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 You know the Fourth Amendment requires it.  So before

9

2 you do an intrusive act demanding identification, you do

3 what you're permitted to do, which is just to ask the

4 person whether they'll talk to you.  Don't you think

5 that that would improve the relationship between the

6 public and the police?  Wouldn't that be the appropriate

7 encouragement we would give, if we don't let police do

8 these things in questionable situations?

9             MR. GREEN:  Well, Your Honor, I think that's

10 what the  the existing rule on the exclusionary rule

11 itself does.  It encourages officers to comport with the

12 Fourth Amendment.  This applies to 

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We're begrudging them

14 now from doing that.  We're saying if you have

15 questionable probable cause, go ahead and do it because

16 we're not going to make you take that extra step of just

17 merely stopping someone and saying, will you talk to me,

18 please.

19             MR. GREEN:  No.  I don't think so, Your

20 Honor.  I think, again, because there are two predicate

21 steps that must be  that must happen before this

22 exception would apply.  And the officer, before the

23 stop, can't count on either one.  That's why when 

24 when we are talking about conduct here that is  that

25 is admittedly a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 low culpability, that's where the  the additional

10

2 marginal deterrence that would come from suppression

3 doesn't do its work.

4             And with respect to the particular type of

5 intervening circumstance here, this is a  a compelling

6 intervening circumstance of the type that this Court

7 identified in its  in its holding in Johnson v.

8 Louisiana.  This 

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Green, you make a

10 point that a person's name is not suppressible, and

11 evidence derived from just knowing the name is not

12 suppressible.  If you're right about that, then the

13 police could stop anyone and say, whether I have

14 reasonable suspicion or not, I want to know your name 

15 and that's not suppressible  then does the warrant

16 check, which you say is intervening circumstance.  So it

17 seems that your argument is  is arming the police with

18 asking every person what is your name and doing a

19 warrant check.

20             MR. GREEN:  Well, Your Honor, it is, of

21 course, that's one of the purposes of a Terry stop, of

22 an investigatory stop, is to try to find a person's

23 name.

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought you needed

25 reasonable suspicion.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1             MR. GREEN:  That's correct.  That's right. 2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is a case where 3 you're telling us reasonable suspicion or not, the name, 4 a person's name, is not suppressible. 5             MR. GREEN:  That's right, Your Honor.  But 6 it is admittedly the butfor link between the initial 7 predicate unlawful stop, and the later discovery of the 8 warrant, and the arrest on the warrant, which is the 9 intervening circumstance.  That's why, Your Honor, we  10 we think this is  this falls comfortably within this 11 Court's prior attenuation jurisprudence.  Just like 12 the  13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So what is an intervening 14 circumstance, in your view?  What is your test for what 15 it is? 16             MR. GREEN:  Your Honor, I  we think under 17 it's  it's  it flows naturally from this Court's 18 teaching in Wong Sun.  That is, it's any means 19 sufficiently distinguishable from a predicate unlawful 20 act, such that suppressing evidence seized after it 21 would not yield appreciable deterrence. 22             And this Court's cases  23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  And your view is that 24 we should look at the question of whether something is 25 an intervening circumstance through the deterrence lens.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 That makes a lot of sense.  We look at everything

12

2 through a deterrence lens with respect to the

3 exclusionary rule.  And that, you know, what we're

4 supposed to say is this  does this appreciably

5 increase deterrence or not; is that correct?

6             MR. GREEN:  That's the inquiry, Your Honor,

7 yes.

8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And I  so I guess, then,

9 I'm back to my question.  In a world in which finding

10 somebody with an outstanding arrest warrant was an

11 extremely low probability, you would be right.  In a

12 world in which it was an extremely high probability, you

13 would be wrong.

14             Then it seems like, where is this on the

15 spectrum?  What do we know about that?  It sure seems 

16 I mean, again, I will come back to this.  I was

17 surprised beyond measure by how many people have arrest

18 warrants outstanding, and particularly in the kind of

19 areas in which these stops typically tend to take place.

20 So that, it seems to me, you know, is a pretty strong

21 argument for why this will increase deterrence.

22             MR. GREEN:  Your Honor  again, I think,

23 Justice Kagan, the answer to that is the inquiry here in

24 attenuation is not just is there an intervening

25 circumstance.  Under this Court's prior cases, there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 still must be something else.  And we think that

13

2 something else, following from this Court's teaching in

3 Brown, is a flagrancy inquiry:  What level of

4 culpability does this conduct display?

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Mr. Green 

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think that

7 something else includes a subjective component, whether

8 there was a purpose to see if there was a warrant?

9             MR. GREEN:  We don't, Your Honor.  We think

10 that that inquiry is inconsistent with the way this

11 Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has evolved.

12 It's 

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So isn't flagrancy 

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it that  it's true

15 that that would be a step maybe beyond our  our  our

16 cases.

17             On the  on the other hand, if the inquiry

18 is one of flagrancy, then maybe that's necessary.  And

19 it may be particularly necessary here because under the

20 line of questioning that Justice Kagan just concluded

21 with you, it would seem odd for this Court to say the

22 higher crime  the more it's a highcrime area, the

23 less basis you have to stop.  That's very odd.

24             MR. GREEN:  Well, I think, Your Honor 

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So it seems to me that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 subjectivepurpose component might serve an important 2 purpose here, so that a police officer can't just say, 3 I'm going to see if there's a warrant for this fellow. 4 I'm  that's the reason I'm going to stop.  That seems 5 to me quite  quite wrong. 6             MR. GREEN:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I think 7 the answer to that question is  is that in the cases 8 upon which Respondent relies, citing the  the  the 9 subjectivepurpose requirement, those have all been 10 cases involving arrests without probable cause.  And in 11 those circumstances, the  the factors and the facts 12 that we think this Court discussed in those cases go to 13 show the objective unreasonableness of those particular 14 actions. 15             We think it's different in the context of a 16 Terry stop, where this Court has repeatedly said courts 17 can make the stop in order to investigate, in order to 18 confirm or dispel suspicion.  And that's particularly 19 so, Your Honor, where  with relation to the  the 20 twopart test that we think this  that we think is 21 appropriate here, where the intervening circumstance is 22 a preexisting warrant based on probable cause, arising 23 from facts completely unrelated to the stop.  That type 24 of intervening circumstance matches up precisely with 25 what this Court found in Johnson v. Louisiana, where the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 intervening circumstance there was a commitment 

15

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is a non sequitur.

3 When you talk about an intervening circumstances 

4 we've looked at it in the case law  it's always been

5 something different than the actual stop.  Another

6 police officer comes by and says, oh, I've been

7 searching for that guy.  I know he has  I  I have

8 a  an arrest warrant for him.  A witness walks by on

9 another crime and says, he just robbed me down the

10 block.

11             Those are intervening circumstances because

12 they are something outside of the stop.  This location

13 of evidence was a direct product of the stop.

14             MR. GREEN:  Well 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It would never have

16 happened except for the stop.

17             MR. GREEN:  Your Honor, we agree that there

18 is butfor cause here.  But with respect, there was

19 actually something else that happened here.  That was

20 that prior finding of probable cause by a neutral and

21 detached magistrate on a crime completely unrelated to

22 the facts at issue in this particular stop.  So in that

23 sense, it does resemble 

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  you know

25 something?  Finding the baggie of cocaine gives the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 officer reasonable  probable cause to arrest, but we 2 don't let that cocaine come into evidence merely because 3 it was a ground for the arrest.  We look at how the 4 evidence was secured before deciding whether it's 5 suppressible or not. 6             And I don't see how this is any different 7 than not letting someone be arrested  or suppressing 8 DNA evidence, fingerprint evidence that leads to other 9 crimes.  We've suppressed those things because they've 10 been the product of an illegal stop. 11             MR. GREEN:  Justice Sotomayor, we agree with 12 you that if the bag of cocaine  if an officer had 13 found a bag of cocaine during an unlawful stop, that's 14 the precise situation where the exclusionary rule would 15 usually apply. 16             What's different here is that the search in 17 which the  in which the drugs and the other evidence 18 was found occurred while the suspect was in lawful 19 custody. 20             Respondent has admitted that the arrest 21 warrant was lawful.  And the arrest was therefore 22 lawful.  And under this Court's decision in Robinson, 23 once the arrest is lawful, the search incident to it is 24 lawful, and all the evidence gathered in any that  in 25 any search is lawfully seized.

1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Green, you made a

17

2 statement in reply brief that says, "The Fourth

3 Amendment does not require officers to have reasonable

4 suspicion before they check for warrants."

5             If you mean that, then any officer can say,

6 what's your name, I'll check you for a warrant.

7             MR. GREEN:  An officer could do that, Your

8 Honor.  That's certainly right.  But what happened here

9 is that the  the  of course that request came during

10 the course of a stop that we've conceded was not

11 supported by reasonable suspicion.  And so the question

12 is what happens 

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you say they didn't

14 need reasons for suspicion.  I mean, as I read the

15 sentence, it says the officer doesn't have to have

16 reasonable suspicion.  It can grab you, what's your

17 name, and check for warrants, and that doesn't violate

18 the Fourth Amendment.

19             MR. GREEN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, they

20 don't have to have reasonable suspicion to check for

21 warrants, but that's different from making the initial

22 stop where, of course, they do need reasonable

23 suspicion.

24             If there are no further questions, I'd like

25 to reserve the remainder of my time.

I don't 20 understand why.  If there's an arrest warrant for 21 someone, for whatever reason, you can arrest them.  What 22 you can't do is stop them illegally to effect an arrest. 23 So it's not as if they're going to get away from 24 whatever the underlying crime was.

BASH:  Well  well, they might have 8 found it during a separate valid execution of  a 9 separate execution of the warrant without a preceding 10 Terry stop, but the evidence found on a person, for 11 example, a firearm, can be very serious crimes that are 12 also of significant danger to these communities. 13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's true of all 14 evidence we suppress.  Now you're attacking our 15 suppression jurisprudence. 16             We understand there's a cost to suppressing 17 evidence.  But we believe, as we've been taught by our 18 precedents, that there is value in ensuring that the 19 Fourth Amendment is respected. 20             MR. BASH:  Of course.  And the overarching 21 inquiry always is weighing those very serious costs of 22 excluding evidence of guilt against the deterrent value 23 that you would get  24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's our rule now? 25 Now you don't need reasonable suspicion to stop someone.

20 1 You only need questionable reasonable suspicion to stop 2 someone. 3             (Laughter.) 4             MR. BASH:  Well  5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And now  so we've now 6 lessened the standard  the Terry stop standard, which 7 is fairly intrusive to stop someone. 8             I  I suspect, and I don't know whose brief 9 it was, yours or your  or Petitioner's, but someone 10 said the public will stop this if they don't like police 11 stopping you with no cause.  I think the public may end 12 up stopping things but in a way the police are not going 13 to like. 14             MR. BASH:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, we're 15 not talking about all Terry cases.  We're talking about 16 a class of carry  Terry cases where an intervening 17 event of huge legal significance occurs. 18             It turns out that a neutral magistrate had 19 already found probable cause to arrest this person.  So 20 we're certainly not talking about lowering the Terry 21 standard in all cases  22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  But  but we're 23 not saying  24             JUSTICE ALITO:  You're not talking about the 25 statistics, Mr. Bash.  Could you do that?

1             And then does the United States know the

21

2 percentage of residents of the United States who have

3 outstanding warrants?

4             MR. BASH:  We don't know globally.  In the

5 reply brief of the Petitioner in this case, he cited a

6 study submitted to the Department of Justice in 2004

7 that looked at two counties.  I don't pretend they're

8 representative, but it's a county in Minnesota and

9 Maryland, and it was an extremely low number of warrants

10 per person.

11             And of course, using that number would take

12 the assumption that every warrant is for a different

13 person, which is probably not true.  And it would assume

14 that the population reflects the total number of people

15 who could be subject to warrants, but of course, people

16 pass through, people come in and out.  So it's probably

17 extremely low.

18             I  I do take Justice Kagan's point,

19 though, that there are some communities where the

20 warrants are high.  I want to focus 

21             JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  And what  what

22 should we be concerned about there?  What  what would

23 prevent the problem in  in communities like that?

24             MR. BASH:  Well, it's  it's important to

25 know that Respondent's rule does nothing to solve the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 problem that the  the Department of Justice in its

22

2 March report  March 2015 report on Ferguson

3 identified.

4             What was going on in Ferguson is that the

5 municipal court, in conjunction with the police, were

6 using arrest warrants as a revenueraising measure.

7 They were issuing warrants for very minor offenses and

8 failure to appear, and then police officers on the scene

9 had the incentive to arrest people to bring them in to

10 pay the fine.  Respondent's rule does nothing to solve

11 that because everybody agrees the arrest is lawful.

12             The Department of Justice did not find, even

13 in a community with as significant number of arrest

14 warrants as Ferguson, that officers had an incentive to

15 search, and that they were acting on an

16 incentivetosearchpeople incident.  The incentive was

17 to arrest and pay the fine.

18             With respect to 

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I guess  I  I take

20 the point, Mr. Bash, but I guess I just don't

21 understand.  Of course, this is a nationwide rule that

22 we would be setting.  But most Terry stops do not happen

23 in most neighborhoods.  Most Terry stops happen in very

24 highcrime neighborhoods  appropriately, but where

25 people have lots of arrest warrants.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             And  and you might be right about the

23

2 specific Ferguson case, but I still have my question,

3 which is why doesn't that dramatically change the

4 incentives for police officers in deciding whether to

5 search somebody?  If you know that there is a

6 significant possibility that somebody you stop is going

7 to have an arrest warrant, that's another reason to stop

8 them.

9             MR. BASH:  Justice Kagan, I don't think the

10 empirics show that the numbers are so great that even in

11 highcrime neighborhoods, at least outside of the

12 Ferguson circumstance where you have this odd

13 revenueraising scheme, that the  the chance of both

14 finding a warrant and then finding contraband in the

15 search ensuing to arrest is so high that it's

16 incentivizing officers to conduct illegal stops solely

17 for the purpose of finding a warrant.

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So that was my point about

19 the importance or the likely importance of purpose in

20 this analysis.

21             MR. BASH:  And  and I was actually just

22 going to turn to that, Justice Kennedy.

23             I think when this Court has mentioned

24 flagrancy in cases, not only those cases listing the

25 Brown factors, but also cases like Leon and Herring,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 what it has been concerned about in part is the notion 2 that once you establish an attenuation principle, what I 3 would say is a commonsense principle here that 4 generally an arrest warrant should be a superseding 5 cause of the discovery of the evidence, you might have 6 an officer exploiting that rule precisely in order to 7 get evidence in searches incident to arrests. 8             So I think the way you could think about 9 flagrancy is:  Did this officer have the purpose  and 10 it could either be a purpose objectively understood from 11 all of the facts or it could be a subjective purpose  12 to exploit this attenuation exception precisely in order 13 to search incident to arrest. 14             I don't think the facts here remotely get 15 there.  I  I don't really think even Respondent has 16 argued that.  This was a legitimate investigation.  The 17 officer may have made a mistake about the quantum of 18 suspicion necessary, but if you had a case where an 19 officer truly, either objectively or subjectively, is 20 going out, just pulling random people over because he 21 now knows about this attenuation rule established in 22 this case, I think that's the sort of flagrancy 23 consideration in cases like Leon and Herring this Court 24 has left as a safety valve. 25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But does that mean that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1 we're going to have to, in every single case, explore 2 the officer's subjective motivations?  Because that 3 sounds like the kind of inquiry that we've tried to stay 4 away from in the past. 5             MR. BASH:  Justice Kagan, Justice Kennedy 6 suggested subjective motivations.  And I think that has 7 some support in the earlier attenuation cases, like 8 Brown and Dunaway and Taylor, where it really did seem 9 to be that the Court was inquiring about purpose.  And 10 it also has some support in doctrines like inevitable 11 discovery, which does ask, you know, what were you going 12 to do, in effect? 13             In more recent cases, the Court has moved 14 towards an objective test.  So I think the way the Court 15 could formulate the flagrancy safety valve in this case 16 is to say does this stop appear objectively designed to 17 exploit the ability to search, incident to arrest on a 18 warrant. 19             And it could look at all the circumstances. 20 It could look at the fact that this wasn't incident to 21 any legitimate investigation.  It could look to the fact 22 that the officer pulled over several people and searched 23 them for warrants in the same incident.  I think it 24 could have that safety valve, which would have the 25 effect of preserving cases like this one, where an
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1 officer is acting in good faith, and someone is found 2 with very serious evidence on them of drug trafficking 3 or a firearm.  And it would make  4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, we've gotten to the 5 point where we no longer have reasonable suspicion at 6 all, because you keep defending this stop.  And I keep 7 going to back to he has an anonymous call; he does see a 8 certain number of shortstay visits, but he stops 9 someone who he doesn't know has been a shortstay visit, 10 has not seen there before, knows nothing about this 11 person, and is doing a complete intrusive stop  not 12 just a hey, willyoutalktome stop, but a formal 13 investigatory stop  on nothing else. 14             MR. BASH:  Justice Sotomayor, respectfully, 15 I think this  I think this was a close case and 16 I'll  I'll just lay out why.  Maybe you'll disagree 17 with that. 18             This is an officer with 18 years of 19 experience and several years, or a couple years, in 20 drug  drug crimes.  Got an anonymous tip that this was 21 a drug house.  Observed it intermittently for three 22 hours and saw shortterm traffic that was consistent in 23 his experience and expertise with drug activity.  And 24 then someone walked out of the house. 25             That person could have been one of two
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 people.  He could have been a shortterm visitor, in

27

2 which case, I think most people would agree, that there

3 would be cause to stop.  Or it could be a longterm

4 resident of that house.  And there's not too many houses

5 that are involved in a long, ongoing drug trafficking or

6 drug sales that the  a longterm resident of that

7 house wouldn't know about.  I mean, this wasn't a pizza

8 deliveryman.  This was some 

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  But it's  it's 

10 it's a given that there was no reasonable suspicion.

11 And you could argue whether it was.  But for our

12 purposes.  There was no reasonable suspicion.

13             MR. BASH:  As the case comes to the Court,

14 that is correct, Justice Ginsburg.  My only point was

15 this isn't the example, in my mind, of the safety valve

16 flagrancy situation that I was discussing with

17 Justice Kagan and Justice Kennedy.

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that  would you 

19 the reason that this case comes to us is because the

20 Utah Supreme Court says, no, this is three kings and

21 flagrant; this is all very confusing.  And courts are

22 coming out all over the lot, so we want to come up with

23 a simpler test.

24             Do you have  are you saying Utah was

25 wrong?  That the threeprong test that we have now is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1 fine?  Would you change, in any respect, how we look at 2 these attenuations? 3             MR. BASH:  Well, I don't think the 4 threeprong way is a bad way to look at it.  The cases 5 have actually used the three prongs to determine whether 6 a defendant's confession is the product of free will. 7             Mr. Chief Justice, can I  8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish your 9 sentence, sir. 10             MR. BASH:  We think it's a fine way to think 11 about this case, in the sense of the Court could hold 12 superseding legal authority by a neutral magistrate is 13 an intervening event of significance for the attenuation 14 analysis, and suppression would be appropriate only if 15 the stop was flagrant, either objectively or 16 subjectively understood. 17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 18             Ms. Watt. 19               ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOAN C. WATT 20                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 21             MS. WATT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 22 please the Court: 23             Utah's proposed rule would open the door to 24 abuse. 25             It would create a powerful incentive for
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 police officer  officers to detain citizens without 2 concern for the Fourth Amendment, knowing that finding a 3 warrant would wipe the slate clean and render the 4 constitutional violation irrelevant.  It would cut the 5 heart out of Terry.  It would create a new form of 6 investigation.  Officers would be stopping citizens and 7 hunting for warrants. 8             It's already the practice in many 9 communities, and if Utah's rule is adopted, it will 10 become the norm. 11             It's unnecessary for this Court to take such 12 a sweeping view as  as Utah has. 13             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, would that be true if, 14 let's say, onehalf of 1 percent of the residents of 15 South Salt Lake or Salt Lake City have outstanding 16 warrants? 17             MS. WATT:  The statistics are important to 18 our argument, but not necessary.  Because even without 19 the statistics, we know that officers make stops 20 precisely for that reason:  To find the warrant.  That's 21 why they're making the stop.  They can target 22 communities.  And so even if there's just a  a very 23 minor amount of  of warrants, they can still target 24 communities that may have a greater incidence of 25 warrants.  And if this were the rule, there would be no
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 downside.  Officers 

30

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's true, there's a

3 downside.  If the officer makes an illegal stop, the

4 officer exposes himself or herself to all sorts of

5 consequences.

6             But you're saying that, let's  if the 

7 on the statistic that I gave you, if there's a 1 in 200

8 chance that there's going to be an outstanding warrant,

9 so the officer says well, you know, I don't have  I

10 have no reason to stop this person, but if I stop 200

11 people today illegally, then I'm going to find one who

12 has an outstanding warrant, you would say that that 

13 that gives the officer the incentive to make those 199

14 illegal stops.

15             MS. WATT:  Well, it's still precisely why

16 the officer would be doing it.  He's writing the warrant

17 check in this  in this facts situation.  We're talking

18 about  about a very narrow set of facts where we have

19 an officer that detained someone, and as part of that

20 detention, there is a warrants check.  These  these

21 were not separate things.  It was inherent in this stop.

22             And so, yes, if an officer is detaining

23 someone under those circumstances and runs a warrants

24 check, he's doing it precisely.

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could  could you  is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 it permissible to do a warrant check as part of a lawful 2 Terry stop? 3             MS. WATT:  A lawful Terry stop? 4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes. 5             MS. WATT:  We  in our brief, we referred 6 to Rodriguez, and  and this Court has certainly said 7 that, at least in the context of  of automobile stops, 8 yes. 9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in  in  in this 10 case, the State, as I understand it  please correct me 11 if I'm wrong  has conceded that the stop was unlawful. 12 It has not conceded that it was flagrantly unlawful; 13 isn't  isn't that correct? 14             MS. WATT:  Well, that's right.  That's 15 right.  And  and so, what  but what  the position 16 that the State has taken is  17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So we take the case as one 18 in which there was no  there was no flagrant conduct? 19             MS. WATT:  The  so the test under Brown 20 for flagrancy really has two elements.  One is whether 21 it was done deliberately or purposefully.  And we know 22 from Dunaway and Taylor, and Brown itself that  that 23 unlawful conduct that is undertaken with the purpose or 24 with the hope of finding something, with the hope that 25 something turns out  up, is deliberate and is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 flagrant.  And  and Dunaway tells us that we don't

32

2 need some overarching flagrancy, that that's enough.

3             And so the purpose is important.  It's

4 viewed from an objective standpoint.  Here, we have an

5 officer that told us his purpose.  But objectively, we

6 do look at purpose.  We look at justification.  That's

7 how we know the limits of a Terry stop.

8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What  what's the

9 number?  What percentage of people have to have warrants

10 before you can imply that whenever an officer stops

11 someone, it is to, you know, illegally search them

12 because they're very likely to have an arrest warrant?

13             MS. WATT:  Well, I think that the proper

14 focus  I mean, I  I don't think breaking it down to

15 numbers is the way to go.  I think the proper focus is

16 on deterrence.  And we know deterrence is not just 

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I suppose

18 that's related.  I mean, your brief had a lot of numbers

19 in it.  And if only one out of a hundred people have

20 arrest warrants, then I think you really couldn't imply

21 that that was the purpose of the stop.

22             MS. WATT:  If you had 

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And some of these

24 numbers  obviously, you have, in particular

25 communities, high numbers, but some of them didn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 strike me  I was surprised how low they were.  323,000 2 is a big number, but that's the entire State of Florida. 3             MS. WATT:  So  so the officers run 4 warrants because  warrants checks because they're 5 likely to turn up warrants.  With  when they target 6 certain  7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is that?  You 8 mean every time a police officer pulls somebody over and 9 runs a warrant check, it's because he thinks it's likely 10 there's a warrant?  Might it  might it be to protect 11 him when he walks up to the car?  He'd like to know that 12 the person is wanted for murder, right? 13             MS. WATT:  So running the warrants check 14 tells him that.  That's  when you run the warrants 15 check, you're looking for a warrant.  In this case, 16 that's what that Officer Fackrell was doing.  He wanted 17 to try to find out something about Mr. Strieff, and so 18 he ran the warrants check. 19             The  these kinds of stops, it is  20 there  21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I guess  I 22 mean, you do require us to determine whether or not he 23 ran the warrant check to ensure his safety in  in this 24 interaction, or as an investigative matter.  I mean, 25 does that make a difference?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1             MS. WATT:  In  he  it makes a difference 2 in the sense that when there is a stop that is  is 3 made, that the warrants check is inherent in that stop. 4             So I guess my answer is no, it doesn't make 5 a difference, because when warrants check is  6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why wouldn't it?  Why 7 wouldn't it?  Now, look at our case, Rodriguez case.  We 8 assumed that the check there was to ensure the safety of 9 the officer. 10             MS. WATT:  That's right. 11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right. 12             MS. WATT:  Right. 13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If the stop here is 14 purely investigatory, isn't that different?  Can you 15 have an investigatory stop based on no suspicion? 16             You were right when you said he stopped to 17 check for the warrant.  The question is Justice 18 Kennedy's question, which is:  Is that legitimate? 19             MS. WATT:  Can  can you have an 20 investigative stop  21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes. 22             MS. WATT:   to check for a warrant without 23 reasonable suspicion or with? 24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Without. 25             MS. WATT:  Without, you cannot.  You

2 reasonable suspicion to run a warrants check.

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  As I understand your

4 position, you don't argue that the arrest was unlawful;

5 is that right?

6             MS. WATT:  We don't.  We have never

7 challenged.

8             JUSTICE ALITO:  So the arrest was lawful.

9 And when the officer is making the arrest, it's

10 permissible for safety purposes for the officer to frisk

11 the person who is being arrested.  Do you agree with

12 that?

13             MS. WATT:  Yes.

14             JUSTICE ALITO:  So it's a  so it's a

15 lawful search, correct.

17 search.

18             JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it  can you  can

19 you give me one other example of a situation in which

20 this Court has held that the fruit of a lawful search

21 must be suppressed?

23 precise circumstance.  Our position throughout 

24             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in any circumstance.

25             MS. WATT:  So  so this case has not come

36 1 before the Court.  We know that an arrest warrant is not 2 always an intervening circumstance.  It wasn't one in 3 Taylor v. Alabama. 4             And  and even  even Utah and the 5 Solicitor General don't take the position that just 6 the  the arrest and the search incident to arrest are 7 enough because they've conceded that dragnets  that 8 any evidence that's found in the dragnet is a fruit. 9 And  and so that  10             JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm just pointing it out 11 that that's a curiosity, isn't it, to have a law  to 12 suppress the fruit of a lawful search?  And maybe you 13 need strong circumstances to justify such an unusual and 14 unprecedented result. 15             MS. WATT:  Well, our position is these are 16 strong circumstances because part of deterrence  the 17 value of deterrence is found in the strength of the 18 incentive to violate the Constitution. 19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you  20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, I thought that  21 you said  22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Go ahead. 23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said you don't 24 question at all the arrest, and you don't question, once 25 there is an arrest, to pat down for drugs  I mean, the

WATT:  Well, our position is that 7 anything that's found is the fruit of that, of that 8 illegal detention, not of the arrest, because the  9 the arrest and  and ultimate  and subsequent search 10 are  are a fruit, but  but they're not suppressible. 11 They're not something that we have fought against 12 because, again, we have the warrant and authorization. 13             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if the individual is 14 going to be arrested and put in jail, isn't it standard 15 procedure and lawful procedure for the authorities to 16 search that person thoroughly?  They couldn't have a 17 person bring drugs into  into the jail or things that 18 the person might use to hurt himself or other people? 19             MS. WATT:  It would still be a fruit. 20             JUSTICE ALITO:  So it would  well, what 21 does that mean?  It's  but it's not  it  that 22 doesn't  that's lawful conduct on their part, right? 23             MS. WATT:  Right. 24             JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  But  so you're 25 asking for the suppression of the fruit of a lawful
Alderson Reporting Company

1 search.

38

2             MS. WATT:  What we're asking for is the

3 suppression based on the unlawful detention that began

4 the encounter.  So  so this encounter begins with the

5 stop.  The stop itself is  is unlawful.  The State has

6 conceded that throughout.

7             So what's  what's the problem with that

8 stop?  This is a stop  the kind of stop that lawyer 

9 or, I'm sorry  that officers are faced with every day.

10 It's a basic kind of stop.  It  what  what do we

11 know about Terry stops?  The officers have to  have to

12 have a reasonable articulable suspicion.

13             Courts have  tells us that it's really a

14 twostep assessment.  They have to, No. 1, look at the

15 totality of the circumstances, and No. 2, they then have

16 to look at whether there is an individualized suspicion,

17 does this tie in with this defendant?

18             So in this case, what does the officer know?

19 All he knows is that there's some short  not terribly

20 frequent, shortstay traffic at the house.  He sees my

21 client emerge from the house, knows nothing else.  So

22 even under the totality, a reasonably welltrained

23 officer should have known this stop was not  was bad.

24             Second 

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're arguing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 something that the State's conceded, right?

39

2             MS. WATT:  Well, I think it's important

3 because the State has taken the position that  that

4 this was just a fact or two shy of  of what was

5 needed.  And being a fact or two shy of Terry leaves us

6 with nothing.  Terry is already a fairlylow standard,

7 but it's a 

8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you still have to say

9 that it's flagrant.

10             MS. WATT:  Well, my position is  is

11 twofold; one, that  that flagrancy has two aspects.

12 One aspect is just the deliberate aspect.  And that

13 in  in this type of a stop where  where it's made

14 for the purpose of  of running a warrants check, if

15 the  the warrants check is inherent in the stop, that

16 that's enough; but secondly, if we were going to 

17 going to include a different definition, it would be

18 that it was blatantly unconstitutional.

19             And so that's why I'm moving into the stop,

20 to talk about what was the problem with this stop, what

21 do we expect of our police officers, what do we need

22 from our police officers?

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You  you said that

24 the  that the stop was made for the purpose of running

25 for the arrest warrants.  I just don't know the basis

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 for that, other than your statistics that in certain

40

2 areas there are a high number of arrest warrants.  In

3 many areas there aren't.

4             I mean, how  is it entirely empirical?  Do

5 we have to accept and generalize from your empirical

6 evidence which  that the purpose must be to execute or

7 to check for arrest warrants?

8             MS. WATT:  No, because what  we know that

9 that's precisely what  what was done in this case,

10 what is done in some other cases.  In this case, we 

11 we have an officer that makes a stop and immediately

12 runs that warrants check.  How does 

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But he immediately

14 runs the arrest  warrants check when he makes the stop

15 because he wants to know who he's dealing with.  It

16 would be  it would be, I think, bad police work to not

17 run the warrant check until after you've had an

18 interaction with the person when the danger that you

19 could have found out about might have been when it's too

20 late to  to act on it.

21             MS. WATT:  The way he finds out who he's

22 dealing with is if there's a warrant.  The point is, he

23 didn't have a reasonable suspicion to stop my client.

24 And so 

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I understand

Alderson Reporting Company

1 that.

Official

41

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In order to run the

3 warrant 

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're implying 

5 I'm still trying to get at how you decide what the

6 purpose was.  In your brief you say several times, oh,

7 the purpose is to  to run the warrants check.  And I

8 just want to know why that's  why that's the case.

9             MS. WATT:  Because it was immediate; it was

10 inherent in what he did; because he stated that his

11 purpose in  in stopping my client was to find out

12 about my  find out about the house; and that it was

13 normal for him to run a warrants check and normal for

14 him to know  want to know who he's dealing with so.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're 

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's say that the

17 warrant check is something he does when he arrests

18 people.  I don't doubt that, but it doesn't prove that

19 that was his purpose in  in the stop.

20             MS. WATT:  So the intended consequence of

21 running a warrants check is to find a warrant, No. 1.

22 And No. 2, our statistics show that  that in  in a

23 sizable number  it's  officers are likely to find

24 warrants.

25             The other concern is if he thought 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're asking us to say 2 that, as a matter of law, you want us to hold that the 3 purpose of this stop was to run the warrants check?  I 4 thought the purpose of the stop was to find out what was 5 going  what was going on in the house. 6             MS. WATT:  I  I think that when  when 7 an  8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The record just doesn't 9 support the first proposition that I made. 10             MS. WATT:  When an officer detains someone 11 as part of a fishing expedition in the hope that 12 something will turn up, that is  that is the purpose 13 that is a problem. 14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There was no suspicion 15 here.  He was  your client wasn't frisked. 16             MS. WATT:  I'm sorry.  Wasn't frisked? 17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  There was no 18 activity that the officer is alleged to have seen that 19 would put the officer in fear of any  that this 20 gentleman was violent or was going to turn on him or do 21 anything else. 22             MS. WATT:  No. 23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Correct? 24             MS. WATT:  Correct. 25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the purpose, as I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 understand what you're trying to say is, he is now

43

2 routinely checking every single person that he stops,

3 whether with or without reasonable suspicion.  There

4 can't be any other reason other than he wants to find

5 the warrant or not.

6             MS. WATT:  But that's 

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So part of the stop may

8 be to investigate, but the other part of the stop is

9 he's doing this routinely, with no reasonable suspicion,

10 with no articulable fear of his  for his own safety.

11 He's demanding peoples' names, and he's running a

12 warrant to do what?  You're saying to find the warrant.

13             MS. WATT:  Find the warrant.

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How often are  are

16 cars  people stopped driving, an officer walks up to

17 the car and they're shot?  Has that happened a fair

18 amount of times?

19             MS. WATT:  It does happen.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It does happen.  So

21 is there no other reason for checking to see if there

22 are warrants out for that person before you walk up to

23 the car?  Or before you conduct an inquiry with a

24 ticket?

25             MS. WATT:  So 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me not 2 wanting to get shot's a pretty good reason. 3             MS. WATT:  But this presents a completely 4 different scenario.  This officer approached 5 Mr. Strieff.  He knew very little about him.  You know, 6 as a matter of deterrence, a reasonably welltrained 7 officer would have known, should have known that there 8 wasn't enough there.  Because he didn't know anything 9 about my client, there was no individualized suspicion. 10 And  11             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, we really don't know 12 very much about exactly what happened here, which is 13 unfortunate.  But what the officer testified was that he 14 didn't just grab this guy and say give me an ID and 15 then  and then run a warrants check.  He did say that 16 he  he approached him and he said  identified 17 himself.  He said he thought there might be drug 18 activity going on in the house, and he asked him to 19 tell  he said, "I asked him to tell me what he was 20 doing there." 21             Now, we don't even know what he  unless 22 I'm  it's someplace else in this record, we don't even 23 know what your client said.  But he could have said, 24 what am I doing there, yeah, I live there, or, my mother 25 lives there, or, my best friend lives there.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1             But whatever  we don't know what he said. 2 But then at some later point he ran a warrants check. 3 So how can we infer from that, that the whole point of 4 the stop was to run the warrants check? 5             MS. WATT:  So  so a really important part 6 of the officer's testimony was that he didn't remember 7 what that answer was.  So if my client had said, I went 8 in there because there's someone who's ill and I've been 9 visiting for, you know, 20 minutes, or  or, this is 10 where my friend lives; that's why I was there, end of 11 inquiry, and  and the warrants check shouldn't have 12 been run.  A reasonably welltrained officer should 13 know. 14             The  the important part of this case is 15 that if we're only looking at  we're not just looking 16 at deterring Officer Fackrell, we're looking at 17 deterring future conduct by officers.  And the  the 18 Terry limitation is something we want our officers to 19 know.  It's fairly straightforward.  This is a fairly 20 straightforward case that is going on every day in this 21 country where officers are looking at houses, watching 22 houses that maybe, might have drug trafficking going on. 23 They're trying to establish probable cause.  Case law is 24 relatively clear about what you need to get probable 25 cause on a house.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1             It's also relatively clear about what you 2 need to get individualized suspicion.  We know from 3 Cortez we need those two elements.  We  we also know 4 from Ybarra that just being in proximity to other people 5 is not enough.  Being around  even when the officers 6 have probable cause to search or probable cause to 7 arrest someone if you're standing right there, it's not 8 enough. 9             So it should be clear to an officer that my 10 client leaving a house that he doesn't even have 11 probable cause on, that he's trying to find something 12 out about  13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, all he did was go 14 from the house to a convenience store, not in a car but 15 walking. 16             MS. WATT:  Right. 17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He walks to a 18 convenience store, he's stopped in the parking garage 19 but without a car.  And I go back to this is not coming 20 up to a parked automobile and getting shot, correct? 21             MS. WATT:  Right.  Right. 22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would your rule 23 apply in that situation? 24             MS. WATT:  Well, when an  when an officer 25 makes a stop 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would your rule

47

2 apply in a situation where the officer approaches the

3 car for a purpose that is later found to be insufficient

4 under Terry?  You would suppress whatever evidence is

5 find  found in that situation too, right?

6             MS. WATT:  If the  if the officer did not

7 have a reasonable suspicion for the stop.

8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So it would

9 apply in the stopping of the automobile situation.

10             MS. WATT:  It would.  But it's 

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.

12             MS. WATT:  But again, in these cases, if

13 there is a warrant, we haven't argued about the warrant

14 itself.  What we've  our concern is the random stops.

15 And our concern is not just for my client.  It's for all

16 of those innocent citizens that will  that are walking

17 around, that are stopped, that a warrants check is run

18 and nothing comes up and then they're sent on their way.

19 There's no oversight.

20             The  the officer is encouraged to engage

21 in  in a catchandrelease type of approach with our

22 citizenry.  And Utah's rule would be something that 

23 that would create that incentive.

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In  in your brief you

25 took the position that  that an event is intervening

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 only if it is unforeseeable.

48

2             MS. WATT:  Well, our position is that an

3 intervening circumstance needs to be independent, and

4 it  it needs to be a break in the  the causal chain.

5 And that when  when a warrant is run  and it needs

6 to be something that is not directly related to the

7 officer's conduct.

8             And so because the warrants check is an

9 inherent part of  of the detention, it's not an

10 intervening circumstance.  And that's something that 

11 that the Utah Supreme Court unanimously agreed with in

12 the dissent in the Utah court of appeals as well, agreed

13 that this is  it's a natural and foreseeable

14 consequence.  It is the intended result.  It  it is

15 not something that  that is independent, that  that

16 comes as a surprise.

17             And that  that's really consistent with

18 this Court's case law in dealing with intervening

19 circumstances.  Spontaneous confessions are something

20 that are independent; they  they break the chain.  We

21 look at free will, and that's independent and breaks the

22 chain.  Witness testimony.  But here there was no break.

23 It was a direct result of the officer's conduct.

24             The  the rule that we are really asking

25 the Court to  to adopt follows settled exclusionary

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 rule case law, and that is that  that if there is the 2 bad stop, it's suppressed unless there is attenuation. 3             And of course, if there hadn't been a 4 warrant, if  if the officer had just stopped my client 5 and searched him, I don't think anyone's contesting that 6 that would just simply be suppressed without 7 attenuation. 8             And in this case there was  there was no 9 attenuation as well because all three of the factors 10 that this Court has looked at work in favor of 11 suppression.  The temporal proximity works with us, 12 obviously.  It was  it was contemporaneous.  It was 13 immediate.  It was inherent. 14             It's not an intervening circumstance because 15 it's not independent and it's not a break in the causal 16 chain.  And it was deliberate conduct on this officer's 17 part that was blatantly unconstitutional. 18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You  you disagree 19 with Judge Friendly's analysis in the Friedman case? 20             MS. WATT:  That  in  in what respect? 21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, with  with 22 his analysis.  As  as I understand, it took the 23 position opposite to what you're arguing, and I just 24 want to know if you have a basis for distinguishing that 25 precedent.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MS. WATT:  I guess I don't, no.

50

2             So  so our position is that that this

3 falls squarely within the  the Court's settled case

4 law.  We're asking that the Utah Supreme Court be upheld

5 and 

6             JUSTICE ALITO:  You agree that attenuation

7 is based on  on deterrence; that the attenuation

8 determination is based on a calculation of the deterrent

9 effect of the ruling.

10             MS. WATT:  I do.  I do.  I  I agree that

11 the focus is on deterrence.  And I think that in this

12 circumstance, there's powerful deterrence to  to adopt

13 our position and to not follow Utah's position.

14             If  if Utah's position is  part of

15 deterrence is looking at the incentive to violate the 

16 the  the Constitution, and looking forward to see 

17 see what would happen with the rule.

18             And under Utah's rule, we  there would be

19 nothing to stop police officers from  from stopping

20 people on the street, articulating something.  Terry

21 doesn't take much.  Most  most officers can articulate

22 some sort of justification, looking for the warrant, and

23 then sending people on their way.  So  so we believe

24 that deterrence would be very well served by adopting

25 our rule.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1             JUSTICE ALITO:  And  and your deterrence 2 argument doesn't depend at all on statistics? 3             MS. WATT:  With  even without the 4 statistics, our deterrence argument works because the 5 point is a reasonably welltrained officer would  6 should know what the parameters of Terry are.  This 7 officer did not. 8             JUSTICE ALITO:  So if one in a thousand 9 people has an outstanding warrant, that's enough? 10             MS. WATT:  So  11             JUSTICE ALITO:  That statistic would  that 12 statistic wouldn't upset your argument? 13             MS. WATT:  It wouldn't upset my argument 14 because we  we run  officers run warrants checks 15 because they're likely to find them  16             JUSTICE ALITO:  One  one in 10,000, would 17 that upset your argument? 18             MS.

1 a warrant.  It's going to selfcorrect.  But for the

52

2 most part, the  I mean, and the flip side is there's

3 then no reason not to run them if that's the rule.  But

4 for the most part, in  in most communities, the  the

5 incentive there  the other thing is, with Utah's rule,

6 it could create an incentive to have even more warrants

7 for even more minor infractions.  This was a traffic

8 matter.  Many of these warrants in the cases down below

9 are minor traffic matters.  The  it

15 referred to as a minor traffic 

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think the judges in

17 the traffic  in the traffic courts are going to start

18 issuing lots of warrants because they want to provide a

19 basis for  for randomly stopping people?

20             MS. WATT:  My point is only that it  it

21 creates an incentive to not be as careful.  It

22 creates 

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm very surprised that

24 Justice Alito doesn't know that most of these warrants

25 are automatic.  If you don't pay your fine within a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 certain amount of days, they're issued virtually

53

2 automatically.

3             MS. WATT:  Right.  And that's exactly what

4 this one was.

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it doesn't create

6 an incentive of the kind you were arguing, you were

7 worried about before.

8             MS. WATT:  I'm sorry.

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The warrants  the

10 warrants are automatic.  You were suggesting that, oh,

11 one thing that will happen is they'll be issuing all

12 these warrants if they know they can get evidence from

13 illegal stops.  And because the warrants are automatic,

14 they're not going to be issuing all these warrants, are

15 they?

16             MS. WATT:  They're automatic in certain

17 circumstances, and those circumstances would increase.

18 So they're automatic right now for no insurance or for

19 speeding.  They would increase.  And  and they'd be

20 automatic for infractions.  They'd  and the other

21 aspect is the databases and the incentive to keep those

22 databases accurate and uptodate.

23             It's our position that this absolutely plays

24 into a deterrence, and that Utah's rule would have an

25 overwhelming impact that would create a powerful

There's actually no evidence of 16 the  in this record that that's what happened here, or 17 that it happens more broadly.  In fact, I think the 18 opposite is true. 19             If you look at page  20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's routine practice 21 to  to run warrant checks.  Every stop, legal or 22 illegal, he says it's  he runs warrants, on the street 23 or in a car.  Meaning, that's what the police officer 24 testified to. 25             MR. GREEN:  He  he runs them, Justice
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Sotomayor, for the purposes I think that have been

55

2 discussed today, for safety rationales and other

3 reasons.  But there's no actual evidence that he runs 

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we now have a new

5 rule.  We've taken running warrants for traffic stops

6 that we've thought were legitimate because they had to

7 do with highway safety.  Now we're saying to police

8 officers, run warrants on any name you get because all

9 you have to do is wave the flag of safety.

10             MR. GREEN:  No, Your Honor.  That's not what

11 we're saying.  We're saying that there is a safety

12 rationale for the warrant check.  But beyond that,

13 there's also the important flagrancy safety valve that

14 we've talked about here.

15             And with respect to this particular warrant

16 check on page 101 of the Appendix to our petition, there

17 is actually a finding from the district court that the

18 reason that this officer stopped this particular

19 defendant was on suspicion of drug possession or

20 distribution.  It wasn't for something else.  So that

21 finding is here.

22             And more broadly, this rule, as we've noted

23 in our papers, is, in fact, the majority rule among the

24 courts that have addressed this issue throughout the

25 country.

56 1             In the United States, and  excuse me, in 2 the Seventh Circuit, the case of United States v. Green 3 was decided in 1997, almost 20 years ago.  And that, of 4 course, involves States with a large number of 5 metropolitan areas, Chicago and Milwaukee and 6 Indianapolis.  And there's no evidence in this record or 7 before this Court that these sort of random stops in 8 order to check for warrants is happening in those 9 jurisdictions.  So I think the actual practice and the 10 way it bears out, and has borne out in  in areas where 11 this has been adopted undermines that particular 12 argument. 13             Second, Your Honor, with respect to the 14 question of whether a subjective purpose should come in, 15 responding to Justice Kennedy's question to this  to 16 this inquiry.  I think if this Court were to do that, it 17 would become an outlier of sorts in the case  in this 18 Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  And I think, 19 with respect, if  if it remains an objective inquiry 20 and consistent with the rest of this Court's cases, that 21 objective inquiry will capture the flagrant cases. 22             We've cited four cases from four different 23 State courts in our reply brief, in footnote 1 of our 24 reply brief.  That's Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey. 25 And Oregon, where the courts that have applied this rule
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
57 1 have undertaken the flagrancy inquiry and have, in fact, 2 suppressed evidence because the initial stop was 3 flagrant. 4             Finally, a third point, the  as we've 5 noted in our briefs, Your Honor, the  the Respondent 6 here has abandoned the Utah Supreme Court's rule that an 7 intervening circumstance must, in fact, be something 8 attributable to the defendant's own free will.  We think 9 that's appropriate based on that concession that it 10 would  that this Court should  should reverse the 11 judgment of the Utah Supreme Court, and leaves the 12 question, of course, of what rule to adopt instead. 13             And we think, Your Honor, this  this 14 intervening circumstance here, this arrest on a 15 preexisting warrant that arises from probable cause 16 based on facts completely unrelated to the circumstances 17 and the facts of this stop, is exactly like what 18 happened in Johnson v. Louisiana, which is the case that 19 this Court pointed to in Brown v. Illinois.  Where  20 where it adopted and said the intervening circumstance 21 is critical to the attenuation inquiry.  It's a 22 straightforward application of that particular test. 23             If there are no further questions. 24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 25             Case is submitted.
