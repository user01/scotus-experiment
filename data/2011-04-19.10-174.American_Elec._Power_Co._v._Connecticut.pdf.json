The States ask that the courts assess liability and design a new common law remedy for contributing to climate change, and to do so by applying a general standard of reasonableness to determine for each defendant, in this case and in future cases, what, if any, its share of global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions ought to be. That would require the courts not to interpret and enforce the policy choices placed into law by the other branches, but to make those policy choices themselves. And all of our arguments here -­ that plaintiffs lack standing, that the Federal common law shouldn't be expanded to include this new cause of action, and that the case presents nonjusticiable political questions -- while all of them represent distinct points, All of them flow from the same basic separation of powers principles that establish, we believe, that the case ought to be dismissed."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KEISLER",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, we believe that Massachusetts was very carefully qualified to focus on the particular regulatory context of that opinion. The Court said that it was addressing standing to challenge the denial of a petition for rulemaking, when the agency would be proceeding incrementally to address a broader problem, and a statute specifically gave the petitioners the right to seek that kind of incremental protection. The Court was very specific about that. The statutory right was of critical importance, it said, to the standing inquiry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Mr. Keisler, the Court did say that, but it's cut off from the Court's actual analysis in the case. When the Court goes through injury and causation and redressability, the Court never refers to the statutory cause of action."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KEISLER",
    "speech": "But it does, Justice Kagan, specifically refer to the regulatory context in which the case is taking place. The Court said that if the EPA's arguments there about traceability and redressability were adopted, it would doom most challenges to agency action because agencies proceed incrementally. Here we have no statute, we have no agency proceeding incrementally, and we believe there is no basis for the plaintiffs to seek that kind of incremental relief when they've acknowledged that will have no material effect on their injury; and they acknowledged that in the State's complaint when they specifically said that the relief they seek here would only constitute these defendants' share of the larger overall emissions reductions that would be necessary in order to have any material effect on climate change or the injuries that they assert. That is an acknowledgment that the relief they seek here would not provide them any redress except in connection with other reductions that would be obtained elsewhere, and that we think means that this is a classic case in which the injuries are not the product of the defendants' conduct but of the collective independent actions of numerous third parties not before the Court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "But the Court clearly understood that in Massachusetts v. EPA and said that it was enough, and I would think under traditional standing principles the standing there was actually harder to find because one had to go through the EPA first. One had to say the EPA should regulate, and then the EPA would regulate, and then the question was would that reduce emissions levels? Here the EPA is out of the picture. The action is much more direct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KEISLER",
    "speech": "But there, Your Honor, they were suing a defendant, the EPA, that had regulatory authority over the entire country. Here they're suing five separate defendants, each of whom has to be evaluated individually, and there is not a single one of them against whom the relief sought would have any tangible effect on the injuries that the plaintiffs claim here. But we also think that Massachusetts is relevant in a completely different respect, which is the Court was very specific in Massachusetts about what its role was and what it wasn't. The Court said: We lack the expertise or the authority to second-guess the policy choices of the EPA, but its role there was to compel the agency to adhere to the statute as the Court interpreted it. In this case, the States are asking the courts to play exactly the role that this Court disclaimed in Massachusetts v. EPA, which is to make those policy choices in the first instance, and they say that the courts can do this because the courts have done this in prior nuisance cases, but this case is nothing like any of the prior nuisance cases this Court has held. It's nothing like an instance in which one State is complaining that another State has dumped sewage into a body of water that's crossed the border. The case -­"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KEISLER",
    "speech": "Exactly, Your Honor, and whether the Court should expand the Federal common law to recognize this. The global nature of this phenomenon makes it different because every sector of the economy worldwide produces greenhouse gases, and there is no geographic nexus, as there was in Tennessee Copper and every one of the other nuisance cases, between the source of the emission and the victim that claims the harm. And that changes what the Court has to do. It means that any court or policymaker thinking about how to alleviate the kinds of injuries that are pled here has to first think what is the appropriate overall level of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and then make a comparative judgment about how the reductions that would be necessary to achieve that level should be allocated among all the different sectors based on the social good that that sector produces and what reductions would mean to that social good."

    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "I thought your -- your first argument when you addressed this issue was there is a decisionmaker and that decisionmaker is EPA.

    "speech": "We are making both arguments, Justice Ginsburg. We don't think there would be an appropriate Federal common law cause of action even if the Clean Air Act hadn't been enacted. But certainly the argument is even stronger and easier because of the existence of the Clean Air Act and in particular because this Court in Massachusetts v. EPA interpreted the Clean Air Act so that the term \"pollutant\" specifically includes greenhouse gases, and that means that Congress has assigned to EPA the task of making precisely the determinations that plaintiffs ask the courts to make here: Do greenhouse gases endanger the public, and if so, what regulatory consequence -­"

  {
    "speaker": "KEISLER",
    "speech": "Because this issue, and I would prefer to refer to it as displacement rather than preemption, is very different from the question of preemption of State law. The Clean Air Act has a savings clause that preserves State authority across a variety of areas, but the Court in second Milwaukee v. Illinois cases specifically distinguished between displacement of State law and displacement of Federal common law. It said the -- the presumption is against preemption of State law because of various concepts of State sovereignty, but because of Federal concepts of separation of powers, the presumption is in favor of lawmaking by Congress and not lawmaking by courts, and that means that the standard is very different. It means that if Congress has addressed the problem, then Federal common law is displaced."

    "speaker": "KEISLER",
    "speech": "Milwaukee v Illinois II. That was the case in which the Court held that the Clean Water Act displaced a Federal common law nuisance claim by Illinois against Milwaukee and specifically said because Congress had addressed the problem, Federal common law had no role to play. Here Congress has established a process and it's a process in which the States and the private parties here can participate. They can file petitions for rulemaking, they can appeal EPA decisions that they oppose, and it would be completely inconsistent with that process if they could also take a complete end run around it and go to court and ask courts to make the decisions that Congress has assigned to EPA."

You know, all the nuisance cases that the court of appeals relied on, Your Honor, they were in a completely different time. They were at a time when the Court's view of its common law authority was extremely broad and its view of Congress's constitutional power under the Commerce Clause was very narrow."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",

    "speaker": "KEISLER",
    "speech": "I don't think so, Justice Kennedy. I think the question is always what Congress has done, not what the stage of the EPA rulemaking process is. Congress, not EPA, can create or modify or destroy causes of action, and that's why the Court said in that Milwaukee 2 case that when Congress has addressed the problem that's the end of the inquiry. And there is no question that Congress has addressed not just the general problem, but the specific problem here. It has the statute which assigns EPA the authority to regulate pollutants in certain ways and pollutants have been defined under Massachusetts v. EPA to include the precise greenhouse gasses that are at issue here. There couldn't be a more specific example of Congress having addressed the problem and assigned a different approach to dealing with it than letting the courts work it out under Federal common law. The States' and the private plaintiffs' argument is that the Federal common law will only be displaced when EPA adopts the precise regulation that provides the precise form of relief that they're asking for. There's no case that says that and that's not the law."

It's announced that it will propose standards in the summer and complete a rulemaking by May. Obviously, at the close of that process there could be APA challenges on a variety of grounds, but we do believe that they have the authority to consider standards under section 111. And if the Court has no questions, with the Court's permission I would like to reserve the balance of my time."

Accordingly, the Court should apply the prudential standing doctrine and hold these lawsuits not fit for judicial resolution. The very name of the alleged nuisance, \"global warming,\" itself tells you much of what you need to know. There are billions of emitters of greenhouse gasses on the planet and billions of potential victims as well."

That is, this Court in outlining what the prudential standing doctrine is all about in, for example, Newdow has said the following at page 11: \"Without prudential standing limitations, the Court would be called upon to decide abstract questions of why public significance, even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the questions and even though judicial intervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATYAL",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Scalia, I think that this case is best like Newdow, in which the Court went to prudential standing first before Article III. And the reason for that is because this court in Massachusetts v. EPA, in analyzing the redressability prong of what you're asking said that the reductions that were sought there, if granted, would, quote, \"slow or reduce the problem.\""

  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",

  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "More than that, Newdow was a case of a father trying to assert a right on behalf of a child, and the child herself did not want that right nor did her mother. So it seems to me it's worlds apart, and when you describe prudential standing as involving generalized grievance, I thought that the generalized grievance was Article III.

    "speech": "I quite agree with you, Justice Kagan. This is not like a case in which the government is announcing some rule of standing that requires the Court to, for example, call into question previous precedents of this Court that reached the merits or something like that. It's that this Court has never had a case involving this scale and scope, and we think that the prudential standing doctrine, at least in a circumstance like this, which is a Federal common law cause of action in which the Court is already being asked to fashion the rules and, as Justice Scalia says, an equitable action in which the Court has I think special abilities to fashion relief if appropriate and not -- I think prudential standing reflects best the kind of tapestry of different factors."

We think that prudential standing best reflects the Court's general intuition in this area that when a problem is of this magnitude and literally involving the world, where everyone is a potential perpetrator, everyone is a potential victim, and where their own theory at page 15 of their brief and 32 and 40 states: \"If someone contributes one drop to the nuisance, they can be sued."

  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Counsel, you don't usually -- your phrase is exactly what bothers me. We don't usually base a decision on our general intuition, and the idea of prudential standing that we have jurisdiction of the case but we're not going to decide it is contrary to Chief Justice Marshall's famous line that if we don't have jurisdiction, we can't decide it, but if we do, we have to decide it."

And with respect to that, Mr. Chief Justice, you had asked before about State common law causes of action and whether they would be -- they would kind -- the existence of those would somehow mean that the Court should either find jurisdiction or reach the merits in a way. And we think that the same arguments that prohibit the Court from -- from -- from recognizing a Federal common law cause of action for displacement very well may be preemption questions as well that could be addressed down the road with respect to State common law actions. And we don't think the Court should be troubled by the existence of a potential State common law cause of action. It's just like Milwaukee II, in which the dissenters made precisely this argument. They said: If you don't recognize it, then the States will regulate it and it will balkanize and the like. And what the majority said is: That's a question for down the road; the question for now is has displacement occurred?"

We think none of those look anything like the -- the common law cause of action here. And, so, it would at least require this Court to extend quite dramatically Federal common law to cover this type of situation in which everyone is a potential perpetrator and everyone is a potential victim.

Does EPA, could EPA, regulate and set standards for existing sources?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATYAL",
    "speech": "Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. Let me say three things about that. First is, EPA is currently regulating existing sources. To the extent that a power plant is modified in any way to increase carbon dioxide above a certain amount -- and this is one of the so-called tailoring rules -- then those power plants right now are subject to regulation. Indeed, one has already had to get a permit. These regulations just went into effect in January 2011 for existing power plants that seek to modify. Second, there is a settlement agreement in place that commits EPA by May of 2012 to deciding how and whether to regulate existing power sources, the existing stationary sources. And third, and I think most fundamentally, there is no precedent, Justice Ginsburg, that says that the government must regulate the specific industry, the specific thing that the plaintiff isolates, in order for displacement to occur. Rather, Sea Clammers and Milwaukee II I think make explicit that that's the wrong question. And so long as the nuisance is being addressed -- and here the nuisance is undoubtedly being addressed with a panoply of different Federal actions in the area of global warming, and an executive order that says that fighting global warming is one of the government's highest priorities -- and concrete steps taken, such as the 500-page tailoring rule, the 400-page -- the -- the other hundreds of pages that EPA has done with its experts to appropriately regulate greenhouse gas emissions, as opposed to a Federal common law court of action doing something which would frankly put you all at sea in terms of the complexity, economics, international nature of the problem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "General, could I take you back on that last point to another threshold question, which is the political question doctrine? Because a lot of your arguments really sound like prongs two and three from Baker v. Carr, but you say that we shouldn't go there, that we should instead address this matter on prudential standing grounds. But the political question doctrine actually seems more natural, given the kinds of arguments you're making. So why not?"

    "speech": "But I think that the prudential standing doctrine is a bit narrower because it -- it contemplates a variety of factors, including the fact that this is a Federal common law cause of action where the Court is fashioning relief in the first place, as opposed to the political question doctrine which looks -- looks more to the standardless nature of the adjudication. We agree that -- that the political question doctrine is an appropriate way to dismiss of this case, but we think that, like Newdow, like Kowalski, this Court can handle this case on prudential standing first and recognize that this is an unprecedented action involving literally the world, and it is not suited for judicial resolution, and that flows quite naturally from the precepts of the prudential standing doctrine."

    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

It rests on three propositions: One, the interests of the States are harmed by global warming; two, these defendants, as the five largest U.S. emitters of carbon dioxide, are significant contributors to it; and, three, these defendants could take reasonable, cost-effective measures to reduce their emissions in a way that would slow the effects of global warming. We will have to prove these propositions, and after we do the district court will have to determine whether it can frame an appropriate equitable injunction. That's what discovery and trials are for. But this Court should not close the courthouse door to this case at the outset. The common law action for public nuisance has been around for hundreds of years, has been adapted by courts to cover new environmental threats, and there's no reason why the courts can't do the same thing here. The defendants say there are too many plaintiffs, too many potential defendants, and that adjudication of this case will require courts to solve the entire problem of global warming, but that is simply not so. On the plaintiffs' side, this is about the States. We are alleging the kind of injury to States that has been traditionally recognized by this Court; their lands, their citizens, their businesses are being injured by pollution emitted in other States."

That is, there could be expert testimony, there could also be evidence about whether -­ what other emitters are doing, what they do that is feasible and cost-effective to reduce their emissions. In Tennessee Copper, one of the defendants settled, and the other was subject to an order, and it would have been available to the Court to look to what the settling defendant did for some indication of what the nonsettling defendant might well be ordered to do.

One argument that the EPA -- that the United States is presenting is the way agencies go about this is incrementally, so they're starting with motor vehicles and then maybe they will go to new sources, and then they'll get to maybe where you are. But you want the Court to start with the existing sources, to set limits that may be in conflict with what an existing agency is doing.

This is a very peculiar moment in time for this case to arrive in this Court, because what is offered as displacing is something that is said to be imminent, not something that actually exists, and something that is imminent may never happen. It was, of course, for that reason that I believe the United States suggested a GBR and we suggested that the case be dismissed so that the lower courts could deal with the unfolding events as they occur. But the case is here now, and there is no Federal statute or regulation that currently regulates the emission of greenhouse gases by existing unmodified power plants, like the ones operated by the defendants. And the Clean Air Act works very differently from the Clean Water Act. It did not put in place a permit system for all emissions when it was enacted in 1970. Unlike the Clean Water Act 2 years later, which forbids all discharges until they're authorized by permit, the Clean Air Act doesn't regulate anything until the EPA makes findings and imposes restrictions."

So there has to be -- there's a strong Federal interest in there being a Federal remedy. Now, when the Clean Air Act was -- was passed, without any regulations, if it displaced the Federal common law, there would be no Federal law applicable at all, because the Federal common law would be displaced and there would be no Federal regulatory law. The States would have recourse at that point to State common law, as has been suggested. That would be available still. But this Court has said repeatedly, and it's correct, that there is a strong Federal interest in regulating this subject matter of interstate pollution with Federal law.

But you say as long as the EPA hasn't gotten to stationary sources, the court can be conducting a similar function with -- one of many differences is that if the EPA is setting the standards they will set -- they will do it through notice and comment, everybody will be able to put in a submission; but the court substituting for the EPA, how does the court replicate that notice and comment process?"

But what they point to is an agreement by EPA to begin considering whether to regulate new and existing power plants. That can't be enough. The Federal common law exists for the purpose of giving States a remedy for interstate pollution, and if it's displaced when -- when the EPA begins thinking about it, then EPA could think about it for a long time. They've said when they hope to complete this rulemaking, but it is not uncommon for delays to -- to enter into such processes, and it could be a long time before EPA actually arrives at a judgment. A lot can happen to delay or derail the fulfillment of a promise."

    "speech": "Yes. I think limitations, a limitation to substantial sources -- and I'll talk in a minute about what that might mean -- comes from the Restatement definition, from garden variety State cases about -- involving nuisance, and also perhaps from the requirements of standing itself. This case asks the Court to recognize that the States can sue the largest emitters of carbon dioxide. These defendants produce 650 million tons a year or 10 percent of U.S. emissions, and individually they produce amounts ranging from 1 to 3 and a half percent of U.S. emissions. There is no other company that comes close except perhaps for a handful of the next largest power companies."

It's a familiar task for common law courts to decide how much is substantial, too. But for an example, if the cut-off were producers of 100,000 tons per year, as in the EPA tailoring rule for new sources, just to take an example, then according to EPA's own technical data there would be at most a few thousand potential defendants."

It does exist for interstate -- for conflicts between the States essentially. So I would like to put those aside.

So that if a certain reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is ordered, that will have this effect, it will increase the cost of electricity by a certain amount, and that will produce certain effects. It will result in the loss of a certain number of jobs, it will mean that consumers will have less money to spend on other -- other things.

The suggestion has been made that the EPA has entered the field of greenhouse gas, and that's enough, but it isn't just one field. It only seems like one because the EPA once said the whole subject was off limits and beyond their jurisdiction. Once that obstacle is removed, there still remain a series of programs under the statute, a series of kinds of sources that need to be regulated. The Clean Air Act regulates by substance and by source. It's a collection of statutory programs, and taking action under one program can't displace the common law as it applies to matters outside that program. It may well be that there will be a regulation soon that displaces, but it would be very surprising if this Court concluded that the promise of regulation is enough to displace the Federal common law as distinguished from the actuality of it. The Court has suggested that a court might impose standards that would conflict with what the EPA is doing, but there's really no reason to think that would happen because if what a court sets out to do is find out what feasible methods there are for reduction and then order the defendants to make reductions that are feasible, that's a much less taxing inquiry, a much less demanding inquiry than the EPA is likely ultimately to make."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

    "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
    "speech": "I don't think it's a different set -- yes, one set of standards for reviewing an agency's determination, but the ultimate standards that are reached are going to be a level of emission reduction through either process. When the agency speaks to the question, the Federal common law is displaced. When it doesn't, and during what could be a long period of time when it doesn't, the States are entitled to a Federal law governing their dispute. So we urge this Court to keep the Federal courts open to States exercising their historic power to protect their land and their citizens from air pollution emitted in other States."

  {
    "speaker": "KEISLER",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points. First, with respect to the merits and what it would involve to adjudicate this case, Justice Kagan, it is a -- there's a reason that this issue is so fraught and difficult in international negotiations and at the EPA and in the halls of Congress, and that's because it requires policymakers to allocate burdens among critical social goods in favor of important environmental considerations; and the remedies that are being considered are potentially transformative because they involve the way we use and supply and pay for energy. And the problems with courts attempting to replicate what's going on in those venues are not simply the matter is complex, although of course it's extremely complex, but there is no legal principle here to guide the decision. It's a question of trade-offs, how the country wants to balance the projected environmental risks and benefits against the projected economic benefits and costs. If Congress enacts a statute providing a standard, then our political question argument goes away. It's not that this is permanently off limits to the judiciary. It's that it requires a standard. And in a big intractable issue like this, Congress can often create an orderly framework for consideration within a statutory context, which it has done in part by enacting the Clean Air Act. And the final point I would make my friend and I come at this really from opposite angles, in the following sense, which is the plaintiffs say that this is a deeply historically rooted cause of action with a very strong and ancient pedigree, and therefore it can't possibly present justiciability problems, under standing, political question doctrines; and we say that the very powerful standing and political question obstacles that we think are apparent on the face of this are a signal that this is nothing like the historical cause of action that they've relied on. To classify climate change as a tort would trigger a massive shift of institutional authority away from the politically accountable branches and to the courts, which we think would be inconsistent with separation of powers, and for those reasons we ask that the Court reverse the judgment and direct that the case be dismissed."
