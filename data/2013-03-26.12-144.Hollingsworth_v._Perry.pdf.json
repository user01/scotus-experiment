They said it is in the context when the public officials, the elected officials, the appointed officials, have declined, have declined to defend a statute. A statute that, by the way, excuse me, in this case a constitutional amendment, was brought forward by the initiative process. The Court said it is essential to the integrity, integrity of the initiative process in that State, which is a precious right of every citizen. The initiative process in that State, to ensure that when public officials -- and after all, the initiative process is designed to control those very public officials, to take issues out of their hands. And if public officials could effectively veto an initiative by refusing to appeal it, then the initiative process would be invalidated."

And of course, if that kind of action is the very kind that does not lie, well, then to say, but they really feel it's important that the law be enforced, they really want to vindicate the process, and these are people of special interests. They -- we found the five citizens who most strongly want to vindicate the interest in the law being enforced and the process for making the law be enforced, well, that won't distinguish it from a public action. But then you say, but also they are representing the State. At this point, the Dellinger brief which takes the other side of it is making a strong argument, well, they aren't the State. They are really no more than a group of five people who feel really strongly that we should vindicate this public interest and have good reason for thinking it. So you have read all these arguments that it's not really the agent and so forth. What do you want to say about it?"

It might as well say it in those terms, Your Honor."

    "speech": "Thank you very much, Your Honor. My -- my -- excuse me. As I was saying, the accepted truth -- excuse me. The accepted truth that -- that the New York high court observed is one that is changing and changing rapidly in this country as people throughout the country engage in an earnest debate over whether the age-old definition of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. The question before this Court is whether the Constitution puts a stop to that ongoing democratic debate and answers this question for all 50 States. And it does so only if the Respondents are correct that no rational, thoughtful person of goodwill could possibly disagree with them, in good faith, on this agonizingly difficult issue. The issues, the constitutional issues that have been presented to the Court, are not of first impression here. In Baker against Nelson, this Court unanimously dismissed for want of a substantial Federal question."
  },

    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

  {
    "speaker": "COOPER",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, certainly I acknowledge the precedential limitations of a summary dismissal. But Baker against Nelson also came fairly fast on the heels of the Loving decision. And, Your Honor, I simply make the observation that it seems implausible in the extreme, frankly, for nine justices to have -- to have seen no substantial Federal question if it is true, as the Respondents maintain, that the traditional definition of marriage, insofar as -- insofar as it does not include same-sex couples, insofar as it is a gender definition, is irrational and can only be explained -- can only be explained, as a result of anti-gay malice and a bare desire to harm. That would have been --"

Virtually every appellate court, State and Federal, with one exception, Hawaii, in a superseded opinion, has agreed that it is not a gender-based classification, but I guess it is gender -based in the sense that marriage itself is a gendered institution, a gendered term. And so in the same way that fatherhood is gendered or motherhood is gendered, it's gendered in that sense. But we -- we agree that to the extent that the classification impacts, as it clearly does, same-sex couples, that -- that classification can be viewed as being one of sexual orientation rather than --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "All right. If that -- if that is true, then why aren't they a class? If they're a class that makes any other discrimination improper, irrational, then why aren't we treating them as a class for this one benefit? Are you saying that the interest of marriage is so much more compelling than any other interest as they could have?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COOPER",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, we certainly are not. We -- we are saying the interest in marriage and the -- and the State's interest and society's interest in what we have framed as responsible pro -- procreation is -- is vital, but at bottom, with respect to those interests, our submission is that same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples are simply not similarly situated. But to come back to your precise question, I think, Justice Sotomayor, you're -- you're probing into whether or not sexual orientation ought to be viewed as a quasi-suspect or suspect class, and our position is that it does not qualify under this Court's standard and -- and traditional tests for identifying suspectedness. The -- the class itself is -- is quite amorphous. It defies consistent definition as -- as the Plaintiffs' own experts were -- were quite vivid on. It -- it does not -- it -- it does not qualify as an accident of birth, immutability in that -- in that sense. Again, the Plaintiffs --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "So you -- so what -- I don't quite understand it. If you're not dealing with this as a class question, then why would you say that the government is not free to discriminate against them?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COOPER",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I would think that -- that -- I think it's a -- it's a very different question whether or not the government can proceed arbitrarily and irrationally with respect to any group of people, regardless of whether or not they qualify under this Court's traditional test for suspectedness. And -- and the hypothetical I understood you to be offering, I would submit would create -- it would -- unless there's something that -- that is not occurring to me immediately, an arbitrary and capricious distinction among similarly situated individuals, that -- that is not what we think is at the -- at the root of the traditional definition of marriage."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Mr. Cooper, could I just understand your argument. As -- in reading the briefs, it seems as though your principal argument is that same-sex and opposite -- sex couples are not similarly situated because opposite-sex couples can procreate, same-sex couples cannot, and the State's principal interest in marriage is in regulating procreation. Is that basically correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COOPER",
    "speech": "I -- Your Honor, that's the essential thrust of our -- our position, yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Is -- is there -- so you have sort of a reason for not including same-sex couples. Is there any reason that you have for excluding them? In other words, you're saying, well, if we allow same-sex couples to marry, it doesn't serve the State's interest. But do you go further and say that it harms any State interest?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COOPER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, we -- we go further in -- in the sense that it is reasonable to be very concerned that redefining marriage to -- as a genderless institution could well lead over time to harms to that institution and to the interests that society has always -- has -- has always used that institution to address. But, Your Honor, I --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Well, could you explain that a little bit to me, just because I did not pick this up in your briefs. What harm you see happening and when and how and -- what -- what harm to the institution of marriage or to opposite-sex couples, how does this cause and effect work?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COOPER",
    "speech": "Once again, I -- I would reiterate that we don't believe that's the correct legal question before the Court, and that the correct question is whether or not redefining marriage to include same-sex couples would advance the interests of marriage as a --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, then are -- are you conceding the point that there is no harm or denigration to traditional opposite-sex marriage couples? So you're conceding that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COOPER",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, no. I'm not conceding that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, but, then it -- then it seems to me that you should have to address Justice Kagan's question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COOPER",
    "speech": "Thank you, Justice Kennedy. I have two points to make on them. The first one is this, the Plaintiffs' expert acknowledged that redefining marriage will have real-world consequences, and that it is impossible for anyone to foresee the future accurately enough to know exactly what those real-world consequences would be. And among those real-world consequences, Your Honor, we would suggest are adverse consequences. But consider the California voter, in 2008, in the ballot booth, with the question before her whether or not this age-old bedrock social institution should be fundamentally redefined, and knowing that there's no way that she or anyone else could possibly know what the long-term implications of a profound redefinition of a bedrock social institution would be. That is reason enough, Your Honor, that would hardly be irrational for that voter to say, I believe that this experiment, which is now only fairly four years old, even in Massachusetts, the oldest State that is conducting it, to say, I think it better for California to hit the pause button and await additional information from the jurisdictions where this experiment is still maturing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Mr. Cooper, let me -- let me give you one -- one concrete thing. I don't know why you don't mention some concrete things. If you redefine marriage to include same-sex couples, you must -- you must permit adoption by same-sex couples, and there's -- there's considerable disagreement among -- among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a -- in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not. Some States do not -- do not permit adoption by same-sex couples for that reason."

  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "I -- it's true, but irrelevant. They're arguing for a nationwide rule which applies to States other than California, that every State must allow marriage by same-sex couples. And so even though States that believe it is harmful -- and I take no position on whether it's harmful or not, but it is certainly true that -- that there's no scientific answer to that question at this point in time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COOPER",
    "speech": "And -- and that, Your Honor, is the point I am trying to make, and it is the Respondents' responsibility to prove, under rational basis review, not only that -- that there clearly will be no harm, but that it's beyond debate that there will be no harm."
  },

    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "COOPER",
    "speech": "That's true, Your Honor. And if there were a way to -- to cabin the arguments that are being presented to you to California, then the concerns about redefining marriage in -- in California could be confined to California, but they cannot, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "I -- I think there's -- there's substantial -- that there's substance to the point that sociological information is new. We have five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years of history or more. On the other hand, there is an immediate legal injury or legal -- what could be a legal injury, and that's the voice of these children. There are some 40,000 children in California, according to the Red Brief, that live with same-sex parents, and they want their parents to have full recognition and full status. The voice of those children is important in this case, don't you think?"

    "speaker": "COOPER",

That consideration especially in the political process where this issue is being debated and will continue to be debated, certainly, in California. It's being debated elsewhere. But on that -- on that specific question, Your Honor, there -- there simply is no data. In fact, their expert agreed there is no data, no study, even, that would examine whether or not there is any incremental beneficial effect from marriage over and above the domestic partnership laws that were enacted by the State of California to recognize, support, and honor same-sex relationships and their families. There is simply no data at all that would -- that would permit one to draw -- draw that conclusion. I would recall, Justice Kennedy, the point made in Romer, that under a rational basis of review, the provision will be sustained even if it operates to the disadvantage of a group, if it is -- if it otherwise advances rationally a legitimate State interest."

Now, let's look at California. What precisely is the way in which allowing gay couples to marry would interfere with the vision of marriage, as procreation of children, that allowing sterile companies -- couples of different sexes to marry would not? I mean, there are lots of people who get married who can't have children. And so take a State that does allow adoption and say -- there, what is the justification for saying no gay marriage? Certainly not the one you said, is it?"

They're free of all that. So start from the proposition that a State has standing to defend the constitutionality of a State law -- beyond dispute. The question then is, who represents the State? Now, in a State that has initiative, the whole process would be defeated if the only people who could defend the statute are the elected public officials. The whole point -- you know this better than I do because you're from California -- the whole point of the initiative process was to allow the people to circumvent public officials about whom they were suspicious. So if you reject that proposition, what is left is the proposition that the State -- State law can choose some other person, some other group to defend the constitutionality of a State law. And the California Supreme Court has told us that the Plaintiffs in this case are precisely those people. So how do you get around that?"

The California Supreme Court thought that it could decide that the proponents, whoever they were, and this could be 25 years after the election, it could be one of the proponents, it could be four of the proponents. They could have an interest other than the State because they have no fiduciary responsibility to the State. They may be incurring attorneys' fees on behalf of the State or on behalf of themselves, but they haven't been appointed. They have no official responsibility to the State. And my only argument, and I know it's a close one because California thinks that this is the system. The California Supreme Court thought that this was a system that would be a default system.

But when a person has the interest of defending this law, as opposed to defending the law of the State of California, there can be all kinds of conflicts, all kinds of situations. That's what I got out of the brief. So give the person that interest. And that, they say, is what's missing here. And you'll say -- I mean, that's -- that's here, and you say it's missing here."

It's an individual right that this Court again and again and again has said the right to get married, the right to have the relationship of marriage is a personal right. It's a part of the right of privacy, association, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In the cases in which you've described the right to get married under the Constitution, you've described it as marriage, procreation, family, other things like that.

The institution developed to serve purposes that, by their nature, didn't include homosexual couples. It is -- yes, you can say that it serves some of the other interests where it makes sense to include them, but not all the interests.

However, to the extent that my opponent in the context of California, talks about child-rearing or adoptions or -- or of rights of people to live together and that sort of thing, those arguments can't be made on behalf of California because California's already made a decision that gay and lesbian individuals are perfectly suitable as parents, they're perfectly suitable to adopt, they're raising 37,000 children in California, and the expert on the other side specifically said and testified that they would be better off when their parents were allowed to get married."

    "speech": "I -- I think that it's not that we're arguing that those are inconsistent. If the -- if the fundamental thing is that denying gays and lesbians the right of marriage, which is fundamental under your decisions, that is unconstitutional. If it is -- if the State comes forth with certain arguments -- Utah might come forth with certain justifications. California might come forth with others. But the fact is that California can't make the arguments about adoption or child-rearing or people living together because they have already made policy decisions.

And if you -- if a State prohibits polygamy, it's prohibiting conduct. If it prohibits gay and lesbian citizens from getting married, it is prohibiting their exercise of a right based upon their status. It's selecting them as a class, as you described in the Romer case and as you described in the Lawrence case and in other cases, you're picking out a group of individuals to deny them the freedom that you've said is fundamental, important, and vital in this society, and it has status and stature, as you pointed out in the VMI case.

We do think that, while it's certainly not free of doubt, that the better argument is that there is not Article III standing here because -- I don't want to go beyond just summarizing our position, but -- because we don't have a formal position. But we do think that with respect to standing, that at this point with the initiative process over, that Petitioners really have what is more in the nature of a generalized grievance and because they're not an agent of the State of California or don't have any other official tie to the State that would -- would result in any official control of their litigation, that the better conclusion is that there's not Article III standing here."

With respect to the merits, two fundamental points lead to the conclusion that there's an equal protection violation here. First, every warning flag that warrants exacting scrutiny is present in this case. And Petitioners' defense of Proposition 8 requires the Court to ignore those warning flags and instead apply highly deferential Lee Optical rational basis review as though Proposition 8 were on a par with the law of treating opticians less favorably than optometrists, when it really is the polar opposite of such a law."

So a State that has made considerable progress has to go all the way, but at least the government's position is, if it has done -- the State has done absolutely nothing at all, then it's -- it can do -- do as it will."

And I understand Your Honor's point and the point that Justice Kennedy raised earlier, but I do think this Court's equal protection jurisprudence requires the Court to evaluate the interests that the State puts forward, not in a vacuum, but in the context of the actual substance of California law. And here, with respect to California law, gay and lesbian couples do have the legal rights and benefits of marriage, full equality and adoption, full access to assistive reproduction, and therefore, the argument about the State's interests that -- that Petitioners advance have to be tested against that reality, and -- and they just don't measure up.

And, of course, it's true that it does hurt their argument that they do quite a lot, but which are their good arguments, in your opinion? I mean, take a State that really does nothing whatsoever. They have no benefits, no nothing, no nothing. Okay? And moreover, if -- if you're right, even in California, if they have -- if they're right or -- you know, if a pact is enough, they won't get Federal benefits. Those that are tied to marriage because they're not married. So -- so a State that does nothing hurts them much more, and yet your brief seems to say it's more likely to be justified under the Constitution.

And I think -- I suppose the caution rationale that Mr. Cooper identified with respect to the effects on children, if it came up in a different case with a different record, after all here, this case was litigated by Petitioners on the theory that rational basis applied and they didn't need to show anything and so they didn't try to show anything. Our view is that heightened scrutiny should apply and so I don't want to -- I don't want to kid about this, we understand, that would be a very heavy burden for a State to meet. All we're suggesting is that in a situation in which the -- the State interests aren't cut out from under it, as they -- as they are here, that that issue ought to remain open for a future case.

But what is your response to the argument, which has already been mentioned about the need to be cautious in light of the newness of the -- the concept of -- of same-sex marriage? The one thing that the parties in this case seem to agree on is that marriage is very important. It's thought to be a fundamental building block of society and its preservation essential for the preservation of society. Traditional marriage has been around for thousands of years. Same-sex marriage is very new. I think it was first adopted in The Netherlands in 2000. So there isn't a lot of data about its effect. And it may turn out to be a -- a good thing. It may turn out not to be a good thing, as the supporters of Proposition 8 apparently believe. But you want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution, which is newer than cell phones or the Internet? I mean we -- we are not -- we do not have the ability to see the future. On a question like that, of such fundamental importance, why should it not be left for the people, either acting through initiatives and referendums or through their elected public officials?"

Those rights are on the books in California now and so the interest of California is -- that Petitioners are articulating, with respect to Proposition 8, has to be measured in that light."

  {

When that is true, then the Equal Protection Clause forbids the exclusion of same-sex marriage and it's an open question otherwise. And if I could just get to the third reason, which I do think is quite significant. The -- the argument here about caution is an argument that, well, we need to wait. We understand that. We take it seriously. But waiting is not a neutral act. Waiting imposes real costs in the here and now. It denies to the -- to the parents who want to marry the ability to marry, and it denies to the children, ironically, the very thing that Petitioners focus on is at the heart of the marriage relationship."

And the fourth point I would make, and I do think this is significant, is that the principal argument in 1967, with respect to Loving and that the Commonwealth of Virginia advanced was, well, the social science is still uncertain about how biracial children will fare in this world, and so you ought to apply rational basis scrutiny and wait. And I think the Court recognized that there is a cost to waiting and that that has got to be part of the equal protection calculus. And so -- so I do think that's quite fundamental."

  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "California -- there are 37,000 children in same-sex families in California now. Their parents cannot marry and that has effects on them in the here and now. A stabilizing effect is not there. When they go to school, they have to -- you know -- they don't have parents like everybody else's parents. That's a real effect, a real cost in the here and now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Well, the real cost right now would be you're asking me to write these words, \"a State that has a pact has to say 'marriage,'\" but I'm not telling you about States that don't. Well, I would guess there is a real-world effect there, too. That States that are considering pacts will all say, we won't do it, or not all, but some would. And that would have a real effect right now. And at the moment, I'm thinking it's much more harmful to the gay couple, the latter than the former. But you won't give me advice as the government as to how to deal with that."

Petitioners said at the podium today that there is no justification for that discrimination in any realm other than the one posed in this case and the -- and so when those two factors are present, those are paradigm considerations for the application of heightened scrutiny, and so I don't want to suggest that in States that haven't taken those steps --"

That in fact, at least in California -- and it's impossible to limit this ruling, Your Honor, even to California, even the Solicitor General's argument, he says, applies to at least eight States. It's impossible to limit these -- these propositions to any particular jurisdiction, so this Court would be making a very real decision with respect to same-sex marriage if it should simply decide to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, Justice Kennedy. And let's -- let's just step back and just consider for a moment the Solicitor General's argument. He is basically submitting to the Court that essentially the one compromise that is not available to the States is the one that the State of California has undertaken. That is, to go as far as the people possibly can in -- in honoring and recognizing the families and the relationships of same-sex couples, while still preserving the existence of traditional marriage as an institution.

That's what this question really boils down here, whether or not it can be said that for every legitimate purpose of marriage, are opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples indistinguishable? Indistinguishable. And with all due respect to counsel and to the Respondents, that is not a hard question. If, in fact, it is true, as the people of California believe that it still is true, that the natural procreative capacity of opposite-sex couples continues to pose vitally important benefits and risks to society and that's why marriage itself is the institution that society has always used to regulate those heterosexual, procreative -- procreative relationships. Counsel -- the Solicitor General has said that -- that the ban that the proposition erects in California is permanent. Well, it's -- certainly that is not the view of the Respondents and what we read every day. This is not an issue that is now at rest in the State of California, regardless -- well, unless this Court essentially puts it to rest. That democratic debate, which is roiling throughout this country, will definitely be coming back to California. It is an agonizingly difficult, for many people, political question. We would submit to you that that question is properly decided by the people themselves. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
