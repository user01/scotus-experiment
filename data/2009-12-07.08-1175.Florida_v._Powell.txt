1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:15 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next today in Case 08-1175, Florida v. Powell. 5 Mr. Jacquot. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH W. JACQUOT 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. JACQUOT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 As courts have recognized, Miranda warnings 11 protect Fifth Amendment rights and promote voluntary 12 confessions, confessions important to seeking truth, 13 solving crimes, and securing justice. Yet the Florida 14 Supreme Court erred in two ways to suppress a voluntary 15 confession relied upon for Kevin Powell's conviction. 16 First, the Florida court misapplied the 17 analysis. Rather than evaluating the warning under a 18 reasonably conveyed standard for the right to an 19 attorney, the court strictly parsed the warning, seeking 20 certain words in a certain order. 21 Second, the court incorrectly found the 22 warning to be misleading. The court ignored the 23 totality of the warning. The court overemphasized the 24 order in which the rights were given, and furthermore, 25 the court applied a hypertechnical analysis of the

1 warning's language. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you agree that it -3 suppose we accept your position and the case is 4 remanded. The Florida Supreme Court could say: Well, 5 that's very nice, but we have a Florida Constitution 6 with a counterpart to the Fifth Amendment, so we're just 7 going to have the same opinion, but we are putting it 8 under -- squarely under the Florida Constitution. 9 They could do that? 10 MR. JACQUOT: Your Honor, the Florida court 11 theoretically could, but the Florida court would have to 12 do that on State grounds, and in this case, they relied 13 on Federal grounds to reach this decision. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, that's what I meant. 15 They could do it on State grounds. 16 MR. JACQUOT: Theoretically. But this Court 17 found in Evans v. Arizona that just because of the 18 theoretical possibility that a court could write its 19 opinion differently on State grounds, this Court still 20 had jurisdiction because the original opinion rested on 21 Federal grounds. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are the Florida Supreme 23 Court elected? Are they elected judges? 24 MR. JACQUOT: Your Honor -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are they elected judges,
4 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the Florida Supreme Court? 2 MR. JACQUOT: Your Honor, the Florida 3 Supreme Court members are first appointed, and then they 4 are subsequently elected. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: How -- how long is their 6 term? There's a retention election when? 7 MR. JACQUOT: Correct. There is a retention 8 election every 4 years. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Every 4 years. And they'd 10 have to run for their retention election on the ticket 11 that "We've expanded Miranda for Florida purposes," 12 right? 13 MR. JACQUOT: Well, Your Honor, they are 14 elected. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Has the -- has the Florida 16 Supreme Court ever explicitly interpreted -- what is it? 17 Article I, section 8, of the Florida Constitution more 18 expansively than -- and explicitly so -- and explicitly 19 so, than Miranda? 20 MR. JACQUOT: No, Your Honor. The Florida 21 Supreme Court has said that the possibility is there, 22 but in its decisions it has found -- particularly in 23 the case before you -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they did it in this 25 case, didn't they? Under your view, they ­- their
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 ruling goes beyond Miranda, and they said that the 2 Florida Constitution requires this result. 3 MR. JACQUOT: No, Justice -4 JUSTICE STEVENS: So they did do it in this 5 very case. 6 MR. JACQUOT: No, Justice Stevens. The 7 court specifically relied on Federal law. It just got 8 it wrong. 9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it also cited the -10 the Florida Constitution, did it not? 11 MR. JACQUOT: It cited the Florida 12 Constitution -13 JUSTICE STEVENS: And did it not also say 14 that this was a violation of the Federal -- I mean, of 15 the Florida Constitution? 16 MR. JACQUOT: Yes, Your Honor, it mentioned 17 the Florida Constitution. However, in those same 18 sentences, it interwove Federal law. It would say: 19 Under the Florida Constitution and according to Miranda. 20 And this Court in Michigan v. Long has found that 21 opinions that interweave State and Federal law are 22 appropriate for this Court's jurisdiction. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One of your amici -- one 24 of the amici suggested that the Florida courts cannot 25 read the Florida Constitution more expansively than the
6 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Federal requirements. Are you rejecting that 2 proposition? 3 MR. JACQUOT: We do indeed, Your Honor. The 4 Florida court in Powell read the warning to -- in line 5 with Miranda. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And it's a different 7 question. One of the amici suggests that the Florida 8 Constitution and Florida case law says that they can't 9 read the Florida Constitution more broadly than it is 10 read under Federal law. 11 MR. JACQUOT: Well, Your Honor, the past 12 cases have said that the Florida court could, but they 13 haven't. And in this case they particularly did not. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So this could be a 15 first, if we were to start from the proposition that 16 Justice Ginsburg did? 17 MR. JACQUOT: Well, Your Honor, under 18 Michigan v. Long the test is to look at the clear face 19 of the opinion, to look for a plain statement that this 20 case relied on adequate -- adequate and independent 21 State grounds, and that is not there. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do -- do you see a 23 conflict between the language of our decisions where we 24 often say that Miranda rights have to be clear and those 25 decisions that say that whatever is said has to
7 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 reasonably convey the essence of the Miranda warnings? 2 Is there a difference between those two 3 statements, and which of our cases or statements would 4 control? 5 MR. JACQUOT: Your Honor, in Miranda the 6 Court did use the terms "clearly inform." However, this 7 Court has gone on in Prysock to use the term "adequately 8 inform" and Duckworth uses the word "reasonably convey." 9 So, yes, although the rights are consistent from Miranda 10 on -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you would suggest 12 that if something is not clear and it's ambiguous, that 13 that's enough? Or -- or is there a difference between 14 reasonable and clarity? That has to be read in a 15 certain way; otherwise an ambiguous warning -16 MR. JACQUOT: No, Your Honor, I would say 17 that this Court has said that clarity is judged by 18 whether the warnings reasonably convey the rights under 19 Miranda; that's the standard. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Miranda itself -- I 21 mean, it set out the four requirements, but there was a 22 charge -- I mean there was a warning involved, am I not 23 right? Well, didn't they cite the then-FBI warning? It 24 has been improved considerably, but there was an FBI 25 warning cited in Miranda itself, was there not?

1 MR. JACQUOT: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and 2 that warning conveyed only the right to attorney. It 3 did not have the specific -4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It also said you have a 5 right to keep silent. 6 MR. JACQUOT: Correct. But on the right to 7 attorney warning at issue here, it said only that the 8 suspect has the ability to consult counsel. It did not 9 go into the specific -- detail, the explicit nature of 10 spelling out the terms "present" and the terms "during" 11 that the Florida Supreme Court required. And that's the 12 real issue here before the Court, is whether the Florida 13 Supreme Court applied a standard that is significantly 14 different than the standard that this Court has 15 required. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: It told them: You are 17 entitled to confer with counsel before answering 18 questions, right? 19 MR. JACQUOT: What warning, Justice Scalia? 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't that -- wasn't that 21 the warning given -- given in this case? You are 22 entitled to consult counsel before answering questions? 23 MR. JACQUOT: Yes, the warning in this case 24 said you have the right to talk to a lawyer before 25 answering any of our questions. And, furthermore --
9 Alderson Reporting Company

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, "any" ­- just 2 to make sure; you've said two different things. It says 3 "any of our questions," right? 4 MR. JACQUOT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the 5 warning said, "You have the right to talk to a lawyer 6 before answering any of our questions." And then the 7 warning went on to say, "You have the right to use this 8 right at any time during this interview." 9 We would argue that this expresses all the 10 rights required under Miranda. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: What about the right in 12 Miranda that says -- in Miranda -- "We hold an 13 individual held for interrogation must be clearly 14 informed that he has the right to consult with the 15 lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during 16 interrogation." Okay? 17 Where does it say that? Interpret it any 18 way you want. You know, we are used to grand juries. 19 In a grand jury, he can go consult with a lawyer, but he 20 doesn't have the lawyer with him. So, where does it 21 tell him that? 22 MR. JACQUOT: Well, Your Honor, the standard 23 being "reasonably convey" -24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 25 MR. JACQUOT: -- the warning lays out that
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you have the right -2 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just asking you to 3 point to the words that tell him that. 4 MR. JACQUOT: The right to talk to a lawyer. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Don't have you a right to 6 talk to a lawyer at a grand jury? 7 MR. JACQUOT: Yes, but a -- Your Honor, a 8 grand jury operates very differently than a criminal 9 interrogation. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, correct. And so 11 aren't you supposed to tell this person, that unlike a 12 grand jury, you have a right to have the lawyer with you 13 during interrogation? I mean, it isn't as if that was 14 said in passing in Miranda. They wrote eight paragraphs 15 about it. And I just wonder, where does it say in this 16 warning you have the right to have the lawyer with you 17 during the interrogation? 18 MR. JACQUOT: Well, Justice Breyer, I would 19 have three responses to that. First, under Miranda the 20 FBI warning did not use the terms "present," did not use 21 the terms "with you," and -22 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't use the word 23 "present," Miranda? It says right here: "We hold" -24 it says -- "not just prior to questioning, but also to 25 have counsel present during any questioning." That's
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 what Miranda says. And then Miranda, after discussing 2 it for five pages, goes on to use the words I just said. 3 You have to tell him he has the right to have counsel 4 with him. So it does use the word "present." 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It -- it used it in 6 determining -- in -- in stating the obligation of the 7 State, but it didn't use those words in setting out the 8 warning that the FBI then gave. 9 MR. JACQUOT: Correct. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It said, this is what -11 States, this is what your obligation is, what you must 12 say to the defendant is. And I think the Florida court 13 is the same way. It said: You are entitled to the help 14 of a lawyer. Then it spells it out in that opinion, but 15 -- but what it said had to be communicated was not the 16 -- the full range. Just you're entitled, I think it 17 was, to the help of a lawyer. 18 So there's -- there's a confusion, I 19 think, between what Miranda spells out and many other 20 cases spell out as the State's obligation, what the 21 State must do, and the statement that must be made to 22 the defendant to communicate that. 23 MR. JACQUOT: Justice Ginsburg, let me be 24 very clear and answer Justice Breyer with the three 25 points I began. Miranda requires that law enforcement
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 effectively communicate the fact that you can access 2 your right to an attorney present and during an 3 interrogation. However, in the Miranda opinion they 4 approvingly cited the FBI warning that only had the 5 terms -- the generalized warning: Consult with counsel. 6 Furthermore, the ability to talk to your 7 lawyer, which is at issue in this warning, is the first 8 natural step to getting your attorney. 9 And, third, as this Court has held in 10 Minnick, that it's the representation that matters in 11 custodial interrogations -12 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what FBI are we 13 talking about? Because the FBI advice of rights says: 14 "You have the right to have a lawyer with you during 15 questioning." Were they -- and -- and I was taken by 16 the fact, "We hold that an individual must be clearly 17 informed." 18 And so, is there some other case that 19 says -- or some other FBI statement that they give 20 people that doesn't use the words "with you," that says 21 you don't have to say "with you during," or doesn't have 22 to say "present during"? Was there some other case that 23 said that? 24 MR. JACQUOT: Your Honor, the current FBI 25 warning does have that. However, there have been
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 several cases in the circuits that have held generalized 2 warnings to be sufficient, warnings that say only the 3 right to an attorney. And one of the issues -4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the warning that 5 Justice Breyer has just referred to -- that's long after 6 Miranda itself, and it was not the warning that the FBI 7 gave at the time of Miranda. 8 MR. JACQUOT: Correct, Your Honor. And -9 and that is the issue, is what is, first, the standard 10 that courts must currently apply in terms of whether a 11 warning reasonably conveys. That is not the standard of 12 analysis that the Florida court applied. 13 And secondly, when evaluating that warning, 14 the -- the Florida court incorrectly finds that this 15 warning was misleading. Now -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a difficulty in 17 terms of this argument about burdening law enforcement. 18 This is a preprinted form that the police made up, 19 correct? 20 MR. JACQUOT: Correct. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the added 22 burden by making the form absolutely and abundantly 23 clear or conforming the form to the statements in 24 Miranda? What's the cost to the State? They're going 25 to print the form anyway. They are telling their
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 officers to read from the form anyway. What's the added 2 cost? 3 MR. JACQUOT: Your Honor, there are three 4 reasons why the Florida Supreme Court's explicit 5 standard is problematic. First, the same standard 6 applies to written warnings as to verbal warnings. So 7 you've had situations where you have a law enforcement 8 officer who doesn't have his card in the field; there's 9 a verbal error; there's an inconsistency in 10 translations. If a suspect is asking questions trying 11 to get clarity, the law enforcement officer is going 12 outside of the card to provide that clarity. Those are 13 situations that may not meet the explicit express advice 14 standard of the Court. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there is a 16 question about how much the subjective intent of the 17 questioner should be involved in this process or not. 18 There are cases where it appears the plurality of 19 our Court has said it should always be an objective 20 standard, and others where certain members have 21 expressed a question about subjective. 22 But if we are dealing with a printed form, 23 why wouldn't the intent of the entity at issue be placed 24 in question? Meaning, you could have -- the police here 25 could have chosen to be explicit, but instead they chose
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to be -- to obfuscate a little bit and be less explicit. 2 Shouldn't we assume that that's an intent to deceive or 3 perhaps to confuse? 4 MR. JACQUOT: Absolutely not, Your Honor. 5 The Tampa Police, in having this warning drafted, is 6 attempting to reasonably convey the warning, and there 7 is good public policy reasons why. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why? The -- the 9 easy solution is to do what 90 percent of the 10 jurisdictions are doing: Copy Miranda. 11 MR. JACQUOT: Well, Your Honor, we would 12 claim that this warning falls within the 97 percent 13 cited by amici because it has the word "during" in the 14 warning. The Florida court ignored the totality of the 15 warning. It chose to place the order of the warning's 16 rights in a way that this Court in Prysock and Duckworth 17 has found is not the proper analysis. 18 Furthermore, this court used a 19 hypertechnical approach. It took the words "before 20 answering any of our questions," turned that into an 21 exclusive statement to say, "only before questioning" 22 and then, as a result of that, attempted to discount the 23 last sentence of the warning. That's the kind of 24 parsing, that's the kind of precise formulation, that's 25 the kind of construing warnings like a will or defining
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 terms like an easement that this Court has rejected. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the danger 3 that Tampa, if you should prevail, will go back to the 4 old way? Now, it has a clearer form -- whether this 5 form was adequate is one thing. But now, it has the 6 form that the -- like the one the FBI currently uses. 7 If you prevail, then Tampa can go back to what it had 8 before? 9 MR. JACQUOT: Your Honor, you are correct, 10 in that Tampa has a new form now that does have the 11 words "present" and "during" in a different formulation. 12 However, there's no indication that they 13 would go back to the other form, for several reasons. 14 One, law enforcement has an incentive to have Miranda 15 rights properly given because they desire there to be 16 confessions and for those confessions to be admissible. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, once we say this is 18 properly given, my goodness, here's -- here's an 19 instruction approved specifically by this Court. I 20 mean, I think they should use that, don't you? 21 I mean, the other one they are going to have 22 to guess about, but this one is approved in a case 23 involving Florida by this Court. So you -- it's pretty 24 attractive to use that one. 25 MR. JACQUOT: Well, Your Honor, law
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 enforcement agencies will look to courts for approval of 2 this -- of their warnings. The warning at issue in 3 Powell -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have to say it's 5 okay. You are arguing that it's perfectly okay, so why 6 do you hesitate when you are asked, you know, could the 7 State go back to doing it? You should say, yes, of 8 course, they -- they might; we don't think it's likely, 9 but they might, and if they did, it's perfectly okay. 10 Isn't that your position? 11 MR. JACQUOT: Well, Justice Scalia, as a -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not your position? 13 MR. JACQUOT: Justice Scalia, they 14 theoretically could, because the warning was reasonably 15 conveyed. It was sufficient. However, it's unlikely 16 they would. Law enforcement agencies modify their 17 warnings when they become issue. So when a litigation 18 begins on a warning, they often modify it at that point. 19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me -- let me ask you 20 one question. Isn't it the case that this particular 21 warning is used in one judicial district, and the 22 warning that was approved in Traylor was used in the 23 rest of the State? And so there is an interest -- the 24 Florida 25 Supreme Court has, in effect, required the same warning
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 throughout the State. And if you prevail, there may be 2 one standard warning in one judicial district, and the 3 other districts may continue to use the one they have 4 used in the past. Isn't that right? 5 MR. JACQUOT: Well, Justice Stevens, it is 6 not true that every jurisdiction in Florida uses this 7 same warning. There are varieties of warnings. 8 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's true, but if you -9 if they all followed the Florida Supreme Court in this 10 case, then they all would use the same warning? 11 MR. JACQUOT: Well, Justice Stevens, if they 12 were all following the Florida Supreme Court here, they 13 would have to explicitly state certain terms in their 14 warning. 15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which most of them do 16 already. 17 MR. JACQUOT: Well, not necessarily. In -18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Not all, but some. 19 MR. JACQUOT: Some -- some do, some do not, 20 and one of the fears in having an express advice 21 standard is that you will have continuing terms that are 22 required. For instance, the term "before" is lacking in 23 30 of 90 jurisdictions in Florida. 24 There is nothing to stop the Florida Supreme 25 Court, if this Court was to allow an express advice
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Standard, from then requiring the term "before 2 questioning" in addition. That's the kind of danger in 3 having an analysis that is much stricter, that 4 essentially looks at words that should be in a warning, 5 rather than looking at whether the right to attorney is 6 reasonably conveyed to the suspect. 7 Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no more 8 questions, I'd like to save the balance of my time. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 10 Mr. O'Neil. 11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID O'NEIL 12 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 13 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 14 MR. O'NEIL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 15 and may it please the Court: 16 I'd like to go directly to Justice 17 Ginsburg's question about what would happen if this 18 Court affirmed the warnings in this case, and I think 19 Respondent's amici make the argument that it will 20 somehow promote a race to the bottom. 21 And I think that history and experience are 22 the best answer to that question. Respondent's amici, 23 who have carefully studied this issue, have found that 24 some police officers have attempted to evade Miranda by 25 interrogation techniques, but there is no indication
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that police have tried to accomplish that purpose by 2 changing the language of the warnings, and that is not 3 because they couldn't do so. For the last 20 years, 4 Duckworth and Prysock have been on the books, and have 5 made clear that no standard formulation of the warnings 6 is necessary and that variant warnings will be upheld. 7 And if it were true -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that Justice 9 Scalia just pointed out, if we approve the language of 10 this, then -- of this particular warning, it becomes the 11 new sort of floor. 12 And if we make it the new floor, it -13 doesn't it provide an incentive for police departments 14 to move away from the explicit warnings that say "during 15 and" -- "before and during" interrogations; now we're 16 saying -- you know, generalize them more. 17 MR. O'NEIL: Well, Justice -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Aren't we encouraging 19 that? 20 MR. O'NEIL: Justice Sotomayor, I have two 21 responses to that: The first is that this Court upheld 22 the warning in Duckworth, which said, we have no way of 23 providing you an attorney, but one will be provided if 24 and when you go to court. 25 Now, if you -- if it were true that police
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 were looking for every way to get around the warnings 2 and if changing the warnings were an effective way to do 3 that, we should have seen every jurisdiction adopt those 4 warnings. 5 In fact, of the 900 warnings that are 6 included in the survey that Respondent relies heavily 7 on, only 5 have that formulation. Second, four 8 circuit courts have held -9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many after 10 Duckworth? Do you know? 11 MR. O'NEIL: I don't -- it doesn't indicate 12 when they were adopted, but I think it's fair to say 13 that, if police did have that incentive, that we would 14 have seen at least some jurisdictions adopt that 15 warning. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So we don't know how 17 many -18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your case has to be 19 that, if we adopt the Petitioner's petition, it's 20 perfectly fine for every jurisdiction in the country to 21 use this warning, right? 22 MR. O'NEIL: We agree that this warning is 23 adequate, and our position is -24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And every jurisdiction in 25 the country can use it, so we can -- we can talk about
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 whether or not it's adequate. 2 MR. O'NEIL: They can, and we think that's 3 unlikely, and if the concern here is that it will 4 destroy the uniformity that the Federal government 5 thinks is a good thing as a matter of policy, we think 6 that that concern is simply not warranted. But, yes, we 7 do agree that these warnings adequately convey the 8 substance -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me. You think lack 10 of uniformity is a good idea? 11 MR. O'NEIL: No, we think that affirming 12 these warnings will not disrupt the uniformity that 13 seems to be in place around the country, and -- for 14 exactly the reason that I said, Justice Kennedy, because 15 Justice Sotomayor mentioned general right to counsel 16 warnings, that if we upheld a general right to counsel 17 warning, that jurisdictions would begin to drop the more 18 specific language that's contained, for example, in the 19 FBI form. Well -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where is 21 that? Is that set forth in the -- in the briefs? The 22 FBI form? Where -- where is that set forth? 23 MR. O'NEIL: I don't believe the FBI form is 24 set out in full. It's on pages 383 and 384 of Miranda, 25 and the description of the court's discussion is on page
23 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 29 of our brief. 2 And I think, Justice Sotomayor, it's 3 significant that four circuit courts have upheld general 4 right to counsel warnings of the kind that were in the 5 FBI warnings in 1966. But the police departments in 6 those jurisdictions have not abandoned the more specific 7 language that is contained in the FBI formulation. In 8 New York City, the Second Circuit has held in Lamia -9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- how do we deal 10 with the fact that, if the purpose of Miranda is to give 11 clear warnings, and your adversary says -- not your 12 adversary -- your co-counsel -- Petitioner's counsel 13 says that means -- "clear" means does it reasonably 14 convey? 15 We've got a split of circuit courts and 16 State courts on whether this reasonably conveys or not. 17 Shouldn't that be enough of an ambiguity for us to 18 conclude it can't reasonably convey, if there's this 19 many courts holding that it doesn't? 20 MR. O'NEIL: No, Justice Sotomayor. This is 21 not like a qualified immunity inquiry, where grounds for 22 debate among reasonable jurists would invalidate the 23 warning. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you calling the 25 Florida State Supreme Court majority unreasonable

1 jurists? 2 MR. O'NEIL: No, I think -- I think the 3 problem with a standard that permits of no ambiguity is 4 that, as Florida just said, this standard will apply, 5 not just to printed forms -- and it is easy enough to 6 create a printed form in advance that includes more 7 specific language -- but it will also apply to 8 inadvertent departures from the standard forms as a 9 result of mistake. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens now is that 11 we are dealing with the exception rather than the rule, 12 and -- but this was the rule, meaning this was the form 13 that they were reading. And if it has some significant 14 ambiguity in it, sufficient for at least one court to 15 say it wasn't sufficiently clear, it wasn't explicit 16 enough, should we worry about the exception as an 17 exception? 18 MR. O'NEIL: Well, I think -- I think the 19 exception is -- needs to be captured within the rule 20 that this Court adopts as -- as the standard. 21 I -- I also think that it -- it is -- it's 22 simply not the case that if this Court, as I said, 23 adopts a standard that permits a less explicit, less 24 precise warning than the FBI wants -25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. O'Neil, isn't one of

I mean, each 7 jurisdiction used its own form, and this was the form 8 that was in place -9 JUSTICE STEVENS: So at least two of them? 10 MR. O'NEIL: Well, every jurisdiction 11 adopts a slightly-12 JUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't it -- isn't it 13 wiser generally to have the same form used throughout 14 the State? 15 MR. O'NEIL: It is. The government believes 16 it is wiser to do that, and the Federal law enforcement 17 agencies do that because it avoids -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the Constitution 19 requires it, right? 20 MR. O'NEIL: Well, no, the Constitution does 21 not require the precise words of Miranda. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Miranda supposedly 23 says the Constitution requires this warning, and if the 24 warning must be in a standard form that everybody uses, 25 the Constitution must require a standard form that

1 everybody uses. 2 MR. O'NEIL: Nowhere in Miranda does it say 3 that a -- a standard form is necessary, and this Court 4 summarily rejected exactly that argument. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Excuse me. Can you just 6 devote one minute before you finish ­7 MR. O'NEIL: Yes. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: -- to the question of why 9 these are adequate? If you remember my question, I 10 tried to explain why I thought they might not be 11 adequate. 12 MR. O'NEIL: Justice Breyer, these warnings 13 state three rights: The right -14 JUSTICE BREYER: But there were four. 15 One is to have during, in the presence of, the right to 16 have a lawyer during the interrogation, in the presence 17 of, with him at the time. 18 MR. O'NEIL: Absolutely. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's one of 20 the four. That's one of the things they devote two 21 pages to Miranda, and they repeat it when they summarize 22 what you have to say. I just want to know where in this 23 statement does it say that? 24 MR. O'NEIL: Justice Breyer, there is no 25 reason to think that a suspect who hears that he can

Official
1 talk to an attorney before answering any questions and 2 during this interview would infer the unstated 3 restriction that he can talk to an attorney but only by 4 phone or only remotely -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Really? I guess anybody 6 who has had prior experience with the law, as this man 7 might have done, might be familiar with a grand jury 8 proceeding. 9 MR. O'NEIL: But for the same reason we 10 don't ask whether the suspect has sufficient knowledge 11 to supplement the information he needs. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. But I tell 13 you: Here's your right to talk to a lawyer before 14 questioning. 15 MR. O'NEIL: Well, it -16 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you then repeat, you 17 can assert that right whenever you want, to talk to him 18 before questioning. 19 MR. O'NEIL: Well -20 JUSTICE BREYER: And my question is, how 21 does that tell him he has a right to have a lawyer with 22 him during questioning, that the questioning he has a 23 right to have take place from beginning to end in the 24 presence of a lawyer, a matter that the Miranda Court 25 repeated three times in the summary and wrote eight

1 full paragraphs about why that was important? 2 MR. O'NEIL: Well, first, as Justice 3 Ginsburg noted, Miranda went out of its way to -- to 4 specifically approve an FBI warning that said, quote -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say it 6 approves that? 7 MR. O'NEIL: It said this pattern of 8 warnings is consistent with the decision that we 9 announced today. And I think -10 JUSTICE BREYER: It wasn't though, actually. 11 MR. O'NEIL: -- it couldn't have been 12 clearer. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: It isn't -- it isn't 14 consistent with it. That's interesting. 15 MR. O'NEIL: Well, that argument was made by 16 Justice Clark in dissent, and the Court did not agree 17 with that. And I think it is clear that the Court 18 thought that -19 JUSTICE BREYER: They didn't say anything 20 about during. 21 MR. O'NEIL: Well, no, they didn't. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: So anyway -- then they 23 don't need to mention "during" at all because if that's 24 right, the FBI warning at that time, J. Edgar Hoover's 25 letter or whatever it was, just talked about telling
29 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you, you have a right to counsel. It doesn't say 2 anything about "during." 3 MR. O'NEIL: Well, I think that's exactly 4 the point, that you don't assume that a suspect is only 5 capable of understanding -6 JUSTICE BREYER: So then you think that, in 7 fact, going by that warning, that there is no 8 constitutional right to have them say a word about 9 during. This would be okay if they said nothing at all 10 about it. 11 MR. O'NEIL: I think a -- a -- advice of the 12 right to counsel or, as the Court put it in a different 13 place in the Miranda opinion, the right to obtain the 14 services of an attorney of his choice, that would be 15 constitutionally adequate. The Federal Government does 16 not use those warnings because they create a list -- a 17 risk of litigation. 18 We think that's the correct reading of 19 Miranda, but that, of course, is not guarantee that 20 other courts would read it that way. And, indeed, 2 21 years after Miranda, the Fifth Circuit had gone the 22 other way and decided that, in fact, a right to counsel 23 warning is not sufficient. 24 But, Justice Breyer, I think that the answer 25 to how these warnings convey presence is that a suspect

1 is not going to draw the highly counterintuitive 2 assumption that if he is told that he can have an 3 attorney not only before answering any questions but 4 during this interview, that he is going to need to walk 5 in and out of the room each time he wants to talk to an 6 attorney. It may -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so I get the 8 bottom line -- if all this warning had said was, you 9 have a right to a lawyer before questioning -10 MR.

O'NEIL: We think that -- that -- that 17 was the warning that this Court confronted in Bridgers, 18 and we think that would be a much closer and more 19 difficult case, but we think that, yes, we -- we agree 20 with the decision cited in our brief that a suspect 21 would not assume that that attorney will become 22 unavailable the minute the first question is asked.

And the very beginning of 11 that sentence, right before they said it, was they -12 that the FBI has compiled -13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What page are you on now? 14 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: We are still on 483. We 15 are in the sentence right above it. Over the years the 16 FBI has compiled an exemplary record of effective law 17 enforcement while advising any suspect or arrested 18 person at the outset of the interview that he is not 19 required to make a statement -- and then I just read it. 20 So, the -- that was to counteract whether it 21 was too burdensome. Not that they were approving -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe, but it 23 says -- it says the -- what the FBI -- the pattern 24 of warning -- well, let me make sure I get it exact. 25 "The present pattern of warnings and respect for the
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 rights of the individual followed as a practice by the 2 FBI is consistent with the procedure we delineate 3 today." 4 And the FBI warning says nothing about 5 presence or with -- or with counsel with him. 6 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Consistent with but not 7 identical. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, okay. I'll 9 take "consistent with." That means that it complies 10 with the rule in Miranda. 11 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: No, I -- in all due 12 respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that this Court 13 went a little further and required the presence of 14 counsel. And then -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then how is the FBI 16 warning consistent with the procedure the Court 17 delineated in Miranda? 18 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: It doesn't say that 19 the -- the attorney has to be present with -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I said how is 21 it -22 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: How is it consistent? 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 24 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: It -- because it -- it 25 gave three of the basic -- you know, you have the right

1 to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney, the 2 services of an attorney; and that you have the right 3 to -- or any -- any statement you make will be used 4 against you. So they just didn't go far enough in the 5 FBI warnings. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I would say that 7 it's not consistent with Miranda. 8 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: It's -- it's consistent 9 to a point, but it -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 11 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: And just as if -- and -12 and they have added in, more recently, the right to free 13 counsel. 14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, while you're 15 looking at whether it would be an undue burden on law 16 enforcement, it was -- it has a burden that's consistent 17 with the ones that Miranda required expressly. 18 MS.

The -19 JUSTICE STEVENS: I say when you were 20 inquiring, as you were at that part of the opinion, into 21 how burdensome it would be on law enforcement to give 22 these warnings -23 MS.

Official
1 those previously given by the FBI. 2 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Correct. It's -- it's 3 not any more burdensome by adding in the -- an 4 additional requirement. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What it says is that 6 the respect for the rights of the individual followed 7 in the FBI is consistent with. 8 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Uh-huh. The rights of 9 the individual, right. 10 And the -- the Miranda Court just made sure 11 that they've added in the additional requirement, and 12 the FBI did change their warnings, and has continued to 13 modify and change their warnings to be consistent with 14 Miranda. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The bottom line in my 16 mind -- the question is, whether these warnings are 17 substantively or otherwise different than the FBI 18 warnings that some believe were approved in Miranda. 19 Are these equivalent? 20 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: I don't -- I believe 21 that -- that requiring the presence of counsel during 22 the interrogation goes a little bit -- a lot further. 23 And it -- it is not equivalent to the FBI. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree with 25 you, but that wasn't my question. My question was, did

And that 9 why -- and that's why I don't believe the Court in 10 Miranda ever said we -- it's consistent with, but they 11 never said, we approve. They never said, we are 12 adopting that language. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is there since 14 then -- I mean, as I read it now I see that, as I said, 15 it seems very clear that they intend you to have to say 16 that the counsel has to be -- is present with you. 17 Present, okay? Now the FBI warnings, which they did say 18 is consistent, don't say that. 19 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: No, they don't. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: They don't. 21 MS.

You 18 want us to believe that your client, who decided to 19 talk, even though he was told he could consult an 20 attorney before any question was asked, and he could 21 consult an attorney at any time during the interview, 22 and he went ahead and -- and confessed -- you are 23 saying, oh, if he had only known.

Powell's lawyer 12 questioned him and asked him: "You waived the right to 13 have an attorney present during your questioning by the 14 detectives?" 15 Answer: "Yes." 16 This is at appendix page 80. So, 17 apparently, counsel understood the warning to have 18 conveyed the right to have an attorney present during 19 questioning by the -- by the detectives. Counsel 20 understood that? 21 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: No, counsel -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did she ever -23 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: -- never -- never asked 24 him did you knowingly waive; did you intelligently 25 waive? She was trying to set up the fact that the

1 client had waived his rights before he made a statement 2 in order to get to his -- his argument that his 3 statements were coerced. 4 But she was never giving up the argument 5 that she had made previously to that -- that testimony 6 that -- that the waiver was knowing and intelligent. 7 She just had already lost that argument in front of the 8 judge, and now she was addressing the jury. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was she asking her client 10 a legal question? You waived the right to have an 11 attorney present during your questioning by detectives, 12 is that what you are telling the jury? 13 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Yes. Well, he did waive 14 his rights, but he didn't knowingly and intelligently 15 waive his rights, and he did sign the form. Because 16 that was the next question: Did you sign the form? 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that the 18 average person hearing this warning would envision the 19 sort of procedure that occurs before a grand jury? 20 MS.

BRUECKHEIMER: And a right -- but they 14 never told him that he'd have the ability to talk to a 15 lawyer during the interrogation. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there -- is there 17 any -- I'm not sure this is pertinent -- but is there 18 any malevolent reason Tampa police would adopt this 19 warning? I mean, someone says, well, here's what the 20 FBI uses. And they say, well, I tell you what, if we 21 just say you have a right to an attorney before 22 answering any questions and then later say you can 23 exercise this right any time, maybe we'll be able to 24 trick some people who don't think they can actually have 25 the lawyer there. In other words was this just --

1 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: It's -- it's hard for us 2 to be able to delve into the minds of the Tampa Police 3 Department and the people who create these forms. 4 However, in the Thompson case, which is before you in 5 the briefs, in 1984, they had it right. They said you 6 have the right to talk to an attorney beforehand and to 7 the presence of an attorney during interrogation. This 8 was in a death case, and there was something wrong with 9 the right to free counsel. They either didn't give it 10 to them or not. 11 So why they went and changed the part to the 12 right to an attorney before -- before the questioning, 13 and then during questioning, we don't know. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- and you can't 15 think of any bad reason they might have done it. 16 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Well, Professor Leo 17 could, and there is a memo he attaches at the end of his 18 appendix in the amicus brief, but I -- I would just say 19 that it doesn't really matter what the motives are, and 20 that it all depends on how the defendant or the person 21 in custody is -- is perceiving these warnings and 22 whether he's getting the information he or she needs to 23 be -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the 25 -- the Court's decisions in Prysock and Duckworth that

It said 4 something about a court would give you -5 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Right. The -- the 6 language in those cases had something to do with -- you 7 know, the idea being that, it was almost 8 informational -- too much information, additional 9 information as to when you're going to get your 10 counsel. But the four core -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You wouldn't have to have 12 any additional information; you just tell them, you have 13 a right to have a -- have counsel now. That would be 14 fewer words. 15 MS.

BRUECKHEIMER: Was not in court? 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. That the court will 24 appoint counsel for you. 25 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Right. And that would be

1 sometime in the future. But -- but they did -- but they 2 did tell them that if you're going -- if you're going to 3 be questioned, you have the right to counsel with you at 4 that time. And that was the important thing. Even if 5 we had to wait, they couldn't question him until he had 6 his attorney with him. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: If this warning is read the 8 way we might -- lawyers might read a statute or a 9 contract or something like that, then I don't know why 10 saying, "You have the right to remain silent," isn't 11 potentially misleading. It says you have the right to 12 remain silent. But once you break your silence, there 13 is nothing in there that says you have the right to 14 resume your silence. 15 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: No. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you agree with that? 17 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Except for that -- that 18 catch-all phrase that they used at the bottom, which is 19 you have the right to use any of these at any time. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that is 21 defective, too? 22 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Well, I think that it -23 it's probably okay as far as reinforcing the right to 24 remain silent and informing him that any of your answers 25 can be used against you, but I don't think it salvages a

1 right that's not there, which is the right to presence 2 during interrogation. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: So once you break your -4 you have the right to remain silent, but once you break 5 that right, the fact that you have that right to use 6 that right to remain silent in the future doesn't mean 7 you can stop answering questions. 8 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Well, the -- the 9 catch-all phrase might inform them that they could stop, 10 but, clearly, if they had the right to presence of 11 counsel with them, that might -12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We could write that down. 13 It could be the next case. 14 (Laughter.) 15 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Right. And I do -- I 16 also contest the language that the opposing counsel uses 17 that says that we have somehow locked in everybody with 18 -- with what the -- what the decision below said. 19 The decision below held that, and I quote at 20 541, "We hold that Powell should have been clearly 21 informed of his right to the presence of counsel during 22 the custodial interrogation." It's not magic language. 23 It's not so -- so written in stone that -- it's not 24 explicit language. 25 There's -- there's -- this language follows
46 Alderson Reporting Company

1 what this -- this Court has said. The reasonable 2 language, the clearly informed language. It isn't 3 locking everyone into these exact words down the line. 4 And there are hundreds of ways that this could be said. 5 So -- and then the court noted that the catch-all phrase 6 did not effectively convey to Mr. Powell his rights to 7 presence before and during and that the last sentence 8 could not effectively convey a right that he was never 9 told he had. 10 As far as whether or not this case should 11 even be here, even though the Florida Constitution and 12 the Florida court has gone along the same road, traveled 13 a parallel road with this Court, and it hasn't seen a 14 need to deviate, they -- they may see a need to deviate 15 here, should this Court disagree with what -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they are -- they 17 are free to do that. I mean, politically, they might 18 consider it risky, but if we say that the charge was 19 good enough, the Florida court could say, but it's not 20 good enough under our Constitution. 21 MS.

BRUECKHEIMER: Right, but -- you know -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's not at all clear 23 that the Washington -- that the Florida Supreme Court 24 could in this case go back to the Constitution. That's 25 -- you can't get that out of Long.

1 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: You can't go lower than 2 the Federal Constitution, but they can give more rights. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's -- maybe in some 4 other case. Not necessarily in this one, because Long 5 leads to -- to the contrary. 6 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Well, in -- in Traylor, 7 which is the court that -- it's the case that the -- the 8 Florida Supreme Court and the decision below relied 9 heavily upon, they said that we are the ceiling and the 10 court is the bottom, and -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have no case in 12 which the Florida Supreme Court has explicitly said that 13 we have a warning that is more strict, more rigorous 14 than what Miranda requires? You have no case? 15 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: No, and they -- they 16 didn't feel like they had to -- to deviate, because they 17 felt like their definition of presence of counsel, which 18 was the right to consult with an attorney before and the 19 right to have counsel present during the interrogation, 20 was consistent with the holdings in Miranda. So they 21 didn't feel the need to deviate. 22 But they did say that that is our definition 23 as we set forth in -- in Traylor, and that is -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm curious: When this 25 goes back to them, do you think they can deviate? They

1 were answering a certified question, which was simply 2 whether this -- this warning complied with Miranda. 3 That was the only certified question. 4 So when it goes back, I assume they, having 5 said no, will now have to say yes. Can they go on and 6 say: Oh, and by the way, even though it doesn't violate 7 Miranda, we think it violates the State Constitution? 8 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: I believe they can, 9 because as long as they are not going below what this 10 Court mandates -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that -12 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: -- if they provide more 13 protections. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that wasn't the 15 question asked of them. The only question asked of them 16 was whether it complied with Miranda. 17 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Right. And they -18 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's really not -19 that's really not quite accurate, because they used the 20 term "Miranda warnings" generically -21 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Generically, and -22 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- as opposed to a 23 category of warnings which are required by both the 24 Federal Constitution and the State constitution, and 25 they said it violated the State constitution.

1 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Yes, they did. And they 2 did -- they did say we have our standard under Traylor, 3 that we defined the right to the presence of counsel or 4 to the help of counsel as requiring presence during, as 5 -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except the words 7 that it quoted from the lower court opinion -- that is, 8 we are talking about the -- the Fifth Amendment, and by 9 extension, Article I, section 9. 10 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Right. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that seems to me to 12 indicate that it's incorporating, not going further. 13 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Well, if -- if -14 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not in the question 15 they -- they took. 16 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: No. No, that's not in 17 the question. 18 But there is a way to -- you know, they 19 repeated all along the way, Article I, section 9. They 20 kept repeating it. They didn't have to. If they were 21 just going to say, oh, by the way, our Constitution 22 goes along with this, they could have said it in 23 passing. They could have also said that we -- we 24 choose not to interpret this other right. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think the opposite. I

1 think the repeated linkage shows that they think they 2 are the same. 3 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Well -- and, again, I 4 would say that they -- they agree that we are traveling 5 along the same road, but they have -- they have -- they 6 are stressing the fact that they have set a line in the 7 sand as far as what they're interpreting the right to 8 presence -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the question asked: 11 Does the failure to provide express advice of the right 12 to the presence of counsel during questioning vitiate 13 Miranda warnings? 14 Okay? That's the question. They have a 15 footnote after Miranda, which reads, "Miranda v. 16 Arizona, 384 U.S. 436." I take that to mean that the 17 question is whether this warning violated Miranda. 18 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: And, of course, if they 19 did violate the baseline, the minimum standard set forth 20 in Miranda -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 22 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: -- then it would be 23 unconstitutional. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Absolutely. 25 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: So -- which is why
52 Alderson Reporting Company

1 Traylor and the Florida constitution kept making -2 because they didn't have to really get to what the 3 bottom or the baseline or the minimum standard was, as 4 long as Florida had set forth a standard. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's true, but -6 but if they -- if they felt the authority to go beyond 7 Miranda, wouldn't they have had to say no to this 8 question, if we find that way, and then go on to say: 9 But it does violate our own? And that's beyond the 10 question that they -- that they -- that was certified to 11 them. 12 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: And I believe the idea 13 that they didn't think it was deviating from the Miranda 14 case. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. I -16 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: But if this Court finds 17 that it does, then they -- they will probably -- and I 18 feel confident that they would fall back on the 19 constitution -- of the Florida constitution. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they did say over and 21 over again -- one was the certified question; another 22 was the issue before the court is whether the failure 23 to provide express advice of the right to the presence 24 of counsel during custodial interrogation violates the 25 principles espoused in Miranda, with the citation.

1 I mean, they said many, many times that the 2 question was -- what did Miranda mean was the issue, not 3 what -- what did Florida's extension of Miranda. 4 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Well, they do have a 5 section in looking at, you know, other circuit courts in 6 the Federal system, and all -- what our Florida courts 7 are doing, and -- which is when they get into the 8 concept of -- well, they start out talking about Traylor 9 and our constitution at the beginning, and they -- they 10 repeat it at the end because they believe it is 11 consistent with. They believe it is following along. 12 But they never say that -- that our 13 constitution isn't insignificant or that it's not 14 important. If they did, they wouldn't have felt the 15 need to cite Traylor. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you would have 17 had a much weightier argument if it hadn't been for 18 Michigan v. Long. If you could have said -19 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: It -- it would have been 20 nice. 21 (Laughter.) 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We could have then 23 remanded to ask the Florida Supreme Court: Was it 24 independently ruling under its constitution? 25 MS.

1 mind. 2 (Laughter.) 3 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: The -- the idea of clear, 4 reasonably clear -- whichever the standard is, 5 Justice Sotomayor, I believe the Florida Supreme Court 6 used the correct standard and used the one by saying 7 that it was clear -- you know, whether or not Mr. Powell 8 was clearly informed. 9 So no matter which standard you use, as far 10 as functionally equivalent or whatever, I believe that 11 this falls within the four corners of that. 12 The obligation -- let's see, I'm looking to 13 see what other cases -- general cases. 14 They -- the opposition cites to the 15 fact that there's this great conflict going on among the 16 circuits. I don't believe that such a conflict is ­17 whatever those cases were deciding, I don't believe they 18 would have approved of this language. 19 This language, because of the "before" 20 limiting language and excluding the "presence during" 21 language, became misleading. And the -- the general 22 cases that like -- just the plain language, you have the 23 right to the presence of counsel, they -- they are not 24 inconsistent with -- with what Florida has required. 25 They -- they would not disagree that there --

1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you said that the 2 average person wouldn't take this warning to mean -3 to -- wouldn't envision a procedure like the grand jury 4 procedure. What does it mislead the average person to 5 think? 6 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: That he -- that once 7 questioning starts, that he -- he has no right to 8 consult with a lawyer anymore, and it certainly 9 doesn't -- and tell him that he has the right to the 10 presence of an attorney with him in an interrogation 11 room, where the coercion takes on a highly new meaning. 12 I mean the coercive practices that are -13 that are -14 JUSTICE ALITO: But the latter part of that 15 is the grand jury question. You have a right to consult 16 an attorney, but you don't have the right to have an 17 attorney present. 18 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: I don't -- I don't 19 believe -- any -- any of the normal reasonable suspects 20 are -- would probably be even aware of what the grand 21 jury proceeding was about. 22 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So then your argument 23 is that this -- that what -- what a normal -- an average 24 person would take this to mean is that you -- you can 25 talk an -- to an attorney before starting to answer

1 questions, but not once the questioning begins. That's 2 what you take it to mean? 3 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Correct, and I'm not the 4 only one. There were five supreme court justices, a 5 majority on the second -- the majority of the second 6 district judges in Powell and seven judges on the second 7 district level, who all found that to be the case, and 8 we're talking someone who doesn't have that level of 9 intelligence. 10 And he may have had a prior record -- he did 11 have a prior record, but that doesn't mean -12 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, all of those people 13 are lawyers, and lawyers are known to read legal 14 documents very precisely. The average person may read 15 them very differently. 16 MS. BRUECKHEIMER: Correct, and in this 17 case -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes, a little 19 knowledge is a dangerous thing. 20 (Laughter.) 21 MS.

BRUECKHEIMER: I -- I -- yes. I do 10 believe that, when they changed the form to comply with 11 the decision below and with what's going on in 97 12 percent -- or 96 percent of the jurisdictions -- it 13 doesn't have to be exact language; it just has to be 14 there. Then -- then the -- then the system runs 15 beautifully. 16 I can't tell you the last time I had a 17 Miranda warning case, and I have been doing this for 18 almost 30 years. 19 There is no litigation when it's done 20 correctly, and it's mostly done correctly. 21 Thank you. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 Counsel, you have a minute remaining. 24 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH W. JACQUOT 25 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
58 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. JACQUOT: Mr. Chief Justice, let me make 2 three brief points, after responding to a question that 3 Justice Stevens asked. 4 In terms of independent and adequate State 5 grounds, in our brief, we relied on the Florida court 6 citing Miranda, the case, not Miranda, as the 7 phraseology, that the Florida Supreme Court interwove 8 the Federal law based on Miranda, the case itself, and 9 there is no plain statement to the otherwise. 10 Three quick points: There is no 11 manipulation behind this warning. This warning is the 12 result of litigation in Thompson v. State. That was a 13 1991 decision by the Florida Supreme Court. 14 The -- the Tampa police had changed its 15 warning. The previous warning had 148 words. This 16 warning is simpler, with 79 words. The previous warning 17 had arcane and redundant language. This language is 18 more straightforward. 19 Those are the reasons behind the change in 20 the warning, not any kind of inference, as amici makes, 21 towards manipulation. 22 Second, what Respondent is asking for is 23 exactly what this Court chose not to do in Prysock. 24 It told the -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
