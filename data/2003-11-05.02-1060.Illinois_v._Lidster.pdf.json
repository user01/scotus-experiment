  {
    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A Lombard informational checkpoint was designed to find witnesses to a specific known crime. The principal question here is whether the checkpoint is per se invalid under the Fourth Amendment or whether it's governed by the Brown balancing test. Now, the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, which generally is measured by balancing the Government interest advanced by a seizure against the intrusion on the individual and this Court has held that road - roadway checkpoints, including those that serve a law enforcement purpose, are governed by the balancing factors set forth in Brown v. Texas. Now, in Edmond, an exception was carved for a certain category of law enforcement checkpoints, those that are designed to advance the general interest in crime control. The Court held in Edmond that crime control checkpoints are not subject to a balancing analysis, but rather are per se invalid. The Illinois Supreme Court in this case held that informational checkpoints, including the Lombard checkpoint here, fall within that general crime control exception. That was an error. Per se invalidity under the Fourth Amendment is very strong medicine and ought to be reserved for exceptional circumstances, and those circumstances -"

  {
    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",
    "speech": "It was a week later, but there was a very good reason why the checkpoint was set up at that particular place and at that particular time. There was a fatal hit-and-run accident at about midnight on a Friday night. There were no witnesses, at least pedestrian witnesses, and the Lombard police reasonably concluded that, because people's driving habits, or at least some people's driving habits might be regular, that some of the drivers that were there on the night in question would also be driving the same route at the same time at the same place one week later, and we -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The - the - you - you said that they had to be used judiciously and that's a good word, but our - do our precedents in this area generally say, well, we defer to the good judgement of the police, they won't use them too often. The Illinois Supreme Court said, oh, if we allow this, we're going to have roadblocks every other - every day, every other street and in part that's hyperbole, but on the other hand, it does caution us that there should be some limiting principle and I just don't know if our precedents would support us in adopting your word, oh, if it's used judiciously."

    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",
    "speech": "That would be closer - that would be closer to the situation that was presented in Edmond, although it wouldn't - it wouldn't present one of the hallmarks of what we believe is a general crime control roadblock, which is that it's the goal of the police to incriminate the motorists as opposed to simply seek information."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, it wouldn't - it wouldn't come within that, but you think that that would - would be invalid even though you would support these informational roadblocks in some circumstances?"

For example, let's assume that in - in some area of some city that there's just rapid lawlessness because of a blackout or whatever and there are hundreds of crimes committed and the police might want to canvass the neighborhood but nobody wants to be seen talking to a police officer. So in that instance perhaps a roadblock would be set up where the police would hand each motorist a piece of paper saying, you don't have to talk to me now but here's a number, and if you know of anything that had happened that was unlawful, please feel free to give us a call, we'll maintain our confidentiality."

  {
    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If you had that kind of a roadblock and one of the drivers just about ran into the policeman, do you think that the court - the courts would entertain the argument that, well, the initial stop was invalid, therefore running into the policeman - it cannot be grounds for the arrest? I - it's just a clumsy way of asking, I guess, whether - whether or not there is any kind of a causation break here, causation link problem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",
    "speech": "Yeah, we - that - that argument perhaps could been made below but it wasn't, and as this case comes to this Court, the assumption is that if - if the roadblock were invalid under the Fourth Amendment, then the subsequent arrest would be as well. Even though the - the - Mr. Lidster almost running into the police officer did provide cause, that question's not presented here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Feinerman, may I go back to your own hypothetical of a moment ago in which this crime has been committed, people don't want to be seen talking to the police, so the police might set up a roadblock under those circumstances. What about the same situation in which the police say - and I suppose it would be reasonable in your hypo that they need to talk to a lot more people than simply the ones who were driving in cars - on your reasoning, could the police, in effect, cordon off sidewalks so that any pedestrian coming down the sidewalk would have to pass through sort of a chute at the end and could not get through with stopping to talk to the police officer and answer questions in order to get through?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",
    "speech": "No, Justice Souter, because pedestrians have greater Fourth Amendment rights than motorists."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, they - they - they do in the sense that we - we recognize certain rights to stop the motorist because of the regulated nature and the highly dangerous nature of the - of the driving enterprise. But here we're talking about stops which bear absolutely no relation to the regulation of motor vehicles. The only reason for the stop in the case that you're defending, and the only reason for the stop in my hypo is that there may be an opportunity to gather evidence from a citizen who won't come forward but would answer a question. So it seems to me that the difference between cars and pedestrians has nothing to do with the - the - the answer to my question. Am I wrong there?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",
    "speech": "I believe so, Your Honor, with respect. It would be permissible with motorists. It wouldn't be permissible with pedestrians because motorists do not have the same expectation of freedom of movement that pedestrians do."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but the - no, but the justification for interfering with their freedom of movement is not the justification that's involved in this stop. You're not looking for impaired motorists. You're not checking licenses and registrations. You're simply stopping motorists because they might have seen a crime, and in the extension of your hypo I'm talking about the pedestrian who might have seen a crime or have some evidence of it. They're in exactly the same situation. If you can stop the cars, why can't you stop the pedestrians?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",
    "speech": "Again, I - I just have to rely on my prior answer. It's because this Court has held that in certain - in certain situations, suspicionless roadway stops are permissible, or at least subject - potentially permissible and subject to the Brown balancing test."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Does one have a - in - is it - a greater sense of privacy walking down a main thoroughfare than being in a car? I understand the distinction between a home or an office, but you're out there on the street and the police could make - could - the police could go to any particular pedestrian and say, could you tell me if you know anything about X crime that was committed in this neighborhood and the police could do that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",
    "speech": "That's correct. The police can walk up to any pedestrian and ask questions and that's not a seizure under the Fourth Amendment."

    "speech": "So why can they do it with a car? Is that what happened here? Suppose this car were in first gear as it cruised, you know, rolled up to the roadblock and the same thing happened, the policeman said, I want to ask you, you know, sir, I'd like to ask you a question. I'm sorry, I'm too busy, just keeps rolling on through. Would - would he have been arrested in this roadblock?"

So he was stopped really for - at most only a minute, which is permissible. But were there a case as in your hypothetical where a motorist were stopped for a half an hour, we would still say that that waiting time doesn't count because that's really more a function of the number of vehicles on the street and it's not really - it was not intended by the officer that there be this backup."

That might be a reason, but there's a - there's an aspect of this, you've repeated the police many times, and one of the worrisome things of this set-up is all you need is a crime, and in major metropolitan areas there are crimes, multiple crimes every day. Who makes the decision? The local police chief. And then after some, you can get into court. It's - it's not like the law dictates this or even the State's Attorney General, but it's in every town, the local police chief that may have just a range of views about using roadblocks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",

Now, if there are some circumstances where we can imagine that we'd want to have this kind of informational checkpoint, then a - and that's really the principal question here. There ought not to be a per se rule, because there are some situations, and we submit that this is one of them, where it makes perfect sense for the police to set up a roadblock because the physical evidence recovered from the scene was not sufficient to identify the perpetrator, and the only witnesses to the crime were fellow motorists, and there was really only one way our - there wasn't only one way, but this was a very good way of getting at them. And if there are circumstances where we can imagine that we'd want to enable the police to solve crimes in this manner, then a per se rule is invalid. It ought to go through Brown balancing."

    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The reason a news story covering a - a hit-and- run fatality, as in this case, is not as effective for a number of reasons. First of all, statistically, the majority of Americans don't watch local news. More importantly, there is significant value as - as has long been recognized when police deal with pedestrians and approach them, seeking their assistance in solving crimes, there is significant value to having a police officer approach someone in a one-on-one manner in an effort to solve a crime. First of all, the - the approach impresses on people, who are otherwise very busy, the importance of the matter before them and that this may be worth devoting their time. The police officer's one-on-one approach can advise the person, in addition, that what you say might be significant even though you didn't see an accident."

    "speech": "No, absolutely not, Justice Scalia. There is a long - just there is a long historic distinction between cars and homes, there's a long historic distinction between cars and pedestrians, and the reason - as a practical matter, you have to have a very, very brief seizure here to protect the life and limb of the police officer while he tries to make this approach. That's not needed when you're approaching pedestrians."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why - why does the distinction - you've mentioned it and - and Mr. Feinerman mentioned it - why does the distinction between cars and pedestrians apply in a case in which the - the justification for making that distinction, regulation, a risk of impaired driving, does not apply?"

    "speech": "No, but my expectation of freedom of movement in the car is that, yeah, the police can stop to - for a sobriety checkpoint and I'll assume they can - they can stop to - to check my - my license and the registration of the car, but I also assume that they can't, you know, barring today, the result of today's case, I - I'm assuming that they - they can't stop me for - for other reasons, barring some really exigent circumstance. And if that expectation is reasonable, and I think it has been at least up until today, then I think my expectation is - is the same as the pedestrian's expectation, barring the - the regulatory authority of - of exercising the regulatory authority, which is not in - in issue here."

It's a balancing test, as this Court has long recognized, and an important part of that balance is the expectations that the individual brings to it, and the expectation of the individual behind the wheel is that there are a number of times that I will come into contact with police officers and I will need to stop, I'm highly regulated, I'm highly restricted, and I am engaged in a privilege of driving on the public roadways. Walking is not a privilege. Driving on the public roadways is and so the question -"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And - and we understand that when - when there's something pretty contemporaneous between the stopping and the - and the accident. That's what I had in mind with exigency. But do we - is - is it such a common practice that a week later or two weeks later -"

  {
    "speaker": "MILLETT",

    "speech": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MILLETT",
    "speech": "But the witness checkpoints are quite routinely done, either 24 hours, or very routinely, a week after, because people are creatures of habit and they tend to drive the same roads at the same time of - the same days, and so it's very common - a number - a number of Federal checkpoints have been done exactly like this. They've been done a week after a child's been abducted. In the Elizabeth Smart case, it was a week later. Federal checkpoints that I'm familiar with were done exactly - exactly a week later, and you try to go at the exact same time, because that is eminently sensible for police officers. If you want to look for the witnesses, you want to find people who are most likely to have been there at the same time."

But also, the ability to measure success here - we're not talking about immediately removing a drunk driver from the road or actually finding the alien - solving - you're successful if you defined you solved the crime, and solving a crime is not a linear project. It involves a lot of information coming in from a different -"

That would clearly be Edmond, and there seems to be something odd about saying, police, you can't have a roadblock in a neighborhood where you think that it's likely the suspect is living, but you can if you say what you're looking for, it's not the suspect, but witnesses."

First of all there are - Edmond leaves open that there are at least some circumstances when you can do this - maybe to approach is exigency - but where you can do these types of checkpoints to catch someone. The language there was a fleeing dangerous criminal who was going by particular routes, so it's not - that doesn't seem to be foreclosed in all circumstances. But the reason it makes a big differences for purposes of Fourth Amendment principles, there's actually three reasons why looking for witnesses is better and should be more consistent with the Fourth Amendment than what - the issue in Edmond. And that is, there - there's a difference between, just a practical difference, between police taking action, seizing people first and looking for a crime to go with them, which is what was going on in Edmond, or having a specific crime and looking to solve it in the most sensible and reasonable manner that police officers do, and that is looking for witnesses."

One is, as a practical matter, one of the balancing tests - factors - in Brown v. Texas is the level of anxiety. When a police officer approaches you and says - even if it's permissible - I want to know if you're doing something wrong. Do you not have a driver's license? Are you drunk? That's - there's a little more anxiety there when a police - than when a police officer comes and says, I would like your help, someone was killed here."

Texas balancing factors is - is of - one of the things that's been mentioned is the level of anxiety, and the reason that you don't have roving stops but you're allowed to have checkpoints is when you see other people being stopped around you, even if they want to know if you're drunk -"

Their job is to find crimes and criminals. Edmond was a checkpoint to find crimes and criminals that we didn't know about, when instead all that's being done here is this is an adjunct to a - adapting to the roadway context the normal investigative processes of police officers. You - you don't have that abuse, and the same way -"

City of Lago Vista the exact same argument was made dealing with misdemeanor arrests. And this Court's decision there specifically relied upon the good sense and political accountability of police, for the same reason that we know police don't arrest for every crime and infraction that - vehicle code infraction that they find. A lot of police chiefs are arrested and checkpoints are a great equalizer, especially these kind, because the location is dictated by where the crime occurred -"

Edmond is the controlling precedent."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that sounds a little colorful, but - but in my own mind I'm thinking that this is asking people to help with crime investigation and to spend 10 seconds listening to the request. Now, it's - I was delayed 2 hours - not 2 hours, but like 2 minutes anyway, or 3 minutes, this morning coming in, for the last couple of days because they had some tree pruning equipment, all right? So maybe they could put that on the sidewalk and not delay me, but I don't mind. I did actually mind, but I mean - (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "- but - you see, it's not - what their argument is, and that's, at least for me, what I'd like you to address, is this is not much of a - of a demand on people to stop for 10 seconds when they're trying to find out somebody who killed someone and - and we just want you to listen for 10 seconds. Now, why - why is that such an unreasonable thing for the police to ask the public to do? Nobody has to take the flyer, they don't even have to help."

That's the word in the Fourth Amendment and I tried to make it as - as reasonable-sounding as I could. Maybe somebody else could do better, but I want your response to my effort to make this sound very reasonable. That's what I'm interested in, your response."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "It remains unreasonable for a number of matters. It's the aggregate of the circumstances then by which other innocent persons could be seized. It's the fact that the gravity of the public concern in this particular event is far less than the reasonableness - reasonableness factors that have been used in Sitz. It's far less than the immigration factor that was found in Martinez v. Fuerte."

I'm not saying you even have to convince me to win your case, I'm just saying that for - I'd like to know why, in ordinary, common-sense English, this isn't the most reasonable thing in the world? Now, I'm - I'm now overstating it so you'll be sure to give me an answer."

You're waiting in line for several minutes as various other cars are evidently being interrogated, some are being transferred to secondary staging areas. The anxiety builds and you arrive at the front of the roadblock to be questioned about where you were last week, personal indications, what have you seen? You feel compelled to answer."

    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "Detective Vasil testified that they were stopped, given a flyer, but also asked if they had been in the area last week and if they had seen anything unusual.

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, suppose that there is a roadblock but the only purpose of the roadblock is the police are stopping people to see if they'll contribute to the police boys fund. The same thing - exactly the same thing happens with that roadblock has happened with your client. He comes up, almost hits the policeman, smells alcohol on his breath and so forth, he's charged with drunken driving and is convicted. Does he have a Fourth Amendment claim?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it would be a seizure, so the Fourth Amendment is implicated. However, applying the Edmond analysis, the programmatic purpose of that seizure not being in the investigation or detection of crime, I would submit it would not be a violation of the Fourth Amendment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So they can hold him up for 2 hours if they're collecting for the police boys fund but they can't hold him up for 10 or 15 seconds if they're trying to solve a crime?"

    "speech": "I - I would submit, Justice Scalia, that if you were to stop a person and seize them for no reason whatsoever that that would not survive a Fourth Amendment analysis. Ten to 15 seconds to deliver some funds and put them in a can would certainly be reasonable for that beneficent, non-crime control purpose. Two hours would certainly exceed -"

    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "It - it is often difficult to say no when - when a fireman is seeking some funds. However, it is certainly not the detection or investigation of crime, and the analysis that would take place there would be different, and certainly 2 hours to put money in a can would suggest that the scope and duration of that stop was far beyond what was reasonable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Maybe - maybe your response to Justice Breyer's question - I'm not sure that reasonableness for Fourth Amendment purposes is the same as reasonableness in general. Do you think it would be - in general, if you're not talking about the Fourth Amendment - an unreasonable thing for a policeman to knock on your door and say, excuse me, sir, we're investigating a crime, we really need your help, do you mind if I - I come in and ask you a couple of questions just to help us solve this crime? Do you think that's reasonable in - in - in a sense? I guess it is."

    "speaker": "RAMSELL",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Even though it isn't really the policeman that's being unreasonable in the general sense. It seems to me it's quite unreasonable for the homeowner to refuse to cooperate at all with the police in the - in the solving of a - let's assume it's a major crime. That seems to me unreasonable, but even so, the policeman is not allowed to come into the home."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor, and there's the difference between the voluntary consensual encounter and what we have in this case was clearly involuntary. They even had an officer -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And so also here. It might be very unreasonable for the person not to want to cooperate, and it might be quite reasonable for the policeman to seek the cooperation, but that doesn't necessarily answer the Fourth Amendment question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "I would suggest that the fact that an innocent motorist would feel that he or she was unreasonable by not cooperating suggests the compulsive aspects of this scenario, make it more of a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and more unreasonable to that extent. One -"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "In - in a general sense, yes. Of course, there would be other factors involved, but child abductions generally fall within the exigent circumstance analysis. Clearly there would likely have to be further evaluation of the facts behind why they felt that -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, why if - if it's the danger involved and wanting to save a life that we hope is still in being, why isn't the same thing if you're trying to get evidence about a hit-and-run person who kills people on the highway?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "Well, first off, the child abduction is a continuing crime, to the extent that the need for action in order to prevent the passable future or immediate harm to that child, makes that an exigent circumstance by itself."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So you think this would be different if this was a serial hit-and-run killer, right? He does one a week. Then - then you think it'd be a different situation and maybe they could conduct the - the roadblock."

  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "Well, as we had in Sitz with the imminent hazard of drunk drivers, if there were such a thing as a serial hit-and-run driver, the imminency, the exigency would be suggested within that hypothetical, and so I believe that it would be more reasonable under that circumstance, but what we -"

    "speech": "So would this - would this case have been different if it had been the next day rather than a week later?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "If they had some independent evidence to suggest that the person was still in the area, that may have been a different set of facts. Commonwealth v. Burns was an example of a informational roadblock where they had independent evidence to believe that the murderer was still in the area. I believe that was 2 days later."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speech": "Justice O'Connor, my understanding is that the roadblock itself was entirely ineffective. It had zero effectiveness in seeking to obtain information regarding this event. In fact, I believe that we've just heard that it was the television which led to some information, which is a standard police practice, does not implicate the Fourth Amendment, does not require any seizure of innocent persons -"

The blue brief describes it as a - a roadblock - roadblock set up in the evening, and as I understand it the crime was at 12:15 a.m., which I interpret to be midnight. It was a midnight crime and I thought the roadblock was at midnight, and I wonder, how long did it last? Was it started in the evening and lasted several hours or was it just -"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "Logic would seem to dictate that by the time the person received the flyer and drove away they would again be away from the scene of the event before they even read the flyer, which also makes it somewhat ineffective in that regard."

  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "Well, to - to take - to take the 10 to 15 seconds Detective Vasil describes as the duration of handing the flyer, asking two questions, and obtaining two answers, it would seem that reading the flyer would have had to have occurred sometime after the seizure."

It is in the joint appendix and it's located on page 9 of the joint appendix, and there is - there is a great amount of detail that's in that flyer, certainly would suggest it would be difficult for one to read the entirety of it, understand the purpose for which they were even being stopped that evening, which is another point. There was no advance signs, unlike sobriety checkpoints, where as you're arriving, and even before you have contact with - with the police officers, there's a sign that says, warning, sobriety checkpoint ahead. At least you're putting - you're put on notice what it is that's taking place in front of you. Here, people are waiting in line having no idea what it is -"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but that - that happens in a lot of other contexts too. You can be driving on a highway, all of a sudden everything comes to a stop. What's the matter? Is it an accident? Are they having one-lane repair? And you just don't know, I mean, that's part of the condition of driving."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "Well, certainly we have to expect that we'll be stopped more often than anyone would wish in that context, but it - it's quite different when you are - when there's six to twelve emergency vehicles there and as you get closer and closer you see this encounter taking place before you with every single motorist in front of you. That raises the anxiety of even the - the most innocent citizen, I would suggest."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Ramsell, there's something I'd like you to comment on. The - the Illinois Supreme Court was - was concerned about the - the effect of - of this practice, in effect, in opening the door to stops all the time. They said, you know, there are loads of crimes and if it's justified here it will be justified in other cases and so on, and there have been some questions from the bench to that effect. One answer to that might be that under the law as it stands now the police can conduct sobriety checkpoints and we will assume that they can make license and registration checks and things like that. So the - the police already have an opportunity, to put it bluntly, to abuse their right to stop if they want to do it. Is there any indication that there is this kind of abuse going on, and hence, is there any reason to believe that the abuse would be greater if this practice passed muster than it is under the existing law?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "Well, I believe that law enforcement is always appreciative of any techniques or tools that they're allowed to use for investigatory purposes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But what - what do we know? Empirically, what we do know? What is - has there - has there been an indication of abuse? Is there a reason to believe that this invitation, this tool, would be abused more than the tools that they now have?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "I would believe that it would be more - more likely for abuse if this Court were to suggest that these type of roadblocks were a valid investigative tool."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But why - why?"

    "speech": "Well, it makes for great publicity to - to have sobriety checkpoints. That's one reason why they have them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "And - I agree, even though statistically roadblock sobriety checkpoints tend to be far less effective than saturation patrols. Most police chiefs comment that they don't get the type of publicity they receive from a roadblock that they get from saturation patrols. QUESTION: Is it true that -QUESTION: Suppose they had done the same thing they did here, the same thing, except that, in addition to giving them a flyer and asking them about what happened - were - you know, were you here a week before, they - it was also a check of driver registration?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, I would suggest the programmatic purpose, which would be a question of intent, would still remain that it was truly for the investigation of this particular crime and certainly the duration and the scope of the seizure would exceed the license check when questions were being asked about whether you had been here last week, whether you had seen anything regarding a hit-and-run or any other crime. And that would seem to exceed even the suggested appropriateness of a roadblock for license checks in Prouse."

    "speech": "I know that a - a far greater number have been reported since Sitz, but I cannot confess to knowing what the statistics or the record-keeping was prior to Sitz, but it has - it has now crept into the American psyche that roadblocks are a - a regular way of life."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But do - do they exist in Michigan anymore, these sobriety checkpoints?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "No. When the - when the case was remanded to Michigan, Michigan found under their own State constitution that this - that a sobriety checkpoint still remained to be an unreasonable violation of the search and seizure clause of their own constitution, so they do not have them. Now, in this case, what we have is we have a - a very stale event. In fact, the facts do not even suggest that the driver was perhaps even negligent in how the accident occurred. We have a - a bicyclist on a major thoroughfare at midnight in a place where it's highly unusual to - to find pedestrians in a dark area, and there's been no indication that the driver was at fault other than failing to remain at the scene of the accident."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",

    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. I would - I would respectfully say that, under the analysis in Edmonds, there is a lack of exigency. Edmonds suggests that, but for the emergency circumstances of an - an imminent terrorist attack, otherwise that would be considered a violation of the Fourth Amendment. This is a single accident. It - it does not fall within the magnitude of any of the previous issues that have been brought before the Court -"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "Well, the line is exigency, and exigency meaning there was no - there's an immediate hazard on the roadway, which was what seemed to justify sobriety checkpoints in Sitz, that there would have been an effectiveness to removing then-hazardous drivers and preventing the potential for future injury to life and limb. This is a post-event, non-exigent roadblock. The facts, nevertheless, don't have the gravity of the public concern. In the Brown v. Texas -"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "I would submit yes, that you could under that circumstance. Number one, you could tailor the roadblock substantially less. You have the exigency because it is a fresh pursuit analysis. You certainly wouldn't need to pull over every car and question them if you had a license plate number to work from. And so it - it would certainly even be capable of being more sufficiently tailored so that those who are admittedly innocent are less likely to have their liberties interfered with."

In fact, in this particular checkpoint, we have virtually no guidelines in place. We have a field officer who testifies that what he did was to ask some questions. There's no indication as to why other persons were sent to secondary staging areas. We do not have any guidelines so that if a motorist had said, yes, I was here last week, and yes, I think I have some information, we have no guidelines for those field officers as to what to do and how to treat that motorist and how to detain that person."

    "speech": "I mean, is there evidence of that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "I - I cannot cite any polling that's been taken one way or the other that would really flesh that out. Here we have far less than the drug interdiction that was rejected in Edmond. We have a single accident. We have far less than the concern about protecting our national borders, as we had in Martinez v. Fuerte, and certainly not the imminency of the hazard that was found in Sitz. There's frankly no empirical or actual data to even support that this roadblock will advance the interest, and by the fact that nothing was advanced in this particular event suggests that even in a balancing test we don't have the sufficiency, the gravity of the public concern, nor do we have any indication of any degree to which this seizure would advance the public interest. This is more akin to Prouse, where the Court found that the - the likelihood of finding an unlicenced motorist versus the likely numbers of persons that will be stopped was so substantial that data was insufficient."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, Prouse was random stops, though, wasn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RAMSELL",
    "speech": "It was random stops. However, the effectiveness was mentioned as - as one of the factors, and there were certainly reasonable alternatives that were suggested that could have avoided the random stop scenario. And here we have admittedly innocent drivers as well with no escape route, so a person couldn't even avoid the - the compulsory stop and questioning. I would also submit that this analysis, if - if found appropriate here, would equally allow for the stop of pedestrians at - on the sidewalk. It would allow the police to circle an office building and have the persons run through the - with the gamut of brief questioning before they were allowed to leave an office building. And it would be very unmanageable and unworkable to find an appropriate balancing test, even though I would submit that one thing the Court needs to do is to, of course, let law enforcement know in advance what will be acceptable conduct on their part and that it would be inappropriate to allow for a case-by-case, fact-sensitive analysis based on the plethora of crimes that could potentially lead to it, the geographic area in a small rural town. The rural police chief may find roadblocks or - may find their most serious crime to be the stealing of a purse and therefore a roadblock of some form justifiable there, where that same roadblock in an urban setting would be found to be unreasonable and unjustifiable, and certainly those politically accountable officials that feel that their citizenry are more favorable to roadblocks may be encouraged to allow them to occur more often. Thank you."

  {
    "speaker": "FEINERMAN",
    "speech": "This Court in Edmond found that narcotics check - narcotics checkpoints are so obnoxious to core Fourth Amendment values that a per se rule of invalidity was justified and the principal question here is whether informational checkpoints present the same Fourth Amendment dangers that general crime control checkpoints present, and the answer to that is no. And in order to answer that, we - we have to figure out what the hallmarks are of a crime control checkpoint, and we suggest that there are at least two. The first is that it's the purpose of the checkpoint to incriminate the motorist as opposed to the situation in Lombard, which was simply the police asking for help, and that distinction makes a difference under the Fourth Amendment for several reasons. The first has to do with privacy. At a general crime control checkpoint, the police are trying to learn something about you, whether you've committed a wrongdoing, whereas at an informational checkpoint there's just asking for help, somebody died here last week, could you help us find the perpetrator. There's also a difference in terms of jeopardy. At a general crime control checkpoint you may be interrogated, detained, arrested, prosecuted, and possibly jailed, whereas at an informational checkpoint, again, you're just being asked for help, and that's a critical distinction that this Court drew in Ferguson between the drug test that was invalidated in Ferguson and the drug testing programs that were upheld in Skinner, Acton, and Von Raab. There's also an indignity element to a general crime control checkpoint. You're being - it's - it's a bit of an indignity to be suspected as being a potential law-breaker, whereas in - in an informational checkpoint there's really no impingement on dignity, you're just, again, being treated as an ally of the police and being asked for help, and in fact, it's an act of responsible citizenship to provide help in that kind of situation. The second distinction is that a general crime control checkpoint - the police are simply trolling for hitherto undiscovered crimes, whereas in an informational checkpoint, they're investigating a known, specific crime, and that's who makes a difference. There's a difference between - as Ms. Millett pointed out - there's a difference between knowing a crime and finding the criminal and then simply rounding up a bunch of potential criminals and trying to peg a crime on them. And that's important not only for the fact that we're uncomfortable with general - general surveillance, but also it's a traditional police function. When a crime happens, police ought to return to the scene of the crime and find witnesses. Thank you."
