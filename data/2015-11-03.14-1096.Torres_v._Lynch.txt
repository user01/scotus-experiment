3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 next this morning in Case 141096, Torres v. Lynch.

5             Mr. Guadagno.

6           ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW L. GUADAGNO

7                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8             MR. GUADAGNO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10             Congress made a choice.  Congress did not

11 choose to make generic arson an aggravated felony.

12 Instead, Congress chose to make Federal arson an

13 aggravated felony.

14             And that makes sense.  The Federal arson

15 statute has a minimum sentence of five years.  There are

16 at least 18 States with arson offenses that are

17 classified as misdemeanors.  Arizona and Colorado have

18 misdemeanor arson offenses involving damage to property

19 worth less than a hundred dollars.

20             Congress would not have wanted to make such

21 minor offenses aggravated felonies.  We know this

22 because of the statutory scheme.

23             Within the aggravated felony statute, we

24 have generic offenses, very serious ones like murder and

25 rape.  There are no  there are no sentence

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 requirements for those very serious generic offenses.

4

2             However, for the remaining generic offenses

3 that are  that are listed in  in  in the

4 aggravated felony statute, they  they are associated

5 with a sentence of a year or more.  Theft offenses,

6 obstruction of justice, burglary, they all require a

7 sentence of a year or more.

8             Also listed with  among the generic

9 offenses is crime of violence.  There is a requirement

10 of a sentence of a year or more.

11             Arson is a crime of violence, and so  so

12 Congress would have realized that  that arson offenses

13 would  would fall under the crimeofviolence

14 provision, and  and for more serious State arson

15 offenses, they would fall under this  this  this

16 provision so that, for the minor arson offenses, where

17 there's a sentence of less than a year, the individual

18 would  would not be an aggravated felon and would be

19 eligible for discretionary relief.

20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But your reading leaves

21 out some very serious arson offenses.  Say under foreign

22 law or under State law it could be the worst kind of

23 arson, but there's no commerce hooker and so it would be

24 left out, on your reading.

25             MR. GUADAGNO:  But  but  but on  on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 our reading, while  while it wouldn't fall under

5

2 the  the  the (e) provision in the aggravated felony

3 statute, these more serious arson offenses, the  the

4 State and foreign offenses, they  they would fall

5 under the  the (f), crime of violence, provision

6 where  where there is a sentence to a year or more.

7             And  and under  under that  that

8 approach, these lessserious arsons would  would not

9 be aggravated felons.  And  and individuals like 

10 like my client, Mr. Luna, who only received a sentence

11 of one day, they would be eligible to receive

12 cancelation of a 

13             JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that's still

14 clear after our decision in Johnson?

15             MR. GUADAGNO:  Johnson, if I  if I

16 remember correctly, dealt  dealt with  with  with

17 16  16(b).  You could still  you  one could still

18 be an aggravated felon under  under 16(a).  But  but

19 regardless, what I'm talking about is 

20             JUSTICE ALITO:  But what you're relying

21 is  you're relying on language that is similar to,

22 maybe, and  and maybe different in an  in an

23 important respect; but nevertheless bears some

24 similarity to the residual clause in the  in the armed

25 criminal  Armed Career Criminal Act, does it not?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1             MR. GUADAGNO:  Yes.  But I'm talking about 2 what Congress intended.  When Congress write  writes a 3 law, it doesn't intend for  for the  for the Supreme 4 Court to find the language ambiguous and  and  and 5 strike it down.  So  so that  we should be looking 6 at what Congress's intent was, not  not  not whether 7 or not the crime of violence will still be an aggravated 8 felony after Johnson.  If  if  if there are problems 9 with this, that will be  that will be for Congress to 10 fix. 11             JUSTICE ALITO:  May I ask you about the 12 statutory language that seems to me to present the 13 greatest problem for your position.  Maybe it's not 14 fatal, but what I'm referring to is the provision that 15 says the term applies  so we're looking at whether 16 the  the State offense here is described in the 17 Federal arson statute.  And then there's language that 18 says, the term applies to an offense described in this 19 paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law. 20             What do you make of that?  It can be argued 21 that what that means is that, when you have a Federal 22 offense with a jurisdictional provision, you disregard 23 the jurisdictional provision because you're never going 24 to find that in a State provision. 25             MR. GUADAGNO:  The  the language you're 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
7 1 you're referring to is  is referred to normally as the 2 penultimate sentence.  And  and the penultimate 3 sentence merely tells us that  that State offenses 4 that are described in the aggravated felony provision 5 are aggravated felonies.  In the  in the board's first 6 matter of VasquezMuniz decision, the board looked at 7 that language and concluded that  that  that all 8 that means is that sometimes State offenses could  9 could be aggravated felonies, but it didn't require 10 that  that State offenses always be  be aggravated 11 felonies. 12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But, I mean, 13 the point is usually when you see language, you know, 14 in  in interstate commerce, your immediate reaction 15 is, oh, that's Federal jurisdiction as opposed to State. 16 But here the one thing we know is they didn't want it to 17 matter.  They said in violation of Federal or State law. 18             So as I look at it, the  your instinctive 19 reaction is to say, well, then, of course you don't have 20 to worry about the provisions that's in there to limit 21 the offense to Federal  Federal offenses. 22             MR. GUADAGNO:  This  this  this 23 language, it  it  it doesn't  it doesn't directly 24 address jurisdiction.  It  it just  it's just saying 25 that  that  that certain offenses, certain State

2 saying 

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There  this  this

4 provision applies to an entire list of multiple crimes,

5 right?

6             MR. GUADAGNO:  That is correct, Your Honor.

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so for most of those

8 crimes there is no jurisdictional element at all.

9             MR. GUADAGNO:  That  that is also correct,

10 yes.

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if you're looking at

12 this as superfluous to not this individual subprovision,

13 one subprovision of many 

14             MR. GUADAGNO:  Yes.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   it's doing a lot of

16 work.

17             MR. GUADAGNO:  Yeah.

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's doing a lot of work

19 because there are a lot of other crimes that qualify

20 under State law, correct?

21             MR. GUADAGNO:  That's correct, yeah.

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, your brief and

23 the solicitor general's sort of tunnel in on this one

24 provision of many.  But I'm wondering why?

25             I'm looking at the entire provision has many

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 State court analogues that don't involve interstate

9

2 commerce, correct?

3             MR. GUADAGNO:  Yes.  So  so under  under

4 our  our reading of the statute, it  it  it

5 doesn't render the  the penultimate sentence a nullity

6 because as  as Justice Sotomayor noted, there  there

7 are  are many State provisions that  that will still

8 be aggravated felonies.  We have all  all  I  I

9 mentioned the  the generic offenses, all the generic

10 offenses will  will be both  both State and 

11             JUSTICE ALITO:  But suppose 

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  What your 

13             JUSTICE ALITO:  Go ahead.

14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  What your theory does is at

15 least create a world in which some things are included

16 and some things are excluded in a way that appears not

17 to make much sense.  Now, you've said no, there is a

18 reason for doing this with arson to limit it to the

19 Federal offense.  But I mean, there are a lot of things,

20 a lot of things on that list that have jurisdictional

21 hooks in them.

22             So you would be excluding  in addition to

23 arson, you would be excluding the child pornography

24 crime.  You would be excluding a kidnapping crime,

25 excluding felon and possession, excluding receiving

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 explosives for the purpose of killing somebody.  So you 2 would be excluding all of those. 3             And then on the other hand, you would be 4 including some things that seem a lot more minor that 5 just happen not to have jurisdictional hooks, like 6 operating a gambling establishment. 7             So you create a world in which the 8 exclusions and the inclusions seem not to match up with 9 anybody's view of  of a sensible categorization. 10             MR. GUADAGNO:  Well, the  the  the same 11 way that  that  that there's  there's an 12 aggravated felony provision for arson in the generics 13 for all those things that Your Honor mentioned, that 14 there are other categories of aggravated felony which 15 would cover State offenses for those things:  Sexual 16 abuse of a minor, crime of violence.  And  and even 17 outside the aggravated felony scope, we have crimes 18 involving moral turpitude.  So individuals who commit 19 those crimes on  within a State, they would still be 20 removable and they would still be removable for 21 aggravated felonies  22             JUSTICE ALITO:  Take two  two defendants. 23 One is convicted of the Federal offense of possession of 24 a firearm by a convicted felon, where you have to prove 25 a connection between the firearm and interstate
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 commerce.  The second defendant is convicted under an 2 identical State statute, but of course, there's no need 3 to prove an interstate commerce element.  And under your 4 argument, the first would be included and the second 5 would not. 6             MR. GUADAGNO:  The person  the State 7 individual would still be removable under the firearm's 8 removability ground. 9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but that may be 10 discretionary as mandatory.  That  that does avoid the 11 question somewhat when you say, oh well, there's another 12 section.  Don't worry.  That's your answer. 13             But that doesn't seem to me a complete 14 answer to the statutory question that Justice Alito's 15 question poses.  You're making the statute a nullity as 16 to the States. 17             MR. GUADAGNO:  Well, you know, the 18 interstatecommerce provision, it's  it's an element 19 of  of the statute that  that's required for a 20 conviction. 21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But does it have to be 22 expressed in the statute?  Is it not always a required 23 element of a Federal crime?  There has to be Federal 24 jurisdiction, so as  as a matter of fact, every 25 Federal crime has some jurisdictional element in it.
Alderson Reporting Company

1 Right?

Official

12

2             MR. GUADAGNO:  Yes, but 

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whether it's expressed in

4 the  in the text of the statute or not, the statute's

5 invalid if there's no Federal hook.

6             MR. GUADAGNO:  But at the same time in  in

7 Federal criminal law 

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But  but you're  you're

9 not  you're just limiting it to the jurisdictional

10 element recited in the statute, right?  That seems to me

11 a little illogical.

12             MR. GUADAGNO:  But in this  this Court

13 always requires the jurisdictional element for  for

14 the conviction.  Jones v. United States, there was 

15 there was a conviction under 18 U.S. 844(i), and this

16 Court overturned that  that conviction because the

17 interstatecommerce element wasn't met.  So you  you

18 can't  you can't have the Federal conviction without

19 the interstatecommerce element.

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but  but it doesn't

21 have to be recited in the statute.  And I mean, if a

22 defendant could come in and challenge his conviction on

23 the ground that there  there was no basis on which the

24 Federal government could  could have reached my

25 conduct.  It was not interstate commerce.  There was 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it was not pursuant to a treaty or anything else.

13

2             Doesn't that make the Federal jurisdictional

3 hook a necessary element of any Federal crime?

4             MR. GUADAGNO:  Yes.  It  the  the

5 Federal jurisdiction element is  is a requirement

6 for  for a  for a conviction.  And 

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But  but  but you're

8 not arguing that.  You're  you're saying only when

9 it's recited in the statute, right?

10             MR. GUADAGNO:  I'm  I'm not following the

11 distinction that you're making.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On those other  the

13 ones that are not stated in the statute, it's presumed.

14 It doesn't have to be proven to a jury beyond a

15 reasonable doubt, correct?

16             MR. GUADAGNO:  Okay.  Correct, yes.

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I have  I'm going

18 to sound like my colleague, Justice Breyer.

19             MR. GUADAGNO:  Okay.

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I became interested in

21 the argument of the National Association of Criminal

22 Lawyers.  And basically, their position is that the

23 definition here that says, an offense described in

24 844  what  of that title, relating to explosive

25 material offenses.  And they argue that that takes arson

Alderson Reporting Company

1 out of this section.

14

2             Why  I don't see that argument in your

3 brief.  Are you disavowing it?  And if so, why?

4             MR. GUADAGNO:  We're  we're not disavowing

5 it, and I think that that does show  support our 

6 our position in  in that it shows how easy it is

7 when  when you have broad language that says

8 eliminate  eliminate elements as  as the government

9 says, that it could be any  it could be any element

10 that gets eliminated.  They're saying it's jurisdiction.

11             In the amicus brief, it says  it says

12 arson 

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not  I'm not even

14 on your point.

15             MR. GUADAGNO:  Okay.

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Did you read

17 the National Association 

18             MR. GUADAGNO:  I  I am  I am familiar

19 with 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  They don't

21 argue that point at all.

22             MR. GUADAGNO:  Okay.

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They're just saying that

24 this  this is not covered by  the fire, the arson is

25 not covered by the statute at all by the enhancement 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 by the statute at all, except under the arson provision 2 that requires a sentence for a year.  That's their 3 argument. 4             MR. GUADAGNO:  That is. 5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Forget about interstate 6 or anything else. 7             So tell me why you didn't make that 8 argument. 9             MR. GUADAGNO:  We  we didn't make that 10 argument because we didn't think about it.  Their brief 11 came  came after ours.  And we  we don't necessarily 12 disagree with their provision, with their argument. 13 We  we just didn't make it in our brief. 14             But  but it does support our  our 15 position, and as  as I was saying earlier that  16 that  you know, the statute says "described in," okay? 17 And the government is saying "described in" tells us 18 that we  we  we can eliminate elements.  But what's 19 the criteria?  How do you know what  what  what 20 element to  gets eliminated.  And that  that example 21 shows that  that it  it may not necessarily be 22 the  the jurisdictional element, and  and it could 23 just as well be the arson element. 24             And  and  yeah, why does it have to be 25 the jurisdictional element that gets eliminated?  It
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 could just as easily be the arson element.

16

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The sole purpose  the

3 sole purpose of it is to enable Federal authority to be

4 brought to bear on the problem.  It has no relationship

5 to the conduct.  The arson is the same.  The only reason

6 for the jurisdictional provision is to authorize Federal

7 action and nothing to do with the conduct involved in

8 the crime itself.

9             So I think a jurisdictional provision is not

10 like any other element.  It's there for one purpose

11 only, which is to authorize Federal action.

12             MR. GUADAGNO:  On Page 24 of our brief, we

13 cite three provisions from Title 18, two from

14 18 U.S.C. Section 3142, and the third one is 18 U.S.C.

15 Section 5032.  And these three provisions have language

16 referring to State offenses if circumstances giving rise

17 to Federal jurisdiction had existed.  That  that is

18 very clear language removing the jurisdictional element

19 or  or applying a State offense with  to a Federal

20 law.

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I agree  yes, I

22 agree with you, that's clearer.  But it still doesn't

23 say if  if the jurisdictional element, why not some

24 other element?  Because jurisdictional elements are

25 unique.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. GUADAGNO:  But the important point

17

2 about  about those three Federal statutes is  is

3 that Congress is saying that if they want jurisdictional

4 elements to be ignored, they're going to say so, and

5 they're going to say so with clear language, much

6 clearer language than  than  than the penultimate

7 sentence or described in, and Congress didn't  didn't

8 do that here.

9             I mean, basically we're  we're asking to

10 apply the full language of  of  of the statute, and

11 the government is saying omit things.  And  and to

12 omit things, you need clear language.

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but your

14 assumption is that there  an element is an element is

15 an element, whether it's substantive or jurisdictional.

16 And that's not the way our  our cases have treated

17 them, or  or the general.  I mean, you don't need to

18 rely on it for  for everything, but the Model Penal

19 Code draws a precise distinction between matters

20 relating to the harm or evil sought to be prevented and

21 facts that relate to jurisdiction, venue, or

22 limitations.

23             MR. GUADAGNO:  But  but still, the

24 jurisdictional element is required for the conviction.

25 You  you cannot have the  the conviction.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
18 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, I know.  But my 2 point is it's required for a conviction.  But that 3 doesn't necessarily mean that you would include the 4 jurisdictional element when you're saying, well, what 5 does the crime  what is the  what is the harm or 6 evil sought to be prevented?  And in a statute like 7 this, it seems to me that that's what Congress is 8 concerned about, not the technical elements like, for 9 example, venue.  I mean, is venue an element if it's 10 listed under the  the criminal provision?  Well, sure. 11 It's an element that could have to be proved depending 12 on the terms of the statute.  But that has nothing to do 13 with the harm or evil sought to be prevented. 14             MR. GUADAGNO:  Okay.  You know, going back 15 to  to the United States v. Jones again, I mean, you 16 know, this  this Court said that Congress didn't 17 intend to make all arson  all  all arsons Federal 18 offenses.  And  and by  by the same token, but 19 that  that if Congress didn't intend to  to make 20 all  all State arsons Federal offenses.  They  21 they  they shouldn't have intended to make all State 22 arsons rulable offenses or aggravated felonies. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but they wanted 24 to make arsons offenses, whether in violation of Federal 25 or State law.

19 1             MR. GUADAGNO:  But  but it's  it's  2 it's described in this paragraph.  So it's still  3 the language of the penultimate sentence is  is still 4 requiring all  all the  all the elements to  to be 5 met.  You know, it  described in.  It  it has to be 6 described in. 7             And  and the 844(i), okay, has that 8 jurisdictional element.  And  and there's nothing 9 about the penultimate sentence that  that  that 10 indicates that  that any element of that offense  of 11 an offense can  can be ignored. 12             You know, under  under the categorical 13 approach, this  this Court has  has regularly 14 compared elements of  of offenses, and we've never had 15 a  a categorical approach case where  where this 16 Court has  has said an element can  can be excluded 17 in the categorical analysis. 18             And  19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we've  we've 20 not addressed this question in the context of the 21 categorical  application of the categorical approach. 22             MR. GUADAGNO:  I  I  I don't dispute it. 23 It  it's never come up and  and sort of my point. 24 But  but  but still, in light of the fact that  25 that Congress is  is aware that  that this Court
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 utilizes the  the  the categorical approach,

20

2 Congress would have used strong language or clearer

3 language if  if  if there was going to be a

4 modification of the categorical  I mean, this would be

5 a  a major deviation from the way that the categorical

6 approach is applied.  And 

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Guadagno, this is along

8 the same lines as the Chief Justice's question.  I mean,

9 tell me if I'm wrong, but jurisdictional elements are

10 different in one important way, which is that we don't

11 require mens rea as to jurisdictional elements.

12             So that's a pretty critical distinction that

13 we've made.  Are you suggesting that jurisdictional

14 elements are different?  You know, you have to prove

15 them, but you don't have to  the  the defendant

16 doesn't have to have mens rea with respect to them.

17             Why doesn't that suggest that there is a

18 real distinction here between jurisdictional elements

19 and substantive elements that can come into play in this

20 context as well?

21             MR. GUADAGNO:  This is the  what Congress

22 showed.  Congress shows a statutory provision with 

23 with  with jurisdictional elements I think should be

24 presumed that  that  that Congress knew what it was

25 doing and it  and it meant 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But  but that  the mens 2 rea example is also an example where  where basically 3 State and what we think Congress meant.  And we're 4 saying, you know, Congress could not have meant to 5 require mens rea for a jurisdictional element. 6             Notwithstanding that there's not language in 7 a statute that says, and there shall be no mens rea for 8 a jurisdictional element.  So why not the same here? 9             MR. GUADAGNO:  Well, even  even if it's 10 different, okay, even if you're going to say 11 jurisdiction is different, it  it doesn't stop it from 12 being a requirement.  Okay?  It  it may  it may be a 13 different element, it may a different kind of 14 requirement, but it's still a requirement.  And  15 and  and so you  you can't just  just wish it 16 away. 17             The  the language  the language in the 18 statute isn't there to  to say, circumstances giving 19 rise to Federal jurisdiction had existed.  Congress 20 didn't put the language in the statute that was 21 necessary to ignore the plain language of the statute, 22 which is  which is that Congress wanted convictions 23 under 18 U.S.C. 844(i) to be aggravated felonies. 24             The  the  25             JUSTICE BREYER:  You could, perhaps, treat
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it as we treated the $10,000  million in the 

22

2             MR. GUADAGNO:   in the Ashwan case.

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  And  and say,

4 yes, Congress did mean to pick up this definition, the

5 jurisdictional part.

6             But since no State explosives law will have

7 that in the language, you can  the government could,

8 if it wanted, prove it at the  prove that it was

9 interstatecommerce related at the deportation hearing.

10 That's what we did with the 10,000, isn't it?

11             MR. GUADAGNO:  Yes.

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  The reason really is pretty

13 similar here.  The  the reason is there isn't a  you

14 know, there isn't a theft statute in the States which

15 have a $10,000 thing in it, and so it didn't make really

16 sense to think Congress wanted to exclude all those.

17 And  and  and so here this is a big thing,

18 explosives.  I mean, that's quite  quite a major

19 problem trying to have an explosive to blow up a

20 building.  And I think if anything counts as an

21 aggravated Felony, it's that.

22             But there is this jurisdictional problem.

23             What do you think about that?  I just 

24             MR. GUADAGNO:  I think  the Ashwan, I

25 think, is  is a very different situation.  The Ashwan

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 dealt with one specific provision, the

23

2 $10,000requirement just  just affected that  that

3 single provision.

4             And  and in that case, there was pretty

5 much a  a nullity situation where that specific

6 provision would  would  would have been rendered a

7 nullity.

8             Here, the  the penultimate sentence

9 relates to the  the entire aggravated Felony

10 provision.

11             So my  my reading of the statute 

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  The penultimate sentence of

13 what?

14             MR. GUADAGNO:  The penultimate sentence

15 of  of  of 1101(a)(43).  The  the language  the

16 term applies to an offense described in this paragraph

17 whether in violation of Federal or State law.  The

18 board, in its decisions, calls that the penultimate

19 sentence.  That  that  that's why I  I keep

20 referring to it as  as  as that.

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  I just need to read it.

22             MR. GUADAGNO:  Okay.

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  It's 1101(43) 

24             MR. GUADAGNO:   (a)  (a)(43).  It is in

25 the  the  our Joint Appendix at page 4A.

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the  the

3 respect that we owe to the BIA for their interpretation?

4             MR. GUADAGNO:  The  the board should not

5 be owed any  any  any deference under  under two

6 different theories.

7             One is that the criminal lenity rule should

8 apply.  The second is that the longstanding principle

9 of construing lingering ambiguities in deportation

10 statutes in favor of the alien should also be applied.

11             And with regard to those rules, Chevron is

12 not a rubber stamp.  Chevron tells us that there are

13 certain circumstances when  when deference should be

14 applied to boards' decisions and, if those circumstances

15 are not met, then the board is  is not supposed to be

16 given deference.

17             And in  in this particular situation, both

18 of these principles that I've just mentioned, they're

19 statutory tools of construction.  And statutory tools of

20 construction are supposed to be applied at  at Chevron

21 step one.  And therefore, the agency should not be owed

22 deference.

23             Unless there are any further questions, I

24 reserve rebuttal time.

2           ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG

3                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

5 it please the court:

6             Section 1101(a)(43) indicates that

7 violations of State and foreign law should be considered

8 aggravated felonies along with violations of Federal

9 law.  It was enacted against the backdrop of multiple

10 doctrines across multiple areas of the law in which a

11 jurisdictional element drops away when a Federal crime

12 is being compared to a State support crime.

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All these examples you

14 gave me in your brief, either it's clear explicitly that

15 jurisdiction was excluded by the statute or the nature

16 of the offense gives jurisdiction or the Assimilated

17 Crimes Act, it makes sense, because the whole purpose is

18 that it's  that Federal  that a State law is going

19 to apply when there isn't a Federal law.  So applying

20 jurisdiction makes no sense.

21             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Our point 

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But  so I don't take

23 much from your arguments, which is the fact that it

24 drops away in other sections.  Congress didn't just say

25 it dropped away here.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, our point isn't that 2 each one of those is exactly analogous.  It's that there 3 are so many different places where it drops away and 4 that that's very telling.  And of course, the purpose of 5 this statute is to capture people who are particularly 6 dangerous who shouldn't be  7             JUSTICE BREYER:  But I  I thought  I 8 agreed with that when I came in.  And  and then I 9 thought, my goodness.  Of course.  It's an explosives 10 crime.  My God.  Blowing up a building or a person, if 11 anything's an aggravated felony, that must be. 12             Then the first words out of his mouth, your 13 friend's mouth, were, have no fear, read on, because 14 there is a section that makes it an aggravated felony to 15 commit a crime of violence.  And "a crime of violence" 16 is very broadly defined.  So any human being who commits 17 an explosives violation where that's a State law 18 violation will fall within the definition of aggravated 19 felony because they will have committed a crime of 20 violence. 21             So now, if that's right, I'm left with only 22 half the problem I thought I was left with.  And the 23 half I'm still left with is, if we follow your 24 interpretation, what we will suddenly do is put into the 25 category "aggravated felony," which forbids the attorney
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 general to exercise her discretion and keep the person 2 here even when she wants to, though the Mor case isn't a 3 problem, because after all, she doesn't have to keep him 4 here.  All right? 5             We put in every tax fraud state, every 6 racketeering, gambling.  I mean, you know the list.  And 7 it includes an awful lot of trivial stuff.  So now I 8 have removing the attorney general's discretion when she 9 wants to keep the thing here  keep the person here in 10 a whole lot of trivial stuff, if I accept your 11 definition. 12             And if I accept theirs, I don't have the 13 problem I thought I had, which was that people who 14 commit very serious explosive crimes are not in the 15 category "aggravated." 16             So what is the answer to that? 17             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I  18             JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't think of it until 19 I heard his first argument. 20             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I disagree with, I think, 21 both halves of that. 22             And let me start by talking about why I 23 think it remains true, despite the crime of violence 24 provision and other parts of the aggravated felony 25 provision, that Petitioner's approach is radically
Alderson Reporting Company

1 underinclusive.

Official

28

2             First of all, it's important that we're not

3 just talking about arson here.  We're talking about all

4 of the different describedin provisions where there is

5 a Federal jurisdictional element.  And so there are many

6 things that it is clear would never be picked up by

7 other parts of the aggravated felony that 

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  I have the list in front of

9 me, thanks to my law clerk.  And I couldn't find

10 anything on that list which either wouldn't fit within

11 crime of violence or would be so terrible to leave out.

12             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, there are a couple of

13 different examples.  And I also think it's true  and I

14 don't want to leave this on the table  that not all

15 arsons would qualify as crimes of violence.  So I want

16 to get to that as well.

17             But the things that would be left out and

18 that would not be picked up by other parts of the

19 aggravated felony provision under Petitioner's view

20 would be a number of really serious child pornography

21 offenses if they were prosecuted by a State or by a

22 foreign sovereign, including possessing child

23 pornography, transporting child pornography, putting out

24 a notice saying that you want to receive or exchange

25 child pornography.  None of that would be picked up by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 anything else in the provision.

29

2             Petitioner says in his brief that the sexual

3 abuse of a minor, generic offense, would pick that up.

4 But it wouldn't pick up any of those things that I just

5 described, although, it might pick up some kinds of

6 child pornography offenses:  Gun possession offenses,

7 being a felon in possession of a firearm, being a

8 fugitive from justice in possession of a firearm.  A lot

9 of really serious gun possession offenses also, if

10 prosecuted by a State or prosecuted by a foreign

11 sovereign, would not be picked up.  And Petitioner

12 actually doesn't contend otherwise.

13             So it is an underinclusive approach.  And

14 that's true even with respect to arson, because under

15 the crime of violence provision, that has to involve use

16 of force against the person or property of another.  A

17 number of State arson offenses would cover arson against

18 your own property.  And this is a categorical approach.

19 So if a 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't  I don't

21 understand.  Your argument is we have to interpret this

22 thing to be as expansive as possible?

23             MS. GOLDENBERG:  No.  It's 

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, you know, if

25 Congress wanted to cover all those things, it could have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 used the language it used elsewhere, which says, you

30

2 know, except  except for the jurisdictional element.

3 But it  it didn't say that.

4             MS. GOLDENBERG:  It 

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What  what do you do

6 about Federal statute that  that  that makes arson

7 of a Federal building a crime?

8             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, in that case 

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does  does that mean that

10 all state arson statutes are picked up, whether it's of

11 a Federal building or of  of the corner grocery store?

12             MS. GOLDENBERG:  No.  I think you'd have to

13 engage in an analysis at that point about whether that

14 element was a purely jurisdictional element or whether

15 it had some substantive force to it.  That's not an

16 analysis 

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's  that's the key

18 you  you 

19             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think the key is

20 if  if the board were going to undertake that

21 analysis, which it hasn't done with respect to anything

22 besides interstatecommerce jurisdictional elements,

23 which are classic jurisdictional elements.

24             But if the board were going to undertake

25 that analysis, I think it would look to the model penal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 code definition that the Chief Justice pointed to

31

2 earlier.  And that is the distinction between the harm

3 or evil sought to be prevented and the legislature's

4 power, jurisdictional power, to regulate that harm or

5 evil.

6             And in the case that you mentioned, I think

7 that might very well be a substantive element, because

8 Congress could be making a determination that if there

9 is something particularly pernicious, particularly

10 culpable, particularly in need of deterrence about arson

11 with respect to Federal property, which Congress really

12 specially wants to protect.  But I don't think you can

13 say that about the interstatecommerce jurisdictional

14 element, which this Court has recognized 

15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Why  why is that?

16             MS. GOLDENBERG:   is a term of art.

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't  go ahead.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito.

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you.

20             Following up on that,though:  But why isn't

21 that true here, in light of the  the Court's decision

22 in Jones?

23             MS. GOLDENBERG:  The Court's 

24             JUSTICE ALITO:  Didn't the Court's  didn't

25 the Court's decision in Jones interpret the reference to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 interstate commerce to be something more than just a

32

2 jurisdictional hook, but rather a substantive

3 requirement that limited the scope of this particular

4 statute to more severe instances of  of examples of

5 the crime?

6             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't think so, because

7 the analysis in Jones was against the backdrop of

8 constitutionalavoidance principle.  And the Court said

9 there might very well have been constitutional problems

10 with interpreting the statute more broadly.  I think

11 the  the best comparison is between Jones and  and

12 Russell.  And you can see there that the

13 interstatecommerce element is not doing substantive

14 work.  If 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I  I don't know

16 why you say that, if it has to have substantive work,

17 otherwise it wouldn't be in the statute.

18             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It  it is picking a

20 crime that only Congress would prosecute, which is

21 following up on Justice Alito's point, substantive

22 because it's more serious.  It has  we have to protect

23 people who are affected from interstate travel, or that

24 affects interstate travel.  You could  even following

25 the model penal code, you could still call this

Alderson Reporting Company

1 substantive.

Official

33

2             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't think so.  And

3 again, I think the comparison between Jones and Russell

4 makes this point.  In Russell, the Court said that the

5 offense was something that could be prosecuted by the

6 Federal government because it was arson of a rental

7 property which was used in interstate commerce.  In

8 Jones, it was arson against a private nonrental

9 property.  And that was said to fall outside the scope

10 of Section 844(i).

11             But I don't think you can say that there is

12 something particularly pernicious or culpable about

13 arson against a rental property versus arson of a

14 nonrental property.  I think 

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why  why have to subject

16 the Federal courts to  to this  this new distinction

17 between a jurisdictional element that's substantive and

18 one that isn't substantive, just jurisdictional?  Why 

19 why should I do that?  I mean, if it's an element, it's

20 an element.  And if Congress really wants to eliminate

21 the jurisdictional element, it can  it can say so, the

22 way  the way it did in some other statutes.

23             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I think 

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if it doesn't say that,

25 you know, don't bother me.  Isn't  isn't that a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 sensible way to handle this?

34

2             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't think so, Your

3 Honor.  I don't think it's possible to draw a negative

4 inference from those other statutes.  Congress obviously

5 can get at the same meaning using different forms of

6 words in different statutes in the U.S. Code.

7             And what's very important about the statutes

8 the Petitioner has pointed to that expressly say that

9 the jurisdictional element should be taken out is that

10 they don't have an analogue to the penultimate sentence

11 in this case, which shows Congress's intent in the

12 aggravated felony provision, that State offenses and

13 foreign offenses count, along with Federal offenses, as

14 aggravated felonies.

15             And so I think once you got that penultimate

16 sentence in there, it may very well be that Congress no

17 longer feels any need to put in language that's

18 equivalent to the language of those other statutes.  And

19 that 

20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that really,

21 Ms. Goldenberg, the only textual basis for your

22 position?  You know, your brief does a good deal about

23 the difference between "described" and "defined," which

24 the Petitioner has suggested is  is  is not a very

25 good distinction, because the "defined" only refers to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 actual statutory definitions.

35

2             So are you still relying on that?  Are you

3 relying on anything else in the statutory text beyond

4 the penultimate sentence, or is the penultimate sentence

5 really the statutory basis for your argument?

6             MS. GOLDENBERG:  No.  We're certainly still

7 relying on the "describedin" language and the

8 distinction between that language and other language

9 that Congress chose to use elsewhere in the aggravated

10 felony provision.  It's just that we think that it's

11 important that when you look at the meaning of

12 "described in," it be read in light of the penultimate

13 sentence, in light of the purpose of this provision, in

14 light of the irrational patchwork that would be created

15 by Petitioner's view.  So I think all those things

16 inform how you would understand "described in" but with

17 respect to the question of whether "defined in" in this

18 provision was just used to refer to dictionary

19 definitiontype statutory provisions.  I think that that

20 is true.  As a descriptive matter, there are only a

21 couple of "defined in" provisions of the aggravated

22 felony statute, and they do refer to other statutes that

23 say the word X means Y.

24             But that's not true throughout the U.S.

25 Code, which was Petitioner's original submission.  There

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 are lots of places where Congress has used "defined in" 2 to refer to offenses and to mean exactly what follows 3 but nothing else.  And one very telling example is 4 Section 844(n) which actually refers to Section 844(i), 5 the provision at issue in this case, by talking about 6 offenses defined in this chapter. 7             So Congress had at its fingertips language 8 that it could have used to refer to these Federal 9 criminal provisions if all it had meant to do was to 10 say, look, we want you to use exactly what comes after 11 this and nothing else.  And there's actually another 12 distinction as well as the "defined in" language in the 13 statute, and that's in Subsection (p), which is found on 14 4A  page 4A of the appendix to the government's brief. 15 There, Congress uses the words "in violation of," an 16 offense which is in violation of a particular Federal 17 statute. 18             The upshot of Petitioner's position is that 19 any time there's an interstatecommerce jurisdictional 20 element in any of the Federal provisions that are 21 referred to, only a violation of the Federal statute, 22 only a Federal criminal prosecution and conviction will 23 count as an aggravated felony, because no State crime, 24 no foreign crime is ever going to have interstate 25 commerce as an element.

37 1             If that's what Congress had meant, if it had 2 meant to restrict it to violations of that Federal 3 statute, then, again, it had language at its fingertips 4 that it has used elsewhere in this provision that would 5 have allowed it to do that. 6             And there's one other aspect of the 7 statutory text that I'd like to mention, and that's just 8 a particular example of a place where Petitioner's 9 reading doesn't make sense in a  in a particular 10 context, in the statute.  And that's Subsection (j) 11 which is on page 2A of the appendix to our brief, and 12 that's offenses described in several Federal provisions, 13 one of which is RICO.  RICO has in it 14 interstatecommerce elements.  And then at the end of 15 the provision, there is one of the limitations that 16 Congress puts in sometimes, and the limitation is that 17 the offense has to be punishable by more than one year. 18             Again, under Petitioner's view, only actual 19 violations of the Federal  the Federal RICO statute 20 and an actual Federal prosecution and conviction under 21 the Federal RICO statute would ever count under 22 Subsection (j) as an aggravated felony. 23             But if that were true, there would have been 24 no reason for Congress to have included that last clause 25 there because Federal RICO convictions are always

38 1 punishable by more than a year.  It says so right in the 2 RICO statute.  They're punishable by up to 20 years.  So 3 it must be  4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what you 5  say it again. 6             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Okay.  I'll try. 7             So it's Subsection (j). 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Got it. 9             MS. GOLDENBERG:  And it is an offense 10 described in  and I'm just referring to the first 11 Federal statute that's listed there. 12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Can you give 13 me the number again? 14             MS. GOLDENBERG:  It's page 2A of the 15 appendix to the government's brief.  And I should say 16 when this provision went into the aggravated felony 17 statute, it was only RICO and not these other statutes 18 that follow in Subsection (j) that were listed.  So it 19 says an offense described in Section 1962 of Title 18, 20 which is RICO, for which a sentence of oneyear 21 imprisonment or more may be imposed. 22             And what I'm saying is you can always impose 23 a sentence of one year or more as an abstract matter 24 when you have convicted somebody of a Federal RICO 25 offense.  And so it can't be that just because there's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 an interstatecommerce element in the Federal RICO

39

2 statute, that, therefore, State and foreign convictions

3 all drop away and the only time someone is an aggravated

4 felon under (j) is if they have been convicted of a

5 Federal RICO crime.

6             If that were right, then there would have

7 been no need for Congress to include that language at

8 the end.

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.

10             MS. GOLDENBERG:  That's there clearly

11 because Congress wanted to pick up State and foreign

12 versions 

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right, right, right.

14             MS. GOLDENBERG:   of the crime, and to

15 then drop away, as Congress does sometimes, to sort of

16 more minor versions of those crimes where there are

17 different sentencing and penalty schemes in place.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course he's  he's not

19 arguing that  that all  all Federal jurisdictional

20 requirements have to be one of the elements.  He's only

21 saying that where  where the statute itself recites

22 the jurisdictional element.  Does RICO do that?  What

23 does RICO say?

24             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes.  RICO does recite an

25 interstatecommerce element.  It does.

1             JUSTICE BREYER:  The basic point is I

40

2 counted   made an effort to count these.  I accept

3 your argument there are about ten of these sections

4 that  you know, you  you couldn't use that as a

5 limitation.  But if I look at those ten individually, I

6 will discover that I  Congress did want to pick up

7 State crimes there or they don't use exactly

8 jurisdiction language like evade a tax imposed under

9 this title.

10             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yeah.

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  And it isn't really going

12 to be the anomaly I thought it was.  That's your point.

13             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, that's one of my

14 points, certainly.  There are, I think, 17 different

15 places in the aggravated felony provision, if you look

16 at actually each of its little subsections, and some of

17 them have two or three subsections.  And by my count,

18 about nine of them have an interstatecommerce

19 jurisdictional element.  And so it's not that the

20 penultimate sentence would be superfluous in

21 Petitioner's view, but it would start doing work in this

22 very odd way for only about half of the aggravated

23 felony provision, and that would just be a very

24 strange 

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  It wouldn't be strange if

41 1 those were things that covered offenses that it makes 2 sense not to want to put in  3             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Right. 4             JUSTICE BREYER:   to the definition. 5             MS. GOLDENBERG:  And I don't think you  6             JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought that some of them 7 did, but  8             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, no. 9             JUSTICE BREYER:  The tax one, for example, 10 the fraud  tax fraud, but he uses different language. 11             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes.  No, I think as to 12 many of them, as with respect to the arson offense at 13 issue here, it would make sense to pick up State and 14 also particularly foreign crimes.  I don't want foreign 15 crimes to get left out of this discussion because I 16 think it's very important and very important to Congress 17 when dealing with the kinds of people who are going to 18 be covered by the aggravated felony provision that if 19 they had committed a sufficiently serious foreign crime, 20 that that would get picked up.  And, of course, foreign 21 crimes are never going to have an interstatecommerce 22 jurisdictional element in them. 23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you deal with his 24 lack of uniformity argument?  That is, some crimes 25 will  under State law, the same conduct will be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 labeled by some States a felony, other States a

42

2 misdemeanor, and you get a lot of these lessertype

3 offenses swept up into the provision that doesn't allow

4 for cancelation of removal?

5             MS. GOLDENBERG:  That's not a feature of the

6 board's interpretation in this case.  That's just a

7 feature of the aggravated felony provision that it

8 sometimes sweeps in things that the States characterize

9 as misdemeanors.  And that's very wellrecognized both

10 by the board and by the courts of appeals.  This is a

11 Federal term of art, aggravated felony, which is used to

12 show that certain immigration consequences should attach

13 to someone.

14             And so the fact that a State

15 idiosyncratically or for its own reasons attaches a

16 particularly low penalty to something that's set forth

17 here is wellrecognized not to be a reason to keep it

18 out of the aggravated felony provision.

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I believe that

20 Mr. Guadagno's point was that this is  it's a reason

21 why Congress may have used the language that it did,

22 rather than, say, just arson.  Right?  That it wanted 

23 that it understood that there was a wealth of very minor

24 arson crimes out there in the States, that it wanted to

25 exclude those.  And the way it excluded those was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1 essentially by saying, no, it's got to be the Federal 2 offense. 3             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I think that would be, 4 again, a sort of strange roundabout way to exclude them, 5 and to move it back through the crime of violence 6 provision, it would be a lot of work.  What Congress 7 could much more easily have done is just to put a 8 limitation right there in (e)(1) as it did in many other 9 provisions that said you have to have a crime that  10 for which you're imprisoned for at least a year, or a 11 certain value of property has to be affected. 12             And Congress did that, not only when it was 13 describing  I'm sorry, generic aggravated felonies, 14 but also it did it in some of the "describedin" 15 sections like Subsection (j) that I was talking about 16 earlier.  So that, I think, would be the way that 17 Congress would have approached it. 18             At the same time, I don't think there's 19 anything at all strange in thinking that Congress didn't 20 want to exclude even things that are more minor as 21 arsons go on a scale of arsons on the view that arson is 22 a really serious crime.  It is aggravated in every sense 23 of that word. 24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this one  this one 25 wasn't  I mean, his  his crime, he got oneday jail

Official
44 1 time and five years of probation.  So it falls on the 2 lesser side.  Given your argument, is there any way that 3 a person in his situation could get a cancelation of 4 removal? 5             MS. GOLDENBERG:  No. 6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So he's just stuck  7 this is absolute?  Even when it's a oneday jail time, a 8 lesser crime, there's no  you're really locked into no 9 means to obtain cancelation of removal. 10             MS. GOLDENBERG:  That's right that he can't 11 obtain cancelation of removal, and that's consistent 12 with Congress's intent in putting the aggravated felony 13 provision into place, which was to constrain the 14 attorney general's discretion and to make it so that the 15 attorney general was locked into certain conclusions. 16             And that was because Congress thought that 17 the way that the whole cancelation of removal process 18 was working before the aggravated felony provision went 19 into place was it wasn't working well.  Too many people 20 were being allowed to stay, and too many people were 21 having their removal canceled.  And Congress expressed 22 very clearly in the legislative history that it didn't 23 like that, and it wanted to constrain the attorney 24 general's discretion. 25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was just going to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 say, of course, the attorney general may decide not to 2 subject the alien to removal in the first place, right? 3             MS. GOLDENBERG:  That's true, yes. 4 Although, aggravated felony is a ground for removal. 5             But also, I don't want to lose sight of the 6 fact that just because this Petitioner's sentence was 7 one day and five years of probation does not mean that 8 he committed a minor crime of some kind.  We actually 9 don't know what the conduct was.  It's not in the 10 record. 11             JUSTICE BREYER:  But the only thing you've 12 been able to think of, my guess is, that gets around his 13 argument that arson and explosives will be covered by 14 the crime of violence is that:  What if a person sets 15 fire to his own property? 16             Now, when would a person set fire to his own 17 property?  When he wants to commit fraud.  And here we 18 have a provision that puts fraud within it.  And 19 moreover, it has the limitation of $10,000.  So 20 therefore, serious fraud crimes will fall within this 21 other section. 22             So not even the case that you've really 23 brought up is  actually needs this provision to 24 prosecute State explosives crimes, because either 25 they're against other people's property, in which case
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 they fall within crime of violence, or they're against 2 your own property, in which case they are a specie of 3 fraud over $10,000. 4             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I'm not sure that 5 necessarily works under the categorical approach because 6 it would depend what the person was actually prosecuted 7 for in State court, and if they were prosecuted not for 8 fraud, but simply for arson, and it was a provision that 9 said  that included arson against your own property, 10 then I think you wouldn't fall into either one. 11             But there's actually another reason that I 12 didn't get to before why I think some arsons might not 13 be crimes of violence.  And there's actually just some 14 uncertainty around this, but after this Court's decision 15 in Leocal, people are continuing to wrestle with whether 16 recklessness would count as a crime of violence.  I 17 think there are some, at least, forms of recklessness 18 that are picked up by the substantive elements of 19 Section 844.  Malicious arson would include deliberate 20 indifference to the possibility that there is going to 21 be damage, so there might be some slippage there as 22 well.  Although, as I say, I  23             JUSTICE BREYER:  So what do you think about 24 this?  I mean, I  I think I dread the suggestion, but 25 when I got into that, I thought, God, there is no way to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 avoid just doing this section by section and saying,

47

2 what did Congress want, section by section.  And then

3 sometime  you know, and then if we did that section by

4 section, maybe it would be satisfactory to say, you

5 know, let them prove the jurisdictional hook in the 

6 in the deportation proceeding.

7             That gives the attorney general considerably

8 more discretion.  She can do it if she wants; she

9 doesn't have to do it if she doesn't want to.

10             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Although I hesitate to

11 object to a helpful suggestion, I actually think that

12 the answer here is to drop out the jurisdictional

13 provision entirely and not to do that for a couple

14 different reasons.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we 

16             MS. GOLDENBERG:  First of all, I don't think

17 it works for foreign crimes.  So in a foreign crime

18 situation, you can't come in and provide proof that it

19 had an interstate commerce element because there's not

20 really an equivalent to that on the foreign side.

21             And so I just think there is a whole serious

22 set of crimes that Congress wanted to include as to

23 which that approach wouldn't function.

24             It would also really multiply the difficulty

25 of the proceedings and make them much longer and harder.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1             And I do think the language here is a little 2 different here than the language that the Court was 3 looking at in Nijhawan, where this $10,000 limitation 4 was in the aggravated felony provision itself and it was 5 worded in a particular way that the Court seized on. 6             I  I  so I just don't think that 7 analysis necessarily carries over here. 8             But again, I think that all of the various 9 signs that you would use to interpret the statute  10 and  and by the way, four of the courts of appeals 11 that have addressed this have said the statute is 12 unambiguously clear.  It means what the board said it 13 meant.  I think that  that all of those signs are in 14 place and so you should be talking  15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I  can I go back to 16 your  to your argument about Subsection (j)? 17             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes. 18             JUSTICE ALITO:  Are there State RICO 19 offenses for which a maximum  the maximum term of 20 imprisonment is less than a year? 21             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't know the answer to 22 that, but I think there might be  there might be such 23 offenses and there might be foreign offenses like that 24 as well.  And I haven't been able to canvas that whole 25 area, obviously.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             And I still think that's the only

49

2 explanation for that limiting language at the end of 

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are there State or foreign

4 RICO offenses at all?

5             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I  I  I  honestly, I

6 don't know the answer to that, but I think there might

7 well be.

8             JUSTICE ALITO:  There are State  there are

9 State RICO statutes, but RICO is a  is a  is

10 regarded as a very serious crime.  It seems strange to

11 have a  a RICO misdemeanor.  I've never heard of such

12 a thing.

13             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I mean, I seized on the

14 RICO statute, but actually the very next provision in J,

15 which is Section 1084, the same analysis would apply.

16 Section 1084 is a statute that has an interstate

17 commerce element in it.  It has to do with gambling and

18 transmitting information for gambling interstate

19 commerce.  And it is punishable by up to two years when

20 it is prosecuted federally and there is a Federal

21 conviction.

22             So the same analysis would work there as

23 well, and that's something where I think it's pretty

24 clear that there would be State analogues to the

25 substantive elements of that crime.  There would be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1 foreign analogues to the substantive elements of that 2 crime as well. 3             I did want to pick up on one other thing 4 that Petitioner said in his presentation, which is, why 5 didn't Congress just use the generic definition of arson 6 here? 7             And I think there are a number of reasons 8 for that. 9             For one thing, I think it would have been 10 underinclusive because it wouldn't have included the 11 explosive offenses that are set forth in the Federal 12 statute very likely.  Or it's possible that courts would 13 have reached that conclusion. 14             For another, I think it would have 15 entailed  and I know this Court is familiar with the 16 process  it would have entailed coming up with what 17 the elements of that generic offense are, and that can 18 be difficult.  I think it could be especially difficult 19 in the arson context where there are states that are 20 sort of all over the place and that has moved away from 21 the classic common law definition of burning of a 22 dwelling place. 23             And so I think there are very good reasons 24 that Congress had when it found a Federal criminal 25 provision that had the substantive elements that it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 wanted to simply refer to that Federal criminal

51

2 provision using the looser language of described in, in

3 light of the penultimate sentence, and that's something

4 that would 

5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I can't square this with

6 the categorical approach.  I  I  you know, we've

7 been very clear.  The categorical approach says, every

8 element of a crime that has to be proven to a jury has

9 to be included in the State offense.  But now you're

10 saying it's every categorical element that's not

11 jurisdictional.

12             Where do you get that from?

13             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think the thrust of

14 the categorical approach is that you don't look at the

15 particular conduct that the person engaged in.  You look

16 at the elements of the crime that they were convicted

17 of.  And then you compare it to something that Federal

18 law tells you to compare it to.

19             And I think that is a question of statutory

20 interpretation, what it is that you're supposed to be

21 comparing it to, that the Federal law is telling you is

22 the proper comparator.

23             And here, that's the question we're

24 answering.  I mean, that's the question about what

25 described in means.  About what it means in light of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 penultimate sentence.

52

2             I don't think there's anything in this

3 Court's categoricalapproach cases that would preclude

4 the interpretation that we're putting forth here today.

5 I just think it hasn't a risen in exactly this way

6 before.

7             But again, this  the important thing about

8 the categorical approach is that you don't look at the

9 Petitioner's particular conduct here.  As I say, it's

10 not even in the record what his conduct is.  All that we

11 know is that he committed a felony under New York State

12 law that was punishable, my understanding is, by up to

13 seven years in prison.

14             And that's the only information we have.

15             And then we have to look at the elements of

16 the New York statute that he was convicted under and

17 compare them to the offense described in Section 844(i).

18             To the extent that the Court thought there

19 were ambiguities, we would ask for deference to the

20 board here.  But we don't think there is ambiguity.  We

21 think that, as the courts of appeals have said, that

22 there is one reading of the statute to which all signs

23 point, and that's the reading the Court should adopt.

24             If there are no further questions 

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the board's original

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 decision was the other way, and it wasn't till the

53

2 circuit came  came out, and then the board went in

3 line with the circuit so that the board read it 

4 doesn't that dilute the strength of the board's current

5 position, that it was not its original position?

6             MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't think so.  I mean,

7 it is true that the board changed positions, but it knew

8 that it was doing it and it gave reasons for doing it

9 and it gave a lot of reasons in its ultimate decision in

10 2002 that are not reflected in the original decision

11 that the board doesn't seem to have considered in the

12 original decision.

13             So I just think it's the  the

14 VasquezMuniz decision from 2002 that has an analysis

15 very similar to the analysis of the courts of appeals

16 that have found the statute unambiguous, have walked

17 through here in looking at, not only at the describedin

18 language itself, but at all the other signs about what

19 the statute means.  And I don't think it should be a

20 negative that the board revisited it and came to the

21 correct conclusion.

19             In provision (K) of the aggravated felony

20 provision, it  it discusses, first generically,

21 managing a prostitution business, and then it refers to

22 Title XVIII offenses regarding transportation of 

23 of  of prostitutes.

24             Congress could have said arson, and then 

25 and then referred to Title XVIII U.S.C. 844(i).  It

55 1 could have combined both generic arson and a reference 2 to  to  to explosive devices. 3             With regards to the comment about not all 4 State arson offenses being crimes of violence because 5 some would involve personal property, that issue has 6 been resolved by the Board of Immigration Appeals since 7 1998.  Our brief  our reply brief mentions a case from 8 the board called Matter of Palacios where the board held 9 that damaging your own property would  would 10 constitute  burning your own property through arson 11 would constitute a  a  a crime of violence. 12             With regards to the comments about  about 13 "defined in" with regards to the INA, "defined in" is 14 used consistently to  to refer to a definition, and 15 the congressional drafting manuals all indicate that 16 "defined in" should  should be referring to  to a 17 definition. 18             And my final point is that what we're 19 seeking here is  is cancelation of removal, 20 discretionary relief, and that  that Congress would 21 not have wanted to deprive individuals who have been 22 convicted of minor offenses or less serious offenses of 23 such discretionary relief and would want them to have a 24 chance to demonstrate  25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do you do with

1 if we rule your way, that it won't address the child

2 pornography possession laws or that it won't address

3 some of the explosion laws?

4             MR. GUADAGNO:  As I said before, there 

5 there is overlap and  and that they're very likely 

6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I want to know where

7 the overlap is for the child pornography.

8             MR. GUADAGNO:  There  there is  on that

9 one, I don't think there is  there is any question

10 about that because there is a Second Circuit case  I

11 believe it's called Ouch v. Holder, where  where the

12 government did not pursue the child pornography under 

13 under the provision my friend is referring to.  It was

14 pursued under  under sexual abuse of the minor.  So 

15 so that  that is  there is at least one case out

16 there where  where that is the way that the government

17 pursued one  one of these cases.

18             If there are no further questions, thank

19 you.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,

21 Mr. Guadagno, counsel.

22             The case is submitted.

23             (Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in the

24 aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
