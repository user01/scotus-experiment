1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Whorton versus Bockting. 5 General Chanos. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. CHANOS 7 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 8 MR. CHANOS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 9 it please the Court: 10 Crawford v. Washington should not apply 11 retroactively to cases on collateral review because it 12 fails to meet the exacting standards for retroactivity 13 established by this Court in Teague versus Lane. In 14 addition, respondent is not entitled to relief under 15 AEDPA. Teague held that new rules of criminal generally 16 should not apply to cases on collateral review unless 17 they fall within one of two narrow exceptions. The 18 second exception, at issue here, is for those new 19 watershed rules of criminal procedure without which the 20 likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously 21 diminished, rules that alter our understanding of the 22 bedrock procedural elements essential to a fair 23 proceeding. Crawford is not a watershed rule of 24 criminal procedure. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you give an

1 example, General Chanos, of one that is other than 2 Gideon? Is there any other one, or -3 MR. CHANOS: The only example that this 4 Court has pointed to in its 25 years of retroactivity 5 jurisprudence is Gideon versus Wainwright. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And none other occurs to 7 you? 8 MR. CHANOS: None other occurs to me at this 9 time. None of the cases that this Court has ruled are 10 not retroactive would I find to be retroactive or 11 watershed, and I certainly don't find Crawford to be 12 watershed. Crawford is not watershed because it is not 13 a rule without which the likelihood of an accurate 14 conviction is seriously diminished and it is not a rule 15 which altered our understanding of the bedrock 16 procedural elements essential to a fair proceeding. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it from your 18 presentation you think we do have to go through the 19 Teague analysis. We can't just rely on 2254(d)(1)? 20 MR. CHANOS: No, Chief Justice Roberts. I 21 believe that you could go straight to 2254(d)(1) and bar 22 relief under 2254(d)(1). 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, what do 24 you do about 2254(e)(1), or I guess (e)(2), which seems 25 to suggest at different rule if a case is made
4

1 retroactive? 2 MR. CHANOS: Well, 2254(e)(2) provides a 3 cause and prejudice opportunity in the event that the 4 state court denies relief on a procedural basis rather 5 than a substantive basis and the petitioner can show 6 cause and prejudice under 2254(e)(2)(A). The Federal 7 court could then look at the petitioner's claim because 8 no merits determination had been made by the state court 9 and, finding the cause and prejudice elements under 10 2254(e)(2), the Federal court would not be precluded 11 from making a merits determination since the -- and 12 conceivably applying a rule that had been made 13 retroactive active under Teague -- because the state 14 court had not made a substantive merits determination. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, my point was 16 that looking at (d)(1), it says is the decision contrary 17 to established law. And I would have thought that if 18 it's a new decision it's clearly not contrary to 19 established law. 20 MR. CHANOS: Correct. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But on the other 22 hand, you look at (e)(2) and it says here's what you do 23 if you're applying a new decision that's that been made 24 retroactive. So I would have thought that meant you 25 can't say simply because it's a new decision it won't

1 apply. 2 MR. CHANOS: Our reading of 2254(d)(1) is 3 that Congress intended to have the federal courts give 4 the state courts deference to the extent that the state 5 courts made a substantive determination. If the state 6 courts made no substantive determination, there's no 7 requirement for deference by the Federal courts, which 8 under 2254(e)(2)(A)(i) the Federal court conceivably 9 find that there was cause and prejudice under 10 2254(2)(a)(i) under the standards enumerated in those 11 subparagraphs (a) and (b) and could then make a merits 12 determination. 13 There would be nothing that would preclude 14 the Federal court from making a merits determination so 15 long as the state court had not already made a merits 16 determination. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose the state 18 has, which is going straight to AEDPA. Does that mean 19 that Teague is out entirely, even the first category, 20 that is a decision, a substantive decision that would 21 mean that what defendant did was not a crime? 22 MR. CHANOS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. It 23 would mean under -- under a plain meaning reading of 24 2254(d)(1), if the state court made a determination on 25 the merits, it would bar subsequent Federal review
6

1 whether it was a substantive, a substantive claim or a 2 procedural claim. However, in Atkins v. Kentucky there 3 would be nothing that would prevent the petitioner from 4 going back to the state court and arguing cause and 5 prejudice, and then if the state court were to make a 6 procedural determination on the second petition that 7 was -- that were to deny the petitioner his claim, he 8 could take that to the Federal court. The Federal court 9 could then look at that because it was only a procedural 10 determination by the state court on the second habeas 11 claim and the Federal court at that point could look 12 back at the substantive rule as established law because 13 on the second claim they have the right, if he's only 14 denied a procedure -- on a procedural basis, there's 15 nothing that would preclude the Federal court on his 16 second claim from looking back at what would then be 17 established law. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is the source of the 19 rule in Teague? Could Congress overturn the rule in 20 Teague if it wanted to and say that nothing is 21 retroactive or that everything is retroactive? 22 MR. CHANOS: My understanding is that the 23 rule in Teague is -- the source is not the U.S. 24 Constitution. It's a judicially created rule that began 25 with Linkletter and developed into Teague and its
7

1 progeny. And yes, I believe Congress could pass 2 2254(d)(1) and alter the habeas procedures, as they have 3 in enacting 2254(d)(1). 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Habeas is an equitable -5 MR. CHANOS: I'm sorry? 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Habeas is equitable relief 7 and the Court has a lot of discretion in identifying the 8 boundaries of equitable relief, doesn't it? 9 MR. CHANOS: Yes, Justice Scalia. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that's how we got 11 to Teague. 12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question 13 as to the basic issue of whether you should be relying 14 on Teague or the statute. If you're relying just on the 15 statute, how would it apply to a case which was correct 16 under established law at the time that the state court 17 made its ruling, but before the case reached the 18 appellate court, in which there was a change in our 19 interpretation? What if this case -- if Crawford had 20 been decided while the case was on appeal? 21 MR. CHANOS: While under the Court's 22 retroactivity jurisprudence Griffith would control, 23 under 2254 it would not. 22(d)(1) would control. 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it really makes a 25 difference whether we rely on Teague or whether we rely
8

1 on the statute if we disagree with you? 2 MR. CHANOS: It make difference. It makes a 3 difference. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume there would 5 be a Rule 60(b) motion or the equivalent of it in state 6 court. 7 MR. CHANOS: Yes. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: If indeed our law had 9 changed; don't you think? 10 MR. CHANOS: Absolutely. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's inconceivable 12 that the problem wouldn't be solved in some fashion by 13 the state court that rendered the decision. 14 MR. CHANOS: I believe that the petitioner 15 would be able to make a subsequent habeas petition at 16 the state court level and if they were somehow denied 17 relief on a procedural basis, there would be nothing 18 that would preclude the Federal court from granting them 19 relief thereafter. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a odd position to 21 take, to proliferate proceedings that way. I mean, I 22 thought your argument, AEDPA argument, was: Too bad, 23 the Federal court is out of it, but the state court is 24 most likely, recognizing that this Court has said what 25 this man did wasn't a crime, to grant him relief. But
9

1 if you're making this two-step and saying, but somehow 2 we can change the substantive proceeding into a 3 procedural proceeding, that seems to me odd, to 4 proliferate proceedings that way. 5 MR. CHANOS: Justice Ginsburg, what we're 6 saying is that Congress in enacting 2254(d)(1) was 7 stating that the Federal courts should give deference to 8 the state court decision so long as it is a merits 9 decision and so long as it complies with existing 10 clearly established law and is not unreasonable. 11 And if that occurs, then Congress under 12 2254(d)(1) was saying give state courts deference under 13 those circumstances. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying not just 15 "clearly"; "then clearly established law." 16 MR. CHANOS: That's exactly. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is, at the time of the 18 state court decision. *END STENO 19 MR. CHANOS: Exactly, absolutely, at the 20 time of the state court decision. In fact, if you look 21 at the language of 2254(d)(1) it says "resulted in a 22 decision that was contrary to or an unreasonable 23 application of clearly established Federal law. It 24 doesn't say "is contrary to clearly established law." 25 It says "was contrary to."

1 2 JUSTICE STEVENS: The word was is somewhat 3 ambiguous. It could either mean at the time of the 4 trial court's decision or at the time of the final 5 judgment on appeal. 6 MR. CHANOS: Well, in either case, it is 7 referring to the -8 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know you win under 9 either view, but -10 MR. CHANOS: Yes, exactly. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- it could mean either of 12 those two things. 13 MR. CHANOS: Our, our position would be that 14 it would be up to when the decision became final. 15 Whatever the law was up to the time that the decision, 16 the state court decision became final, that is what was 17 clearly established law. 18 I'll continue with our Teague analysis 19 because we believe that the claim is barred under either 20 analysis. The -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Crawford did use the term 22 bedrock? 23 MR. CHANOS: Yes. Yes. And what 24 Crawford -- what we believe Crawford was saying -- well, 25 Crawford said that the Sixth Amendment right to
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 confrontation is bedrock. It didn't say that that 2 decision altered our understanding of the bedrock 3 procedural elements essential to a fair trial. That is 4 the standard. Not whether or not the Sixth Amendment is 5 bedrock. 6 In fact, if you look at the case of Gideon 7 versus Wainwright and Betts versus Brady, in Betts 8 versus Brady this Court had held the Sixth Amendment 9 right to counsel was not applicable to the states 10 through the 14th Amendment. Gideon overruled Betts 11 versus Brady and said that the Sixth Amendment right to 12 counsel was applicable to the states under the 14th 13 Amendment. 14 That alters our understanding of the bedrock 15 procedural elements that are essential to a fair trial. 16 In one case, we're saying rights of counsel is not one 17 of those bedrock procedural elements. Is not, 18 therefore, applicable to the states under the 14th 19 amendment, Betts versus Brady. In the next case we're 20 saying right to counsel is it implicit in the 21 Constitution. It is an essential to the fairness of a 22 proceeding, and it is therefore applicable to the states 23 under the 14th Amendment. 24 That truly alters our understanding of the 25 bedrock procedural elements that are essential to a fair
12

1 trial. 2 In contrast, when you look at Crawford 3 vis-a-vis Ohio versus Roberts, the -- there's a real 4 distinction there. In both cases, we know that the 5 right to confrontation is essential and Federal and one 6 of those bedrock elements that are essential to a fair 7 proceeding. Therefore Crawford doesn't alter our 8 understanding of what elements are or are not essential 9 to -- bedrock elements essential to a fair proceeding. 10 Instead it modifies the contours -11 JUSTICE STEVENS: You make the same analysis 12 if you say the right is not necessarily the right of 13 confrontation but the narrower right of 14 cross-examination. 15 MR. CHANOS: Would I make the same analysis? 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because that is central to 17 Crawford. 18 MR. CHANOS: Yes. Yes. Crawford doesn't 19 tell us that the rights to confrontation or the right of 20 cross-examination is a new right as Gideon tells us. 21 Instead Crawford tells us -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there is a new 23 emphasis on cross-examination. 24 MR. CHANOS: It alters, it modifies the 25 manner in which we implement that right. Under Ohio
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 versus Roberts there was plenty of cross-examination 2 that was occurring. The standard under Ohio versus 3 Roberts was unavailability and inadequate indicia of 4 reliability. There was a reliability screen in place, 5 and it was clear under Ohio versus Roberts that the 6 right to confrontation was an essential bedrock right, 7 essential to a fair trial. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. But you know, how 9 you play the game depends upon at what level of 10 generality you describe the right. And I agree with you 11 if you describe the right as the right to 12 cross-examination, that -- that was -- reinstituted by 13 Crawford, which said that the confrontation right is a 14 right to confrontation -- to cross-examination, which 15 didn't exist before. I mean, you could dispense with 16 that right of cross-examination if there were indicia of 17 reliability. 18 MR. CHANOS: Well, there were -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that you can 20 so -- in such a facile fashion decide what is a bedrock 21 principle. Frankly, I don't know any formula that 22 would -- that would describe it. I really think it is 23 a -- you know it when you see it. 24 MR. CHANOS: Well, Justice Scalia -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is like obscenity.
14

1 (laughter.) 2 MR. CHANOS: I understand. The other point 3 that -4 JUSTICE SOUTER: That gets, if you follow 5 Justice Scalia's argument, that gets you to, I think to 6 the argument you have made. And that is all right, we 7 have got to look at it pragmatically. I mean, what are 8 the consequences of following a reliability model rather 9 than a cross-examination model? And your argument is 10 consequences that are not necessarily more favorable to 11 defendants, in fact -- or more productive of ultimately 12 reliable determinations, in fact. And that I take it is 13 your basic point. 14 So I think you've answered what for all of 15 us is a problem. And that is we don't have a clear 16 analytical definition of bedrock; but if we look to 17 consequences, you have got an argument. Your friends 18 don't think it is a good one, but that's your point. 19 MR. CHANOS: The other point is that there's 20 a second component to watershed which is it must be a 21 rule without which the accuracy of a proceeding is 22 seriously diminished. There was cross-examination under 23 Ohio versus Roberts. There -- in Crawford, the language 24 of Crawford isn't a sweeping indictment of -- of 25 Roberts.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there wasn't 2 cross-examination by defense counsel. 3 MR. CHANOS: I'm sorry? 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case there wasn't 5 cross-examination by defense counsel. Or am I 6 incorrect? 7 MR. CHANOS: There was cross-examination of 8 the mother, there was cross-examination of the police 9 detective -- there was cross-examination of -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, oh. No, I mean of the 11 witness. 12 MR. CHANOS: Not of Autumn -- not of Autumn 13 Bockting. But the important point that I want to make 14 before I reserve the balance of my time is that the 15 question isn't simply, is Crawford accuracy-enhancing? 16 The question is is it a rule without which the accuracy 17 of a proceeding is seriously diminished. In other words 18 must all -19 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- accuracy-enhancing then? 20 MR. CHANOS: I'm sorry? 21 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's a question about how 22 much more accuracy-enhancing, if at all? 23 MR. CHANOS: That, and it is really an 24 analysis of Roberts. Is, is that judicial determination 25 of reliability under adequate indicia of reliability, so
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 fundamentally flawed that all of the decisions that 2 were, that were arrived at pursuant to its authority 3 must be undone, and new trials must occur with respect 4 to those decisions because it is so fundamentally 5 flawed. And our point is that it is not. It does not 6 rise to that level of inadequacy and Crawford is 7 therefore not a rule without which the accuracy of a 8 proceeding is seriously diminished. 9 Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the balance 10 of my time? 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you General 12 Chanos. 13 Mr. Gornstein, we will hear now from you. 14 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN, ON BEHALF OF 15 THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING 16 PETITIONER 17 MR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 18 it please the Court. 19 Crawford does not satisfy either of the two 20 requirements for a retroactive watershed rule. The 21 application of Roberts rather than Crawford did not so 22 seriously diminish the likelihood of accurate 23 convictions as to require the wholesale reopening of 24 convictions that were final before Crawford was decided, 25 with all the societial costs that entails.
17

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Since you barely 2 cite AEDPA, I think you assume we need to reach the 3 Teague question before the AEDPA question. 4 MR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, we do not 5 have an interest in the AEDPA question because it does 6 not apply to Federal convictions, the 2254(d)(1), and 7 there is no Federal conviction analog to 2254(d)(1), so 8 we are not telling you that you should or should not 9 reach it. We just don't have an interest in that 10 question. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is law that is 12 applied in Federal court, though. I assume you have an 13 interest in that. 14 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, we have a general 15 interest in the way law is applied in Federal court but 16 we do not ordinarily opine on issues just on that basis 17 and we haven't in the past opined on AEDPA issues unless 18 they have some Federal analog carryover effect. And we 19 did not here. 20 Now with respect to the reliability prong of 21 the Teague analysis, there are three reasons that the 22 Roberts rule did not so seriously diminish the 23 likelihood of accurate convictions as to call for 24 retroactive application of Crawford. 25 The first is that Roberts had a built-in
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 reliability screen. Hearsay could not be admitted under 2 Roberts unless a determination was made that there were 3 particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. 4 The second reason that Roberts did not 5 seriously diminish the likelihood of accurate 6 convictions is that there were other procedural 7 components that operated in tandem with Roberts to 8 promote accuracy. They included the right to 9 cross-examine the witness through whom an hearsay 10 statement was introduced, the right to introduce your 11 own evidence to challenge the reliability of the hearsay 12 statement. Defense counsel could point out to the jury 13 all the weaknesses in the hearsay statement and the 14 defendant could count on the common sense of the jury to 15 weigh the reliability of the hearsay statement in light 16 of all the evidence in the case. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Can't you make that argument 18 about any, about cross-examination in general? It is 19 debatable whether -- how good cross-examination is in 20 determining the truthfulness of a witness's testimony. 21 Now, our Constitution decides the issue one way, but any 22 infringement of cross-examination could be susceptible 23 to the same argument that you are making. 24 MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. And I don't think that 25 this is a self-sufficient argument for that reason. It
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is just one component of the argument about why there 2 was reliability. The fact that there was a Roberts 3 screen on reliability is an additional factor that 4 distinguishes my example from what you said. 5 And the fact is that there was a right to 6 cross-examine live witnesses here. So there was a right 7 to cross-examine the police officer through whom this 8 hearsay statement was made. It is not a case where 9 there was an across-the-board denial of any 10 cross-examination. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well I guess you're asking 12 us to say Crawford, get one, take one, it is really not 13 that important. If that's so, I suppose we shouldn't 14 have overruled Roberts. 15 MR. GORNSTEIN: No, I think Crawford that is 16 an important decision. But if you made retroactive 17 every one of your important decisions, you would be 18 reversing the rule of Teague. What Teague says that is 19 there is not -- that the purposes of habeas corpus are 20 largely exhausted once somebody has received a trial in 21 accordance with then existing law. 22 Because of the importance of finality to the 23 system -- and there are only going to be two very -24 there's only a very narrow window for watershed rules, 25 of rules that, the accuracy of proceedings beforehand
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 are so seriously diminished that there is an 2 unacceptably large risk that systematically, innocent 3 people were being convicted, and that this is a rule 4 that approaches Gideon in its fundamental and sweeping 5 importance. Those are the only circumstances in which 6 the Court is going to go back on finality. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many times have we 8 dealt with a quote, "new rule," with the argument made 9 that it was watershed and therefore should be 10 retroactive? This is not the first time. 11 MR. GORNSTEIN: No, I think that there have 12 been -- I don't know the exact number, but maybe 11 or 13 12, about half of which are ones, are proposed new rules 14 and half of which are ones where the rule was already 15 established previously and the question was whether it 16 was going to be made retroactive. And I cited in the 17 brief there are three or four death penalty cases where 18 the Court had already established before each one of 19 them there was a right not to be -- the death penalty to 20 be arbitrarily imposed. And in each case there was a 21 new rule that built on that basic rule in an important 22 way; but in each case, the Court said it was not the 23 kind of rule that was going to be applied retroactively. 24 And so, too, here. 25 The third reason I wanted to give about why
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there was not a serious diminishment in accuracy that is 2 in at least one respect, the Roberts rule actually 3 promotes more accuracy than the Crawford rule, and 4 that's with respect to non-testimonial hearsay. In the 5 case of non-testimonial hearsay, under Roberts, that 6 could come in only if determination had been made there 7 were particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. 8 Whereas under the Crawford rule, that kind of 9 non-testimonial hearsay comes in without any reliability 10 check under the Constitution at all. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not this case. 12 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well there was actually in 13 this case the mother's testimony about what the daughter 14 said to her. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about the 16 daughter's testimony. 17 MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. The daughter's 18 testimony about what she said to the mother illustrates 19 the difference, because that came in through the mother. 20 It only came in because there was a particularized 21 guarantees of trustworthiness to that statement; whereas 22 under Crawford in future trials, statements to the 23 mother -- which are not testimonial -- they will come in 24 through the mother without any screen for reliability 25 under the Constitution at all. So in that respect, the
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 defendant here got more by virtue of the Roberts rule 2 than by -- than he would have had by virtue of the 3 Crawford rule. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the case in Federal 5 courts, too? 6 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, it is a matter of 7 interpreting -- what protection is left is only going to 8 be by virtue of the residual hearsay rule. So there 9 will have to be some determination made about whether 10 there are sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it is conceivable 12 that Federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to 13 require precisely that anyway. 14 MR. GORNSTEIN: But Justice Scalia -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: In which case you shouldn't 16 be making this argument because it applies only to state 17 courts. 18 MR. GORNSTEIN: No. I think it applies 19 equally to Federal courts because it is free to the 20 Federal court system to devise a rule that would allow a 21 looser standard of entry than the Roberts standards, and 22 if it did, that would be constitutional. So there is an 23 interest in that kind of argument in the Federal system. 24 I wanted to move on to the bedrock aspect of 25 the inquiry, which is a separate second inquiry that had
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 threshold that has to be crossed if you are going to 2 find something to be watershed, and the only rule that 3 the Court has found to be bedrock is Gideon. And this 4 rule, Carawford does not approach Gideon in its 5 fundamental and sweeping importance, and there are a 6 couple of reasons for that. 7 First, the right to counsel pervasively 8 affected all aspects of the criminal trial whereas this 9 focuses on one limited -- the admissibility of one 10 limited category of evidence, testimonial hearsay, and 11 adopts a somewhat new rule for that than had existed 12 before. 13 The second thing is that under, the right to 14 counsel is deemed so essential to a fair trial that 15 depriving someone of that right can never be discounted 16 as harmless error, whereas Crawford errors can be 17 harmless. There are a significant number of cases where 18 they are found to be harmless. So you cannot say that a 19 violation of the Crawford rule always and necessarily 20 results in an unfair trial, whereas you can say that 21 about the right to counsel. 22 Finally, the Gideon rule established for the 23 first time a right to free counsel in all felony 24 criminal trials. Before Crawford was established, there 25 was a right to cross-examine. It simply was a different
24
Alderson Reporting Company

1 right. You had a right to cross-examine the live 2 witnesses and you had a right to screen out 3 uncross-examined statements unless they met the 4 reliability standard of Roberts. And the change that 5 was made was one in which the Roberts rule was thrown 6 out, and you can no longer get in uncross-examined 7 statements with a determination of reliability. 8 But that is a modification or an incremental 9 change in an existing right that previously existed to 10 cross-examine, and instead -- unlike the Gideon rule, 11 which established the right to counsel for the first 12 time. 13 If the Court has nothing further. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 15 Mr. Gornstein. 16 Ms. Forsman? 17 ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCES A. FORSMAN 18 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 19 MS. FORSMAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chief 20 Justice. Members of the Court: 21 This man was sentenced to life in prison 22 based upon accusations that have never been tested by 23 the only constitutionally reliable test that is now 24 acceptable in this Court. There is no question that the 25 statements that were admitted through the police officer

1 were testimonial. There is no question that if 2 Mr. Bockting were tried today, that those statements 3 would not have come in. 4 The government has argued that the 5 reliability screen, so-called, that came from Roberts 6 was sufficient, and it was only an incremental change 7 when the Crawford decision was decided. The fact of the 8 matter is that this Court found that the reliability 9 screen that the government has discussed was 10 fundamentally flawed. 11 And in this case, comparing the right to 12 counsel to the right to cross-examination is easy. It 13 is easy because it would not have mattered how many 14 lawyers Mr. Bockting had. It would not have mattered if 15 he had the finest lawyers in the country. It would not 16 have mattered if he was Duke Power Company and had every 17 lawyer at the highest hourly rate representing him. If 18 he was unable to cross-examine his accuser, just as in 19 Crawford -- in Crawford, there was even an audiotape of 20 what the wife said. There was an audiotape. There was 21 a police officer who listened to what she said. And 22 this Court found that wasn't good enough. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't say in 24 Crawford, I don't think we said in Crawford -- I ought 25 to know, I suppose.

1 (Laughter.) 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the new rule 3 produced greater accuracy. We said that it was the view 4 of the framers of the Constitution that 5 cross-examination, confrontation in that sense, was 6 necessary for greater accuracy. 7 Now in our evaluation of what constitutes a 8 landmark decision, are we bound to the framers' view of 9 things? I mean, you know, maybe -- I'm not sure that if 10 you apply a proper interpretation of indicia of 11 reliability under Roberts, I'm really not sure whether 12 it wouldn't be more accurate than confrontation, but 13 that wouldn't matter to me, because confrontation is 14 what the Constitution required and what the framers 15 thought were necessary. 16 Am I bound, for purposes of the rule we're 17 arguing about here, to what the framers think? 18 MS. FORSMAN: No, Your Honor, you are not 19 bound to what the framers think. However, I think that 20 you went far beyond simply saying that this was like 21 quartering soldiers in discussing the confrontation 22 clause and the right to confrontation. The opinion goes 23 into at length why the Roberts rule was so fundamentally 24 flawed. You talked about the kinds of decisions that 25 were produced, although this Court said that this Court
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 had pretty much tacked to the same direction as the 2 framers' view. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that discussion of 4 the, you know, the contrary decisions that had been 5 produced under Roberts was just for the purpose of 6 justifying the overruling of a case that -- you know -7 that was not that old. It hadn't worked out as well as 8 we maybe expected it would. But I don't think it was 9 for the purpose of showing that it always produces 10 unreliable results. 11 MS. FORSMAN: And I don't think that our 12 burden would to be show that it always produces 13 unreliable results. I think that this Court has clearly 14 taken the position that the only constitutional 15 reliability is the right to cross-examination. However, 16 throughout your retroactivity jurisprudence, you have 17 been able to distinguish easily between issues such as 18 the exclusionary rule, the right to a cross-section of 19 the community on a jury, and the right to 20 cross-examination. I would point out to you, the 21 decisions that made Bruton, for instance, retroactive, 22 because the right to cross-examination went so directly 23 to the integrity of the fact-finding process. 24 I think that one of the major difficulties 25 in the argument being taken by the State --
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's in an instruction, 2 like Toomey versus Ohio. The judge is corrupt. It is 3 just structural. You can't say that about Crawford, or 4 can you? 5 MS. FORSMAN: I don't mean to say, Your 6 Honor, that it is structural. I think the issue of 7 whether something is structural error or harmless error 8 has to do with whether or not it is measurable, not 9 whether it's bedrock, not whether it's watershed, not 10 whether it leads to better accuracy. 11 We know that, because in Teague, although 12 Gideon was the only case explicitly referenced, there 13 was also three other examples mentioned in Teague. 14 There was a trial tainted by mob violence. There was a 15 trial flawed because of the intentional introduction of 16 perjured testimony. And there was a trial flawed by the 17 introduction of testimony with regard to a coerced 18 confession. 19 We know that two out of those three examples 20 are actually subject to harmless error analysis. So 21 this Court has never tied the issue of the elements of 22 Teague or even the elements of the pre-Teague 23 jurisprudence to the issue of whether something is 24 structural or harmless. It is the issue, as it was in 25 the more recent decision of Gonzalez-Lopez, of the right
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to choice of counsel decision. They are what the Court 2 looked to to determine the issue was, is it harmless, is 3 it quantifiable. And in this case, courts are 4 accustomed, appellate courts are accustomed to looking 5 at the introduction of this kind of evidence and 6 determining whether or not it is harmless. 7 The State has not taken a position before 8 this Court that the Ninth Circuit was erroneous in 9 determining that this evidence was prejudicial, and 10 therefore affected the outcome. 11 So the issue of accuracy as defined by the 12 State and by the government, the problem with that 13 argument and the easiest way to see the problem in that 14 argument is if you look to Gideon. Certainly we 15 wouldn't argue that the insertion of counsel into a case 16 may not result in what the State is defining as a more 17 accurate result. The insertion of counsel into a case 18 may well cause the exclusion of evidence. In fact, in 19 many instances that is exactly what counsel does. 20 So their definition of accuracy if applied 21 to the Gideon case would mean that Gideon would flunk 22 that definition, and wouldn't be the case that has been 23 so repeatedly referenced by this Court as an example of 24 the kind of case that should be made retroactive. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Forsman, what about
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the cases we're had so far on this second Teague 2 category? As far as I know -- well, we haven't found 3 anything to be retroactive on collateral review so far, 4 so this would be the first time. 5 MS. FORSMAN: It would be, Your Honor, and 6 it is appropriate that this be the first time. As I 7 previously referenced, those cases fell -- there are 12 8 of them, by the way. There were 12 decisions post 9 Teague applying the Teague analysis in which this Court 10 did not find retroactivity. The Solicitor General is 11 correct. Some of those were cases in which on 12 collateral review, the petitioner was seeking to 13 actually create a new rule and apply it retroactively. 14 But if we look to cases such as the 15 retroactivity application of Batson, for instance, what 16 this Court has found is that the Batson rule, the 17 cross-section of the community on a jury, that the 18 purpose of that rule was not created for the purpose of 19 protecting against unjust convictions or ensuring the 20 integrity of the fact-finding process. That was not the 21 purpose of the Batson rule, this Court found that it 22 wasn't the purpose of the Batson rule, and that 23 therefore, it would not fall under the Teague exception. 24 That is not so when you talk about the 25 purpose of the cross-examination rule.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the decision 2 that said Ring v. Arizona was not retroactive on 3 collateral? 4 MS. FORSMAN: Again, in Schriro versus 5 Summerlin, the issue there was an issue with regard to 6 ultimate accuracy of a jury versus a judge. Again, this 7 Court found that the evidence was -- the evidence was 8 equivocal with regard to whether or not a judge findings 9 or jury findings were more accurate. 10 Now you might say, well, that sounds a 11 little bit like Roberts. The problem with that is that 12 it isn't like Roberts, because under Roberts, the 13 cross-examination right, which is something that we held 14 so dear and connected so directly to the right to 15 counsel, having counsel without the right to 16 cross-examination, isn't much of a right. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem with your 18 case -- maybe it's our problem because it was our 19 rule -- is that we're asked to adopt an across-the-board 20 calculus as to the rule. In some cases, as I think you 21 will have to concede, under the Roberts jurisprudence, 22 the fact finding was more accurate. 23 In your case, what you are telling us is 24 that the fact finding is far less accurate. But I think 25 you are stuck unless you can give us some reason that we
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 depart with it. With a rule-made jurisprudence, we have 2 to look at the rule in the whole universe of cases, not 3 just your case. It seems to me that was the problem you 4 had in arguing in this area, and maybe you can suggest 5 some way out. I don't see it. 6 MS. FORSMAN: I can, Your Honor. The reason 7 that I can is that the judge does not have the ability 8 to see the cross-examination statement either. So if we 9 start with the premise, when making this reliability 10 determination, we would have to throw out all of the 11 statements in Crawford and all of the previous cases 12 which hold so dear the right to cross-examination and 13 say, but a judge can make a reliability determination 14 without ever hearing the statements cross-examined, can 15 make them in that vacuum without ever testing the 16 reliability of the statements with the -- with 17 cross-examination. 18 And I don't know how you would be able to 19 square that with the strong statements that are made in 20 Crawford. And the strong statements that are made in 21 the cases, for instance, in the case finding that Bruton 22 should be retroactive, because it goes to the integrity 23 of the fact- finding process. Unlike all of the other 24 cases that you've talked about since Teague, the 25 integrity of the fact-finding process is what is at
33

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 issue here. Do you have confidence in a result which is 2 based upon an accuser's statements being admitted 3 without ever having been cross-examined? 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Ohio versus 5 Roberts was not overruled because of a judgment that it 6 was not doing a good enough job in assessing reliability 7 of these statements. It was overruled because of a 8 judgment that the Founders wanted there to be 9 cross-examination. 10 MS. FORSMAN: That's -- Your Honor, that is 11 the base of the decision. It harkens back to what the 12 Founders believed. However, the rule in Roberts was 13 described variously from "amorphous to unpredictable, 14 proof manipulable," to saying that the basis for the 15 right to confrontation and cross-examination comes from 16 a basic mistrust of, even to the levels of a judge in 17 terms of accepting the testimony without the advantage 18 of an actual adversary proceeding. 19 This case, of course, illustrates the dire 20 need for cross-examination because the accuser in this 21 case testified inconsistently at the preliminary hearing 22 in this case and then was excused before 23 cross-examination was allowed. The accuser in this 24 case, who was sent to a counselor by the district 25 attorney, when she went to the counselor refused to

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 knowledge that the incident happened, according to the 2 testimony of the counselor. 3 And because the court -- and the record is 4 very scant on what happened here -- the court, the trial 5 court for instance, under Roberts made only a couple of 6 findings and he said the testimony was consistent -- he 7 didn't look at the fact that it had been inconsistent on 8 at least two other occasions -- and said it was 9 chronological, at least according to what the police 10 officer said. 11 And so there were only a couple of findings 12 by the trial court at all with respect to -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You had the 14 opportunity to challenge those findings under the 15 Roberts regime in state court? 16 MS. FORSMAN: We did. We did, and that -17 and that issue was not reached by the Ninth Circuit 18 because after we had argued the case in the Ninth 19 Circuit the Crawford decision was decided; and it was at 20 that point that the Ninth Circuit picked up on the 21 Crawford, and they didn't decide the issue of whether or 22 not Roberts would have meant that this testimony was 23 unreliable anyway. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: You can still argue -- what 25 hearsay exception did it come in under?

1 MS. FORSMAN: It came in under a Nevada 2 statute which was patterned after Roberts. It came in 3 under a Nevada statute -4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Adequate indicia of 5 reliability. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Adequate indicia of 7 reliability? 8 MS. FORSMAN: Yes, adequate -- basically, 9 indicia of reliability. It didn't go into -- it didn't 10 go into too much more detail than that. It just simply 11 required that, a witness under ten, the court must find 12 that the, that the statement is reliable and the 13 statements are reliable, and then -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that universal in 15 Nevada? I mean, is they are no more hearsay rule in 16 Nevada, that you just evaluate hearsay straight out in 17 every case? 18 MS. FORSMAN: No. No. That was a statute 19 that was adopted specifically for child witnesses. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is for children 21 under ten, isn't it? 22 MS. FORSMAN: Children under ten. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As you just said. 24 MS. FORSMAN: That's correct. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And here we had someone
36

1 who was six years old and was hardly articulate, it 2 seems from the little we have of this record. So the 3 Nevada statute I think was very specific to children and 4 was not -5 MS. FORSMAN: It was. Yes, yes. No, it 6 was. It was adopted for witnesses under ten. This 7 child actually was quite articulate in the preliminary 8 hearing and was able -- was able to talk about the fact 9 that she remembered talking to the police officer, that 10 she remembered -- but then, but then in terms of trying 11 to recall the incident, she was unable to recall the 12 incident, and she was unable to recall it in any of the 13 same detail that the police officer testified to. 14 So it wasn't -- you know, it wasn't a 15 circumstance in which you had a child who simply 16 couldn't speak or a child who couldn't describe what had 17 occurred. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: So if you lose this case, 19 you can go back to the Ninth Circuit and say, well, even 20 under Roberts it shouldn't have come in? 21 MS. FORSMAN: I believe that's correct, Your 22 Honor, because the Ninth Circuit did not reach that 23 issue. 24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Would you comment, 25 Ms. Forsman, on your opponent's argument based on
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 2254(d)? 2 MS. FORSMAN: Yes. I think the easiest way 3 to explain our position on that is that what has been 4 articulated here is that a retroactive -- a rule made 5 retroactive by this court would be applicable to 6 Mr. Bockting if he had not raised this issue or had been 7 somehow procedurally defaulted along the way. In other 8 words, in order to be able to get the advantage that was 9 discussed by both the state and the government of the 10 other sections of the statute which clearly recognize, 11 as to the extent that it's relevant the sponsor of the 12 legislation did, that you still have the power to make 13 rules retroactive, but the only way that Mr. Bockting 14 would be able to get advantage of that rule would be if 15 the state court had never ruled on the merits of his 16 claim or had made some sort of procedural ruling that 17 meant that he was defaulted on the claim. So instead of 18 Mr. Bockting, who has raised this question of being able 19 to cross-examine his accuser from day one in the trial, 20 he cannot have that rule applied retroactively to him. 21 If instead he now, he goes back later and the court 22 says, no, this is a successor petition, you can't, you 23 can't get it, you can't come into our courtroom, the 24 door is slammed on you, according to the state now 25 there's no ruling on the merits of his claim, and that's
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 why that section of the statute would permit the 2 retroactive rule to apply. 3 2254(d)(1), while it has the language 4 clearly established, and the court asked some questions 5 about that, I think it must be remembered that when that 6 statute is being addressed, it's being addressed in 7 state court -- or in Federal court, on Federal habeas. 8 And so at the time that the petitioner is in Federal 9 court, then the rule has been clearly established. 10 The 2254(d) -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not -- the 12 state has to result -- the state -- it's adjudicated on 13 the merits in state court and results in a decision that 14 was contrary to clearly established Federal law. 15 MS. FORSMAN: Correct. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it seems to me 17 that the question is what was the law, what was the 18 clearly established law at the time of the state 19 decision. 20 MS. FORSMAN: 2254(d)(1), I think the only 21 way that you can read that section compatibly with the 22 four other sections which are quoted in our appendix 2 23 of our brief, the only way that you can do that is to 24 recognize, although this Court will recall that it has 25 described AEDPA as not quite a silk purse of legislative
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 drafting, but the only way to make those sections 2 compatible is to say, listen, what was going on when 3 2254(d)(1) was written was we were talking not about the 4 timing of the new rule, what we were talking about is 5 who is it decided by, because before AEDPA was adopted 6 it wasn't apparent that it must be a decision by you, by 7 this Court, that established by the rule. So that's the 8 first part. 9 And the second part is that it's not dicta. 10 It is an actual holding of this Court that is to be 11 looked to to determine whether or not the state court 12 was wrong. And so the only way to read that is to say, 13 listen, there has to be some meaning to retroactivity, 14 and what does retroactivity mean? Retroactivity means 15 like a nunc pro tunc order, that when you've determined 16 that a new rule is retroactively applicable -- and 17 certainly between AEDPA and the Teague exceptions, which 18 you did say in Horn versus Banks, by the way, should be 19 analyzed differently -- although it has not been tossed 20 up to you directly as it has in this case, the meaning 21 of the 2254(d)(1), you have repeatedly advised that 22 Teague is still alive and well and that when you look to 23 the application of whether a rule should be applied 24 retroactively you look to the Teague exceptions, so we 25 also look --

1 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any language in 2 2254(d) that could incorporate the Teague exceptions? 3 MS. FORSMAN: There is not language in 4 2254(d)(1). The language -- the reason that we know 5 that Congress was cognizant of Teague is that there is 6 language throughout AEDPA, particularly in the sections 7 that we've quoted to you, that are lifted directly from 8 Teague. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: What would we say if we were 10 to say that 2254(d)(1) accommodates the Teague 11 exceptions, that Congress meant to put them in but just 12 forgot to do it? How would we account for the language? 13 MS. FORSMAN: I think that what you would 14 say is that 15 Congress would not have deprived you of the power to 16 make a rule retroactively applicable and would have not 17 then created the ludicrous situation which the state 18 suggests would occur here, which is instead of the 19 motivation in Congress in having someone like 20 Mr. Bockting raise the issue from the very beginning in 21 one unitary proceeding, as opposed to going back, which 22 is what they've suggested he must do in order to get the 23 advantage of a retroactive rule, is that Congress was 24 cognizant of that and in order to make all of the 25 statute -- all of the provisions of the statute have
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 meaning and not render certain provisions, including the 2 sections that we quoted, superfluous, that you must 3 interpret that to mean that the -- that the -- that 4 2254(d)(1) is not a timing statute. It's what law do we 5 look to. That must be what they meant. Otherwise, the 6 rest of it just doesn't make any sense. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that making the tail 8 wag the dog, because there's language in the provisions 9 on successive petitions that refers to Teague, that you 10 would read the Teague exceptions into 2254(d)(1) when 11 there's nothing in the language there that can be 12 interpreted to refer to them? 13 MS. FORSMAN: No. I don't believe that's 14 the tail wagging the dog, because I don't think that 15 that was the intent of 2254(d)(1). I think the 16 intent -- again, I think the intent of 2254(d)(1) was in 17 order to define what kinds of decisions the state court 18 decisions should be measured against. There must be 19 some kind of meaning to retroactivity, and retroactivity 20 means that you are making this decision now and you're 21 making it retroactive to the time. It is not going to 22 be many things, as we know not only from your decisions, 23 but as we know from the very small core of decisions 24 that Teague left open. And it is those decisions where 25 we must worry whether or not an innocent man has been
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 convicted. It is those rules that protect against 2 those -- an unjust, an unwarranted, a wrongful 3 conviction. It is only those rules that go to 4 reliability, that go to the integrity of the 5 fact-finding process, that you are going to let through 6 that veil. 7 So if it is only that small core of rules 8 that you reserved in Teague, only that small core of 9 rules, and we know it won't be many at this point, then 10 if you read that compatibly with AEDPA, it is not and, 11 as we know, it is not going to open the floodgates. 12 There is a very defined period of time in which people 13 can bring actions for relief. Under your Dodd decision 14 decision, there is only one year, not from the time that 15 you make -- if you were to make, for instance, this 16 decision retroactive, not from today, but it is one year 17 from Crawford that petitioners have the opportunity to 18 be able to come into court within that statute of 19 limitations with regard to the date on which a new rule 20 is adopted. 21 It is from that date forward. So there is a 22 defined population. In appendix 1 of our brief, you 23 will see all of the decisions that we could find that 24 have actually applied Crawford and there were 49 of 25 them. And what you'll find is that of the decisions --
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and the state and the government have not disputed 2 this -- of the 49 decisions which we were able to find 3 at the time of the writing of that brief, only five 4 actually resulted in relief. There's no question it 5 would result in relief here because there is no 6 contention before you that the Ninth Circuit's 7 determination of harmfulness -- there is no 8 determination before you; they haven't challenged that 9 to you. 10 So it would result in relief for 11 Mr. Bockting. But because it's harmless error or it's 12 not testimonial or there was a previous opportunity to 13 cross-examine, of the 49 decisions only 5 were found to 14 have to result in relief. 15 And that is as it should be. The state 16 argues that watersheddedness, if that's a word, is that 17 watersheddedness must mean that it affects many, many 18 decisions. Now, that can't mean what Teague means. 19 Teague can't mean that my burden is to show you that 20 many decisions will be overturned. That's the exact 21 opposite of what Teague was decided for. 22 Watersheddedness has to do with the 23 alteration of our understanding. It is difficult for me 24 to understand how the change of course as described by 25 then Chief Justice Rehnquist, that the change of course
44

1 that Crawford represented in the way that we look at the 2 right to confrontation cannot be, cannot be seen as 3 precisely the alteration in the understanding of this 4 bedrock principle again directly from the language of 5 Crawford. 6 We ask you, Your Honors, to make the rule of 7 Crawford retroactive and to affirm the determination of 8 the Ninth Circuit. 9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Forsman, can I ask you 10 a personal question?

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to the interpretation of 2254(d)(1) clearly established 2 language is inconsistent with the statement made -3 statements made by this Court in Lockyer and in Williams 4 v. Taylor. In Lockyer, the Court stated Section 5 2254(d)(1)'s clearly established phase referred to the 6 holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's 7 decisions as of the time of the relevant state court 8 decision, citing Williams v. Taylor. In other words, 9 clearly established federal law under 2254(d)(1) is the 10 governing legal principle or principles set forth by the 11 Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its 12 decision. 13 With regard to counsel's point about 14 this case in particular, Bockting, I agree that there 15 are broader issues beyond this particular fact 16 situation. However, I want the Court to feel 17 comfortable that when this Court sent this case back 18 down to the Nevada Supreme Court and told the Nevada 19 Supreme Court to follow Ohio -- Idaho versus Wright, the 20 factors in Idaho versus Wright to determine 21 trustworthiness, talk about spontaneity and consistent 22 reputation -- repetition, mental state of declarant, use 23 of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, and 24 lack of motive to fabricate. Particularized guarantees 25 of trustworthiness must be so trustworthy that
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 adversarial testing would add little to its reliability. 2 Following that admonishment from this Court, 3 the Nevada Supreme Court found those statements to be 4 reliable and to satisfy the standards of Ohio -- Idaho 5 versus Wright. 6 Finally, I would just point out that 7 although Caldwell is indeed an important rule, and may, 8 in fact, be a fundamental rule, so was Batson in Teague, 9 as was Caldwell in Sawyer, as was Ring in Summerlin, as 10 was Duncan in DiStefano as was Mills in Banks. Yet this 11 Court failed to apply retroactive status to any of those 12 important fundamental rules saying none of them rose to 13 the level of Gideon versus Wainwright. The same should 14 be true with your decision here with respect to 15 Crawford. 16 Finally, as Justice Harlan stated in the 17 case of McKay, talking about where this Court's 18 retroactivity jurisprudence has come from, no one, 19 not -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your 21 sentence. 22 MR.
