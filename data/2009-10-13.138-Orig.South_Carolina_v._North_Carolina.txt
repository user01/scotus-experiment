1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (1:00 p.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument this afternoon in Case 138 in our original 5 docket, South Carolina v. North Carolina. 6 Mr. Frederick. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF 9 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, 10 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 South Carolina seeks an equitable 12 apportionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River. 13 Both States act as parens patriae on behalf of all users 14 of the river within their boundaries. 15 For three reasons, this Court should not 16 adopt the Special Master's recommendation that 17 Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply 18 Project be permitted to intervene as parties in this 19 original action: 20 First, the report articulates the wrong 21 legal test for intervention. Second, under the New 22 Jersey v. New York standard, none of the three entities 23 should be permitted to intervene. And, third, the 24 report's approach to intervention involves this Court in 25 deciding intramural disputes between and among water

1 users in one State. 2 With respect to the first point, the Special 3 Master applied the wrong factors, we would submit, in 4 deciding whether or not a party or an intervenor should 5 be allowed to intervene as a party. 6 The Special Master sought to distill from 7 this Court's cases three principles that we would submit 8 are not the appropriate principles in deciding an 9 intervenor's status. 10 First, the report overemphasizes the, quote, 11 "direct stake," although the master found that the 12 equitable apportionment had no specific impact on 13 individual users of the water. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 15 friends agreed that the New Jersey v. New York standard 16 applied? 17 MR. FREDERICK: Your Honor, part of what you 18 will be deciding in this case is the appropriate 19 standard for intervention, and the Special Master, we 20 respectfully submit, did not apply the New Jersey v. New 21 York factors. Instead, the report distilled from other 22 cases, not the New Jersey v. New York case, the 23 principles that she thought should apply to govern an 24 intervenor's status, and those three principles, we 25 would submit, are incorrect.

1 Under the New Jersey v. New York standard, 2 the master did not make findings that would be 3 appropriate to determine the intervenor status here as 4 appropriate parties. There was no finding of inadequate 5 representation by either State to support any of the 6 intervenor's request to participate as parties. There 7 was no finding of a compelling interest in the sense 8 that it was truly compelling. It's hard to argue in 9 cases in -- where there is no case from this Court in 10 the equitable apportionment area that three intervenors 11 would have met the compelling interest standard here. 12 And, finally, the New York-New Jersey 13 standard talks about having interests that are apart 14 from other interests. But both Charlotte and the 15 Catawba River Water Supply Project are simply acting on 16 behalf of all users of North Carolina water. They 17 simply happen to be the largest ones. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, we -- we had 19 a case involving, what, a tax on -- on oil companies, in 20 which it was a State against State case, but we allowed 21 the oil companies who would pay the tax to intervene. 22 Now, why is that any different from this 23 case? 24 MR. FREDERICK: First, the interests were 25 different. They were not an equitable apportionment

1 where the water -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does that make any 3 difference? 4 MR. FREDERICK: This Court has said for 200 5 years that water is a unique resource within the 6 sovereign control of States. 7 In the Maryland case, the Court permitted 8 intervention in a situation in which Louisiana had sued 9 the pipeline companies in Louisiana State court for a 10 declaratory judgment that its tax was constitutional. 11 There was also a pending FERC action in Federal court in 12 Louisiana raising the same issue, so when Maryland and 13 eight other States who were not parens patriae of the 14 various pipeline companies who sought to intervene filed 15 the original action, I think the Court appropriately 16 considered that interests of judicial efficiency called 17 for handling the Commerce Clause challenge in the 18 original action in this case. 19 And finally, the Court only devoted two 20 sentences of its opinion and didn't cite the New Jersey 21 v. -- New York v. New Jersey case in acting on the 22 intervention. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, these ­ these 24 are rules that we are making up ourselves, right, as to 25 when we are going to allow intervention or not? Do ­-

1 is there any case -- I think there isn't, but tell me if 2 I'm wrong -- is there any case in which we have rejected 3 intervention that has been recommended by the Special 4 Master? 5 MR. FREDERICK: I don't think I can recall a 6 case in that factual scenario, but I can point you to 7 Kentucky v. Indiana in 1930, in which this Court 8 rejected Kentucky's attempt to join individual Indiana 9 citizens as parties in an original action over 10 Indiana's alleged breach of a contract to build an 11 interstate bridge. And the reason -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand your 13 basic argument that each State should represent its own 14 constituents. But isn't the Catawba River Water Supply 15 Project in a different category? Because it straddles 16 both States, and I think it can reasonably fear that it 17 would be treated as a stepchild by both States. 18 MR. FREDERICK: No, in fact, 19 Mr. Chief Justice, I would submit they have the weakest 20 claim to intervention in this case. 21 Their argument, fundamentally, is that Union 22 County, North Carolina, which is the North Carolina part 23 of the joint venture with the Lancaster Water District, 24 should be permitted to have water purchased from the 25 South Carolina side of the boundary. So what's
7 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 happening with that water project is the water is sucked 2 out on the South Carolina side and piped north for Union 3 County's consumption under a Union County permit with 4 the State of North Carolina. Union County, therefore, 5 is acting as any other user of water, along with 6 Charlotte and all other users of water in North 7 Carolina. 8 The Catawba Project is not here to intervene 9 to protect its interests on the South Carolina side of 10 the boundary. Those are adequately protected, we 11 submit, by the attorney general acting on behalf of the 12 State. So in effect the Union County, North Carolina, 13 claim here of 5 million gallons of water per day which 14 they are seeking to protect through their intervention 15 is no different than the other interests of North 16 Carolina water users that they are seeking to protect -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except that these -18 these three entities are the principal entities that are 19 guilty of interbasin transfers, which is essentially 20 what the -- what the dispute is about. 21 MR. FREDERICK: The dispute is about the 22 transfer of water and consumption of water in toto. The 23 Court -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the focus -- the 25 focus of the complaint is upon interbasin transfers,
8 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 isn't it? 2 MR. FREDERICK: The focus of the complaint 3 highlights interbasin transfers to the extent that they 4 are a large quantifiable amount of water being taken out 5 of the Catawba River, that we submit should not be 6 counted on -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. And these three 8 entities account for a very large proportion of those 9 interbasin transfers. Isn't it the case that any -- any 10 decision by -- by this Court on -- on this question will 11 necessarily impact directly these three entities? 12 MR. FREDERICK: No. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? 14 MR. FREDERICK: Because in an equitable 15 apportionment case, this Court decides which share of 16 the water is allocable to each State. It is a question 17 of State law how each State shall determine the 18 intrastate allocations of the water. So -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but I'm 20 talking about the real world. If -- if indeed North 21 Carolina has to cut back, and if indeed the opinion of 22 this Court says that it's taking too much because of 23 interbasin transfers, as a practical matter these three 24 entities are going to be out of luck. 25 MR. FREDERICK: We take the real world, Your

1 Honor, as this Court's cases direct us, and those cases 2 tell us that in situations where the Court is deciding 3 an equitable apportionment between two States -- water, 4 of course, is fungible. It's a series of molecules that 5 do not accord property rights in any one entity or user. 6 They all divine from the State itself. 7 So if North Carolina, in its exercise of 8 parens patriae responsibility, determines that Charlotte 9 should have a larger share than what it currently has, 10 that's a decision for Charlotte -- for North Carolina as 11 a political entity to decide among its users. It does 12 not necessarily implicate this Court's action in an 13 equitable apportionment to say that what the Court will 14 ultimately decide is what Charlotte's share is. That is 15 not what we are seeking, and that's not what an 16 injunction from this Court equitably apportioning the 17 Catawba River would necessarily decide. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, if this 20 were an ordinary civil case, we would be guided by the 21 rule on permissive intervention, and appellate courts in 22 dealing with that rule give a healthy measure of respect 23 to the trial judge's determination. 24 So even though the civil rules are not 25 binding in original jurisdiction cases, isn't that a
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 sound approach that we should adopt? Just as a court of 2 appeals would defer to a district judge's decision, so 3 we should give a healthy measure of deference to the 4 Special Master's evaluation that this will be useful. 5 MR. FREDERICK: No, for several reasons, 6 Justice Ginsburg. First, in any appellate review 7 Situation, this Court would review de novo the legal 8 test that would be applied. Our initial submission is 9 the master applied and articulated the wrong legal test. 10 So you would first need to determine, we would submit, 11 what is the correct legal test for submission. That is 12 a de novo review standard. 13 But secondly, the Court has said in numerous 14 original cases it does not apply deference, although it 15 gives appropriate respect to special masters, and so 16 there would be no basis for applying a deference 17 standard to a special master ruling on a question of law 18 that fundamentally is about what this Court's original 19 jurisdiction under Article III is supposed to be about. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: But, in fact, we've never 21 rejected a special master's desire to -- to have 22 intervenors in the case. 23 MR. FREDERICK: Well, virtually every case, 24 Justice Scalia -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that oil case that I
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 mentioned. I forget the name of it. The tax -2 MR. FREDERICK: Maryland v. Louisiana. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. What had the Special 4 Master recommended in that case? 5 MR. FREDERICK: There was actually no 6 special master recommendation in that case. The Court 7 decided it on its motion directly to this Court. 8 Virtually all of the cases that we cited in 9 the blue brief highlight the fact that special masters 10 routinely reject motions to intervene. It is the rare 11 situation in which a special master would allow 12 intervention. 13 And the only example that the other side can 14 come up with is the Nebraska v. Wyoming case, in which 15 finally Basin Electric, after 10 years of participating 16 in the original action as an amicus, was allowed to 17 intervene because the Special Master viewed there to be 18 tension between the State of Nebraska's interest and 19 that that Basin Electric was seeking to vindicate. You 20 -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, can we go 22 back a little? I think you just said there was no 23 special master's recommendation in 24 Maryland v. Louisiana, but I'm looking at page 745. In 25 the footnote 21, it said: "The master recommended that
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we grant the motion of 17 pipeline companies to 2 intervene as plaintiffs." And then it says: "It is not 3 unusual to permit intervention of private parties in 4 original actions." 5 MR. FREDERICK: And the case that it cited 6 is Oklahoma v. Texas, which is a very unusual case from 7 this Court's docket in the 1920s. What the Court 8 decided in 1932, Justice Ginsburg, in the Wyoming and 9 Colorado case was that in situations involving 10 interstate allocations of water, the claimants or users 11 of a State are deemed to be represented by the State. 12 The case on which the Court relied in the Maryland case 13 was back into an old era in which it was unclear whether 14 States acting as parens patriae had the responsibility 15 to act on behalf of all claimants or users of water. 16 The Maryland case, as I said before, did not 17 analyze the New Jersey v. New York factors, and I would 18 submit that in light of the other circumstances of the 19 case, the fact that it was a Commerce Clause challenge 20 involving Federal, State, and private companies, in 21 which there was multiple litigation pending in various 22 forums, it was an exercise of the Court's decision to 23 efficiently decide the Commerce Clause challenge to 24 allow those pipeline companies in, where some of those 25 pipeline companies were not represented by States that
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 were parties in the case. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I guess I 3 haven't heard yet an answer to Justice Ginsburg's first 4 question about whether there was a recommendation from 5 the Special Master or not. 6 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I -- I will -- I 7 obviously forgot about footnote 21 of the Court's 8 opinion in Maryland v. Louisiana, Justice Ginsburg. But 9 I think -10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I don't know 11 that you've actually addressed the operative question of 12 what amount of discretion, if any, are we going to give 13 to special masters to determine when they require the 14 presence of a party to do equity, which is what I read 15 the Special Master to be suggesting. These are the 16 three biggest users of water, at least one of them 17 straddles both States, another has a potential license. 18 And so that each of them has a different situation than 19 a normal water user. 20 So, you're -- all you're begging is the 21 question of whether we just say you can't. But why is 22 the "you can't" compelled, either by our case law or by 23 any original jurisdiction principle? 24 MR. FREDERICK: Well, let's start with the 25 original jurisdiction principle. Those are actions that
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 are brought invoking this Court's original jurisdiction, 2 which this Court could sit without a special master 3 and would decide the matter as it sits as a court of 4 nine. The fact that it appoints a special master to 5 assist and facilitate that effort does not imbue the 6 actions of that person delegated that responsibility 7 with something akin to the deference given to district 8 judges in making various fact findings. 9 Secondly, on a question of law, as 10 intervention fundamentally is -- and ultimately we are 11 talking about the scope and contours of this Court's 12 exercise of original jurisdiction -- what the Court has 13 said is that there are two interests that are ultimately 14 being protected: One is the dignity interest of the 15 State acting in its sovereign capacity on a subject, 16 water, that quintessentially is sovereign; and it is 17 doing so for judicial efficiency purposes, because it 18 allows the Court to expect each State to represent 19 adequately all of the users of water in that State. 20 So, for those reasons, we think that a 21 special master recommendation ought to be reviewed with 22 the same level of scrutiny that all other aspects of a 23 special master's -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we've -- we've 25 allowed private parties to be impleaded by the States.
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 We have allowed one State to sue another State and a 2 private party. 3 MR. FREDERICK: Not in an equitable 4 apportionment. And -- and I think the -- the scope of 5 the relief is important. And that is because the State 6 seeking the relief is assuming the risk that the relief 7 that it wants to get from that State is an inadequate 8 form of relief. 9 Here the form of relief South Carolina seeks 10 goes only against North Carolina. We cannot get an 11 equitable apportionment with Charlotte or the Catawba 12 Project. We can only get it from North Carolina. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I see your light's on, but 15 can we take this case on the assumption that nothing 16 that you obtain in the way of relief will affect Duke 17 Power under the comprehensive relicensing agreement? 18 MR. FREDERICK: Yes -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't we have to take the 20 case on the assumption that their rights under that 21 agreement might be affected? 22 MR. FREDERICK: They might be affected, but 23 only in an ancillary way. It is an -- part of an 24 application to the FERC. The FERC here is saying it 25 does not affect it because the license itself will not
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 dictate minimum -2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But are you saying you are 3 not seeking a result that's inconsistent in any way 4 with that agreement? 5 MR. FREDERICK: Neither the agreement ­- and 6 this is at page 51 to 52 of our brief, citing 39 of the 7 CRA -- says it doesn't affect water rights. The final 8 environmental impact statement from FERC says it doesn't 9 affect apportionment interstate issues. Both FERC and 10 the CRA itself disclaim any impact on the equitable 11 apportionment action pending here. 12 If I could save the balance of my time. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 14 Mr. Frederick. 15 Mr. Miller. 16 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER 17 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 18 AS AMICUS CURIAE, 19 SUPPORTING THE PLAINTIFF 20 MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 21 please the Court: 22 In order to intervene in an original action 23 in this Court, a citizen of a State that is a party to 24 the action must show a compelling interest, separate 25 from that of other citizens, that is not properly
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 represented by the State. In an equitable apportionment 2 action, the interest that is at stake is not a private 3 property interest in water. Rather, it is the sovereign 4 interest of a State in a particular share of the 5 waters of an interstate river. For that reason, a 6 private interest in water is not an appropriate basis 7 for intervention in such a proceeding. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on, I suppose, 9 on what you mean by "is not properly represented by the 10 State." If you think the State does not have a 11 sufficient interest to defend that -- that particular 12 right vigorously, might that not be -- might not that 13 qualify? 14 MR. MILLER: Well, I think that the interest 15 that the private party has is a State law property 16 interest in water, and that's an interest that simply 17 isn't at stake in an equitable apportionment action. 18 The only thing that this Court is deciding is what share 19 of the river does each State get. 20 The Court in an equitable apportionment 21 action does not decide the purely intrastate question of 22 how will that share be allocated. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you could say that 24 realistically when you are talking about an individual 25 water user, a small potatoes water user, a normal
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 resident of Charlotte perhaps. But when you are talking 2 about the biggest entities that are going to be affected 3 by the apportionment, it really doesn't ring true to me. 4 MR. MILLER: Well, that -- I mean, in New 5 Jersey v. New York, Philadelphia, which sought to 6 intervene in that case, constituted a majority of the 7 water users within the State of Philadelphia. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did the special master 9 think Philadelphia should have been let in? 10 MR. MILLER: I don't recall what the special 11 master -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: The answer is no. 13 MR. MILLER: -- said in that case. But this 14 Court has held in, for example, Colorado v. New Mexico, 15 that even on purely factual questions, the special 16 master is -- who makes recommendations, and those 17 recommendations are reviewed by this Court de novo. The 18 Court is not sitting in an appellate capacity. This is 19 a case within its original jurisdiction, and this Court 20 has an independent responsibility to make a 21 determination, even on factual questions and a fortiori 22 on questions of intervention. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but we haven't -- we 24 haven't been sitting there trying to figure out what 25 would facilitate the proceeding. Much of the discovery
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 in the case has already focused on these three entities, 2 hasn't it? 3 MR. MILLER: That's right. And to the 4 extent -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: So to say that they are 6 just -- you know, they are just Joe Dokes is ­- is 7 really very unrealistic. 8 MR. MILLER: Well, to the -- I mean, to the 9 extent that they have valuable information to provide, 10 third-party discovery can take account of that, as can 11 amicus participation. It would be entirely appropriate 12 for parties that have information or a special 13 perspective on the case to present an amicus submission 14 to the Special Master or to this Court. And it's -- but 15 that -- that's not a basis for allowing them to become 16 full parties through intervention. 17 And then, to the extent that there's a 18 concern about the management of this case, I think it's 19 important to keep in mind that the rule recommended by 20 the Special Master and the rule that the would-be 21 intervenors are urging this Court to adopt would, of 22 course, apply not just in this litigation, but in every 23 equitable apportionment action. And not only does it 24 make the litigation of those actions much more difficult 25 to have additional non-State parties in, but it makes it
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 much more difficult for those cases to be settled. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if that -- if and 3 when that is the case, the Special Master will not want 4 them to come in, as the vast majority of special masters 5 have not wanted them to come in, in the past. I don't 6 think that's going to change. 7 MR. MILLER: I -- I guess what I would 8 say is that I don't think that, either in the 9 recommendation of the Special Master in this case or in 10 the submissions of the -- the would-be intervenors, that 11 there's really any logical limiting principle that 12 would not allow, as a matter of routine, large water 13 users to come in to equitable apportionment actions. 14 And that's inappropriate for the more 15 fundamental reason that these original actions in this 16 Court are not ordinary cases. This Court has said that 17 sitting in judgment between two sovereigns is one of the 18 most grave -- grave and delicate responsibilities the 19 Court has, and it's a sparingly exercised jurisdiction 20 reserved for the most serious of issues, issues of such 21 importance that, if the States were independent 22 countries, would be resolved through treaties or -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: But not reserved 24 exclusively to State -- to suits between a State and 25 another State. We've allowed it to cover suits between
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 a State and another State and private citizens of the 2 other State. 3 MR. MILLER: Yes. And when a State brings 4 such an action or seeks to bring such an action, it 5 can't simply file a complaint as of right. It has to 6 seek this Court's permission to file the complaint. And 7 this Court can review the complaint at that time and 8 look at who the parties are and figure out whether it's 9 an appropriate case for the exercise of this Court's 10 jurisdiction. And that, in our view, is a much more 11 appropriate way to proceed, making that determination at 12 the outset on the basis of the State's complaint, rather 13 than through piecemeal litigation as different non-State 14 parties -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, here the complaint 16 was South Carolina's complaint, and these are 17 intervenors on North Carolina's -- on North Carolina's 18 side. 19 MR. MILLER: That's where they were seeking 20 to intervene on North Carolina's side as defendants. 21 That's right. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And as representing the 23 position of the United States, would you address the 24 FERC license that Duke Energy is raising? 25 MR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor. Under section
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 27 of the Federal Power Act, which is 16 U.S.C. 821, the 2 Power Act does not affect State law water rights. So 3 State law water rights are taken as a given, and it's up 4 to the licensee to have the necessary State water 5 rights, and a FERC license does not in any way alter the 6 distribution of State law property rights in water. 7 And what the commission has said in this 8 case in the final environmental impact statement with 9 respect to Duke's relicensing application, which is 10 available on the commission Web site, it cited section 11 27 and it said: "Any license that is issued will not 12 impose requirements, including minimum flows, that 13 infringe on water rights or apportionments." So the 14 commission is aware of the pendency of this case. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it isn't a matter of 16 infringing on water rights or apportionments. I mean, 17 that does not exclude, it seems to me, the revocation of 18 the license or the denial of a renewal of the license 19 because Duke Power does not have enough water. That 20 wouldn't preclude that, would it? 21 MR. MILLER: Well, the -- the nature of this 22 proceeding makes that outcome not -- not something that 23 would happen even if South Carolina were to prevail, 24 because what South Carolina is seeking is to get more 25 water flowing downstream to it, and so the -- the
23 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 licensing conditions, which generally impose minimum 2 flow requirements at each of the various dams operated 3 by Duke, would be easier to satisfy, not harder to 4 satisfy, if South Carolina were -- had an entitlement to 5 get even more water flowing through -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't 7 understand that. I don't understand that. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to North 9 Carolina if it has less water? What does it do with 10 respect to Duke? 11 MR. MILLER: Well, Duke -- Duke's dams ­12 the licensing condition is that each dam allow a certain 13 amount of water to flow through, under the current 14 license that they are operating under, and there are 15 different minimum flow requirements under the renewal 16 license that is being sought. But an order in effect 17 requiring that they let more water flow through would 18 not be in conflict with the licensing requirement, but 19 -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And why isn't Duke 22 Power -- why isn't Duke Power on the other side, then? 23 MR. MILLER: I mean, I -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They have smart 25 lawyers.
24 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. MILLER: Well, they -- I mean, one 2 possibility is, of course, that Duke is -- in addition 3 to obviously being an operator of dams, Duke is a very 4 large consumer of water. In fact, it's the largest 5 consumer of water on the Catawba system because of its 6 coal and nuclear power plants which use water 7 evaporatively for cooling of the power plants. So -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it may also mean it 9 when it has to increase the outflow, the level of its 10 impoundments reduces, and that may affect its ability to 11 generate power, which in turn may -- may affect its 12 license. 13 MR. MILLER: It -- it may have some effect 14 on its ability to -- to generate power. But that makes 15 it a large industrial user of water, akin to those that 16 the Court referred to in New Jersey v. New York, which 17 were not entitled to intervene. 18 I would also point out in further response, 19 Mr. Chief Justice, to your question, that Duke is a 20 North Carolina corporation, which may be why it's 21 seeking to come in on the North Carolina side of this 22 case. 23 But I -- I want to return to the idea that 24 these kinds of cases are not ordinary cases. They 25 involve sovereign interests, and I think what's

1 important about that is that the interest -2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Miller, if I -- if I 3 understood your argument, you are saying that Duke's 4 interests are really with South Carolina, or -- to 5 increase the flow. But I would think then it would be 6 North Carolina who would be objecting to their 7 participation in the case rather than South Carolina. 8 And they don't. They -- they welcomed them in, as I 9 remember the papers. 10 MR. MILLER: As I said, Duke is an operator 11 of thermal power plants that are large consumers of 12 water, and some of those are located in North Carolina. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 14 Mr. Bartolomucci. 15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. CHRISTOPHER BARTOLOMUCCI 16 ON BEHALF OF THE INTERVENORS 17 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Thank you, 18 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 19 The Special Master correctly concluded that 20 Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply 21 Project should intervene in this original action. Her 22 recommendation deserves some deference because she is in 23 the best position to know whether these parties would 24 assist her in the adjudication of this complex dispute. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is our original

1 jurisdiction. I regard the Special Master as more akin 2 to a law clerk than a district judge. We don't defer to 3 somebody who's an aide that we have assigned to help us 4 gather things here. I think on legal questions of 5 intervention we have to decide de novo. 6 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Our claim is not that the 7 Special Master should get deference on legal questions, 8 but she should get deference on -- on the narrow 9 question of whether it would be helpful to her to have 10 these intervenors in the case. She has -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what she 12 said that makes them helpful. What can they provide 13 that couldn't be done by merely an amici submission? 14 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, she pointed out, 15 for example, that Duke Energy, which controls the flow 16 of this river and is participating in the FERC 17 proceedings, would establish a -- a direct link between 18 this adjudication and what's going on before the FERC. 19 And of course those two proceedings have -- have a lot 20 of interaction. I think it's also fair to -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, your adversary has 22 just said none, according to the terms of the license 23 and what the FERC has said. So why is -- why don't we 24 just take what FERC has said -25 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Oh, I think --
27 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- at face value? 2 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: I think FERC has not said 3 that there will be no effect, that there would be no 4 effect upon the licensing proceeding from the original 5 action. There could be a conflict between the decree 6 that comes down, if one comes down in this Court, and 7 the terms of the FERC license. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I think all FERC said 9 is -- is that nothing in its license would -- would 10 require allocation of water by -- by North Carolina. 11 And that's quite different from whether -- whether a 12 severe reduction in the water that Duke can use would -13 would affect the -- the nature of the license given by 14 FERC. 15 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, Duke of course 16 pulled together 69 other stakeholders to join the 17 comprehensive relicensing agreement to -- to smooth 18 FERC's acceptance of -- of the new license. And this 19 original action is -- will pit the two Carolinas, each 20 of which seeks to maximize their share of the river, and 21 those interests work at odds with the CRA, which 22 endorses a compromise middle flow position that ­- that 23 neither of the Carolinas seeks to defend in this action. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, let me tell 25 you what I'm very worried about. This is our original

1 jurisdiction, a delicate jurisdiction that allows us to 2 resolve disputes between sovereign States. And I look 3 out and I see all sorts of private parties intervening 4 in a way that would give them party status. And I think 5 that's compromising what our original jurisdiction is 6 supposed to be about. 7 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Mr. Chief Justice, 8 private parties and cities have intervened in the past 9 in original actions and have been named as defendants in 10 original actions. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But even in the New 12 Jersey v. New York decision, the dissenters there that 13 would have allowed the intervention did say that in 14 general it is unwise to encumber original jurisdiction 15 cases with non-State parties. That was even the 16 dissenters. So you start out with in general it's not 17 wise to let these people come in. 18 And following up on the Chief's question, a 19 State can't be sued without its consent. And it's true 20 here that South Carolina is initiating the action, but 21 it's initiating the action against a sister State. The 22 Special Master's recommendation would require the State 23 to have as its direct adversary three parties who are 24 not a sister State, and that kind of dilutes the notion 25 of original jurisdiction. It's a controversy between
29 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 two States. 2 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, in -- Justice 3 Ginsburg, in the case of New Jersey v. New York, New 4 York City was a party defendant, and in this case the 5 City of Charlotte occupies the exact same position as 6 New York City. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's because the State 8 chose 9 to sue it as a party defendant. 10 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: It did, but of course a 11 State can only sue a proper party defendant. Whether 12 the question is intervention or whether it's naming a 13 city as a defendant in an original action, both have to 14 pass the test of is this city or non-State a proper 15 party defendant? 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're -- all of the 17 intervenors, prospective intervenors, they want to make 18 sure North Carolina doesn't lose water, right? 19 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: That -- that is not their 20 exclusive interest. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, their -- well, 22 they want to reduce South Carolina's claim on the water. 23 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: No. Duke Energy, for 24 example, doesn't have an interest in maximizing the flow 25 on the North Carolina side of the river. Duke's -- Duke

1 Energy's interest is in preserving the -- the flow 2 compromise reflected in the CRA. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- to the 4 extent they have differing interests, why aren't those 5 interests fully satisfied by amicus participation? 6 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, when -- when South 7 Carolina first opposed, for example, Charlotte's motion 8 to intervene, it said: Oh, Charlotte, you can file an 9 amicus brief as to any dispositive motion. Well, that 10 kind of amicus participation is vastly different from 11 being able to shape the record on which the -- the key 12 issues in this case are finally decided. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Shape the record, 14 but intervention status would give you the right to 15 appeal, right? 16 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: It would allow us to seek 17 leave to file exceptions to an -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, and appeal 19 the normal case. 20 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Yes. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's my 22 question. If we grant intervention in this type of case 23 and there is no reason it would be three -- I mean, in 24 the next case, it could be 20 different intervenors, and 25 they are filing exceptions every other week that we have
31 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to review and adjudicate because they are not bound by 2 whether or not the State that is on their side wants to 3 file exceptions. 4 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, let me say two 5 things, Mr. Chief Justice: If the proposed decree 6 affects the interests of Charlotte or the joint venture 7 or Duke, I think they ought to be allowed to file 8 exceptions, which this Court can grant leave or not. 9 As to the specter of 20 possible 10 intervenors -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how does that get us 12 to avoid involvement in interstate -- intrastate 13 disputes over water use? That just drags us right into 14 your problems among your water users. 15 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, South Carolina and 16 the United States present this vision of an equitable 17 apportionment action in which the Special Master simply 18 divides up the flow of the river, and then it's up to 19 each State to subdivide among its users. 20 But that is not what has happened in 21 equitable apportionment cases. In New Jersey v. New 22 York, for example, this Court entered a decree, which 23 enjoined the flow of the Delaware River to New York City 24 above a specified level. I think 411 cubic feet per 25 second.
32 Alderson Reporting Company

1 And -- and that is the kind of decree that 2 South Carolina, I believe, is seeking in this case. If 3 you look at paragraph 2 of South Carolina's prayer for 4 relief, they want an injunction against the interbasin 5 transfers currently being carried -- carried out by 6 Charlotte and the joint venture. So this -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And North Carolina, 8 as a sovereign State, can represent the interests of its 9 constituents as it sees fit. 10 You and your fellow prospective intervenors 11 just have to do what citizens do all the time, which is 12 convince North Carolina, one, and you can help them, to 13 get as much water as they can; and, two, when they get 14 it or if they lose it, whatever they are left it, to 15 give it to you, rather than the other parties. 16 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, as to Duke -17 Mr. Chief Justice, I have explained, Duke's interest is 18 not in maximizing the share -- North Carolina's share of 19 the river. 20 The joint venture of the Catawba River Water 21 Supply Project is not represented by either State 22 because it's a bi-State entity. Neither -- and both of 23 the Carolinas is -- are affirmatively hostile to part of 24 the operations of the joint venture. 25 When the joint venture --

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then that's ­2 then I just wonder why you are here in an original 3 action. 4 What you are saying is they have all sorts 5 of different interests, and it just -- they get to skip 6 district court. They get to skip the court of appeals. 7 They can just come right in here, as if they were a 8 State, and participate in the case. 9 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 10 I think this -- this is not a novel proposition. The 11 City of Port Arthur was allowed to intervene in the case 12 of Texas v. Louisiana. 13 Five Indian tribes intervened in Arizona v. 14 California, and New York City was allowed to be a party 15 defendant in the New Jersey case, even though the Court 16 could have dismissed it from the case, as it did to the 17 Indiana citizens in -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are advocating a 19 rule that says, almost, you have a right to intervene 20 because you have an interest that won't be adequately 21 represented. 22 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: We -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that your position? 24 Then what happens to the Special Master who says, no, I 25 don't want all you guys here? How do we say that that

1 master abused his or her discretion by saying no? 2 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: We are saying that the 3 Special Master got it right, when she said that you have 4 to show a compelling interest that's not properly 5 represented by a party State, and she applied the New 6 Jersey v. New York test, finding, at page 27 of her 7 report, that neither Charlotte nor the joint venture 8 are properly represented. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you see the issue 10 before us as being was she right or wrong, even though 11 Nevada said -- I'm sorry -- that North Carolina said 12 that it was going to adequately represent each of these 13 interests, but that just wasn't correct? 14 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: I think the question 15 is -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That North Carolina is 17 not telling us the truth? 18 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: I think the question is, 19 should the Court accept the Special Master's 20 recommendation? And I would disagree with South 21 Carolina, when it says that she applied the wrong legal 22 test. 23 She did apply New Jersey v. New York. She 24 did find that the intervenors were not properly 25 represented by the party States.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The intervenors -- the 3 intervenors are users of the water from the river? 4 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: But not mere users. Their 5 status is special. Duke, of course, is unique. 6 It controls the flow of the river, and there's no one 7 else like Duke on the Catawba. 8 The other two intervenors are the cause of 9 the harm for which South Carolina seeks injunctive 10 relief. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- because they use 12 a lot of water. And my question is: How do we decide 13 once we say -- beyond the Special Master can let these 14 people in with party status -- what users can come in 15 where, obviously, we are not going to allow all users of 16 the river water to come in, so which ones can and which 17 ones can't? 18 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Certainly, our position 19 is not that mere users of water or all users of water 20 may intervene in original action. 21 You have to show a compelling interest 22 that's not properly represented, and that's going to 23 depend upon the specific facts of the case. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: And is it automatic then? 25 Is it automatic then? Or is it just that, when that
36 Alderson Reporting Company

1 condition is met, the Special Master can permit the 2 intervention? 3 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: No, Justice Scalia. I 4 would say it's not automatic because there are some 5 other considerations the Special Master can bring to 6 bear. 7 For example, timeliness -- you can't show up 20 years 8 after the litigation has started, like the City of 9 Philadelphia, and expect to get in. You -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And, also, how helpful the 11 intervention will be to the management of the case. 12 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Correct. Or, conversely, 13 how -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And, of course, the Special 15 Master's determination of that is not final. It's 16 ultimately up to us. 17 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: That's correct. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it is a discretionary 19 intervention you are arguing for, not a mandatory one. 20 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: It is discretionary, and 21 if -- if the Special Master believes that -- that this 22 complex multiyear water rights dispute would be aided by 23 the presence of a -- of a limited number of intervenors 24 who have a very special interest in the case, then 25 that's something that, for institutional --

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what's special 2 about it? I mean, let's say I own a little farm on 3 the banks of the Catawba, and I take water out to -- so 4 the cows have something to drink, why does Charlotte get 5 a special status just because they take a lot? 6 I'm affected by how much water runs through 7 there. 8 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, Charlotte has 9 special status because South Carolina seeks specific 10 relief -- injunctive relief -- against Charlotte's 11 interbasin transfer. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and that 13 relief will affect how much water is available for me to 14 draw out and use on my farm. That's a compelling 15 interest. 16 I -- you know, in times of drought, this 17 water barely trickles by, and, if it's cut back, the 18 farm is going to go down. It seems to me that, when you 19 say they have a special interest, you are just saying 20 they have got a big interest. 21 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: It's not just that it's 22 -- it's a big interest, and it surely is, but they are 23 singled out in South Carolina's complaint, and 24 injunctive relief is sought against them, which, I 25 think, brings into the play the rule this Court

1 announced in Kentucky v. Indiana, which is that, if a 2 plaintiff or plaintiff State in an original action is 3 seeking relief against a citizen of a State, that 4 citizen ought to have an opportunity to come into the 5 litigation and defend its interests. 6 That's what Charlotte is seeking in this 7 case. The joint venture, of course, is not represented 8 by either State fully because both States are hostile to 9 at least part of what the joint venture does. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's say the 11 interest -- the dispute is really in effect between 12 company ABC in North Carolina and company XYZ in South 13 Carolina. I mean, do we -- we would not accept an 14 original action if they sued each other, right? 15 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: No -- well, of course ­16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we let them just 17 use the States as, you know, a façade to get into 18 this Court and have their dispute adjudicated here? 19 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: No. As in Kentucky v. 20 Indiana, if there are improper parties in original 21 action, they -- they can be dismissed, but I think it's 22 noteworthy that the Court allowed the New Jersey 23 litigation to proceed with New York City as a party 24 defendant. 25 And Charlotte's position is truly
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 indistinguishable from the position of -- of New York 2 City in that action, with -- with the sole exception 3 that Charlotte seeks to intervene, whereas New York City 4 was named as a party defendant. 5 South Carolina invokes the principle that it 6 is the master of its complaint, and we would agree with 7 that, in part. A plaintiff is the master of the 8 allegations in claims it seeks to make, but a plaintiff 9 is not a master of the universe of -- of interests that 10 -- that may be affected by the lawsuit they have -- they 11 have brought. That's -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think the same -13 the same test applies to the appropriateness of naming a 14 private party defendant, as you would urge for 15 intervention by a private party defendant? 16 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Yes. I think there would 17 be a very similar analysis. I think that the question 18 whether a proposed defendant -- and of course, you need 19 leave from this Court to file an original action or to 20 name someone as a defendant in an original action. I 21 think, in both cases, it raises the question: Is ­- is 22 this entity a proper party defendant or is the entity a 23 proper 24 intervenor? 25 I think it's a similar analysis.

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question: 2 In what respect does the relief sought against the city 3 differ from the relief sought against the State? 4 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: In this respect, Justice 5 Stevens: The -- the complaint prays for North Carolina 6 to stop authorizing the interbasin transfers being 7 carried out by Charlotte and the joint venture. But -8 but Charlotte and the joint venture are the entities 9 whose primary conduct, if you will, would be affected by 10 that injunction. They are the parties who are carrying 11 out the interbasin transfers, and they would have to 12 stop those transfers if -- if authorization was 13 withdrawn by North Carolina. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn't it ­ would 15 it be surprising if the Special Master recommended that 16 all the issue that she was going to address was the 17 relative equitable apportionment between North Carolina 18 and South Carolina, and even though South Carolina 19 wanted an injunction directed against the City of 20 Charlotte, that's up to North Carolina? North Carolina 21 can divvy up its water however it wants. 22 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: I think it would not be 23 surprising if she came down -- if she were to come down 24 with a decree, it would not be surprising that -- that 25 it would decide whether or not to allow Charlotte's
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 interbasin transfers to continue. 2 Because that's -- that was much like what 3 was decided, for example, in New Jersey v. New York. 4 There was the proposed diversion of water to New York 5 City, and the Court there ultimately entered a partial 6 injunction that banned flows to New York City above a 7 certain level. So -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in -- in deciding 9 what's equitable as between the two States, I guess the 10 -- the Court, ultimately, and the Special Master, 11 initially, will have to decide what uses of water by one 12 State or the other are not equitable uses -13 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: And, Justice Scalia -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and go beyond what is 15 reasonable. So I don't see how you could decide the 16 case without deciding whether especially particularly 17 massive uses are appropriate or not. 18 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Not just massive. 19 There's -- it's no accident that South Carolina focuses 20 upon these interbasin transfers, because they inflict a 21 special injury, in South Carolina's view. 22 The interbasin transfers take water out of 23 the river basin, and -- and so it doesn't come back to 24 South Carolina within the basin. Other types of uses of 25 water are non-consumptive, in the sense that the water
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 can be treated and eventually gets to South Carolina 2 within that basin. 3 But South Carolina has targeted these 4 interbasin transfers because they are entirely, 5 100 percent consumptive, in the sense that -- that once 6 the water has left the basin -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Dead losses to South 8 Carolina. 9 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: -- it does -- it does not 10 come back. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the percentage, 12 approximately, of the river that flows into South 13 Carolina that the three intervenors account for? 14 MR.

BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, I -- it's a 10 significant proportion. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: You must have some idea. 12 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: It's a significant 13 proportion.

BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, I haven't done that 19 calculation. I will say that they are significant 20 enough that South Carolina seeks a specific injunction 21 against those interbasin transfers. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I guess it depends on 23 what you mean by the water in dispute. If the main 24 gravamen of the complaint is interbasin transfers, they 25 -- they occupy a huge proportion of that.

BROWNING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 24 please the Court: 25 Let me turn to two questions that Justice
45 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Scalia asked Mr. Frederick, but I think his response 2 needs clarification from North Carolina's perspective. 3 The first question dealt with Maryland v. 4 Louisiana, and Mr. Frederick responded that that case, 5 in which 17 pipeline companies were permitted to 6 intervene -- according to Mr. Frederick, the States in 7 that case did not serve as parens patriae with regard to 8 those 17 pipeline companies. That is factually 9 incorrect. In that case, two of those pipeline 10 companies -- the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipeline Company was 11 a resident of the State of Michigan, one of the 12 complaining States in that case, as well as the National 13 Gas Pipeline Company of America was an Illinois 14 corporation. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maryland v. 16 Louisiana involved a specific tax on specific companies, 17 and they were allowed to intervene. This is not that. 18 This is a question of how the equitable apportionment of 19 the water is going to be, and North Carolina can do with 20 the water whatever it will. 21 It strikes me as very different than 22 Maryland v. Louisiana. 23 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, in Maryland v. 24 Louisiana, that was a taxation case, a case that goes to 25 a fundamental interest of the States, the power of
46 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 taxation. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- did the decree only 3 apply to taxing these particular companies? Could the 4 -- could the State have taxed other companies after the 5 decree issued? 6 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, as the 7 Plaintiff States were seeking to attack the Louisiana 8 tax at issue. So it would have general applicability. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As -- as the 10 allocation would in this case, presumably. 11 MR. BROWNING: Well, I don't -- and that 12 question -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that yes or no? I -14 you say yes, it would have general applicability. 15 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, 16 Justice Scalia. 17 Your Honor, South Carolina has said that 18 this case is about consumption of water in toto. But 19 when you look at their bill of complaint, that is simply 20 not the case. When you look at the question presented 21 in their leave for -- their motion for leave to file a 22 bill of complaint, it starts out whether North 23 Carolina's interbasin transfer statute is invalid under 24 the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. 25 And when you look at the allegations in the bill of
47 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 complaint, it is specifically focused on interbasin 2 transfers. It asserts that they are inequitable, and it 3 is seeking injunctive relief with respect to those 4 interbasin transfers. We -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how is just this 6 involved? Is there -- because I am amazed that this is 7 now coming to me for the first time. All this case is 8 about is interbasin transfers and that you account for 9 100 percent of them, you three. Is that -- is that 10 right? Because I suspect in, like, 5 minutes, somebody 11 might tell me it's not right. 12 (Laughter.) 13 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, there are -14 there are very few interbasin transfers. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- that's not my 16 question. 17 MR. BROWNING: Yes. Yes. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: I want -- I'm trying ­19 look, if Alaska sued California and the complaint was we 20 want San Francisco back, San Francisco might have a 21 right to intervene. But if it was about California 22 generally, maybe they wouldn't. 23 So what I want to know is, what's the water 24 that is at issue in this complaint and how much of the 25 water that is at issue in this complaint do the three
48 Alderson Reporting Company

1 intervenors account for? That seems like a fairly 2 simple empirical question. 3 MR. BROWNING: Yes. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I'm trying to 5 get the answer to. 6 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the 7 two intervenors that have interbasin transfers account 8 for the vast majority of the water that is consumed as a 9 result of an interbasin transfer. 10 In the 2006 study that was done by Duke 11 Energy, the largest interbasin transfer is the City of 12 Charlotte at 9 million gallons per day. The second -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, my basic 14 concern is that -- and I will let you finish if there is 15 more to the answer. I'm sorry. 16 Private parties are going to hijack our 17 original jurisdiction, and it was highlighted for me 18 when I read your motion, the motion of private parties 19 for divided argument. Your proposal was that they be 20 divided 10, 10, and 10. You didn't even want to be 21 here. 22 As they view the case and as you view the 23 case, it's got so little to do with the State that the 24 State didn't even want to come here and argue the case. 25 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, that was an

1 accommodation from the State of North Carolina with 2 respect to the intervenors. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You thought their 4 participation here before this Court on a question in 5 original jurisdiction was more important than yours, and 6 you represent the State. 7 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, the intervention 8 motion directly affects each of these intervenors, and 9 they have a right to be heard with respect to that 10 intervention motion. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why can't you 12 represent them? 13 MR. BROWNING: Well -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They are your 15 constituents. You are the State. You are coming here 16 directly, not even going to district court, and you seem 17 to be ceding your sovereignty over to them. 18 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, we do not believe 19 that we are ceding our sovereignty. With respect to 20 Duke Energy and the Catawba River Water Supply Project, 21 North Carolina does not and cannot adequately represent 22 their interests with respect to Duke Energy. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? 24 MR. BROWNING: Okay, with respect to Duke 25 Energy: Duke is -- has 11 dams in North and South

1 Carolina. As a result of those dams, Duke Energy 2 controls the flow of the river into South Carolina. As 3 -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you are going to 5 defend all of their interests as it affects North 6 Carolina, right? You are not incapable of protecting 7 their North Carolina interests. 8 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, their 9 interests are inseparable, specifically with regard to 10 Duke Energy. 11 Duke negotiated, over a period of several 12 years, a comprehensive relicensing agreement, with 13 various agencies of North Carolina, various agencies of 14 South Carolina, and stakeholders up and down this river. 15 As a result of that negotiated agreement, 16 there was -- the CRA was put in place, which is 17 essentially a request that FERC issue a license in 18 accordance with the provisions of that agreement. 19 That agreement would set a minimum flow of 20 water into South Carolina that is much, much higher than 21 the previous license. Now, South Carolina has come into 22 Court and has attacked that agreement. 23 Duke has a very real and substantial 24 interest with respect to that agreement. But -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- what's

1 the interest of North Carolina? 2 MR. BROWNING: Well -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are standing 4 there telling me why Duke has an interest. What's North 5 Carolina's interest? 6 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, North Carolina 7 will defend these interbasin transfers, but with respect 8 to Duke Energy, we are not aligned with Duke Energy 9 because Duke has a very real interest in preserving -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So oppose their 11 intervention. 12 MR. BROWNING: Well, we believe that they 13 have a right to be heard because of their compelling 14 interests that are affected in this case. 15 South Carolina is seeking to change the CRA, 16 to have a flow of water that is much higher than is set 17 out in the CRA. Although North Carolina supports -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't it your interest 19 to -- to resist that? 20 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. Not only 21 are we resisting that -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And your interest is 23 to defend the CRA, right? 24 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, North Carolina 25 will resist having South Carolina have a greater flow

1 of water than -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't answered my 3 question. 4 MR. BROWNING: I'm sorry. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it in your interest 6 not to support the CRA? 7 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. It is in 8 our interest because even -9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You would like -- you 10 would like, in this litigation against the two States, 11 for the Special Master to undo the -- your obligations 12 under the CRA? 13 MR. BROWNING: That will, ultimately, be our 14 request in this case because South Carolina has attacked 15 that agreement. 16 From North Carolina's perspective, South 17 Carolina is receiving much more water under this 18 negotiated agreement than they could ever hope to 19 achieve in an equitable apportionment action. 20 So at the end of the day, we will be asking 21 this Court to issue a decree that sets a flow of 22 water less than -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are prepared to 24 tell us right now -- this is what you are saying to us: 25 We will not represent the interest of Duke?

BROWNING: With respect -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And to your -- and to 7 the CRWSP? 8 MR. BROWNING: With respect to the city, we 9 have said in our briefs that we will defend this 10 interbasin transfer. We believe that we will represent 11 the City of Charlotte with respect to that regard, but 12 we also support their intervention motions because we do 13 not believe that it would result in them impeaching the 14 interests of North Carolina. 15 And more importantly, the Special Master got 16 it right, that there is -- this is a specific attack on 17 the City of Charlotte and its unique interests. It is 18 seeking injunctive relief that will cripple the largest 19 city in North and South Carolina. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it's an 21 attack on -- if it's an attack on Charlotte, I would 22 expect the State to be standing there protecting it and 23 not feel that they can't do that without Charlotte, 24 itself, coming into the case. 25 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, we will defend
54 Alderson Reporting Company

1 this interbasin transfer, but the fact of the matter is 2 injunctive relief is sought as against Charlotte, and 3 there is something to be said for fairness in allowing 4 that entity to be present in this Court. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -6 MR. BROWNING: Now, turning -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you prepared to say 8 that you are not adequately defending the interest of 9 the CRWSP? 10 MR. BROWNING: Correct, Your Honor, that 11 that is an interstate entity. It -- its interests have 12 been expressly attacked, the interbasin transfer. South 13 Carolina singles it out in the bill of complaint. 14 What's more important -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't answered my 16 question. You said, with Duke, that you won't support 17 -18 MR. BROWNING: Yes. We -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- them. Are you not 20 going to support this -- the joint venture in property? 21 MR. BROWNING: We -- we cannot represent the 22 interests of the joint venture. They have an interbasin 23 transfer, pursuant to the North Carolina statute for 24 Union County. 25 But what the complaint doesn't disclose is
55 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that the other half of that joint venture also has an 2 interbasin transfer with respect to Lancaster County, 3 South Carolina. 4 So South Carolina can hardly attack the 5 Union County interbasin transfer while simultaneously 6 defending the Lancaster County, South Carolina, 7 interbasin transfer. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's go back to the 9 question of couldn't the Special Master receive the 10 information she wants if these three entities come in as 11 amici? 12 Coming in as intervenors, they have full 13 party status. They can engage in discovery. They can 14 protract the case. They can appeal any adverse 15 judgment. 16 Why isn't the most reasonable accommodation 17 to say, well, we will listen to you, but we are not 18 going to give you full party status? 19 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, if that were 20 the -- the standard, there would never be intervention 21 motions in any of these proceedings. 22 The fact of the matter is that these 23 entities have unique interests, and with respect to two 24 of those interests -- Duke Energy and the Catawba River 25 Water Supply Project -- their interests are not

1 represented by either State. 2 All three of them have been expressly 3 attacked in the complaint, and fairness dictates they 4 should have an opportunity to be heard. 5 Thank you. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 7 Mr. Frederick, you have 2 minutes. 8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF 10 MR. FREDERICK: I have four points, 11 Mr. Chief Justice. First -12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me, are you seeking 13 injunctive relief out of any of the three intervenors? 14 MR. FREDERICK: No. We seek an injunction 15 enjoining the interbasin transfer statute to the extent 16 it exceeds North Carolina's equitable apportionment. We 17 are here to get our fair share of the river vis-à-vis 18 North Carolina. 19 And Duke's CRA application expressly 20 disclaims any -- any ability to go into the interbasin 21 transfer. That's at page 20, footnote 14, of our motion 22 for leave to file exceptions. 23 The FERC has said it will not affect, in 24 giving its license, the equitable apportionment action 25 now pending before you.

1 In Duke's CRA, at paragraph 39.9, it says it 2 does not affect State water uses. So the only issue 3 here is whether or not those expressed disclaimers 4 should be given effect when South Carolina is simply 5 seeking to determine, as between the two States, the 6 rights. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it affects the 8 agreement on which the license is based. The license 9 was based upon a very hard negotiated agreement among a 10 number of entities. 11 MR. FREDERICK: The license hasn't been 12 issued, Justice Scalia. It's still pending. 13 And that's what FERC has before it, and FERC 14 has said that the CRA will not affect what license is 15 issued, but I want to go back to a fundamental -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you willing to 17 concede that if whatever you ask for here affects that 18 license, once its issued, that then Duke's 19 intervention is proper? 20 MR. FREDERICK: No, because the United 21 States can enter -- can affect the interests and 22 represent the interests of its licensees. 23 Duke's interest is completely derivative of 24 the United States' power to confer a license on an 25 energy producer. And the United States here is saying,
58 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 no, they should not be allowed to intervene. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought Duke said the 3 problem is not the United States -- so much the United 4 States granting a license. It's the license we 5 requested was based upon a negotiated agreement among a 6 number of entities, and that agreement goes out the 7 window once -- on the basis of this lawsuit. 8 MR. FREDERICK: The agreement is a private 9 contract among various water users, and it is no 10 different than the fact that all users of this river 11 will be affected, one way or the other, by whatever 12 decree this Court issues, whether they are on the South 13 Carolina side or the North Carolina side. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 15 The case is submitted. 16 (Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the case in the 17 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
