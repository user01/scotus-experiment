 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 now in No. 90 -- it's 02-9065, Shakur Muhammad, also known
 5 as John Mease v. Mark Close.
 6 Ms. Beckwith.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORINNE BECKWITH
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MS. BECKWITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
 10 may it please the Court:
 11 The petitioner in this case, Shakur Muhammad, is
 12 a state prisoner who has brought a civil rights action
 13 alleging that a prison guard framed him on a false
 14 disciplinary charge in retaliation for his having 15 exercised his constitutional right to seek redress in the
 16 courts for this same prison guard's previous misconduct. 
 17 For three reasons, this Court should not engraft onto this
 18 type of Section 1983 claim a favorable termination
 19 requirement that would make this prisoner have to win his
 20 claim in another forum before he can seek his remedy in
 21 Federal court.
 22 First, the favorable termination requirement is
 23 a habeas protecting advice - device - that was borne of
 24 this Court's recognition that Congress would not have
 25 wanted a general civil rights action to be the vehicle for

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 undoing a state criminal judgment, particularly given the
 2 more specific habeas exhaustion requirement.
 3 Second, extending the favorable termination
 4 requirement beyond this original rationale lacks any basis
 5 in the statute's terms or history, and it's devoid of the
 6 kind of common law pedigree that might suggest Congress
 7 envisioned a broader application to cases that do not look
 8 like habeas cases in that they don't involve a direct or
 9 an indirect challenge to the fact or duration of custody.
 10 And finally, any remaining qualms about
 11 Congress' intent are resolved by the Prison Litigation
 12 Reform Act, where, after carefully weighing the interests
 13 of overburdened courts and of prison officials, Congress
 14 imposed an administrative exhaustion requirement, not a 15 favorable termination requirement.
 16 QUESTION: But I don't understand this about this
 17 case. I'm having an awfully hard time understanding this
 18 case, and - and it seemed to me what had happened was that
 19 the - your client, who's certainly well represented, he is
 20 sitting there at lunch and he makes some faces or gestures
 21 and the prison guard then has him up for a couple of
 22 charges and he basically is acquitted of the more serious
 23 one and they punish him for the more - less serious,
 24 threatening behavior, no, it's insolence or something like
 25 that.

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 He never says a word about retaliation, never
 2 says a word about it. He never appeals, which he could
 3 have done, his conviction. He never says to the prison
 4 authorities, hey, throw this out. The whole thing was
 5 based on the guard's desire to retaliate. And now
 6 suddenly have his - not having done any of that, we're in
 7 Federal court, and the Federal magistrate says, you know,
 8 he has no evidence of retaliation, or at least not enough.
 9 And now we're up here arguing about Heck v.
 10 Humphrey, sort of like the Finnegan's Wake of the habeas
 11 corpus law, and I - I can't really understand how we even
 12 got here. I - I don't understand why, if you're right,
 13 this isn't an unexhausted claim, or at least the
 14 magistrate said you don't - your client, unfortunately for 15 him, has not enough evidence. How do we get into this?
 16 QUESTION: Well, I suppose one of the reasons you
 17 got into it was that the Sixth Circuit said that you had -
 18 had to comply with Heck against Humphrey, and you didn't
 19 agree with it.
 20 MS. BECKWITH: Well, that's right, and you know,
 21 this is undoubtedly a valid First Amendment retaliation
 22 claim. The idea here is our - our client is saying, you
 23 know, he - he made perfectly appropriate allegations in
 24 the courts against this prison - this prison guard in
 25 prior lawsuits, and the guard set out to get him -

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Can we reach this - I can't reach the
 2 Sixth - the question that the circuit thought was here. I
 3 don't see what we're supposed to say. What are we
 4 supposed to say? That - that this unexhausted claim,
 5 nonetheless, in 1983 states a claim?
 6 MS. BECKWITH: It's not - I don't believe it's an
 7 -
 8 QUESTION: If I said what I said, is that correct
 9 what I've said?
 10 MS. BECKWITH: I don't think so, because it's not
 11 an unexhausted claim, and I believe the whole point of
 12 this case is the - is the misstatement of the law by the
 13 Sixth Circuit that would deem this a non-civil rights
 14 claim, basically a habeas claim completely contrary to 15 this Court's precedent in Preiser. We have, you know,
 16 Preiser v. Rodriguez, which set up the way, you know,
 17 followed up on by Heck v. Humphrey, the way that we decide
 18 which way these cases should go. Is this a civil rights
 19 claim? It should go through 1983. Or is it something
 20 we're worried might swallow the habeas exhaustion
 21 requirement?
 22 QUESTION: Well, does the Heck Humphrey issue
 23 that comes to us one that is affected by whether good-
 24 time credits are lost?
 25 MS. BECKWITH: The - whether good-time credits

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 are lost is a - is a consideration and whether this is a
 2 fact or duration case.
 3 QUESTION: Right.
 4 MS. BECKWITH: And this case is nothing about -
 5 QUESTION: So after all the briefing, the
 6 additional briefing that's gone on, do we know now for
 7 sure whether good-time credits are affected here?
 8 MS. BECKWITH: I think we do. The most important
 9 point on that question, Justice O'Connor, is something
 10 that I - a point I unfortunately made in a footnote
 11 instead of in the text, footnote 6 on page 5 of the yellow
 12 brief, which I wish had been the first sentence of my
 13 issue in bold, and that point is that it doesn't matter,
 14 because we're not - no part of our constitutional claim 15 challenges the insolence conviction.
 16 QUESTION: But is - is that really the point? 
 17 It's not what you challenge, it's the implication of what
 18 you want to be held.
 19 MS. BECKWITH: It - that's right.
 20 QUESTION: And those are quite different things. 
 21 I mean, if in fact good-time credits are lost, even though
 22 you are not asking for any adjudication on good-time
 23 credits, then it necessarily follows that the length of
 24 the sentence can be affected, and it necessarily follows
 25 that at some point there could be a habeas claim because

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the individual was not being released.
 2 MS. BECKWITH: That's right, but there's nothing
 3 about this claim that would ever, you know, ever lead to
 4 the result, under the test necessarily imply the
 5 invalidity of the deprivation of good-time credits, which,
 6 by the way, I don't believe we were deprived of good-time
 7 credits, because of the reasons I state in my brief. Our
 8 client is a habitual offender and this claim was not
 9 raised in the lower court but -
 10 QUESTION: Well, let - let's - could we just make
 11 a short excursus there? Assuming that no good-time
 12 credits are lost with respect to the minimum sentence, the
 13 point of - determining the earliest point at which he
 14 could be paroled, isn't it the case under state law that 15 good-time credits still would be applied to the maximum
 16 sentence?
 17 MS. BECKWITH: That - that is true. I don't
 18 believe that would ever -
 19 QUESTION: Then - then isn't that the end of your
 20 argument -
 21 MS. BECKWITH: I don't think so.
 22 QUESTION: - because doesn't it - I mean, let me
 23 just finish -
 24 MS. BECKWITH: Sure.
 25 QUESTION: - my - my question so you know where

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 I'm going. If - if - if the good-time credits would apply
 2 to the maximum sentence, then it seems to me that if he is
 3 not released at the point at which he says he should be
 4 entitled to good-time credits, he's got a habeas claim.
 5 MS. BECKWITH: I don't think that - I think that
 6 that aspect of the claim, you know, aside from waiver and
 7 aside from not challenging the conviction that led to the
 8 good-time credits, if they exist, is still not true, I
 9 don't think. It - it's too hypothetical. Most of these
 10 cases are like Preiser, where there would be immediate
 11 release. He has to serve his minimum sentence under
 12 Michigan law, so he's not ever going to get out earlier
 13 than his minimum. He - those will not be shortened by
 14 good-time credits.
 15 After that, he's going to see the parole board
 16 several times. He's going to be 103 years old when he
 17 hits his maximum sentence. The likelihood that he would
 18 actually not be dismissed until his maximum sentence, you
 19 know, be discharged as opposed to paroled earlier than
 20 that and have his sentence terminated long before his
 21 maximum, you know, just makes it impossible that this
 22 would be anything but hypothetical -
 23 QUESTION: Well, but for ease of judicial
 24 administration, do we really want to have to look at how
 25 old he's going to be and all of these things? Is it not

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 possible to say at the end of the day, good-time credits
 2 still apply to the maximum, so you're out of here?
 3 MS. BECKWITH: Well, that may be true in another
 4 case, but it's not true in our case, because we're not
 5 challenging, you know, nothing about our constitutional
 6 claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of that
 7 insolence conviction.
 8 QUESTION: Well, sticking with Justice O'Connor's
 9 question, suppose good-time credits were involved here,
 10 but insofar as the prisoner is concerned, it was wholly
 11 peripheral, and assume that the good-time credits would
 12 not click into operation for another 20 years. Would it
 13 make sense for us to insist on Heck v. Humphrey in those
 14 circumstances?
 15 MS. BECKWITH: In - I mean, I think that - that
 16 Preiser created a clean line, and this Court has decided
 17 repeatedly that good-time - the loss of good-time credits
 18 falls on the fact or duration side of that line, and I
 19 think it makes sense to continue to maintain that clean
 20 line, and it's the kind of thing where good-time credits
 21 are the hard case. There's -
 22 QUESTION: So you think it does - so you think
 23 that if good-time credits were unequivocally involved
 24 here, that the Heck rule would apply?
 25 MS. BECKWITH: I don't - I - I think that's what

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 this Court's precedents would suggest. There might be
 2 room for reconsideration of the good-time credits in the
 3 future when it - when it starts to get real hypothetical
 4 or when there - if there might be some abuses, such as
 5 prison, you know, evidence that prisons were, you know,
 6 had the perverse incentive of tacking on good-time credits
 7 to -
 8 QUESTION: Well, this is - this is very strange
 9 when we - when the original idea, I thought, of Heck was
 10 typing the kind of claim. I think the Court said in that
 11 case, this is not a prison condition case like my dietary
 12 law is not observed, am I not getting medical treatment,
 13 but it - it is like - there was an analogy to malicious
 14 prosecution, and here this has the same flavor, that this 15 is - the complaint is that this guard had it in for me,
 16 and there were trumped up charges.
 17 And the way you get around - would you say
 18 you're not really attacking the insolence, what he - he
 19 was convicted, so you're only concerned with the six days
 20 pre-hearing detention, but I don't see how you can, in all
 21 candor, chop up your complaint that way, because if the
 22 officer hadn't been retaliatory, the officer wouldn't have
 23 confronted him in the first place, he wouldn't have been
 24 insolent, and nothing would happen. So how you can say
 25 is, well, we'll accept the insolence but really we don't

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 because this is a retaliation and there never would have
 2 been any charge at all.
 3 MS. BECKWITH: Well, I - that's - part - along
 4 the lines of the argument the respondent makes in trying
 5 to use a - sort of a but-for kind of take, or test, or a
 6 relevance kind of test, but that is not the test. The
 7 test is whether the claim, the constitutional claim, would
 8 necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or
 9 sentence -
 10 QUESTION: I - I thought your response to that
 11 was that provocation was no defense to the charge -
 12 MS. BECKWITH: That's right.
 13 QUESTION: - to the charge of insolence.
 14 MS. BECKWITH: The respondent is - is arguing 15 that - that it goes to credibility. Credibility is not
 16 enough. That's about relevance or admissibility.
 17 QUESTION: But is not your position, and I don't
 18 know that the other side has contested it, that
 19 provocation would not have been a defense to the charge of
 20 insolence?
 21 MS. BECKWITH: That's right. There's no -
 22 QUESTION: And therefore, your provocation claim
 23 does not invalidate the insolence conviction.
 24 MS. BECKWITH: There's - there's - that's
 25 correct, Justice Scalia. There's no way of litigating -

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: How - how do I decide that, because
 2 that, it seems to me, is why I kept thinking I'm having
 3 trouble with this case? 
 4 MS. BECKWITH: Well -
 5 QUESTION: It is inconceivable to me that under
 6 any law of any place that if a guard has gone and brought
 7 this whole thing about as a way of retaliating against a
 8 First Amendment right, I can't imagine a tribunal that
 9 wouldn't throw out the whole thing. I mean, I know you
 10 say, oh no, that isn't what they would have done. If he
 11 had gone to that disciplinary body and it said, look, I
 12 have proof here that this is total fake by the guard in
 13 retaliation for my First Amendment right, what that body
 14 would have said is, we convict you still of insolence but 15 not of the greater charge.
 16 That to me is inconceivable, but whether that's
 17 so or not is a pure matter of state law, and - and it
 18 seems to me that this case then turns on a pure matter of
 19 state law, because I think if it is totally separate maybe
 20 you're right. If it isn't totally separate, I don't see
 21 how you could be right.
 22 MS. BECKWITH: And it is. I have several answer
 23 that. It is totally separate. You - you can't litigate
 24 the retaliation claim in - in a - in a prison misconduct
 25 hearing, just as Rodney King couldn't -

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: You couldn't - you couldn't say,
 2 hearing examiner in the prison, I want to tell you
 3 something. The guard's doing this because I filed some
 4 earlier claims against him. What - what would be so hard
 5 about doing that?
 6 MS. BECKWITH: In fact, we actually - the hearing
 7 officer himself, in his deposition, which is at joint
 8 appendix 102 to 103, indicates he - he - retaliation was
 9 not a defense. It might go to credibility, but he can't
 10 consider that -
 11 QUESTION: No, but that's a - that's an issue of
 12 fact. And the thing that's bothering Justice Breyer is
 13 the same thing that's bothering me, and that is it seems a
 14 - it seems like a very strange statement of law to say 15 that there would be no retaliation defense, and if - and
 16 yet it seems to me you've got to say that in order to
 17 avoid Heck and Humphrey. So what's your basis for saying
 18 it? Do you have -
 19 MS. BECKWITH: It's -
 20 QUESTION: - any state law authority for saying
 21 that so that we could make that assumption that you are
 22 correct in your statement when we decide this case?
 23 MS. BECKWITH: To tell you the truth, I just
 24 assumed it as - as a logical matter. It's like, as I was
 25 saying before, Rodney -

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: You assumed that in - in the - in the
 2 disciplinary proceeding for - that, let's say, in a
 3 disciplinary proceeding for insolence, he would not be -
 4 the prisoner would not have the opportunity of saying, he
 5 got me into this situation in retaliation for filing these
 6 actions? You just assumed that?
 7 MS. BECKWITH: Right. It's just like assault on
 8 a police officer. If you're arrested because you're black
 9 and then you assault that police officer, you - you know,
 10 your - your 1983 claim on the illegal arrest is not, you
 11 know, it's - it's separate and apart from -
 12 QUESTION: But we're talking here about
 13 insolence. I mean, he gave him a dirty look or something
 14 or other.
 15 MS. BECKWITH: The - the hearing officer himself
 16 said that -
 17 QUESTION: Well, is there any state law authority
 18 that we could look to?
 19 MS. BECKWITH: I'm not aware of any and I'm sorry
 20 that I -
 21 QUESTION: Well, it doesn't seem unreasonable to
 22 me. A police officer who's charged with a civil rights
 23 violation for - for whacking a demonstrator cannot please
 24 - plead as a defense, I was provoked. Doesn't matter if
 25 you're provoked, you're not supposed to do - do the act,

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and I don't know why it would be any different with - with
 2 a prison inmate if - if he was provoked -
 3 QUESTION: But he doesn't admit that.
 4 QUESTION: - to resist the provocation. 
 5 MS. BECKWITH: And in any event -
 6 QUESTION: What's so unreasonable about that?
 7 MS. BECKWITH: - I think that what - whether we
 8 challenge the - the misconduct - the result of the
 9 misconduct proceeding in this case is really not relevant
 10 because -
 11 QUESTION: Well, his - his complaint doesn't say
 12 the kind of thing you just said. I think his complaint
 13 says, I'm sitting there, the officer made some faces,
 14 lured me into this whole thing, and then what he charged 15 me with was false. So I - I didn't see - it's what
 16 Justice Ginsburg, I think, was talking about at the
 17 beginning. I'm just - maybe you have nothing else to say
 18 on it, but I saw this being chopped up. I saw one
 19 incident, it being chopped up as if there were several
 20 things, one insolence, one threatening behavior, and then
 21 separating that out, and I got totally confused about the
 22 Heck v. Humphrey part, the exhaustion part -
 23 MS. BECKWITH: The - the complaint is very clear. 
 24 I mean, the gist - the most tangible part of - of the
 25 complaint is that I was overcharged, you know, and I had

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to do pre-hearing detention, six days in pre-hearing
 2 detention that I would not otherwise have had to do
 3 because this guard was retaliating against me for suing
 4 him, for exercising -
 5 QUESTION: This is the amended complaint. It was
 6 not his original complaint, and one of the many puzzling
 7 features in this case is the Sixth Circuit is addressing
 8 the original complaint, where this man says, I want the
 9 whole thing expunged, not that, yes, I was insolent, but I
 10 wasn't engaged in threatening behavior. The initial
 11 complaint said, this officer retaliated against me, the
 12 whole thing is no good, court, expunge the discipline. 
 13 And it was only in the amended complaint that they came up
 14 with this theory, oh, insolence was all right, and the 15 only thing that we're attacking is the threatening
 16 behavior.
 17 MS. BECKWITH: Well, the two complaints are
 18 actually very similar, maybe identical, except for the -
 19 removing the request for expungement. And, of course, the
 20 Sixth Circuit's -
 21 QUESTION: Well, isn't that a rather significant
 22 difference, because that says the whole thing is no good,
 23 the insolence is no better than the threatening, the whole
 24 thing is no good?
 25 MS. BECKWITH: Mr. Muhammad was - was not

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 represented by counsel. He was - he was working pro se,
 2 and he amended his complaint. The amended complaint was
 3 accepted and that's - that's the complaint that's - that's
 4 before -
 5 QUESTION: But that's not what - that isn't the
 6 complaint that was before the Sixth Circuit, so at a
 7 minimum, shouldn't we send it back to the Sixth Circuit -
 8 9 MS. BECKWITH: No.
 10 QUESTION: - and say, look, you looked at the
 11 wrong complaint?
 12 MS. BECKWITH: Well, it was the complaint that
 13 was before the Sixth Circuit. They just made a factual
 14 error, and I think both parties agree it was a factual 15 error, but it's one that didn't matter.
 16 QUESTION: Nonetheless, they ruled on a complaint
 17 that is not the one he was complaining about.
 18 MS. BECKWITH: But - but it doesn't matter,
 19 because they relied on Huey v. Stine and the case law in
 20 the Sixth Circuit. It wouldn't matter whether you asked
 21 for expungement or not if you are challenging the result,
 22 which the Sixth Circuit thought -
 23 QUESTION: Excuse me. All of this is relevant
 24 why? Because of the issue of whether he's lost any good-
 25 time credit, isn't that right?

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. BECKWITH: I don't -
 2 QUESTION: Wasn't that issue waived by the other
 3 side and wasn't - wasn't there a finding? As I understand
 4 it, there was a finding by a - by the magistrate that
 5 plaintiff is no longer in the more restrictive custody of
 6 toplock or administrative segregation, nor in the more
 7 extended custody that would still faced him had he lost
 8 any good-time credit, and an issue was never made by the
 9 other side as I understand it, nor before the Sixth
 10 Circuit, that he had lost any - any good-time credit. Am
 11 I wrong in that?
 12 MS. BECKWITH: That's absolutely right. The
 13 issue wasn't presented -
 14 QUESTION: So it's waived. 
 Why should we get 15 into that here?
 16 MS. BECKWITH: Right. And if - but if -
 17 QUESTION: Especially having granted cert on a -
 18 on - on a significant question, to which that - that is -
 19 is preliminary.
 20 MS. BECKWITH: That's correct, Justice Scalia,
 21 and if good-time credits are not at issue, it doesn't
 22 matter if we're challenging the insolence conviction,
 23 because nothing about this claim is going to affect the
 24 fact or duration of - of confinement, so that, you know -

1 QUESTION: Though the state does dispute you on
 2 the good-time credit, does it not?
 3 MS. BECKWITH: The state does dispute. You know,
 4 I think they're wrong for four reasons.
 5 QUESTION: But too late, but too late. Isn't
 6 that your point? They dispute you, but too late.
 7 MS. BECKWITH: That is my point. I mean, that is
 8 my best point. My second best point -
 9 QUESTION: Okay. If you're right on that point,
 10 then it's the easiest case ever, you're obviously right. 
 11 If it has nothing to do with good-time credit -
 12 MS. BECKWITH: Well -
 13 QUESTION: - if you can chop up the - the action
 14 in that way, if all you're complaining about is six days 15 that he spent in pre-trial detention and your winning on
 16 that would have nothing to do with anything else, would
 17 not set aside the rest of the - of the loss of good time
 18 or anything else, then you're obviously right.
 19 MS. BECKWITH: That's right.
 20 QUESTION: That's what she says.
 21 (Laughter.)
 22 QUESTION: Why is it an issue for us?
 23 MS. BECKWITH: I agree. It's an issue because
 24 the respondent is trying to push the test of, you know, of
 25 Heck v. Humphrey into the context of misconduct

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 proceedings, regardless of the punishment imposed. They
 2 say even -
 3 QUESTION: You don't - you don't say that Heck
 4 against Humphrey should never apply to misconduct
 5 proceedings, do you?
 6 MS. BECKWITH: No.
 7 QUESTION: You just say it shouldn't have -
 8 MS. BECKWITH: As in Edwards, it should
 9 definitely apply when good-time credits are lost or
 10 something else happens, you know, in the proceeding. I
 11 can't imagine what besides good-time credits, but if fact
 12 or duration is affected - in this case, fact or duration
 13 was not affected. This is a classic civil rights claim. 
 14 We're talking about the First Amendment. It could have
 15 been about religion. It could have been about race.
 16 QUESTION: Know what is very strange about this
 17 case is you've got these two threshold requirements. If
 18 it's a habeas line, then you can't skirt exhausting state
 19 judicial remedies. If it's a prison condition case, then
 20 you have the PLRA, you have to exhaust the internal
 21 remedies. Here, you didn't do either. I mean, if you
 22 take it on your case, this is really in the prison
 23 conditions line. You didn't even appeal internally.
 24 MS. BECKWITH: But that's - that's not at issue
 25 in this case. The - the respondent complained in the

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 courts below about exhaustion. It was considered by the
 2 lower court. The respondent said, you didn't seek
 3 rehearing, and the magistrate judge said, I disagree with
 4 you, he didn't have to seek rehearing because he's not
 5 complaining about the insolence -
 6 QUESTION: But, nonetheless, you are saying that
 7 this is a case that can go into court under 1983 even
 8 though there was - it's not on the habeas side so you
 9 don't have to exhaust the judicial remedies. It's not on
 10 the prison conditions side and you don't have to - you
 11 don't have to exhaust internal administrative remedies.
 12 MS. BECKWITH: Justice Ginsburg, I absolutely
 13 disagree. He did exhaust. This was a question -
 14 QUESTION: What did he exhaust?
 15 MS. BECKWITH: He - he did everything he needed
 16 to do. The magistrate judge held that and the district
 17 judge affirmed that and it wasn't appealed -
 18 QUESTION: Where? Because it seems to me that he
 19 didn't. He didn't ask for anything.
 20 MS. BECKWITH: In -
 21 QUESTION: He said - and he said, indeed, I'm not
 22 challenging, I'm not challenging the insolence conviction.
 23 MS. BECKWITH: Record 68, the district court
 24 record in 68, unfortunately it's not in the joint appendix
 25 at - at 8 to 9 - pages 8 to 9, the magistrate held that

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Mr. Muhammad exhausted, without seeking rehearing he
 2 exhausted. And there was also a -
 3 QUESTION: But can you tell me exactly what that
 4 was, because I don't see how he - he had?
 5 MS. BECKWITH: Well, the -
 6 QUESTION: He might have said he didn't need to
 7 exhaust.
 8 MS. BECKWITH: No, the - the - the government
 9 filed a brief, a motion to dismiss, saying, you know, many
 10 things, but one of the things was he didn't exhaust his
 11 administrative remedies and they said because he didn't
 12 seek rehearing, respondent, or the - Mr. Muhammad
 13 responded, I didn't have to seek rehearing because I'm not
 14 complaining about the insolence. 
 I agree I'm guilty of 15 insolence. And the magistrate agreed. That's the end of
 16 exhaustion.
 17 QUESTION: Exactly. But did he exhaust
 18 administrative remedies for what he's complaining about
 19 here, which is -
 20 MS. BECKWITH: Right. There was no -
 21 QUESTION: - which is not the insolence
 22 conviction, but rather the sixth - the six day lockdown or
 23 whatever he had pending the hearing on the higher charge.
 24 MS. BECKWITH: As far as we know, he exhausted
 25 everything that he needed to exhaust.

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, how - how could that be,
 2 because -
 3 MS. BECKWITH: The government -
 4 QUESTION: I know they said that, and that's one
 5 of the reasons I'm having difficulty. You would have
 6 thought that if he was retaliated against, he would have
 7 said to the hearing examiner, I was retaliated against me,
 8 the whole thing is no good, I had six days that I spent,
 9 at least deduct the six days from the seven days
 10 additional punishment you're giving me. He didn't say
 11 that. Nobody knew a thing about it. He didn't ask for a
 12 rehearing. He didn't ask a judge - I mean -
 13 MS. BECKWITH: I -
 14 QUESTION: - what I'm worried about is writing an 15 opinion in this that says you're completely right, and in
 16 the course of doing that by every assumption I have to
 17 make, so mixing up the law that nobody can understand what
 18 it is.
 19 MS. BECKWITH: I understand. There - there's no
 20 doubt that the PLRA requires exhaustion of administrative
 21 remedies. It's not at issue in this case. It's not
 22 jurisdictional. Every circuit court to consider the issue
 23 has said it's not jurisdictional. The government raised
 24 the - the question. The lower court considered it. They
 25 - they ruled in our favor. It's not a part of this case

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 anymore.
 2 QUESTION: Was it raised on appeal?
 3 MS. BECKWITH: It was not raised on appeal.
 4 QUESTION: Was it raised in the brief in
 5 opposition?
 6 MS. BECKWITH: In - in cert?
 7 QUESTION: To the petition for cert?
 8 MS. BECKWITH: No.
 9 QUESTION: Not the state, from the district court
 10 or the court of appeals?
 11 MS. BECKWITH: That's right, but it was not part
 12 of - of the government's response, failure to exhaust. It
 13 was decided in the lower court. It's - it's over.
 14 QUESTION: Is - is it clear that the wrong of 15 which he's complain - complains - is one of the wrongs set
 16 forth in the Prison Litigation Reform Act, or is this - is
 17 this some -
 18 MS. BECKWITH: Yes. And in fact, that - that's
 19 one of our arguments that the Prison Litigation Reform Act
 20 reaffirms the - the clean line that was created in
 21 Preiser. You have fact or duration claims and you have
 22 conditions claims, Prison Litigation Reform Act, in - in
 23 creating an exhaust - an administrative exhaustion
 24 requirement for conditions claims, you know, indicates
 25 that this is the kind of claim that needs to exhaust.

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: If he had been charged initially just
 2 with insolence instead of threatening behavior, that is
 3 bondable, but that doesn't mean that he would have been
 4 bonded, right? That's a discretionary determination.
 5 MS. BECKWITH: That's right.
 6 QUESTION: So it might have been the very same
 7 thing. The officer might have said, this is a bad guy,
 8 don't let him out until after the hearing. So, in one
 9 case, he can't get out because it's mandatory pre-trial
 10 detention. In the other - so this case is not about he
 11 had a right to be free, or free in the prison population
 12 those six days, but he could have argued that he should
 13 have been not locked up. Is that's what the - that's the
 14 whole thing that this case is about, right?
 15 MS. BECKWITH: I mean, his - his claim is a First
 16 Amendment retaliation claim. The damages are this, you
 17 know, the chilling effect, the six days of pre-hearing
 18 detention, but that's just a remedial question. The claim
 19 is a valid one.
 20 QUESTION: I thought he's suing for damages and
 21 that's the only thing he's suing for, not injunctive,
 22 nothing else. All he wants is money.
 23 MS. BECKWITH: That's right. That's right.
 24 QUESTION: And what he wants money is for the six
 25 days that he might have spent anyway.

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. BECKWITH: He wouldn't have spent it anyway,
 2 and you can see from the joint appendix at page 58, credit
 3 was not given -
 4 QUESTION: No, I'm not talking about - it's
 5 bondable. There's nothing that shows that if the charge
 6 had simply been insolence they wouldn't have held him for
 7 the six days. He wasn't entitled not to be held.
 8 MS. BECKWITH: That's purely speculative and a
 9 matter of remedy, not - not the right. Mr. Chief Justice,
 10 if I may reserve the balance of my time.
 11 QUESTION: Very well, Ms. Beckwith.
 12 Mr. Casey, we'll hear from you.
 13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY
 14 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 15 MR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 16 the Court:
 17 I agree this is a very confusing case. We
 18 believe there are several reasons why summary judgment
 19 should be affirmed. The first is that because Mr.
 20 Muhammad did lose good-time credits, and because the
 21 nature of his challenge necessarily implies the invalidity
 22 of his misconduct determination, we think this case is
 23 controlled by Edwards v. Balisok.
 24 QUESTION: Why didn't you waive the question of
 25 good-time credits? I mean, why - you - you heard the

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 discussion before.
 2 MR. CASEY: Yes.
 3 QUESTION: Why - why is this something we should
 4 consider?
 5 MR. CASEY: First of all, we believe it's - it's
 6 a matter of straightforward statutory - not even
 7 interpretation, just reading the text of the Michigan
 8 statutes on good time, so it's not some fact issue that -
 9 that can be waived. Secondly -
 10 QUESTION: Excuse me? Only fact issues can be -
 11 legal issues can't be waived?
 12 MR. CASEY: No, it's not a legal argument. This
 13 is a straightforward - a straightforward application of
 14 the statutory language that says he did lose good time. 15 QUESTION: You did not - did you make the point
 16 below that the other side has to lose because he lost
 17 good-time credit?
 18 MR. CASEY: In our first motion for summary
 19 judgment, which was in 1998, we argued that Heck and
 20 Edwards controlled the case, that he was in effect
 21 challenging his good - or his misconduct hearing
 22 determination. The magistrate of the district court
 23 denied that motion, saying he is not challenging his
 24 misconduct. They agreed with his theory that this was a
 25 stand-alone retaliation case. So nobody - neither party

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 nor the district court nor the Sixth Circuit got into the
 2 fine points of the argument about whether this was a
 3 duration case or a conditions case.
 4 QUESTION: Then why isn't it waived?
 5 MR. CASEY: Well, we submit it's - it's a
 6 straightforward matter. It appears that the magistrate,
 7 in his opinion or his recommendation denying our motion
 8 for summary judgment, was under the impression he did not
 9 lose good time.
 10 QUESTION: Okay. And let's assume the magistrate
 11 was wrong. As I understand it, you did not go to the
 12 district court and say, the magistrate is wrong on this
 13 point and this point can be dispositive under Heck. Am I
 14 correct?
 15 MR. CASEY: We did not argue it in those terms. 
 16 We argued, as I say, the broader application of Heck and
 17 Edwards to the effect that he was - the nature of his
 18 challenge necessarily implied that his -
 19 QUESTION: But your position - your position as I
 20 understand was that even if he did not lose any good-time
 21 credits, that you - nevertheless, Heck controls.
 22 MR. CASEY: Yes.
 23 QUESTION: And that's the question -
 24 QUESTION: And that's what -
 25 QUESTION: - on which we granted certiorari. 

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 That's the question we - whether a plaintiff who wishes to
 2 bring a 1983 suit challenging only the conditions rather
 3 than the fact or duration of his confinement must satisfy
 4 Heck v. Humphrey. Now, that question is not in the case,
 5 if indeed the duration of his confinement is what is
 6 affected. And did you respond in the brief in opposition
 7 by saying, actually, this question is not even in the
 8 case?
 9 MR. CASEY: Yes. We -
 10 QUESTION: But even if you did, it's not in the
 11 case, none of it's in the case on the assumption your
 12 colleague there was making, or your opponent. Imagine
 13 that Mr. Muhammad wins his claim in the 1983 action, which
 14 the fact that they thought didn't have enough evidence 15 suggests he wouldn't, but suppose he did. Then he says,
 16 what I've showed was illegal under the Constitution or
 17 whatever, was, by being put in confinement for six days
 18 before my hearing, and my being charged with threatening
 19 behavior, that's it, that's all. The rest of it is all
 20 beside the point. I don't complain about my insolence. I
 21 don't complain about the seven days. I don't complain
 22 about the loss of good time. I don't complain about
 23 anything except the six pre-hearing days and the later
 24 dropped charge of threatening.
 25 So, if he's right about that, if you can do

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that, if in fact his winning on that in no way calls into
 2 question the conviction or the loss of good time or the
 3 seven later days for insolence, then under Heck, of course
 4 he can bring it.
 5 MR. CASEY: Yes, that - that's correct. Heck -
 6 the favorable termination requirement of Heck only applies
 7 when the nature of the challenge necessarily implies -
 8 QUESTION: Fine. So now I've got to the point
 9 that either she's obviously right or you're obviously
 10 right, and what it depends upon is a matter of state law,
 11 which is whether, as a matter of state law, should he win
 12 this claim, it is true that his showing the retaliation in
 13 respect to the six previous days and threatening in no way
 14 calls into question the validity of the insolence 15 conviction, the seven days, and the loss of good time. So
 16 I say, what is the answer to that question of state law? 
 17 Or a sister concluded - it's fairly obvious under the law
 18 that they are separate. Now what do you conclude?
 19 MR. CASEY: We argue that they are not separate,
 20 that the nature of this challenge does in fact necessarily
 21 imply the invalidity of his misconduct determination. 
 22 What he's challenging in this Federal lawsuit is
 23 retaliatory disciplinary action. That - that's the
 24 language that he used in his amended complaint. What he's
 25 saying is that the guard acted with an improper motive and

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that these adverse consequences flowed from that. The
 2 only adverse consequences that he's alleging are involved
 3 in the misconduct hearing. So we don't think that the
 4 fact that he was found guilty of insolence and not
 5 threatening behavior has any bearing at all on this
 6 question. It was one incident, one charge that this
 7 particular hearing officer felt should be reduced to a
 8 lower charge, but the nature of his challenge, if - if Mr.
 9 Muhammad is correct that this guard acted
 10 unconstitutionally, there should not have been any
 11 misconduct charges, should not have been a hearing, should
 12 not have been any pre-hearing detention or post-hearing
 13 punishment.
 14 QUESTION: Is - is - is that so? 
 You - you think 15 it, as a matter of constitutional law, you - you could not
 16 - you could not say that a prisoner has no right to
 17 threaten a guard even if he - even if he claims to have
 18 been provoked or has no right to insolent behavior even if
 19 he claims to have been provoked? As a matter of
 20 constitutional law, the prison cannot have such rules?
 21 MR. CASEY: The Heck v. Humphrey analysis says
 22 that there were certain claims that are not cognizable on
 23 a money damage action under 1983. Our argument is this is
 24 such a claim. If a punishment imposed affects the
 25 duration of confinement, the loss of good time, then under

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Edwards v. Balisok, termination requires -
 2 QUESTION: I'm saying it - it does not affect it
 3 if he would have been convicted anyway, and the contention
 4 of the other side is that he was guilty of the offense,
 5 both the major offense, if he had been guilty of that, and
 6 the minor offense, regardless of whether there was
 7 provocation on the part of the guard.
 8 MR. CASEY: Correct. That - that's his claim. 
 9 Our argument is that -
 10 QUESTION: Well, why - why do you - why do you
 11 assert the opposite?
 12 MR. CASEY: Well, that - that implicates the
 13 elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution,
 14 as discussed in Heck and Edwards, and those elements 15 include favorable termination and probable cause.
 16 QUESTION: But I think what you're not - it isn't
 17 the issue of whether provocation is a defense to a charge
 18 of insolence. I thought what you were saying is that this
 19 whole string never would have happened, nothing would have
 20 happened. If he - if he establishes the retaliation, then
 21 none of this would have happened, and it's just one
 22 episode.
 23 MR. CASEY: Well, if - if he's correct that this
 24 retaliation is independent of the hearing process, that's
 25 - that's his argument. Our argument is that the only

33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 thing he's complaining about is the retaliatory action,
 2 and the retaliatory action was charging him with
 3 misconduct. He -
 4 QUESTION: Is not - not retaliation separate in
 5 the hearing process. You're saying, is his point that
 6 when the guard looked at him from outside the cafeteria
 7 and made faces at him, and then he came in, and then the
 8 prisoner stands up and gives him some very dirty looks,
 9 according to the guard. Now, if you can separate out
 10 there the retaliation, if you can separate out there what
 11 the guard did by way of retaliation, making some very bad
 12 faces through the window, and insolence under state law,
 13 which would exist even if the guard were badly motivated
 14 in making the bad faces, then you've got your two separate 15 things.
 16 MR. CASEY: Under Sixth Circuit law, to establish
 17 a claim for retaliation, there has to be protective
 18 conduct that the inmate engaged in and there has to be
 19 adverse action taken against that plaintiff that would
 20 deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to
 21 engage -
 22 QUESTION: Fine. And the - and the conduct -
 23 MR. CASEY: But that's -
 24 QUESTION: - of the prisoner that's retaliation
 25 is that - that - has to do with that -

34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CASEY: No, conduct of the guard.
 2 QUESTION: - would be his threatening look, but
 3 not his insolent look.
 4 MR. CASEY: If this situation had proceeded
 5 exactly as petitioner alleges up to the point where they
 6 were nose to nose for a few seconds and then they had both
 7 walked away, there would be no retaliation claim, there
 8 would be no constitutional violation at all. The only
 9 thing that gives rise to a constitutional right is the
 10 adverse action of charging him with misconduct. That's
 11 why we say that this charge is necessarily implicated in
 12 the hearing process. It necessary - necessarily
 13 implicates that his misconduct determination is invalid. 
 14 If he's right that there should have been no 15 charge at all, if he's right on that, then the Heck v.
 16 Humphrey analysis doesn't even come into play. We think
 17 he's wrong on that. The - the district court felt he was
 18 right on that and - and ruled against us on our Heck v.
 19 Humphrey motion. The Sixth Circuit in effect said we were
 20 right on that, that the nature of this challenge does
 21 implicate the hearing process, and under Sixth Circuit
 22 precedent, they said, therefore, it falls.
 23 QUESTION: But the Sixth Circuit was addressing a
 24 complaint that looked like it was attacking the whole
 25 thing, because it asked for expungement of the

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 disciplinary - of the disciplinary action. Why didn't you
 2 call to the - or whoever was representing Michigan at that
 3 stage - call to the attention of the Sixth Circuit that it
 4 had addressed the wrong complaint?
 5 MR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit issued its order. 
 6 The petitioner filed a motion for rehearing. Under the
 7 court rules, we're not permitted to respond to that, but
 8 our argument is that even though the Sixth Circuit -
 9 QUESTION: You could have made a motion to remand
 10 or something.
 11 MR. CASEY: We could have, but we did not. In
 12 retrospect, I wish many things had been done differently
 13 in this case.
 14 QUESTION: Well, do you aggrieve, looking at the 15 Sixth Circuit opinion, that it was examining the original
 16 complaint, not the amended complaint?
 17 MR. CASEY: It referred to the original
 18 complaint, but the - the holding of the Sixth Circuit on
 19 page 106 of the joint appendix, they say in an earlier
 20 Sixth Circuit case, and they quote it, in order to grant
 21 the plaintiff in this case the release he - relief he
 22 seeks, we would have to unwind the judgment of the state
 23 agency. That is the basis on which they affirmed the
 24 judgment.
 25 QUESTION: I thought you agreed that the Sixth

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Circuit was looking at the initial, original complaint,
 2 not the amended.
 3 MR. CASEY: That they - they mentioned the
 4 initial complaint and not the amended complaint. That's
 5 correct.
 6 QUESTION: Yeah.
 7 MR. CASEY: But we believe that the rationale
 8 that they used, that his challenge did implicate the
 9 validity of his misconduct hearing, is correct on both his
 10 original complaint and his amended complaint.
 11 QUESTION: May I ask you a hypothetical question? 
 12 Assume we had the case with the same facts except the
 13 remedy a different - if the, say the prison authorities
 14 had said you can't use your television set for 30 days and 15 that was the only remedy and otherwise everything else was
 16 the same, and he said it was - they did that in
 17 retaliation because I exercised my First Amendment rights. 
 18 If that were the discipline, would Heck v. Humphrey
 19 preclude relief in this case?
 20 MR. CASEY: Yes, we believe - that's the question
 21 the Court granted cert on. If a punishment affects only
 22 conditions -
 23 QUESTION: And that's the one we probably ought
 24 to hear some argument about.
 25 MR. CASEY: That's - that's correct. I - I

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 agree, Your Honor. We argue that -
 2 QUESTION: And why would it preclude relief in
 3 that case? That's what I'd be interested in hearing.
 4 MR. CASEY: Because as in the Edwards v. Balisok
 5 and - and Heck v. Humphrey, the proper method of analysis
 6 is to look to the most closely analogous common law tort,
 7 look to traditions of common law, public policy
 8 considerations in light of the purposes of Section 1983. 
 9 In Heck v. Humphrey and Edwards v. Balisok, the Court
 10 said, in the prison context - prison disciplinary context,
 11 the favorable termination requirement applies. On the
 12 facts of those cases, there was good time involved, so
 13 duration -
 14 QUESTION: More than the facts of the case, we 15 the reason we - we - we adopted that common law rule was
 16 to prevent a collision between 1983 and habeas corpus law
 17 and prevent 1983 from being used as an end-run around
 18 habeas corpus limitations.
 19 MR. CASEY: Again, on - on the facts of the case,
 20 that's - that was the situation presented, because in that
 21 case there was a collision between the habeas statutes and
 22 the 1983 -
 23 QUESTION: And that collision was - was in the
 24 reasoning of the Court. It isn't -
 25 MR. CASEY: Yes, it was. But additional

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 reasoning was based on common law traditions and we argue
 2 that that same rationale applies even if good time is not
 3 involved, even if it's just conditions of confinement as
 4 punishment.
 5 QUESTION: So that even if setting a - a ruling
 6 in favor of the plaintiff would not in any way call into
 7 question the prison disciplinary proceeding, it still
 8 should - Heck should still apply?
 9 MR. CASEY: No. If - if the nature of the
 10 challenge does not imply that the misconduct determination
 11 is invalid, then the Heck v. Humphrey analysis doesn't
 12 apply. It's not analogous to the common law tort of
 13 malicious prosecution. We don't assert that the favorable
 14 termination requirement applies to all conditions cases. 15 We say it only applies when a claim for money damages is
 16 attempted which - the nature of which necessarily implies
 17 that the misconduct hearing is invalid.
 18 QUESTION: Well, it looked like the Sixth Circuit
 19 is on the short side of a five-to-one split among the
 20 courts of appeals on how Heck v. Humphrey is to be
 21 applied, that the Sixth Circuit views it differently than
 22 the other circuits that have addressed it.
 23 MR. CASEY: I believe that's correct.
 24 QUESTION: Do you agree?
 25 MR. CASEY: I believe that's correct.

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Yeah, based on -
 2 QUESTION: How - how is -
 3 QUESTION: - its own Huey decision, and I really
 4 thought very likely that was why this Court granted cert
 5 here, to see whether the Sixth Circuit rule is out of step
 6 with what we said in Heck v. Humphrey.
 7 MR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit, and all of the
 8 court of appeals' decisions that have attempted to apply
 9 the Heck v. Humphrey analysis to conditions cases, are
 10 necessarily involved in - in extension of the Heck
 11 rationale to this other factual context, because Heck and
 12 Edwards involved good-time losses. I agree that's - we
 13 assume that's why the Court took the case. When we filed
 14 our brief in opposition, we suggested that there are these 15 alternative reasons why the Court should not grant cert. 
 16 One of them was the loss - that he did in fact lose good
 17 time, but -
 18 QUESTION: But, of course, that conceivably was
 19 waived, because you didn't get into it below. If we - if
 20 we disregard that and think that you waived this issue of
 21 good-time credits, and if we reach the merits on which I
 22 assumed we granted the case, then what justifies the Sixth
 23 Circuit rule? Do you say just because damages potentially
 24 are at issue that the 1983 claim can't go forward?
 25 MR. CASEY: A - a claim for damages cannot go

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 forward unless there's favorable termination. If his
 2 claim was for an injunction changing the hearing
 3 procedures somehow, as in Edwards, that type of claim
 4 could go forward.
 5 QUESTION: I don't see the difference in the
 6 Sixth Circuit rule anymore. What - in what respect is it
 7 in the minority? I thought you were reading now, as I
 8 heard you, the last or the next to last sentence in the
 9 opinion -
 10 MR. CASEY: That's - that's correct.
 11 QUESTION: - that the Sixth Circuit simply
 12 thought that if this individual wins, if Mr. Muhammad
 13 wins, they would have to unwind the entire judgment of the
 14 hearing, which would include the judgment having to do 15 with insolence.
 16 MR. CASEY: That's correct.
 17 QUESTION: And so if that's what they base it on
 18 -
 19 MR. CASEY: That's correct.
 20 QUESTION: - is their rule different from that of
 21 any other circuit?
 22 MR. CASEY: The way the Sixth Circuit is
 23 different from most of the other circuits is that they
 24 apply the Heck v. Humphrey analysis to punishments of
 25 conditions and not just to punishments affecting the

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 duration of confinement.
 2 QUESTION: What is the condition -
 3 QUESTION: They meaning the Sixth Circuit?
 4 MR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit applies it to
 5 conditions, punishments, and duration punishments.
 6 MR. CASEY: What do you mean by a conditions
 7 punishment?
 8 QUESTION: The - the punishments that Mr.
 9 Muhammad received were the loss of good time, confinement
 10 to administrative segregation, essentially remaining in
 11 his cell, plus loss of privileges for 30 days. So only the
 12 loss of good time affects the duration of his sentence -
 13 QUESTION: Thus, only the loss of good time could
 14 have been challenged in habeas?
 15 MR. CASEY: Correct.
 16 QUESTION: And the conditions couldn't have been
 17 challenged in habeas?
 18 MR. CASEY: Correct.
 19 QUESTION: And that's the distinction -
 20 MR. CASEY: The distinction in this case -
 21 QUESTION: - that the other circuits think is
 22 crucial?
 23 MR. CASEY: Correct. In - in conditions
 24 challenges, habeas corpus relief is not available, so
 25 there will be no other Federal court remedy if a Federal

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 civil rights action is not available.
 2 QUESTION: And it - it's your position that there
 3 should be no remedy whatever for this person?
 4 MR. CASEY: It's our position that if he is -
 5 QUESTION: If - if - we're disregarding the good-
 6 time credits. That's waived, that's out of here. Let's
 7 just make that assumption. And you say that he's out of
 8 luck on pursuing any remedy for anything else?
 9 MR. CASEY: Prisoners who seek to challenge the
 10 nature of their complaint seeks to challenge or call into
 11 - whose challenges necessarily imply that a prison
 12 misconduct is invalid, do not have a Federal Civil Rights
 13 Act cause of action, whether it - whether the punishment -
 14 15 QUESTION: And other circuits disagree. They say
 16 that in this case it would relate to conditions, and
 17 therefore, the 1983 suit could go forward.
 18 MR. CASEY: Correct.
 19 QUESTION: That's the difference?
 20 MR. CASEY: Correct. And the difference was
 21 created because the majority in Heck based much of its
 22 decision on a rationale of the common law. A concurring
 23 opinion in that case, signed by four justices, said, no,
 24 we're not going to base it on that rationale because that
 25 might mean that there would be no Civil Rights Act remedy

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 in any such case. Subsequently, in the Spencer v. Kemna,
 2 one of the judges who - or justices - who had been in the
 3 majority changed her mind and is now agreeing with the
 4 rationale of the concurring opinion in Heck. So that's
 5 why the Sixth Circuit, or that's why the courts of appeals
 6 are split on this. On the facts of Edwards and Heck it
 7 involved just duration claims, but depending on the
 8 rationale for the rule, it may or may not apply to
 9 conditions cases. We say it does apply to conditions cases
 10 because -
 11 QUESTION: And the condition here - and one thing
 12 is the abstract level on which you're speaking, the other
 13 is concretely what this case is about. This case is about
 14 six days spent in pre-hearing detention. 
 It's the only 15 thing that money is sought for. Now, we're told that
 16 insolence is bondable, threatening behavior is not. Does
 17 bondable mean it will be bond? What is the incidence? 
 18 What practically is the effect?
 19 MR. CASEY: Some - some major misconducts are
 20 mandatory non-bondable. Threatening behavior, the
 21 original charge, was mandatory -
 22 QUESTION: So insolence is not mandatory. What is
 23 the practice in the prison? Is it common to let people -
 24 MR. CASEY: On - on page 14 of the joint appendix
 25 we've quoted from the policy directive, and the standard

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is, if there is a reasonable showing that failure to do so
 2 would constitute a threat to the security or good order of
 3 the facility, so on a case-by-case basis, a prisoner
 4 charged with a bondable major misconduct could be placed
 5 in pre-hearing detention.
 6 QUESTION: Well, when you say bondable, I mean,
 7 you don't mean if a person posts a bond they're out on the
 8 street?
 9 MR. CASEY: No, no. That - that's the phrase
 10 used in these prison directives.
 11 QUESTION: But that's what this case is about,
 12 those six days when he was in administrative detention.
 13 MR. CASEY: Those are the six days for which he
 14 is seeking damages.
 15 QUESTION: And - and do you have, rather than
 16 being in the general prison population, do you have any
 17 statistical indication of - on charges of insolence, are
 18 people more often than not, or is it rare that they would
 19 be in administrative detention awaiting the hearing?
 20 MR. CASEY: I - I don't have the statistics of -
 21 the Department of Corrections probably could compile
 22 that, but I don't know. I do know that there were last
 23 year more than 72,000 major misconduct hearings of all
 24 kinds, bondable and non-bondable. I do not know how many
 25 of those 72,000 resulted in pre-hearing detention.

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: But was - was this argument raised
 2 below that there's no cause of action because there's no
 3 assurance that he wouldn't have been kept for six days
 4 anyway, even if it was bondable? You - you didn't defend
 5 on that ground, did you?
 6 MR. CASEY: It was not argued in those terms, no. 
 7 As I said, the case was argued -
 8 QUESTION: Why do we want to get into that? I -
 9 I don't understand.
 10 MR. CASEY: No. We did not argue the - the terms
 11 of the bond versus non-bondable, because it simply didn't
 12 come up.
 13 QUESTION: So suppose now - I think Justice
 14 O'Connor may be causing the light to dawn in my head 15 suppose you're right, suppose that there is just one ball
 16 of wax. Suppose the - this is all a waste of time trying
 17 to separate those two things. There's just one thing. 
 18 There's a conviction, all right?
 19 MR. CASEY: Correct.
 20 QUESTION: Now, we look to see what happens if he
 21 wins. If he wins, we set aside the whole conviction, but
 22 good time is out of it. And since good time is out of it,
 23 of course he can bring a 1983 action, because this wasn't
 24 the kind of thing that habeas was designed for. Habeas
 25 was about duration of - of staying in prison, and with

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 good time out of it, it doesn't matter whether it's one
 2 ball of wax or two. He can go in on 1983 since there's no
 3 conflict with the habeas statute. What's your response to
 4 that?
 5 MR. CASEY: Our response to that in - in - in
 6 response to the question that the Court granted certiorari
 7 on is that even if good time was not at issue in the case,
 8 if the only punishment he received affected the conditions
 9 of confinement, our argument is, it's still appropriate to
 10 look to the traditions of the common law and public policy
 11 considerations to determine whether a cause of action in
 12 those circumstances is cognizable in 1983. We've argued
 13 that it is not cognizable. If he is challenging the
 14 validity of his misconduct determination, that's analogous 15 to the common law tort of malicious prosecution.
 16 The elements of that tort require favorable
 17 termination before it can succeed. We believe that - that
 18 same element applies in a 1983 case. So if he does not
 19 get favorable termination of his prison misconduct, he
 20 cannot bring a suit for damages under 1983.
 21 QUESTION: It is essential to your argument, is
 22 it not, that provocation would be a defense?
 23 MR. CASEY: No.
 24 QUESTION: No?
 25 MR. CASEY: Whatever - whatever charge -

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: If provocation would - would not be a
 2 defense, then even if he establishes provocation, for
 3 which he can get damages, he would not be impairing the
 4 judgment against him.
 5 MR. CASEY: One of the elements of the
 6 constitutional cause of action for retaliation is adverse
 7 action against the prisoner because of his protected
 8 conduct. The adverse action in this case is not the
 9 staring down and the nose-to-nose confrontation. The
 10 adverse action is charging misconduct, and we say, if he's
 11 right in his complaint that there would not have been a
 12 misconduct charge but for this action, that necessarily
 13 implies that the misconduct proceeding is invalid, and
 14 that triggers the analogy to malicious prosecution and its 15 element of favorable termination.
 16 QUESTION: So that you say basically, the
 17 importance of Heck and Humphrey here is the way it says
 18 you ought to refer to common law analogies in analyzing
 19 whether there ought to be a 1983 action, and that has
 20 nothing to do in the final analysis with whether there's a
 21 collision between habeas corpus and 1983. That is an -
 22 that is an independent requirement of the way you go about
 23 analyzing 1983 actions.
 24 MR. CASEY: Yes, that's correct.
 25 QUESTION: So that even though there isn't a

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 habeas corpus problem, you still go through the same
 2 methodology?
 3 MR. CASEY: Correct. You say the same
 4 methodology applies whether it's just conditions or
 5 duration of confinement. If it's a -
 6 QUESTION: Are you essentially making an
 7 exhaustion of - of state remedies then? It seems to me -
 8 are you - you're not saying that this person would have
 9 no complaint, no Federal complaint, not in habeas, not in
 10 1983? Are you saying that -
 11 MR. CASEY: Yes.
 12 QUESTION: - or are you saying 1983 is premature?
 13 MR. CASEY: If he gets favorable termination. We
 14 say -
 15 QUESTION: Where does he get the favorable
 16 determination?
 17 MR. CASEY: The - if he got favorable termination
 18 by review of the misconduct - if he - if he had won at the
 19 misconduct or if he had appealed and won on appeal, that
 20 would be favorable termination.
 21 QUESTION: So you're saying essentially he hasn't
 22 exhausted his internal administrative remedies, and that's
 23 why the 1983 is improper?
 24 MR. CASEY: We say the - his failure to exhaust
 25 is another independent reason why he does not have -

49
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: You're saying he has to both exhaust
 2 and prevail?
 3 MR. CASEY: That's correct. They're independent
 4 requirements.
 5 QUESTION: And that seems somewhat inconsistent
 6 with at least the negative implication of the Federal
 7 statute, which says all he has to do is exhaust.
 8 MR. CASEY: Well, the - the Court addressed that
 9 question in Heck v. Humphrey, and it said that even if a
 10 person exhausts his remedies, if he has not favorably
 11 terminated, he cannot bring the lawsuit unless and until
 12 he gets favorable termination. They're - they're
 13 independent. The exhaustion requirement -
 14 QUESTION: Well, that's the Heck v. Humphrey's 15 gloss, but that's an additional requirement. Usually
 16 exhaustion does not require prevailing.
 17 MR. CASEY: Well, that's correct. That's
 18 correct. The - the reason he has to get favorable
 19 termination in this case is because of the analogy to -
 20 QUESTION: Yes.
 21 MR. CASEY: - malicious prosecution. 
 22 QUESTION: Right. It - it usually does not
 23 require prevailing, but it does require prevailing when -
 24 when your cause of action is that - that you have been
 25 subjected to the law improperly.

50
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

 3 MR. CASEY: Thank you very much.
 4 QUESTION: Ms. Beckwith, you have 3 minutes
 5 remaining.
 6 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CORINNE BECKWITH
 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 8 MS. BECKWITH: Turning to the actual question
 9 presented in this case, there is no justification for the
 10 Sixth Circuit's rule extending the Heck favorable
 11 termination requirement to prison hearings that don't
 12 involve the fact or duration of custody. Congress could
 13 have amended 1983 to say that, but we know from the PLRA
 14 they looked at the same considerations, they did something 15 different. The Sixth Circuit is an outlier here, as
 16 Justice O'Connor said, because there's no - there's no
 17 conflict with habeas in a - in a matter like this. 
 18 As to all of the other questions that have come
 19 up during this argument, this case came to this Court in
 20 the posture where there were no good-time credits and
 21 there was no exhaustion question. Now, we think we can
 22 overcome those problems, but I don't think this Court
 23 needs to.
 24 And the - the government has never cited any law
 25 that says the guard's retaliatory conduct violating Mr.

51
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Muhammad's First Amendment rights would have been a
 2 defense, and we know of none. They argued that it was -
 3 it was relevant to credibility. They argued that that was
 4 some kind of a but-for relationship, but victory in the
 5 1983 suit does not affect the adjudication for insolence
 6 in this claim. All of this only matters if good-time
 7 credits are at issue.
 8 And putting all of that aside, we just agree
 9 with Justice Breyer that then this is an easy case in our
 10 favor. If there are no further questions from the Court,
 11 we'd ask that you reverse the Sixth Circuit.
 12 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.
 13 Beckwith. The case is -
