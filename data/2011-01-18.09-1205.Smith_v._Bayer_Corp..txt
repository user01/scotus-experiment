3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next this morning in Case 09-1205, Smith versus Bayer 5 Corporation. 6 Mr. Monahan. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. MONAHAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. MONAHAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Petitioners Keith Smith and Shirley 12 Sperlazza were not named plaintiffs in the prior Federal 13 proceeding litigated by George McCollins. They never 14 received notice of that prior proceeding; they never 15 received an opportunity to appear and be heard; they 16 never received an opportunity to opt out; and they never 17 received an opportunity to appeal the decision denying 18 class certification. 19 No precedent of this Court would justify 20 treating -- treating people as parties under preclusion 21 principles under these circumstances. Recently, in 22 Taylor v. Sturgell, this Court addressed the rule 23 against nonparty preclusion and discussed the recognized 24 exceptions. The Court in that case discussed a properly 25 conducted class action as being one of the exceptions.

4 1 The Court, in discussing these preclusion 2 rules, noted that they are limited by due process 3 concerns, and the Court noted that the properly 4 conducted class action is an exception due to the due 5 process protections incorporated into Rule 23. 6 Obviously, this Court has discussed the due 7 process protections with class actions in prior cases, 8 particularly those dealing with 23(b)(3) classes in 9 cases such as Eisen and Shutts. The Court has noted 10 that whenever a class is certified notice must be 11 provided; the right to -- notice must be provided; they 12 must have the right to appear and be heard in person or 13 by counsel; they must have the right to opt out as well 14 as protection of adequate representations. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose a class action 16 based on diversity is filed in one of the Federal 17 districts in West Virginia, and the district court 18 denies class certification. The same plaintiff, the 19 same plaintiff's attorney, takes the old complaint, 20 writes in the name of the new named party, files exactly 21 the same complaint in another Federal -- in the other 22 Federal district in West Virginia. Would your argument 23 be the same? That can go forward, get another shot at 24 class certification? 25 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, under the -- yes,
Alderson Reporting Company

1 under those circumstances, as outlined by -- by Your

5

2 Honor.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: All you have to do is get

4 a new named plaintiff?

5 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, as long as it's not the

6 same party. If it's a different party -- and that -

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it could be the same

8 attorney?

9 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, it could be the same

10 attorney. This Court noted that in Taylor v. Sturgell,

11 in South -- South Central Bell v. Alabama, and also as

12 discussed in the Richards case.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would the -- would the

14 decision that's saying -- saying Rule 23 standards have

15 not been met, the individual issues predominate over the

16 common issue -- doesn't that deserve some measure of

17 respect when the same thing is tried again?

18 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor, but that

19 would be under stare decisis principles, we believe, and

20 that's the situation, since it is a different party,

21 since it's not the same party itself. And, certainly,

22 the district courts in West Virginia would look to other

23 district courts' opinions and would likely render them

24 persuasive -- or consider them persuasive under those

25 circumstances.

6 1 JUSTICE ALITO: But they have no obligation 2 to follow another district court opinion, do they? 3 MR. MONAHAN: Technically, no, Your Honor. 4 If the Fourth Circuit, for instance, had spoken on the 5 matter, though, and it was something that was decided by 6 the Fourth Circuit, or of course by this Court, then 7 clearly they would. And the - 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And this one was 9 determined by the multidistrict panel, right? 10 MR. MONAHAN: Yes. Yes, a district judge in 11 Minnesota. Yes, Your Honor. 12 Interestingly, in Taylor, this Court noted 13 that adopting a broad theory of virtual representation 14 based upon an identity of interests, adequate 15 representation, and a close relationship would -- would, 16 in essence, be equivalent to adopting a de facto class 17 action or recognizing a common law class action without 18 any of the procedural due process protections provided 19 by Rule 23. 20 Obviously, in dealing with these cases, the 21 main reason a certification is -- the main reason the 22 due process protection is provided upon certification is 23 to go ahead and justify binding the class members to any 24 judgment issued by the court at that point. Until you 25 have that, unless you have the certification and the due
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
7 1 process protections for a Rule 23(b)(3) class, until you 2 have those, the absent class members remain strangers to 3 the proceeding. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the absent class 5 members retain their individual right. I mean, they are 6 not being precluded as to their individual claim. It's 7 only they can't be a class representative. 8 MR. MONAHAN: That's -- that's true, Your 9 Honor. We submit, however, that any procedural rights 10 which have been recognized and adopted -- those 11 procedural rights, just as the substantive claim itself, 12 have to be adjudicated consistent with due process. And 13 West Virginia itself has adopted Rule 23 of the West 14 Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure, and that State has 15 the right to apply and interpret that rule as it sees 16 fit to manage its own docket and administrate its own 17 docket as it sees fit. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right to read the 19 supplemental brief as saying that now the West Virginia 20 Supreme Court agrees with the multidistrict panel on 21 what the content of West Virginia law is? 22 MR. MONAHAN: That's not correct, Your 23 Honor. All of the issues raised in our petition for 24 cert remain just as they were. At worst -- if White v. 25 Wyeth withstands petition for rehearing, at worst we
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
8 1 lose our CCPA claim. That certainly is a valuable claim 2 to us. I will not dispute that. But we also have a 3 common law fraud claim. We also have breach of warranty 4 claims, and those are still in existence. 5 And the critical fact of this case in that 6 regard is the question of whether or not a class may be 7 certified under West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure 8 has never been litigated, has never been decided by any 9 court. 10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Monahan, do you 11 mean by that that you would have a blanket rule that a 12 decision on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 can never 13 be preclusive as to a State Rule of Civil Procedure 23? 14 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I believe it would 15 depend upon whether or not that State has said that not 16 only are we going to look at these Federal decisions as 17 being persuasive, but we're going to consider ourself 18 bound by the decisions of the Fourth District or the 19 United States District Court for the Southern District 20 of West Virginia. 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose the State 22 says: We will not consider ourselves bound; we do have 23 our own law with respect to Rule 23, but sometimes we'll 24 go along with the Federal rule and sometimes we won't. 25 Is it then up to the courts to actually try to determine

1 whether the -- the West Virginia court in this case

9

2 would have gone along, would have interpreted its own

3 rule of civil procedure the same way that the Federal

4 court interpreted the Federal rule?

5 MR. MONAHAN: Well, for instance, what Your

6 Honor suggested is essentially what the West Virginia

7 Supreme Court of Appeals does. I mean, they will -

8 they will consider them to be persuasive. They will

9 consider them -- but in their In re Rezulin case, the

10 court noted -- the court actually criticized the circuit

11 judge for relying exclusively on Federal decisions

12 denying class certification in medical device or

13 prescription drug cases. And the court noted that, you

14 know, although we will look at those rules and they may

15 be persuasive, they are not binding or controlling on

16 us, and that's because we do not want our legal analysis

17 to be nothing more than a mere Pavlovian response to

18 Federal decisional rules.

19 JUSTICE ALITO: What is -- what is the

20 difference between the Federal law and the West Virginia

21 law on the class certification issue? Not the

22 application to this particular complaint, but as to the

23 -- the standard. What do you see as the difference

24 between the Federal standard and the West Virginia

25 standard?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
10 1 MR. MONAHAN: The main difference, Justice 2 Alito, is that our court has -- and they cite this in 3 In re Rezulin, for instance. They cite Newberg on Class 4 Actions as one of the authorities to support this 5 principle, but they note that in -- in our court that 6 normally challenges based upon reliance, causation, and 7 damages will not bar certification on a predominance 8 basis, because those go to the right of the individual 9 to recover, but not to the overall liability issues of 10 the defendant, which it believes can be addressed as 11 common issues in many cases and save the court an 12 extreme amount of time addressing those common issues. 13 Now, the court indicates that if individual 14 trials need to be conducted later on, on any of those 15 issues, if there are truly individual issues that need 16 to be resolved concerning those claims, individual 17 trials can be accomplished. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On the ground that the 19 court here, the Federal court, decided that there 20 weren't predominant issues based mostly on the fact 21 that, like the Virginia court has now, it's decided that 22 there is no economic loss, what were the differences? 23 What were the differences here? How would 24 the difference in standard play out here? 25 MR. MONAHAN: Well, for instance -- and this
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is an interesting aspect of this case -- that the

11

2 court's not only trying to bind us on the procedural

3 ruling but is also trying to bind us in a substantive

4 ruling as to what the elements of the claims in West

5 Virginia are and as to what's needed to prove those

6 claims.

7 For instance, the Eighth Circuit has -- has

8 held that, in looking at the district court's opinion,

9 that it has held that an actual physical injury is

10 required, that economic loss alone is not enough.

11 Clearly, that's not consistent with West Virginia law.

12 An economic loss alone can be sufficient. In West -

13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The -- I'm sorry. I

14 don't mean to cut you off. But you're really arguing

15 that due process requires the same treatment,

16 essentially, of notice and an opportunity to be heard

17 that we are giving to a substantive decision that blocks

18 a future member from pursuing his or her claim, correct?

19 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, very similar, Your Honor.

20 I mean, in this circumstance -- I mean, these rights are

21 provided. These procedural rights, once they are

22 created, are being provided, and they can't be taken

23 away without due process. West Virginia has recognized

24 the right to -- to proceed in our court under our rule,

25 and not -- you don't have a guarantee --
Alderson Reporting Company

12 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're almost treating 2 it as a property right, and -- and you're basically 3 saying we're equating it with, essentially, a property 4 right. 5 MR. MONAHAN: Well, I think -- I think what 6 I'm trying to say, Your Honor, is that these type of 7 procedural rights -- whenever you have a substantive 8 claim which is a property right, and you seek to 9 litigate them, you shall have available to you all the 10 Rules of Civil Procedure which have been adopted and 11 recognized, and those procedural elements of the claim 12 should be treated or adjudicated just the same as a 13 substantive claim, consistent with due process. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we disagree with you, 15 because there is a difference of some sort between 16 procedure and substantive rights, then what would 17 command the due process violation in a situation in 18 which the Federal litigation has applied essentially the 19 same standard that the State has and there has been 20 adequate representation on the procedural question, 21 where no substantive right of a plaintiff has been 22 extinguished? 23 That's a lot of conditions, but those are 24 the three conditions of this case. So, what in due 25 process requires that outcome, your outcome?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
13 1 MR. MONAHAN: Well, I believe that the 2 basic -- because we are not the same party, we believe 3 the basic elements of just the notice and the right to 4 be heard, which our party has never had. May I - 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're extinguishing a 6 substantive right. If I return to my question of what 7 makes a procedural right substantive - 8 MR. MONAHAN: Well, this particular 9 procedural right is very closely connected -- I mean, 10 one of the main purposes of a class action is to level 11 the economic playing field and to enable people with 12 small individual claims to aggregate them in order to 13 seek justice. Without those - 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually not true. The 15 plaintiff here received the same thing. The issue is 16 how much money the lawyers are going to receive, 17 really - 18 MR. MONAHAN: Well - 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because plaintiff 20 gets their attorney's fees, gets a statutory violation 21 amount, which is going to be the same whether it's in a 22 class action or an individual action, so it's really not 23 the plaintiff who stands to win. 24 MR. MONAHAN: No, Your Honor, what - 25 what -- the assumptions you just made I don't believe
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
14 1 are correct in this -- in this particular case, because, 2 one, obviously if we lose the CCPA claim in light of the 3 White case, there would be no statutory attorney fees. 4 And even if we had the CCPA claim, it's -- the court has 5 discretion. It may award them. There's no requirement 6 that it do so, no requirement whatsoever. 7 And how can anybody bring -- any lawyer 8 trying to bring one of these small damage claims -- if 9 the damages are only $100, $200 per plaintiff, for 10 instance, how could any lawyer justify facing a 11 defendant such as Bayer in a complex product liability 12 action? Just the cost alone of having experts, of doing 13 discovery -- all those matters would greatly exceed the 14 value of the claim itself. So the class action is the 15 only way in which to aggregate the claims and level the 16 economic playing field for everybody. 17 The other thing, I would note for the common 18 law fraud claim, West Virginia does have a bad-faith 19 exception for attorney fees, but that depends on the 20 degree of fraud that the court finds, and that -- that, 21 in and of itself, is discretionary. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- how far 23 does your procedural right extend? Let's say in the 24 second action, the court says, look, we've been through 25 all this before; we have had a million pages of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
15 1 discovery from the prior action, no protective order at 2 all. So while, if you were the first person here, 3 you're entitled to, you know, 10 interrogatories, 4 because we've been through this before, I'm going to say 5 you can look at all the discovery that's there, but you 6 only get 5 interrogatories. 7 Now, do you say no, no, no, I'm entitled to 8 the same procedural rights I'd have if I were here 9 first? Is that right? 10 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I think the court 11 does have some flexibility, depending upon the 12 procedural rule at issue. And -- and, in essence, the 13 court is applying almost essentially the stare decisis 14 type of principles there. We have resolved this exact 15 discovery issue before, the exact arguments - 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So now it's not only 17 that you're entitled to your day in court substantively; 18 you're -- you're entitled to your day in court 19 procedurally as to some procedural aspects but not 20 others? 21 MR. MONAHAN: Well, I certainly think the 22 Court needs to examine the procedural aspect and its 23 importance, and the part that it plays. I mean, for 24 instance, one of the problems we have in this situation 25 is that normally res judicata and collateral estoppel do
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
16 1 not normally apply to mere procedural rulings. They're 2 not normally used for that purpose. 3 Most cases where they are used for that 4 purpose are cases where a dismissal has occurred based 5 upon a procedural ruling or a procedural failing. And 6 whenever they apply collateral estoppel and res 7 judicata, it's almost -- every case I've seen deals with 8 the exact same party in another proceeding. And there 9 they preclude them. But here is a totally different 10 party. And the issue under West Virginia law has never 11 been litigated by any court. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: A totally different 13 party -- if a person, say an intervenor, joins a 14 litigation late, and there have been a lot of procedural 15 rulings, I guess that that intervenor takes the case as 16 he finds it. Now, he could go to the judge and say: 17 Judge, I want you to reconsider your procedural ruling 18 in light of the fact I'm here. 19 How does the situation I've just sketched 20 differ from this one? I mean, you have a client who's 21 coming to the litigation late. He's separate from the 22 litigation, I know, but he could send a representative 23 to the judge and say: Judge, I want you to reconsider 24 in light of the fact I'm joining. Now, I know I'm not 25 joining; in fact, I'm bringing a different case.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
17 1 But I'm thinking of the -- of the Chief 2 Justice's hypo, here and I'm -- and I'm trying to apply 3 it. And is your client analogous to that person who 4 joins litigation late? 5 MR. MONAHAN: No, Your Honor, because -- I 6 mean, for instance, this Court has noted -- and they 7 noted it, I believe in the -- you noted it in the 8 Richards case. The Chase National Bank v. Norwalk and 9 Martin v. Wilks has noted that a stranger to litigation 10 has no duty to seek to intervene in the case; however, 11 they can; they can seek to intervene if they have 12 notice, if they so choose. 13 If you take that affirmative step to 14 intervene, knowing what has happened in that case, you 15 obviously have notice of the case because you're 16 choosing to intervene. And if you seek to intervene 17 having that notice, then you take it as you find it. 18 Now, you can certainly ask the court to 19 reconsider because you want to raise new arguments, but 20 there would be no obligation to do so. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here you have a different 22 forum. You pick up a different plaintiff, and you go to 23 a different forum. How -- and I guess your answer is 24 that you could go on and on and on until -- until maybe 25 you find a judge who will certify this class.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
18 1 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I don't -- I don't 2 believe so. I don't believe that's the case because 3 there are limitations to that. One would be, I think, 4 if you filed at another Federal court, for instance, 5 Rule 23 would be the same legal standard. Federal Rule 6 23 is the same legal standard in all Federal courts. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we have a new 8 plaintiff, so that plaintiff wouldn't have had notice 9 and an opportunity to be -- to be heard. 10 MR. MONAHAN: For preclusion purposes, 11 that's correct. But I think the Federal court certainly 12 would look at those cases for stare decisis purposes in 13 looking as to whether or not the class should be 14 certified under the same legal standard. 15 Now, here we do have a different forum. We 16 have the State of West Virginia, as a separate 17 sovereign, has its own rights to do this. But, once - 18 once -- if a class would be denied in West Virginia at 19 one time, I believe that the chances of having another 20 one succeed are very low, because courts will look to 21 those stare decisis principles. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but there are 50 23 States. 24 MR. MONAHAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor? 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are 50 States. And
Alderson Reporting Company

19 1 if -- and if the plaintiff was asking for a nationwide 2 class action. 3 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor, and the issue 4 with that, though, is this Court has -- in Taylor v. 5 Sturgell, for instance, which Your Honor authored, the 6 Government argued in that case that, you know, we should 7 adopt this virtual representation theory because of 8 repetitive litigation. We had this FOIA request. Any 9 person out there can file asking the government for 10 these documents, and the government may have to go on 11 thousands of times, millions of times, conceivably, to 12 do this. 13 And this Court note -- noted that the threat 14 of repetitive litigation is not sufficient to justify 15 adopting a new exception to the rule against nonparty 16 preclusion. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: What kind of notice do you 18 think due process would require? If the court in which 19 the case was first filed thought, I'm not going waste -20 I don't want to waste my time on this class 21 certification issue if it's just going to be re 22 litigated over and over and over again, so I want to 23 provide sufficient notice so that the members of a class 24 will be bound by my -- by my class certification issue, 25 what -- what would have to be done? Would they all have
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to be given individual notice and asked to opt out?

20

2 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I -- I believe so.

3 I believe -- I mean, consistent with Shutts, this

4 Court's ruling in Shutts and Eisen, I think they would,

5 because once they had the notice and that they would

6 decide not to opt out, then they would be bound by any

7 ruling that the -- that the court issues there. But

8 if -- if they don't have that opportunity, especially

9 whenever -- and this case also involves the

10 Anti-Injunction Act, of course, the principles of

11 federalism and comity, and any question under the

12 Anti-Injunction Act, any doubt, should go against

13 issuing injunctions.

14 And the -- the exceptions to that Act are

15 narrowly construed in light of principles of federalism,

16 and because we do have a separate State here and we're

17 trying to apply or seek State relief and seek the State

18 rules and follow the State rules, I do believe you would

19 need the same notice that we have in Shutts, the notice,

20 the opportunity to appear, and the opportunity to opt

21 out.

22 Now, certainly, other issues -- if we're

23 talking about policy concerns, another thing that I

24 would note is that in CAFA recently -- whenever Congress

25 adopted CAFA, certainly if they believe that basing
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 one -- using one class denial in Federal court as a

21

2 basis to preclude all other similar classes seeking -

3 seeking certification, if they thought that was

4 consistent with due process, certainly they could have

5 considered adopting that as part of CAFA. But they

6 chose to deal with it in a very different way, a very

7 different manner, and that was to go ahead and change

8 the jurisdictional status in diversity cases, make

9 minimal diversity and allow removal with certain -- you

10 know, certain exceptions for certain discretionary ones,

11 stay at home and local controversy exceptions, but they

12 didn't -- I mean, that's how they chose to deal with it.

13 Now, certainly, we would admit that since

14 CAFA has been enacted, the chance -- certainly, there's

15 not nearly as many of these cases which will occur where

16 this would -- where this will be an issue, because many

17 large classes now will get removed. And -

18 JUSTICE KAGAN: When -- when Congress

19 enacted CAFA, did Congress think about this precise

20 issue, the issue that Justice Ginsburg is raising about

21 a lawyer going from State to State with a different

22 named plaintiff? Was that -- was that part of what

23 Congress was reacting to?

24 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Justice Kagan, it's my

25 understanding that that was something they were
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
22 1 concerned about. And they were concerned about, again, 2 some States being too permissive in granting class 3 certifications, and they were worried about some of 4 those same factors. 5 But, you know, one of the primary concerns 6 on all -- in CAFA itself, though, was protecting the 7 absent class members' rights, and this Court's noted 8 those same rights in Amchem and Ortiz. In many of its 9 cases, your cases, you've noted that that's a principal 10 concern. And this Court has heightened the standard in 11 those class -- class settlement certifications for the 12 court to make sure that each and every element and 13 requirement is met, to ensure that -- that the 14 settlement itself is fair to all class members, 15 including the absent class members, and that, you 16 know -- and that the attorney fees are fair. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Wouldn't it be a violation 18 -- wouldn't it be a violation of due process if Congress 19 enacted a statute or if there were a rule adopted that 20 said that the first ruling on class certification by a 21 Federal court binds all members of the class in any 22 other Federal litigation? Would that be a -- then they 23 would retain their individual claims, but there could 24 not be another -- another class action -- another class 25 action filed. Would that be a due process violation?

23 1 MR. MONAHAN: In all other Federal cases, I 2 believe that that might survive a due process challenge, 3 because you're limiting it to the same legal standard in 4 those cases. Certainly, I think you could -- because - 5 because it would be applying, though, to absent class 6 members who were not truly parties, I believe some of 7 those due process concerns could be raised. 8 But you certainly would not have the 9 elements of the federalism; you would not have the 10 different legal standard that we have with State courts 11 applying their own rules. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, is there a due process 13 right to have class action? 14 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, this Court has 15 noted a procedural right to seek class certification. 16 There is no right to have one. We have to meet the 17 requirements in order to - 18 JUSTICE ALITO: But what if Congress just 19 decided to get rid of class actions altogether? Would 20 that be unconstitutional? 21 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I -- I certainly 22 would hope that they would provide notice and an 23 opportunity for people to come and make their arguments 24 and to argue both sides of the question. But, no, I 25 don't believe so.

24 1 JUSTICE BREYER: Did it ever happen -- did 2 you ever come across an instance before where in a 3 Federal court a judge in the district court says, no, 4 you can't have a certification, no; and then a different 5 plaintiff went to a different Federal court in a 6 different part of the country and asked for a similar 7 certification? Have you ever found anything like that 8 in precedent, that it's in two Federal courts rather 9 than the State/Federal? 10 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor. I believe 11 that maybe Thorogood, the recent Thorogood case out of 12 the Seventh Circuit, might involve something similar to 13 that. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: And did they say -- did 15 they say in -- in that case that the second judge is 16 bound as a matter of stare decisis, or is he bound as a 17 matter of collateral estoppel? 18 MR. MONAHAN: Based on a collateral estoppel 19 preclusion principles, Your Honor, which - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: So it's the same issue as 21 here? 22 MR. MONAHAN: Well, it's even somewhat 23 worse, in my opinion, because not only did they have a 24 different party, but they went from a nationwide class 25 to a statewide class, and that itself is -- you know,

2 under.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you -- you would

4 say that the subsequent plaintiff is not bound if he was

5 not given notice and an opportunity to opt out, even if

6 he came back to the same court, right?

7 It would be a stupid thing to do.

8 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: And he's probably going to

10 lose, but you'd say he's not bound, right?

11 MR. MONAHAN: Yes. Yes, that's because he's

12 not the same party, but the legal standard would be the

13 same, and it would not be a wise move.

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

15 Mr. Beck.

16 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP S. BECK

17 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18 MR. BECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19 please the Court:

20 The core issue here is whether absent class

21 members can be bound by a denial of class certification

22 where there was adequate representation on that issue

23 but not notice and opportunity to be heard.

24 JUSTICE KAGAN: When you say "on that

25 issue," Mr. Beck, on what issue? Because I think that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
26 1 there is an argument in this case that the West Virginia 2 approach to class certification is different from the 3 Eighth Circuit's approach, that Rezulin would not have 4 been the way that the Eighth Circuit would have 5 approached the class certification question. 6 MR. BECK: The issue that was decided and 7 preclusive was the issue of predominance, Your Honor, 8 and what happened there is that Judge Davis, the judge 9 who was supervising the multidistrict litigation, he 10 made a determination under West Virginia law as to 11 what's required to make out an economic loss claim, and 12 he concluded that what is required is individual proof 13 of injury as well as individual proof of causation. And 14 then he went on to describe what kind of evidence would 15 be necessary to do that. 16 So he made a legal determination, and then 17 he went -- and then after looking at what kind of 18 evidence would be required -- excuse me -- made a -- I 19 think a mixed law and fact determination that, given 20 that, individual issues would predominate over common 21 issues. His -- his interpretation of West Virginia law 22 was later vindicated by the West Virginia Supreme Court 23 in White, where they held that -- that there is a 24 requirement of individual proof of injury, which had 25 been contested by Petitioners, and it's clear that it's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 going to require the same exact kind of inquiry.

27

2 So what we have is that there's no

3 suggestion in Rezulin or anywhere else that the

4 predominance requirement under the West Virginia version

5 of Rule 23, which is essentially identical to the

6 Federal version, has any other content that's different

7 from the Federal version.

8 In Rezulin, there's a suggestion that when

9 -- that the West Virginia courts would treat differences

10 in -- in damages or reliance as less significant than

11 some Federal courts, but nothing at all that suggests in

12 any way that if the underlying cause of action requires

13 individual proof of injury and causation, that somehow

14 that common questions are going to predominate over

15 individual questions. There's no suggestion of that.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We couldn't know. We

17 couldn't -- when they went to the West Virginia Supreme

18 Court, that was before this White v. Wyeth. They were

19 arguing a question of substantive law: What do we have

20 to show in order to get damages, when we say we weren't

21 hurt by the drug? We're saying -- we're not saying we

22 didn't get any benefit from it; we're just saying we

23 paid more money for it than we should because it wasn't

24 of the quality that it was represented to be.

25 When the Federal judge said, having to make
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
28 1 a determination of West Virginia law, no, it's not the

2 law; you have to show causation, some harm to you. But

3 then when they -- when these plaintiffs went to the West

4 Virginia court, that was still an open question of West

5 Virginia law, and the West Virginia courts might have

6 decided it differently than the Federal court, right?

7 MR. BECK: Yes. Well, yes -- when the

8 Federal district judge made the determination, it was in

9 Mr. McCollins's case, and he's called upon to resolve

10 questions of State law just like courts are every day in

11 diversity actions. And he resolved the question of

12 State law, what's required by the West Virginia Consumer

13 Credit and Protection Act.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But sometimes Federal

15 judges -- they try their best, but they're not the last

16 word on what the State law is.

17 MR. BECK: And some -- and, Your Honor, if

18 -- if for example, Judge Davis had found as he did in

19 McCollins, and then he had issued the same injunction,

20 and then the White case had come down the other way,

21 that -- that says that there is no requirement of

22 injury, then conceivably the Petitioners could have gone

23 back to Judge Davis and asked for relief from his

24 injunction. And then we'd have an interesting

25 question --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
29 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not these Petitioners. 2 They weren't parties to the case before - 3 MR. BECK: No, but they were -- they were 4 parties to the injunction proceeding. They were the 5 defendants in the injunction proceeding. So they're 6 subject to an injunction, and then -- then the law 7 changes, or the law is declared differently by the West 8 Virginia Supreme Court. 9 Nothing would have precluded them from 10 coming back in front of Judge Davis and said: 11 Respectfully, sir, you -- you were wrong in your 12 prediction, and we'd like to be relieved from the 13 injunction. 14 And then we'd have a very interesting 15 question about whether being correct or incorrect is - 16 is something that can eliminate the law of preclusion, 17 because normally if -- if a party is precluded, they're 18 not allowed to say I shouldn't be precluded because I 19 think the judge made a mistake on the law. But we don't 20 have that here because, in fact, Judge Davis was 21 vindicated on the content of West Virginia law. 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Beck, I'm -- I'm not 23 sure that White answers the question that I asked, 24 because White decided a matter of substantive liability, 25 and the question I asked was whether the approach to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
30 1 class certification was different in the Eighth Circuit 2 and in West Virginia. 3 MR. BECK: Yes. 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: If you look at Rezulin, if 5 you compare to it some Eighth Circuit cases, there seems 6 to be a difference in at least tone, shall we say, about 7 the extent to which a finding is required that common 8 issues predominate. 9 MR. BECK: I think that, actually, Judge 10 Davis took into account the difference in tone, and he 11 looked very carefully at Rezulin, and he said that what 12 Rezulin was focusing on was individual questions of 13 damages, which defendants often argue is enough so that 14 individual questions predominate, individual questions 15 of reliance, which we also often argue mean that 16 individual questions predominate. 17 But he said this is different, because this 18 is -- in order to prove liability, they've got to 19 establish individual injury, which means, on a 20 person-by-person basis, either that they were harmed by 21 the drug or that the drug didn't work to lower their 22 cholesterol as -- as it was supposed to, and they have 23 to show that whatever the violation of the Consumer 24 Fraud Act was is causally linked there. 25 And he said that's a different animal from
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 questions of reliance and damages. And -- and I've

31

2 heard or read no conceivable explanation about how,

3 under any standard of predominance, you could have

4 common questions predominating when every single member

5 of the class is going to have to examine the medical

6 records to see whether their cholesterol came down,

7 whether they suffered any side effects, and -- and if

8 their cholesterol didn't come down and they did suffer

9 side effects, how that could be linked to a violation of

10 the Consumer Fraud Act.

11 So what Judge -- Judge Davis didn't depart

12 from Rezulin at all. Judge Davis said: This goes to

13 core questions of liability, and as I interpret the West

14 Virginia statute, in order to establish liability,

15 they're going to have to show that on an

16 individual-by-individual basis.

17 And the relevance of White is that he's

18 correct. Of course, White even goes further and says,

19 because of that, there's no cause of action under the

20 West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer that

22 they have claims that do not involve the consumer,

23 whatever it is; that they have fraud claims and some

24 other kind of claims?

25 MR. BECK: A warranty claim, Your Honor.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
32 1 There was also a warranty claim in the McCollins case, 2 the original Federal case. Their warranty claim is no 3 different, and the requirements of a warranty claim are 4 no different. 5 Fraud, obviously, requires individual proof 6 of injury and causation. The fraud is -- I mean, the 7 Consumer Fraud Act is -- is an effort to make it easier 8 for plaintiffs to make out a cause of action. If you 9 can't make out a cause of action under the Consumer 10 Fraud Act, it certainly can't be made out under fraud. 11 And in terms of preclusion law, what the 12 Eighth Circuit observed was that when there's the -- the 13 same core set of facts that make out a cause of action, 14 adding another label to it doesn't change the preclusion 15 analysis. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Beck, if you're right 17 about issue preclusion, then if Bayer had gone into the 18 West Virginia court and said, West Virginia court, Judge 19 Davis has decided this case in Minnesota Federal 20 District Court -- issue preclusion -- that's one thing, 21 but what was used here was quite a heavy gun, and that 22 is the -- an empty suit injunction, which seems to say: 23 We're not going to trust the West Virginia court to 24 apply issue preclusion. We're going to stop that court 25 from proceeding altogether.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
33 1 And the anti-suit injunction is -- it's a 2 very strong weapon, and even though it's the -- the 3 clients who are being precluded, it's really saying to 4 another court: We're not even going to let you get to 5 this question; we're going to stop you. 6 So maybe you could be right about preclusion 7 but wrong about use of the anti-suit injunction. 8 MR. BECK: Well, Your Honor, the -- any time 9 that someone invokes the re-litigation exception to the 10 Anti-Injunction Act, by definition, an alternative would 11 be to go into the second court and -- and just simply 12 plead preclusion. That would always be available. And 13 if that were sufficient, then there would be no 14 re-litigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act. 15 Here's a reason why it's very important in a 16 case like this: Under their theory, they -- they could 17 not only file a class action in one county in West 18 Virginia, and then if we couldn't get an injunction but 19 we pled preclusion, and if -- and if we prevailed, they 20 could file one in another county. And in West Virginia, 21 county judges don't look to judges from other counties 22 as stare decisis. 23 And so they could go, under their approach, 24 to another county, and that judge might agree with us. 25 And then they go to another county, and eventually
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
34 1 they're pretty confident that they'd find one judge in 2 one county in West Virginia who would reject our 3 preclusion analysis and allow the case to go forward. 4 And in West Virginia, we have no right to have an appeal 5 heard. There is no intermediate appellate court, and 6 there's no appeal of right to the West Virginia Supreme 7 Court. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, you're 9 arguing the principle. What would have happened if the 10 class had gone -- those who wanted to be in the class 11 had gone first to the West Virginia court, and the West 12 Virginia court had denied class certification? Would 13 that preclude a later Federal court from granting class 14 certification? 15 MR. BECK: If the -- if the West Virginia 16 court had denied class certification on an issue that is 17 present in Rule 23, then it would be preclusive under 18 Rule 23. It would be under the full faith and credit 19 statute, where Federal courts have to give full faith 20 and credit to State judgments to the same extent that - 21 that a State would. 22 If, however, Your Honor, the court said in 23 West Virginia, well, they meet all of the requirements 24 of our Rule 23, but under West Virginia law, we have 25 discretion to deny a class even if they meet all the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 requirements of Rule 23, then that would be an

35

2 interesting question, because under Federal procedure,

3 under this Court's opinions, if someone meets all the

4 requirements of Rule 23, then class certification is

5 appropriate.

6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Beck, the re-litigation

7 exception of the Anti-Injunction Act speaks in terms of

8 judgments. Why is the denial of class certification a

9 judgment?

10 MR. BECK: I'm not sure that it would be

11 in -- in the mine-run case, but we don't have it. We -

12 one of the reasons that this case is unusual is that we

13 actually have a real-life final judgment that

14 incorporates the denial of class certification.

15 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the judgment, if I

16 understood it correctly -- there was just a

17 contemporaneous summary judgment motion, and the court

18 granted summary judgment as well. But the denial of

19 class certification isn't responsible for the judge's

20 dismissal of the suit.

21 MR. BECK: Well, but it is -- it is merged

22 into the judgment. It's explicitly a part of the

23 judgment. It's in the judgment itself. I think it's

24 our Joint Appendix 83, is it?

25 JUSTICE KAGAN: So that sounds like a very
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
36 1 contingent answer to my question. If that were not the

2 case, if it -- if it was the denial of a class

3 certification, but then the action proceeds as a

4 non-class litigation, you think that there would be no

5 judgment, and so the Anti-Injunction Act would not

6 apply?

7 MR. BECK: No, Your Honor. I think that

8 would be a tougher question. It's posed in some of the

9 other cases percolating up, the Thorogood case, for

10 example, or some of them out of the Seventh Circuit.

11 I think that, under normal preclusion

12 analysis, decisions that have not reached the point

13 where there's a formal final judgment can still be given

14 preclusive effect if they're sufficiently final, that a

15 court says it's exceedingly unlikely that we could

16 reconsider. There's another -

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's true about -

18 that's true about preclusion, but -- and so that you

19 might go into the West Virginia court and say this

20 second plaintiff should be precluded, but as Justice

21 Kagan pointed out, you're dealing with the

22 anti-injunction statute -

23 MR. BECK: And I -

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that talks about

25 judgment.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
37 1 MR. BECK: And I was about to say, Your 2 Honor, that -- that under the Anti-Injunction Act, it 3 might actually be a different analysis, and because the 4 issue isn't present here, we haven't briefed it, but I 5 could see under the -- looking at the statutory language 6 of the re-litigation exception that talks about 7 judgments and also looking to the federalism concerns 8 that -- that inform the -- the Anti-Injunction Act, one 9 could argue, in an appropriate case, that whatever the 10 law is as to preclusion generally, when it comes to the 11 Anti-Injunction Act, we're going to require more in the 12 form of a -- of a formal judgment that -- that 13 incorporates the particular ruling. As I said, that's 14 not our case, but I could - 15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Oh, but why isn't it really, 16 because here what happened was that there was a denial 17 of class certification and there was a granting of a 18 summary judgment motion at one and the same time? But 19 the thing that was responsible for getting the case out 20 of court was the granting of the summary judgment 21 motion, not the denial of class certification. That was 22 extraneous to the judgment that the case was dismissed. 23 MR. BECK: Well, I think it's actually - 24 while -- while it was collateral to the summary judgment 25 motion on Mr. McCollins's individual claim, it's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 actually essential to the judgment in -- in terms of

38

2 including it, in terms of who's bound by -- by -- by the

3 judgment. If class certification had been -- we -- we

4 need to know once the judge has ruled on class

5 certification, whether he's granted it or denied it, in

6 order to know who's affected by the judgment on the

7 merits and otherwise.

8 And if he had granted the motion to certify

9 the class, then there would be one set of effects coming

10 out of a final judgment. If he denies the motion to

11 certify the class, there's a different set of effects

12 that come out of that judgment.

13 So, it is essential to the judgment, in our

14 mind, and, incidentally, the essential-to-the-judgment

15 point under preclusion law is not one that -- that the

16 Petitioners have ever raised below. It's not one that

17 is in their questions presented or their cert petition

18 or their brief. So this isn't an issue that -- that

19 they've preserved or argued, but we do believe, quite

20 clearly, that the class certification denial was an

21 integral part of the final judgment, and -- and,

22 obviously, it's in there on its terms.

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, under the

24 Anti-Injunction Act, would it permit a blanket

25 injunction that says, against all future State court
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 class proceedings across the United States? Could a

39

2 court just order a re-litigation bar?

3 MR. BECK: I don't believe so, Your Honor.

4 I think that -- I think that in this Court's Chick Kam

5 Choo decision, there was an emphasis that under the

6 Anti-Injunction Act you have to have, you know, the same

7 issue litigated, and there was a concern about whether

8 there was a significant difference in standards.

9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's my question to

10 you.

11 MR. BECK: Yes.

12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So articulate what we're

13 comparing when we're saying that the re-litigation bar

14 can apply to a procedural ruling.

15 MR. BECK: Yes.

16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We started a little bit

17 on the question. Is there any requirement that that

18 issue have been fully and fairly adjudicated in the

19 prior proceedings?

20 MR. BECK: Oh, I think -- I think that for

21 the -- for -- for preclusion to apply, even before one

22 gets to the Anti-Injunction Act, there's a requirement

23 that the issue be fully and fairly litigated. I think

24 that -- I think the focus would be, as Judge Davis's

25 was, is there a difference in -- in the class
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
40 1 certification procedures that would -- that would result 2 in a -- in a different outcome, given the particular 3 issue that's been decided. So that -- so that there - 4 you know, I could conceive of issues that would be 5 dispositive in a Federal court on class certification 6 that would have nothing to do with - 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let's 8 take - 9 MR. BECK: -- with certification in State 10 court. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You talked about 12 different standards. Your adversary said that, in this 13 State, reliance doesn't need to be proven. Let's assume 14 that fact. And the district court's ruling here was 15 based on a reliance requirement and said no predominance 16 because each individual plaintiff will have to prove 17 reliance. Does that become the same -- a different 18 standard or not? 19 MR. BECK: Judge Davis's opinion was not 20 based in any way on reliance. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I -- I'm posing it 22 as a hypothetical. 23 MR. BECK: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As a hypothetical. 25 MR. BECK: If -- if a State court had said
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that this thing, that -- that reliance, or whatever,

41

2 that is talked about so much in Federal courts, we don't

3 care about that, that's not part of our standard,

4 then -- then that would be -- and that was the basis of

5 the Federal court's decision, then I think you would be

6 applying different standards, and under Chick Kam Choo,

7 there wouldn't be preclusion.

8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You see, the problem is

9 that I don't know how you get and when you get to the

10 question of whether reliance needs to be proven or not,

11 if you're going to bar the State court from reaching

12 that -- that substantive question, not that substantive

13 issue, but that substantive question -

14 MR. BECK: The -

15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which is not very

16 different from here, which is, what does economic loss

17 require in terms of proof?

18 MR. BECK: Well, we're -- we're moving now

19 from what is in Rule 23 in Federal and State

20 jurisprudence to what is the underlying cause of action

21 when we -- when -- you know, whether reliance is a part

22 of the claim. We keep saying "reliance" and -

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I'm shifting them

24 only to try to get -

25 MR. BECK: Okay.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
42 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- a sense of what

2 different standards mean -

3 MR. BECK: Okay. And -- and -

4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to you, and how we

5 articulate that rule in a way that doesn't preclude -

6 doesn't permit the barring -

7 MR. BECK: I think -

8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- of claims when

9 there's a different standard.

10 MR. BECK: I think -- I think, Justice

11 Sotomayor, that you have to distinguish between Rule 23

12 and the underlying State law that's the subject of the

13 lawsuit. And any time a -- a Federal court is looking

14 at whether a class action can be certified for a

15 violation of State law, it has to make a determination

16 of whether -- of what State law is in terms of how you

17 prove a violation, what the elements are. And that's

18 what -- that's just -- you have to do that every single

19 day.

20 And you make that kind of determination, and

21 then you move to the next step of whether that should be

22 preclusive, which is when Rule 23 comes into play. And

23 I think that's the point where you say, are the State

24 standards under Rule 23 different from the Federal

25 standards?

43 1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm the -- I'm the 2 party trying to bring the later class action, and you 3 tell me I can't do it because somebody else sought a 4 class action, and -- and it -- and it was denied. And I 5 say: Well, I don't care. I -- you know, that's 6 somebody else. That was not me. I was not -- and not 7 only was I not a party to that case, I think that person 8 had a lousy lawyer, and had I chosen the lawyer, we 9 wouldn't have lost that point. 10 What's your response to that?

BECK: Well, I think, under the - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: You want to litigate this 24 later, and - 25 MR. BECK: Well, adequacy, of course, is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
44 1 part of Rule 23 analysis, but it's also independently a 2 part of preclusion law analysis, where in order to be 3 precluded -- for a nonparty to be precluded, then you 4 have to do the analysis that's called for in Taylor v. 5 Sturgell, where you have to say in order to preclude a 6 nonparty, does it meet the two-part test of Taylor v. 7 Sturgell? 8 The first part: Were their interests 9 aligned? Here their interests were perfectly aligned. 10 And then the second part is an either/or: Did the party 11 in the first action understand herself -- in this case 12 himself -- to be acting in a representative capacity, or 13 did the court take care to protect the interests of the 14 nonparties? 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a very 16 subjective decision whether the lawyer is -- right here. 17 MR. BECK: I'm sorry. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether the - 19 the lawyer is adequate or not. People have different 20 views about what kind of lawyer they want, and I can see 21 somebody who doesn't even know that this action is going 22 on saying: Well, I don't care if you think the lawyer 23 is adequate. I don't think he is. Besides I wanted my, 24 you know, brother-in-law to be the lawyer. 25 MR. BECK: Well -- and in every preclusion
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
45 1 case there's a -- there's a question about adequacy, and 2 it focuses not on whether someone likes the lawyer or 3 they've got a brother-in-law who is a lawyer. It 4 focuses on whether the parties' interests are aligned, 5 and McCollins's interests were identical to Mr. Smith's 6 and Ms. Sperlazza's. And it -- and it points to whether 7 Mr. McCollins understood that he was acting in a 8 representative capacity and to whether Judge Davis took 9 care to protect the interests of nonparties. 10 So it doesn't say that everybody gets to 11 pick their own lawyer. If that were the rule, there 12 would be no law of preclusion because nobody would ever 13 pick the same lawyers. 14 My -- one other point I want to make - 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- I'm sorry. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to 17 say -- it's odd to say you're precluded. The whole 18 point is the basic principle that you're entitled to 19 your day in court. And you're saying, well, you're not 20 entitled to your day in court if somebody else had a day 21 in court and they had a good lawyer. 22 MR. BECK: And -- and that is exactly the 23 question that's posed by the law of nonparty preclusion, 24 and -- and as this Court's opinion in Taylor v. Sturgell 25 said, there are circumstances where a nonparty can be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 precluded based on litigation from someone else, and

46

2 I -- I referenced the test, and the first point I wanted

3 to make -

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you -- how can you

5 possibly find that in the first action the lawyer

6 understood that he was acting in a representative

7 capacity?

8 MR. BECK: Well, it's the -

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: He tried to act in a -- but

10 -- but his representation was denied.

11 MR. BECK: It's the party rather than the

12 lawyer, and -- and it's when -- when he commenced that

13 litigation and when he litigated the issue that we're

14 talking about, of class certification, there's no doubt

15 in the world that he is -- that he understood himself to

16 be acting on behalf of a class. That -- that's why he

17 was litigating class certification.

18 And -- and, Your Honor, what we -- we have

19 here also, because we're -- we're kind of verging into

20 the due process analysis, you have to start with the

21 question of what is the interest that's at stake here.

22 The injunction doesn't forbid any -- any plaintiff from

23 pursuing their individual claim or arguing anything they

24 want about underlying West Virginia law. It only

25 precludes them from going forward in a class action, and
Alderson Reporting Company

1 that is -

47

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- that's

3 often theoretical because on these small claims, it's

4 class action or nothing. Nobody's going to pay a lawyer

5 to go to court with a $100 case.

6 MR. BECK: These I don't think fall in that

7 category, Your Honor. There's -- it's $200 statutory

8 penalty per violation, which means per prescription

9 refill. There's -- there's attorney's fees on top of

10 that; there's punitive damages on top of that. The

11 McCollins case in Federal court was that kind of case,

12 and he pled that he satisfied the jurisdictional amount

13 of $75,000. But even if it's a small claim, the -- that

14 doesn't mean that the opportunity to litigate it in a

15 class action and join other parties is a property

16 interest that implicates due process protections. That

17 is -

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

19 Thank you.

20 Mr. Monahan, you have 4 minutes remaining.

21 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. MONAHAN

22 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

23 MR. MONAHAN: In this case, the MDL court

24 did not seek to bind any parties. The decision was deny

25 class certification; the decision was not to bind any
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 absent class members.

48

2 Moreover, in cases talking about adequate

3 representation, such as Hansberry v. Lee and the

4 Richards case, one of the things this Court noted was

5 that normally you have a judgment that indicates who it

6 purports to bind. There's nothing in the district

7 court's initial judgment indicating that the absent

8 class members are bound by the denial of class

9 certification, nothing whatsoever.

10 In Devlin v. Scardelletti, which they say

11 supports their opinion, clearly it supports our

12 position, because that was a case dealing with a

13 certified class settlement, where there was objections.

14 And because the objections were made and overruled, this

15 Court noted that those people could appeal directly

16 without having to intervene in that case. And -

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you have to -- I

18 think you would concede that the Seventh Circuit's now

19 two decisions, one in Bridgestone and then the other in

20 Thorogood -- the Seventh Circuit thinks it can do this.

21 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor, and the

22 Seventh Circuit, for instance, in Bridgestone, which -

23 which the Eighth Circuit relied on in this case,

24 indicated that adequate representation was one of the

25 factors, our right to appeal was one of the factors, and
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 then our individual claims still existing, consisted

49

2 sufficient due process. But, one, we had no notice, so

3 how can we appeal anything if we don't know it exists?

4 And this Court has noted that in many cases, in Mullane

5 and Richards and throughout, that if you have no notice

6 of a matter, how can you ever have an opportunity to be

7 heard, because you don't know about it?

8 Now, as to adequate representation, that was

9 something I wanted to turn to -

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But just on notice, does

11 the record show when the client first came to the

12 attorney?

13 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, our case was filed

14 in September 2001. The McCollins case was filed in

15 August 2001, and nobody knew about the other one at all.

16 I mean, these cases were filed almost the same time,

17 less -- less than a month apart in different counties,

18 different attorneys, different named plaintiffs.

19 I did want to note in Devlin v.

20 Scardelletti, Justice Scalia noted in his dissent that

21 not even petitioners were advancing "the novel and

22 surely erroneous argument" that absent class members

23 were considered parties before class certification.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Do we know that in the

25 record, that the attorneys didn't even know about each
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
50 1 other's cases? Is that borne out? I mean, is that an 2 issue? 3 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, we've argued that 4 throughout. We knew nothing about it. And see, the MDL 5 proceeding -- we had, like, one or two cases that were 6 filed, individual actions where the plaintiffs did not 7 want to seek class action status, and those got removed 8 to Federal court and transferred. The MDL court 9 provides notice of the orders affecting all cases in 10 general and then provides you with orders in your own 11 case. You do not get orders about other individual 12 cases. So we never knew about McCollins when it was 13 seeking class certification. 14 I would note that the White case here in no 15 -- no way vindicates the district court. The White case 16 did say that reliance did not have to be proven if you 17 have fraudulent concealment or suppression. Rather, the 18 standard is all you have to do is you have to show: 19 Would an objectively reasonable person have bought the 20 product had they known all of the information that was 21 concealed and suppressed? And, clearly, that can be 22 dealt with on a common basis. 23 But a confusing aspect here, it seems like 24 many people try to argue that for class actions that you 25 have to have all common issues or else you can't have
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
51 1 one. And that's unfortunate because I'm not aware of 2 any class action where you don't have at least - 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I just go back to 4 what you said before? I thought the West Virginia 5 Supreme Court said you can't have actions for drugs 6 under the consumer whatever. 7 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, they added -- they added 8 a syllabus point 6, the last paragraph of the opinion, a 9 paragraph that says that, from now on, the - 10 prescription drug purchasers cannot have such a claim. 11 And that was unknown to anybody. It was not raised as 12 part of a certified question and had not been litigated 13 or argued. So that's part of the petition for 14 rehearing, is my understanding. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel, 16 counsel. 17 The case is submitted. 18 (Whereupon at 12:05 p.m., the case in the 19 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 20 21 22 23 24 25
