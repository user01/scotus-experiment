1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:01 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next this morning in Case 09-115, Chamber of 5 Commerce v. Whiting. 6 Mr. Phillips. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 10 and may it please the Court: 11 In 1986, Congress converted what had been 12 before that time a merely peripheral concern of 13 immigration policy -- that is, how to regulate worker 14 authorization -- and converted it into a core concern of 15 immigration policy by the passage of the -- of the 16 Immigration Reform and Control Act. 17 This Court has characterized that change in 18 legislation as providing a comprehensive scheme for 19 dealing with those issues, and that characterization is 20 obviously apt because Congress provided for an 21 exhaustive and exclusively Federal method of bringing to 22 the attention of Federal authorities problems in worker 23 authorization, the method by which those matters should 24 be investigated, the method by which they should be 25 adjudicated, all of which are controlled as a matter of

1 Federal -- exclusive Federal activity; and, indeed, the 2 ultimate judicial review goes exclusively to the Federal 3 courts of appeals. 4 The sanctioning provisions are very explicit 5 and they're very clear and they are very balanced; and 6 for a good reason. Congress realized in this context 7 that if you over-enforce in one direction -- that is, if 8 you try to deter the hiring of unauthorized workers - 9 you run a very serious risk of causing employers to err 10 on the side of not hiring others who are in fact 11 authorized but who may fall into protected classes. And 12 so Congress very carefully calibrated the penalties on 13 both sides so that the employer essentially would play 14 it straight down the middle and hire the best people for 15 the job under these circumstances, while, of course, 16 complying if at all possible with the Federal 17 requirements. 18 And so it's against that backdrop - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is that a 20 problem if, as -- as the Federal statute requires and 21 the State statutes require, you have to show an intent 22 to hire an unauthorized worker? Isn't -- isn't that 23 what the State statutes here require? 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the State statute has 25 two components to it. One is knowing and one is intent.

1 But - 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 3 MR. PHILLIPS: But I don't see how that - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so why is that a 5 problem for -- for the business? I mean he's safe so 6 long as he doesn't intentionally hire an unauthorized 7 worker. 8 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think part of the 9 problem is that there -- it is never 100 percent clear 10 precisely who is and who is not an authorized worker. 11 And I think what Congress said was -- I'm not going to 12 deal with this problem in the kind of granular way 13 you're looking at it, Justice Scalia, which is 14 specifically at each of the individual employment 15 decisions. I'm going to look at the generality of 16 situations, and realize that if you put in -- on one 17 side of the scale what Arizona has done here, which is 18 to say you can -- you can essentially have the death 19 penalty to the business, that is, complete eliminate the 20 business's right to exist, and, on the other side of the 21 scale, a $250 fine, it would -- it would be pretty 22 remarkable to say, well, I -- you know, I'm going to 23 hide behind the intent and knowing requirements and, 24 instead, simply avoid if at all possible the risk of 25 Arizona's sanctions being imposed upon me.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think what Arizona 2 would answer to that is: Well, that's the only option 3 the Federal Government left us. 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm quite sure that 5 that's what Arizona will say. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: They excluded everything 7 else. We might have used reticulated penalties or, you 8 know, enforced the Federal law ourselves, but they 9 forbade that. But they did allow us to enforce the law, 10 immigration laws, through licensing, right? So it all 11 essentially comes down to -- to the licensing issue, 12 doesn't it? 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. It does ultimately 14 does come down to the "through licensing" laws and - 15 the -- the part of the -- and the fundamental problem, 16 obviously, with Arizona's scheme here is that this is 17 not a licensing law. This is a worker authorization 18 sanctioning law. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, when I picked up 20 this -- this brief and looked at this case, I thought: 21 Oh, well, licensing, that's a defined term; I'll look in 22 Corpus Juris Secundum or ALR or something. But it 23 really isn't. Your brief indicates you start with 24 dictionaries, fair enough. You indicate what Federal 25 licensing laws are. But I see no limitation on what the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 State can decide is a license in any jurisprudential 2 principle that you've cited. 3 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Justice Kennedy, I 4 think the better way to try to -- to grapple with the 5 meaning of the licensing law or whether it ought to be 6 construed broadly to allow the State wide authority to 7 engage in supplemental enforcement in this, or narrowly 8 in order to say that what really ought to happen in this 9 context is, if you deal with a situation where the 10 Federal Government has enacted -- I'm sorry -- has 11 enforced a provision and imposed a penalty through the 12 Federal scheme, that then as a supplement to that the 13 State does in fact have the authority to add something 14 over and above what it -- what the Federal Government 15 has done. 16 But it seems to me quite remarkable to think 17 that Congress intended through a parenthetical referring 18 to "through licensing laws" to allow the State to adopt 19 an entire alternative shadow enforcement mechanism, a 20 non-administrative decision-making process, completely a 21 State-run operation; and even at the end, the sanction 22 is not -- is not imposed ultimately in effect by the - 23 by any regulating entity. It is ordered by a State 24 court. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be possible only
7

1 because nobody would think that, with this scheme in 2 place, the Federal Government would not enforce it. Of 3 course, no one would have expected that. But what 4 Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in 5 place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other 6 States are in serious trouble financially and for other 7 reasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration. And, 8 therefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree 9 this step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it 10 to occur under this statute, but expectations change 11 when the Federal Government has -- has simply not 12 enforced the immigration restrictions. 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, I -- I 14 understand the point, and I understand the motivation 15 for why Arizona did what it did. But the -- the problem 16 is the statute was enacted in 1986, and that's when the 17 pre-emption standards were put in place. And the - 18 again, the notion -- if you look at the way the 19 structure of the statute -- and this also responds in 20 some ways to Justice Kennedy's question about how should 21 you read licensing, since it's not a self-defining 22 concept -- is if you -- is that, first, Congress said 23 very specifically that the immigration laws should be 24 enforced uniformly, which says that there shouldn't be 25 40,000 different localities offering up their view of
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 licensing and -- and the additional 50 States. 2 Second of all, and this part I think is 3 particularly telling in terms of this massive State 4 scheme that's been adopted, which is that under section 5 1324a(b)(5), which is in 134a of the -- of the appendix, 6 Congress specifically outlaws the use of the I-9 form. 7 And in some ways this goes to your question, 8 Justice Scalia, because it would be inconceivable that 9 the State can in fact enforce knowing and intentional 10 decision making without having access to the I-9 form, 11 because that's - 12 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this 13 question to get back - 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Sure. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: -- to the issue of whether 16 this is a licensing law? "Licensing" is not an unknown 17 term. States and municipalities issue all sorts of 18 licenses. For example, I think here in the District of 19 Columbia every business has to have a general business 20 license; isn't that right? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: That is true, Justice Alito. 22 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, if the District of 23 Columbia were -- after having enacted this requirement 24 some years ago, were to pass a new ordinance saying "and 25 if you knowingly hire an illegal alien, your general
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 business license can be forfeited," would that not - 2 would that cease to be a licensing law? 3 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think the answer 4 to that specific hypothetical is that's still not a 5 licensing law, because it doesn't tie the grant of the 6 license to the revocation powers. I think Congress -- I 7 think Congress means for the States to adopt something 8 more specific than that, although I do think 9 eventually - 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why is it -- this is 11 the same question you're answering. Why is it suddenly 12 not a license because the -- because the State imposes 13 an additional condition, where it was a license before? 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I - 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I - 16 MR. PHILLIPS: I think the question is 17 whether it is a licensing law within the meaning of what 18 Congress intended. I mean -- the -- the reality is, 19 Justice Alito, there -- there is no common definition of 20 "license," and various States and local - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Actually, there is. I 22 mean, it seemed to me when I read this, it sounded a 23 little familiar, and I think whoever wrote it in Arizona 24 copied it out of the Administrative Procedure Act. I 25 mean, you read the definition of "license" in the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Administrative Procedure Act - 2 MR. PHILLIPS: But - 3 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and this is awfully 4 close. 5 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I understand that, 6 Justice Breyer, and I agree with that. But the problem 7 is, is that the -- the Federal law, it doesn't talk 8 about actions with -- with respect to licenses. It 9 talks about licensing laws and - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. It might 11 have meant something different; Congress might have. 12 But what is, then -- I read the SEIU brief. I thought 13 that was pretty interesting. Is that something you 14 adopt as what the Congress did mean? I mean, what do 15 you think Congress did mean, and what evidence is 16 there -- if it didn't mean the APA definition, what 17 evidence is there for that? 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the SEIU brief does a 19 very nice job of explaining the -- the particular focus 20 of Congress, obviously, on the -- on the Agricultural 21 Workers Protection Act, and in particular -- which, you 22 know, has tremendous significance in terms of narrowing 23 the State's authority here, because, obviously, in their 24 conforming amendments in that context - 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could have named that,
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 if that's all it meant. 2 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, Your Honor. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could have named that, 4 that particular licensing scheme, if that's what it 5 meant. But it didn't name it; it said licensing 6 generally. 7 What did it intend to add to that? Barbers' 8 licenses? 9 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I think what - 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Beauticians' licenses? 11 MR. PHILLIPS: Of course. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: How would any of this have 13 anything to do with the immigration laws? 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what it -- what 15 Congress actually had in mind and what's the most 16 natural reading of a licensing law is the fairly common 17 situation where somebody violates Federal law, usually 18 on the criminal side, and a State licensing entity finds 19 out about a conviction of a Federal crime, and says: 20 Oh, wait a second, we don't want people to have licenses 21 under these circumstances, and, therefore, they - 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they're saying - 23 that's exactly what they are saying. We -- we have - 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, no. But, 25 Justice Scalia, there's a vast difference between that
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and what they're saying. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's very common to 3 talk about authority to do business within a State as - 4 as a license. You say "licensed to do business in" so 5 many States. It's a common expression. 6 Now, I have -- maybe you'll persuade me 7 otherwise, but I have no doubt that insofar as this law 8 limits the authority to do business within the State, it 9 is a -- it is a licensing law. It's a little harder 10 extending licensing to formation of a corporation, but 11 when you issue a corporation charter you really do two 12 things. You create the corporation and enable the 13 limitation of liability that creates, and secondly, you 14 authorize that new creature to do business within your 15 State. So at least half of that corporation law is 16 licensing, it seems to me. 17 Now, if that's what I think, what - 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Actually, Justice Scalia, can 19 I stop you there? 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Go on. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Because I think, actually, if 22 you just -- if you just receive the articles of 23 incorporation, that doesn't actually in all States 24 necessarily give you the opportunity to do business. It 25 just simply gives you the right to exist, and you may
13

1 very well need to get a separate document in order to 2 actually do business in a particular State. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- but you do not need 4 the kind of a document that an out-of-State corporation 5 needs - 6 MR. PHILLIPS: No, you don't need that. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you're an in-State 8 corporation. 9 Mr. PHILLIPS: That's true. That's true. 10 But the -- but the reality is that nobody, I think - 11 and common sense and common use of the term, thinks of 12 articles of incorporation or the charter of a 13 partnership or any of those as -- documents as 14 licensing, which suggests that the State - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- could I - 16 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry? 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- just -- just focus 18 the questioning? Because we keep talking about whether 19 the APA-type definition of licensing is what Congress 20 intended or not, but you don't disagree that Congress at 21 least intended that if someone violated the Federal law 22 and hired illegal aliens and was -- undocumented aliens 23 and was found to have violated it, that the State can 24 revoke their license, correct? 25 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to do business? 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I don't disagree with 3 that, Justice Sotomayor. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it really doesn't 5 matter whether they're revoking their right to do 6 business in the State. And they can only revoke their 7 charter or their articles of incorporation if they're - 8 if they were filed in that State. They wouldn't have 9 power to revoke a Delaware - 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. They can't do it - 11 they can't do it to Delaware, right. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So it's 13 stopping them from doing business. So really the only 14 conflict you're talking about is not the power to stop 15 them from doing business, because you accept that this 16 saving clause gives them the power to do that, to revoke 17 the right to do business; what you're talking about is a 18 conflict in the adjudication of that issue. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: And - 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that correct? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and the enforcement 22 and investigation. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So I'm - 24 you know, how they define "license" or not is irrelevant 25 to me. Walk me through whether -- what expressly
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 pre-empts that adjudication right - 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- or what implicitly 4 pre-empts that adjudication right. 5 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because that is, for me, 7 what the center of this question is. 8 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think there are 9 three pieces of evidence that respond directly to what 10 you asked, Justice Sotomayor. 11 First is Congress, in section 115 of the 12 statute, specifically says enforcement should be 13 uniform, which suggests to me that this ought to be 14 exclusively a Federal investigation and -- and 15 adjudication process. 16 Two, the point I was making earlier about 17 the I-9 form. Those forms cannot be used in any 18 location - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Don't depart 20 from that. What does that mean, "enforcement shall be 21 uniform"? 22 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry? 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does that mean, 24 "enforcement shall be uniform"? 25 MR. PHILLIPS: The enforcement of the
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 immigration laws shall be uniform. Congress stated that 2 as a -- as an overarching principle - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that any different 4 from - 5 MR. PHILLIPS: -- when it enacted section 6 115. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- from what is the assumed 8 situation with respect to all Federal laws? 9 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, not necessarily. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are Federal laws not to be 11 applied uniformly. 12 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, I -- I mean, I 13 think it depends on the circumstances. I can imagine a 14 lot of -- I mean, this is -- remember, we're talking 15 about immigration policy and immigration law here, and 16 in general, you would expect that to be pretty much 17 uniform. But this Court in De Canas had decided that 18 there are some elements of it that were not, and 19 Congress is simply reinforcing the basic notion that 20 enforcement of it ought to be uniform to - 21 JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the exception for 22 licensing mean that this isn't going to be completely 23 uniform? One -- one jurisdiction may take the position 24 that a restaurant that employs illegal aliens may lose 25 its restaurant -- its license to operate. Another one
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 may take the different position. 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: So it's not going to be the 4 same. 5 MR. PHILLIPS: But -- but, Justice Alito, I 6 think that's why it's terribly important to limit, to 7 narrow as much as possible -- and it's fully consistent 8 with congressional intent - 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they say that 10 these - 11 MR. PHILLIPS: -- the need to get a full 12 sanction done by the Federal Government and then just an 13 add-on on the licensing side, rather than an entire 14 regime to enforce State law. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this is -- it can't 16 be uniformity of sanction, because the court permitted 17 licensing sanctions. 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, there -- but only at 19 that point. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let's go back to my 21 question of adjudication. What you're saying is what's 22 specifically pre-empted is the right to adjudicate - 23 MR. PHILLIPS: Investigate - 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whether someone has 25 hired undocumented aliens, correct?
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 2 And -- and the last thing I would say with respect to 3 that was the conforming amendments with respect to the 4 Agricultural Workers Protection Act, there's a situation 5 where the Department of Labor, which used to engage in 6 adjudication as well, was divested of that authority. 7 It seems quite unlikely Congress meant to give that 8 authority to the States and take it from the Department 9 of Labor. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see the problem in 11 -- in diverse adjudication. Wouldn't there be a Federal 12 question presented if a -- if a company claimed that it 13 was deprived of the ability to do business because of a 14 mistaken interpretation of Federal law, that the person 15 it hired was not an authorized person? 16 MR. PHILLIPS: But Arizona doesn't 17 purport - 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't that be a Federal 19 question that -- that could be - 20 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Arizona doesn't purport 21 to be enforcing Federal law here. It has an independent 22 State law basis for the actions that it takes. So that 23 would not arise under Federal law, Justice Scalia. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the State law basis 25 refer to the Federal law?
19

1 MR. PHILLIPS: No, it -- actually, I don't 2 think it - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it tracked it. 4 MR. PHILLIPS: No, it -- well, it tracks it, 5 but it doesn't incorporate it. It doesn't purport to be 6 -- to be applying it. It's the same standards, but it's 7 still a matter of State law. It's not a Federal -- it's 8 not Federal -- it doesn't arise under Federal law. 9 I'd like to reserve - 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 11 General Katyal. 12 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL 13 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 14 SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 15 GENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, 16 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 17 Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Congress 18 declared Federal employer sanctions central, not 19 peripheral, to the policy of immigration law. Congress 20 broadly swept away State and local laws, pre-empting any 21 sanction upon those who employ unauthorized aliens, with 22 the sole exception being a mere parenthetical for 23 licensing and similar laws. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to pose there, 25 we've had a little discussion about what licensing laws
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 are, but we haven't talked at all about those last two 2 words, "and similar laws." It seems to me that whatever 3 wiggle room or ambiguity there may be in saying whether 4 this is a license or not, Congress swept pretty broadly. 5 It said, not just licensing laws, but licensing and 6 similar laws. 7 GENERAL KATYAL: First let me tell you, 8 Mr. Chief Justice, what we think a licensing law is and 9 then deal with the "similar" question. 10 We think a licensing law, as Congress 11 defined it in IRCA, was the traditional licensing laws 12 that were in place in 1986. Those were largely farm 13 labor contractor laws. They were aimed at fitness to do 14 business, and they had a few essential characteristics 15 in those laws. They - 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Let me 17 just -- I mean, businesses had to have licensing laws 18 pretty much across the board, right? You couldn't set 19 up a -- I don't know -- an electrical contracting 20 business if you didn't -- weren't licensed to do 21 business or met the requirements for an electrician. It 22 wasn't just agricultural work. 23 GENERAL KATYAL: Oh, absolutely. And -- but 24 I think that this licensing law looks very different 25 from the ones you were referring to or the farm labor
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 contractor ones, for a number of reasons. The first is 2 licensing laws issue licenses. They're generally about 3 the issuance of licenses, not simply ones in which 4 licenses are revoked. Second, they are ones in which 5 the issuance of the license, the criteria for issuance, 6 is the same as the criteria for revocation, because 7 they're - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You -- are you 9 saying, and I think the Petitioner here may have been 10 saying as well, that if you have a licensing law that 11 permits the revocation of the license, the revocation is 12 not a licensing law? 13 GENERAL KATYAL: No. What I'm saying is, 14 is that a - 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I have a licensing 16 law which says if you do this, your license will be 17 revoked. Does that remain a licensing law? 18 GENERAL KATYAL: In general, that itself is 19 not a licensing law. The licensing laws share a number 20 of characteristics. Now, we can debate about whether 21 subtracting one or another of those characteristics - 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why make exception for 23 licensing laws therefore if you can't revoke a license 24 under it? 25 GENERAL KATYAL: Because -- because,
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Justice Scalia, Congress wanted to preserve the States' 2 traditional power for licensing laws, which were about 3 fitness to do business. And what Arizona has done - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Once you're in, you can do 5 whatever you like. Do you think that is what Congress 6 meant? You can -- you can pass upon their fitness when 7 you issue the license, but once its issued, they can do 8 whatever they like; is that right? 9 GENERAL KATYAL: No. I think that the 10 criteria would be the same for issuance and revocation. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And revocation. Okay. So 12 that raises the question: What does it make -- why does 13 it make any difference if the revocation provision is 14 contained in the narrow licensing law or if there's a 15 general State law which says all licenses that -- that 16 are issued may be revoked for certain reasons? 17 GENERAL KATYAL: Because, Justice Scalia, 18 what Congress was trying to do was preserve the States' 19 and localities' traditional power for fitness to do 20 business. And one good indicia that fitness to do 21 business is not was what at issue in the particular law 22 is that they will let businesses operate, they will 23 license them without any care whatsoever as to whether 24 they have a history of violating the particular 25 provisions -
23
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: So they should just -2 Arizona should just amend all its licensing laws to 3 require what they now require when the license is 4 issued, and to say, in each specific licensing law, that 5 it can be revoked for the same -- on the same grounds - 6 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that would 7 solve that problem. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would solve the 9 problem. 10 GENERAL KATYAL: Now, there are other - 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if they said - 12 GENERAL KATYAL: -- hallmarks of licensing 13 law. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if they said 15 "and you have to renew your license every year or every 16 6 months"? 17 GENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. That 18 itself, I don't think, is relevant to whether the 19 licensing law is -- the other hallmarks are that they 20 have discretionary adjudication by an expert body, that 21 it's not mandatory, that it is genuinely aimed at 22 qualifications to do business. It - 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't disagree 24 that whether or not a company hires illegal workers is 25 related to quality or -- or ability to do business or
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 qualification? 2 GENERAL KATYAL: A State could certainly 3 make that part of its genuine fitness to do business 4 law. Now, here Arizona hasn't done that. And we know 5 that because the criteria for issuance of the license 6 are entirely divorced from the criteria for revocation 7 of the license. And if Arizona really believed, 8 Mr. Chief Justice, what you're saying, which is that 9 it's relevant to the -- the violation is relevant to 10 whether they can do business or not, they allow every 11 single one of these entities to get the license. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your argument sounds to 13 me like look at the law and see what its purpose is. If 14 the purpose is to regulate undocumented aliens, then 15 it's struck down. If it happens to put its revocation 16 provisions in its licensing law, then it's okay. 17 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice - 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't make much 19 sense - 20 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, I'm not 21 talking about purpose. I'm saying look at the face of 22 the statute and see what is being - 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The face of the statute 24 talks only about if you hire undocumented aliens, your 25 license is revoked.

Civil or criminal sanctions 6 other than through licensing and similar laws. So, I 7 mean - 8 GENERAL KATYAL: Right. And this is not a 9 licensing law. Congress essentially had two boxes in 10 1986.

The Federal 17 adjudication is expressly -- State adjudication of a 18 Federal violation is expressly pre-empted as well as 19 impliedly so for three reasons. The first is that 20 Congress, in developing IRCA and the comprehensive 21 scheme, set out a series of procedures, Federal 22 adjudication with an ALJ, all sorts of different 23 regulations to the jot and tittle. And what Arizona 24 does here is what 40,000 different localities can do if 25 this law is upheld, which is have -

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At the time the statute 2 was passed, there were many, many State laws that 3 adjudicated revocation of licenses. Perhaps not many 4 had addressed the issue of hiring undocumented aliens, 5 but many State laws existed that independently 6 adjudicated revocations. What in the legislative 7 history or in the words of the statute show that 8 Congress intended in any way to limit those 9 adjudications? 10 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's undoubtedly the 11 case that without the parenthetical, the mere 12 parenthetical savings clause, that Arizona-like laws 13 would be swept away as sanctions, that these are 14 sanctions imposed. So the question is whether the 15 licensing law phrase saves that. And I think it saves 16 the Federal -- State adjudication, and I think the 17 answer to that is no, because to read the statute that 18 way is to permit all of those States to have their own 19 laws, and it's undoubtedly the case that Congress wanted 20 to sweep away the De Canas-style State statutes that 21 were in place that imposed sanctions on employers. And 22 so the - 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, just so I 24 get -- make sure I understand your approach. You're 25 saying that Arizona had a law saying you have to have a
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 license to do business, and then it became aware of a 2 problem it wasn't aware of before -- it found out that a 3 lot of employers were employing child labor, and they 4 didn't know they would do that -- and they say we can 5 revoke your license if you're determined to have 6 employed child labor; that that would not be okay? 7 GENERAL KATYAL: Well - 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it would be okay 9 if, in the original licensing thing, they said "and you 10 can't employ child labor"? 11 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think that the 12 answer depends on what Congress was trying to get at. 13 In 1986, we know what Congress was trying to get at with 14 respect to State enforcement of immigration laws. They 15 broadly swept away the De Canas-style laws, and they 16 said, for the I-9 provision, which President Reagan 17 described as the keystone of the Act, that I-9 documents 18 can't be used in any procedure besides IRCA procedures. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Chief Justice - 20 the Chief Justice can insist on the answer to his own 21 question, but it seems to me his question is why isn't 22 that still a licensing law? 23 GENERAL KATYAL: If it has independent 24 adjudication, it is swept away by the first parts of the 25 (h)(2) statute which say -- which say the provisions of
28

1 this section pre-empt any State or local law imposing 2 civil or criminal sanctions. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then, what - 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in the child labor 5 example, why isn't that a -- an addition to a regulatory 6 licensing scheme so that it's a licensing law? 7 GENERAL KATYAL: Because if I understand -8 I may not understand the hypothetical, but the word 9 "provisions" refers to the entire subset -- the entire 10 statute in IRCA, including the procedural protections - 11 the procedures that follow for Federal enforcement of 12 the immigration laws. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you - 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you had - 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- read that section again? 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to 17 say you tried earlier to talk about the two boxes, and 18 you said something would be pre-empted by the first 19 clause. Anything -- civil and criminal sanctions are 20 allowed if they're imposed through licensing and similar 21 laws. There are not two boxes. The State can do what's 22 in the first part so long as it does it through 23 licensing or similar laws. 24 GENERAL KATYAL: Right. And our -- and our 25 position is that this is not a licensing law because it

1 doesn't bear any of the indicia of a traditional 2 licensing law, and - 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it similar to a 4 licensing law? 5 GENERAL KATYAL: No, I don't think so, that 6 Congress -- Congress had in the -- when they used 7 "similar" meant to sidestep the schematic debate about 8 whether something is a certificate, as some of the farm 9 labor contractor statutes use that term, or a license. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, that's all right. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 12 Ms. O'Grady. 13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY R. O'GRADY 14 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 15 MS. O'GRADY: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, 16 and may it please the Court: 17 Through their police powers, States 18 traditionally have the authority to regulate the conduct 19 of employers within their jurisdiction to determine what 20 conduct warrants issuance of a State license and to 21 determine what conduct justifies suspending or revoking 22 such a license. And although Congress pre-empted some 23 of our traditional authority when it enacted IRCA in 24 1986, it preserved significant State authority through 25 the savings clause that permits a State to impose
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 sanctions through licensing and similar laws. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the - 3 the anomaly that Arizona cannot impose a fine even in a 4 modest amount, but it can revoke someone's license to do 5 business? 6 MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we think that 7 looking at the savings clause -- we don't view it as an 8 anomaly. The structure that Congress established is one 9 that the State's authority is determined by the nature 10 of the sanction that we choose to impose. We don't have 11 the authority to -- they -- they took away our authority 12 to impose civil monetary and criminal sanctions but 13 preserved our authority to impose sanctions through a 14 similar law. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But underlying Justice 16 Ginsburg's question is why would Congress want to do 17 that? 18 MS. O'GRADY: Well, I think it makes sense, 19 Your Honor, because in terms of licensing, it -- it 20 provides some accountability, because we are the 21 entities that establish policy for our licensees, and we 22 are the ones accountable for whether that business 23 remains in business or whether we're taking it away from 24 them. So it - 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Perhaps Congress never
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 expected that the States would have to resort to such 2 massive measures, and they probably wouldn't have if - 3 if the law had been uniformly enforced and vigorously 4 enforced, right? 5 You -- you didn't -- didn't have any notion 6 of doing this sort of thing in 1986, did you? 7 MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, certainly we 8 waited until 2007. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: So maybe Congress wasn't 10 worried about it because it seemed very unlikely that 11 anything like that would occur. 12 MS. O'GRADY: Perhaps. But I think also 13 Congress was recognizing what this Court recognized in 14 De Canas, was that unauthorized employment has 15 significant local consequences, so they did not want to 16 fully pre-empt State law. They wanted to preserve State 17 authority - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: The main -- the main 19 anomaly seemed to me to be this, that in the Federal 20 Act, as -- that was the first point that the Chamber 21 made, that it's a fairly careful balance. There are a 22 group of people in Arizona, they may look as if they 23 come from Mexico or speak with an Hispanic accent, and 24 you're not certain whether they in fact are illegals or 25 that they're legal. Now, think of that category.

1 Congress has passed a statute that gives the 2 employer just as much incentive to verify, so there's no 3 discrimination, as to dismiss, so there's no illegal 4 hiring. It's absolutely balanced. A $1,000 fine for 5 the one, a $1,000 fine for the other. 6 So Arizona comes along and says: I'll tell 7 you what, if you discriminate, you know what happens to 8 you? Nothing. But if you hire an illegal immigrant, 9 your business is dead. 10 That's just one thing they do. Now, how can 11 you reconcile that intent to prevent discrimination 12 against people because of their appearance or accent - 13 how do you reconcile that with Arizona's law? 14 If you're a businessman, every incentive 15 under that law is to call close questions against hiring 16 this person. Under the Federal law, every incentive is 17 to look at it carefully. 18 MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, a couple of 19 points. First, in terms of how our law works, we do 20 have a prohibition against investigating any complaint 21 that's based solely on race. So if we get a complaint 22 that says those people all look Mexican or Hispanic, 23 that does not get investigated under Arizona law, first. 24 We also have criminal penalties if frivolous complaints 25 are filed.
33

1 Beyond that, we have the use of E-Verify, 2 which is an added protection for employers to prevent 3 the hiring of unauthorized aliens. So if they use 4 E-Verify, if they're in good-faith compliance with the 5 I-9 process, they have no risk of exposure under Arizona 6 law, just as true under Federal law. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- doesn't it 8 frustrate the congressional intent when the Federal law 9 says that the I-9 can be used for no purpose other than 10 the Federal adjudication of whether a violation has 11 occurred or not? Doesn't it frustrate that law to have 12 the States raise a defense that depends on forcing 13 someone to disclose something that the Federal law 14 protects? 15 I mean, this is a vicious circle. Federal 16 law says you can't do the I-9 for -- you can't use it 17 for any purpose other than the Federal adjudication. 18 Now you're creating a defense that says you have to 19 supply us with something that Federal law otherwise 20 protects from disclosure. 21 MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we don't think 22 that the Federal law prohibits the use of an I-9 -- of 23 the I-9 -- an employer's use of the I-9 in a State 24 proceeding, that these can be used under the Federal 25 proceeding or under the State.
34

1 But, beyond that, if at some point in an 2 actual enforcement action it was determined that Federal 3 law did have that impact, they would still have that 4 defense available to them. They would just have to, you 5 know, prove it up in a different way other than use the 6 form. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't answer my 8 point. Doesn't it frustrate Federal law when the 9 Federal law says that I-9 can be used for no purpose 10 other than the Federal adjudication of the status of 11 employees? I think that's - 12 MS. O'GRADY: Here -- here's what the law 13 says: It may not be used for purposes other than for 14 enforcement of this chapter. And we believe that 15 a State enforcement action, under the authority for 16 preserving sanctions through licensing and similar laws, 17 would fall within that. So we think they should be able 18 to use that; the employer should be able to use that. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there -- isn't there a 20 difference between saying it may not be used for any 21 purpose other than for enforcement of this chapter and 22 other provisions of Federal law, on the one hand, and 23 saying, on the other hand, it may not be used for any 24 purpose other than in a Federal proceeding? The 25 enforcement -- the I-9 certainly could be used in a
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Federal proceeding by the employer. Would that then - 2 would that be used for the enforcement of the Federal 3 law? I wouldn't think so. 4 MS. O'GRADY: That's true, Your Honor. 5 That's -- that - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Is the I-9 -- I do have a 7 question on the I-9. I'm not certain. I thought under 8 Federal law that if the employee -- the employer isn't 9 certain, but the employee says here's my Social Security 10 card, here's the driver's license. The employer looks 11 at that, he's home free; is that right? 12 But under Federal -- under your law, under 13 Arizona law, he's not home free, and, moreover - 14 because he -- it may -- he's not home free. He still 15 could be prosecuted. Is that right or not? 16 MS. O'GRADY: No, that's not right, Your 17 Honor. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: So if he shows the driver's 19 license -- under -- under Arizona law, if the -- if he 20 shows a driver's license and Social Security card, the 21 worker, the employer looks at it, the employer cannot be 22 prosecuted? 23 MS. O'GRADY: Well, Your Honor - 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no? 25 MS. O'GRADY: We would need the evidence
36

1 that the person knowingly employed the unauthorized 2 alien and a good-faith defense through use of a - 3 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- I thought 4 in reading it that it creates some kind of presumption, 5 but he is not home free? 6 MS. O'GRADY: No, Your Honor. The -- the 7 substantive - 8 JUSTICE BREYER: But under Federal law he is 9 home free. 10 MS. O'GRADY: The substantive requirements 11 under Arizona law and Federal law are the same. We're 12 imposing no new obligations. And - 13 JUSTICE BREYER: So then he's home free? 14 Look, I don't -- I'm trying to understand. Maybe it's 15 not enough time to explain it, but I thought Federal law 16 requires this E-9 business or whatever that E review is. 17 And I was worried about the E review which it seemed to 18 require because it seemed to me in 20 percent of the 19 cases where the notice is this guy is not authorized; we 20 don't have any record that he's authorized to work -- 20 21 percent of those are wrong, and he is authorized to 22 work. 23 So the employer who follows that is really 24 going to fire 20 percent of the people who will be 25 absolutely entitled to work. And so I'd just like you
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to address those points, as you wish. 2 MS. O'GRADY: Okay. And let me walk through 3 how our law works to see if this addresses the concern. 4 So the -- Arizona doesn't change anything in terms of 5 the use of the I-9. We retain the same defense that's 6 in the Federal law for good-faith compliance with the 7 I-9. We do require employers to use E-Verify, although 8 we don't impose a sanction on that employer if they 9 don't use E-Verify. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain that, 11 E-Verify, because this is a Federal resource, and the 12 Federal Government has said we want this to be 13 voluntary. How can Arizona take a Federal resource, 14 which the Federal Government says is voluntary except in 15 certain circumstances, and turn it into something that's 16 mandatory? 17 MS. O'GRADY: We think the -- that question 18 is answered by looking at -- into the conflict 19 pre-emption analysis, because Congress didn't address 20 the role of the States with regard to E-Verify. And we 21 aren't - 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't -- I don't get 23 into any pre-emption or not, but it's -- Arizona wants 24 to use a Federal resource. And the Fed makes it 25 available if the employer can use it voluntarily, but
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 not mandatorily. How can -- how can Arizona set the 2 rules on the use of a Federal resource? 3 MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we can -- as long 4 as it's not a burden to the objectives of Congress, we 5 think that we can require employers within our 6 jurisdiction to use E-Verify. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do you make it 8 mandatory? 9 MS. O'GRADY: Well, our statute says you 10 shall use E-Verify. We don't impose a penalty against 11 employers who fail to use it. The consequences are the 12 same as they are under Federal law. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: You just -- you just don't 14 get the safe harbor. Isn't that the only consequence? 15 MS. O'GRADY: That's right. You don't get 16 the safe harbor under E-Verify. Now -- for the use of 17 E-Verify. We did add after this lawsuit was filed some 18 additional requirements similar to what they have under 19 the Federal system, where you can't get State contracts, 20 you can't get State grants. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you are taking the 22 mechanism that Congress said will be a pilot program 23 that is optional, and you are making it mandatory. It 24 seems to me that's almost a classic example of a State 25 doing something that is inconsistent with the Federal
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 requirement. 2 MS. O'GRADY: Well, again, we look at the 3 test for conflict pre-emption in terms of, does this 4 make it impossible to comply with Federal law? No, it's 5 really a question of are we interfering with 6 Congress's -- excuse me -- the Federal Government's 7 ability to achieve its goals? And the goal in 8 developing E-Verify is to have a more effective 9 verification system. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: If they fail to do it, then 11 they cannot receive any, quote, "grant, loan, or 12 performance-based incentive," end quote, from the State. 13 That's what the law says, isn't it? 14 MS. O'GRADY: That's what -- and that was 15 added after this lawsuit was filed. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I would think 17 then the answer to Justice Scalia's question is, yes, 18 there is that penalty. It isn't simply hortatory. 19 MS. O'GRADY: Well, there's no penalty in 20 terms of - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: You don't go to jail. 22 MS.

1 MS. O'GRADY: That's true under current law. 2 That's not what the plaintiffs challenged - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does this lawsuit challenge 4 that? 5 MS. O'GRADY: That -- it does not, Your 6 Honor. They just challenged subsection (A) - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're under the old law, 8 and the only -- the only sanction is you lose the safe 9 harbor, if that's a sanction. 10 MS. O'GRADY: That's right. That's right, 11 Your Honor. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, in answer to 13 Justice Breyer's earlier question, in fact, relying on 14 the I-9 does not provide a safe harbor, because under 15 the E-Verify system, you can't just rely on the I-9 16 forms and statutes; you have to rely on the E-Verify. 17 MS. O'GRADY: Well, Your Honor, we have the 18 same -- it's modeled after the Federal law. So, just as 19 Federal law has a defense for employers who in good 20 faith follow I-9, so does the State law. I - 21 JUSTICE ALITO: The Federal law and the 22 State law do seem to be exactly the same on this point, 23 but I have -- I don't understand how these two 24 provisions fit together when E-Verify is used. 25 Suppose an employer -- the first thing the
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 employer does is receive the forms from the employee, 2 from the I-9 process. He looks at the forms. Well, 3 they reasonably seem to be authentic. So that employer 4 now has the good-faith defense that's provided under - 5 by the I-9 process, under both Federal law and State 6 law. 7 But, under both Federal law and State law, 8 the employee -- employer either must or may also use the 9 e-verification system. The employer gets back a notice 10 of non-authorization. But what -- and that creates, 11 supposedly, a rebuttable presumption under both systems 12 that the employee is not authorized to work. 13 How does that fit together? If you have a 14 complete defense for having used the I-9 process in good 15 faith, the whole e-verification process seems to be 16 irrelevant under both Federal law and State law. I 17 don't understand how they fit together. 18 MS. O'GRADY: And, Justice Alito, we haven't 19 wrestled that in practical application, and I'm not 20 aware of them reaching that point under the Federal 21 system, either, but -- because it does seem at some 22 point, if you -- that the system should work, that if 23 you have used I-9 and you get back a final 24 non-confirmation, not a tentative non-confirmation, that 25 that employee is unauthorized, that that, you know,
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 seems like it should carry greater weight in an 2 enforcement action. But as a -- as an -- on an 3 as-applied basis, I'm not sure how that plays out in an 4 actual enforcement action. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you -- I 6 wasn't quite sure what she meant. Judge Schroeder, in 7 her opinion for the court, emphasized that this statute 8 was being evaluated on its -- on its face and that - 9 she said in as-applied, particular challenges might 10 arise. 11 How would that work? If we determine this 12 is not pre-empted, how would -- on its face, how would 13 an as-applied challenge come about? 14 MS. O'GRADY: I think, Your Honor, perhaps 15 if we -- perhaps in terms of what are the outer limits 16 of our definition of "license" and their saying that we 17 are outside the definition of licensing and similar laws 18 in a particular case, perhaps that would be an 19 as-applied-type challenge. 20 I think some of the I-9 concerns are perhaps 21 more appropriately resolved in a -- in a direct case 22 where that issue has arisen on an as-applied basis, and 23 I think she was concerned about some of the real 24 implementation questions that were wrapped into the 25 legal challenge.

O'GRADY: My hope is, Your Honor, that 14 we get sufficient guidance - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wouldn't -- wouldn't it 16 be easier, if that's Justice Scalia's concern, to take 17 the Solicitor General's position, that if you're 18 adjudicating good faith or intent differently in any way 19 from the Federal Government, that it's pre-empted? 20 Isn't that what waiting for an as-applied challenge 21 means, whether or not you are putting different 22 requirements on proving good faith? 23 MS. O'GRADY: No, Your Honor, and -- because 24 I was trying to give some examples of the kinds of 25 things that may come up as a practical matter, but I
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 think we can get the guidance from this Court. I hope 2 that we can proceed in implementation, but - 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, let -- then let me 4 ask the question directly. If Arizona's system does not 5 permit a employer to rely on non-suspect documents, the 6 I-9 documents that are permitted employers to rely on - 7 the Arizona system says, no, you can't rely on those. 8 Is that pre-empted or not? 9 You can't rely on I-9, or the Arizona system 10 says -- on the I-9 documents. Or the Arizona system 11 says you can't hire someone who hasn't been approved 12 under the e-verification system. Is that pre-empted? 13 MS. O'GRADY: I think those would both be 14 problems. I think we need to be consistent with the - 15 the structure and the obligations that are imposed under 16 Federal law in terms of our sanctions provisions. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, are you -- are you 18 conceding that any variation from the Federal standards 19 for -- for criminal and civil liability is automatically 20 precluded? 21 I mean, as I read the exception, it's an 22 exception for State licensing and similar laws. And it 23 doesn't say "so long as those licensing and similar laws 24 go no further than what the Federal Government has 25 done." I mean, we often allow States to impose
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 regulatory requirements that go beyond the regulatory 2 requirements that the Federal Government has imposed, 3 and that is not automatically considered to be 4 pre-empted. So why -- why are you conceding that 5 Arizona cannot go a whit beyond what the Federal 6 Government says? 7 MS. O'GRADY: Because I think what Congress 8 preserved for us was our ability to impose sanctions, 9 including the suspension and revocation of State laws. 10 But I do think they established a uniform national 11 standard. I don't think we could, for example, 12 establish a -- a strict liability offense in Arizona. 13 We'd have to have a scienter requirement as they have in 14 Federal law. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what I was trying to 16 get is -- what I was looking at specifically is Federal 17 law says, if you look at the driver's license and Social 18 Security card -- those are I-9 docs -- then the employer 19 has established an affirmative defense and has not 20 violated the law. That's what it says. You know the 21 cite -- 27a or whatever. Okay? That's the Federal law. 22 Arizona law that I was reading -- maybe 23 there's another place I should read -- is it says, on 24 determining whether he's an unauthorized alien, the 25 court -- the court shall consider the Federal
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Government's determination. It creates a rebuttable 2 presumption. That means it might be rebutted. Okay? 3 So I see a difference there. And the reason 4 that that's relevant is because, my first question, if 5 you are an employer, prior to your law, it's 50/50. I 6 better verify because if I'm discriminating, you know, 7 da, da, da. And it's not that hard. I just look at the 8 driver's license and I look at -- I'm home free, and the 9 Social Security card, and if I hire an illegal 10 immigrant, the same thing, da, da, da. Okay? So same 11 both ways. 12 Your law: Employer, look at the driver's 13 license and Social Security, you are not home free. 14 Employer, if it turns out that you've been hiring this 15 illegal immigrant and he's not an American, your 16 business is finished. But what happens if I 17 discriminate? Under our law? Nothing. 18 Now, that was the original point they made. 19 That's why I brought up this question of difference in 20 standards. And I want to be absolutely clear what your 21 answer to that is. 22 MS. O'GRADY: And I'm hoping I am being 23 clear, Justice Breyer. We have the same standards as 24 Federal law. We have the same I-9 defense that's in 25 Federal law.

O'GRADY: Okay. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: So tell me where it is. 7 MS. O'GRADY: Okay. Let me get to it, and 8 let me explain our rebuttable presumption while I find 9 the specific statutory cite for our I-9 process. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it's on page 184 to 11 185 of the appendix to the petition, isn't it? 12 MS. O'GRADY: Yes. And 178a is the 13 provision: For the purposes of this section, employer 14 that establishes it has complied in good faith with the 15 requirements of 8 U.S.C. 1324a(b) establishes an 16 affirmative defense, et cetera. So that's the provision 17 that provides the I-9 defense. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the - 19 MS. O'GRADY: The rebuttable presumption 20 issue -- and this is how that comes into play. We have 21 to, in bringing an enforcement action, have to rely - 22 the State, in making its case, has to rely on 23 information from the Federal Government regarding 24 whether someone is authorized or unauthorized. We have 25 to rely on that information from the Federal Government.

1 We bring our action in State court if we have 2 verification from the Federal Government that that 3 person is unauthorized. We have additional information 4 that we've established the scienter requirement, then we 5 bring our action. But the employer has an opportunity 6 to rebut the evidence that we've presented in a State 7 court proceeding. It may be, you know, that person 8 doesn't work for us or some other type of evidence. So 9 that's the role of that rebuttable presumption, Your 10 Honor. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, thank you. I see 12 that. 13 MS. O'GRADY: Certainly. So in terms of the 14 prior adjudication - 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just so you know, I 16 interpret your answer as confirming the implication of 17 Justice Breyer's question, that there is a very 18 substantial difference in Federal and State law on this 19 point. I mean, you've told about -- you know what 20 lawsuits are about. If you're -- if you're home free by 21 a driver's license and Social Security inspection under 22 Federal law and you're not under State law, that is a 23 difference - 24 MS. O'GRADY: And our standards are the 25 same. And it's subsection (J) in which we have the I-9

1 affirmative defense in our State law and our Federal - 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think you are 3 home free under State law? 4 MS. O'GRADY: To the extent that you would 5 -- should be home free and you'd have the benefit of 6 that good-faith defense. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an affirmative 8 defense under both. 9 MS. O'GRADY: Yes, Your Honor. But having 10 the - 11 JUSTICE BREYER: The main point -- I mean, 12 I'll check that. I think maybe I was mistaken, perhaps, 13 in that I was looking at the other section. 14 MS. O'GRADY: That's right. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: But then we're still stuck 16 with this enormous discrepancy in penalty. I mean, I'm 17 characterizing it as enormous, but it seems like the - 18 you know, it's even on discrimination versus under the 19 Federal law. It's not even -- your business is out to 20 lunch, gone, and on the other side it has nothing. What 21 about that one? 22 MS. O'GRADY: I think, Your Honor, that that 23 is the natural consequence of the savings clause that 24 Congress itself adopted. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: The savings clause itself,

1 the word "licensing" -- not everyone looks at this, but 2 I did look at the legislative history. And when you 3 look at that paragraph on page 39 of the red brief, it 4 seems to me that that paragraph says what it means. It 5 says precisely what it is. It says -- the first thing 6 it says is that, look, if you're found to have violated 7 this -- where is it? It's page -- there it is. 8 Suppose somebody has been found to have 9 violated the sanctions provision in the Federal 10 legislation. Now, you've found -- he has been found by 11 the Federal Government. Then what the State does, it 12 can revoke his license. Okay? That's one thing. And 13 the second thing it says it wants -- doesn't want to 14 pre-empt "'fitness to do business laws,' such as State 15 farm labor contracting laws or forestry laws." In other 16 words, it's thinking of some precise set of licenses, 17 and that's why this licensing thing was there. And the 18 very next part of this Federal law are conforming 19 amendments, and those conforming amendments apply to 20 departments of government that were concerned with 21 maintaining State farm labor contractor laws. 22 Now, I grant you, you have to go beyond the 23 text, but some of us do because we get enlightenment. 24 And going beyond that text, it seems to me we should 25 follow what that House report says. Now, what is your
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 response to that? 2 MS. O'GRADY: Well, first, of course, we 3 would focus on the text where Congress could have but 4 did not - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I've got - 6 MS. O'GRADY: -- limit -- they didn't limit 7 it. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: I said yes, I've got broad 9 licensing -- but let's deal with the part where you look 10 at their explanation as to why they put those words 11 there. 12 MS. O'GRADY: Okay. First, the farm labor 13 contractor is simply an example, and I think it says 14 "such as" an example of the type of licensing provisions 15 that existed at this time that addressed that. So 16 that's not an all-inclusive universe of sanctions that 17 -- of -- of all the licensing laws that might be subject 18 to this. They also don't specifically say there has to 19 be a prior Federal adjudication. That sentence has 20 passive voice, "has been determined," without specifying 21 who is making that determination, and it specifically 22 refers to State and local processes that provide for the 23 suspension and revocation of State licenses. 24 And then the sentence goes -- then there's a 25 following sentence that says, you know, further, we
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 don't intend to disrupt laws such as these forestry and 2 other, you know, fitness to do business. 3 We think this is a fitness to do business 4 law in that we are establishing as a State standard that 5 if you engage in this conduct of knowingly employing 6 unauthorized aliens, we are going to have the ability to 7 take an action against that license that we have given 8 you to do business in our jurisdiction. So we think we 9 fit within that last sentence of the -- of the - 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you also explain the 11 I-9? You said it's the same as in the Fed. Home free 12 if you have documents, Social Security, driver's 13 license. But you also require the E-Verify. So how - 14 does the E-Verify information modify the I-9? How - 15 how do those two - 16 MS. O'GRADY: They work in our system, Your 17 Honor, as they do under the Federal law, under -- that 18 you get a rebuttable presumption if you -- in your favor 19 if you've used E-Verify, but the affirmative defense if 20 you've used I-9. And I am -- there is that caution; it 21 is good-faith use of -- of the I-9 system. We do have 22 examples where, for example, if an employer is 23 terminated because they are unauthorized and they show 24 up with a different name and different papers 2 weeks 25 later, you're not going to be able to establish your
53

1 good faith. So you're home free but subject to that 2 good-faith limitation. But we do incorporate the same 3 obligations that exist under Federal law. 4 And also I wanted to address more on the 5 farm labor contractors and the amendments. And what we 6 think that they were doing in those amendments was 7 simply dividing responsibility at the Federal level 8 between the Department of Labor and their processes that 9 pre-existed IRCA, and what they were establishing in 10 IRCA, and said we're not going to have these 11 determinations of whether they -- the farm labor 12 contractor has employed an unauthorized alien through a 13 Department of Labor process; we're going to instead use 14 the IRCA-established process. 15 But, importantly, what Congress did not 16 change in the agricultural worker regulations was the 17 provision that addresses State law. It said, before 18 IRCA and after IRCA, that those laws -- those Federal 19 laws only supplement the authority of the States and 20 that means that they preserved all of the State 21 authority that they had before IRCA in the area of farm 22 labor contractors. And that I think is reinforced by 23 the legislative history that -- that again reinforces 24 that those have been preserved through IRCA. 25 This is an area that has traditionally been
54

1 within the mainstream of State police power. We 2 acknowledge that Congress does have the authority to 3 pre-empt us, but they left important discretion in terms 4 of our ability to impose sanctions through licensing and 5 similar laws, and we are doing so by establishing this 6 scheme that provides for the suspension and revocation 7 of State licenses. 8 It's an important part of the balance that 9 Congress struck when it enacted IRCA by addressing what 10 State authority would exist after that congressional 11 enactment. We think the lower courts properly 12 determined the scope of that provision. 13 And unless there are further questions, I 14 thank you for your attention this morning. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 16 Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining. 17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 20 and, once again, may it please the Court: 21 I want to begin frankly where Justice 22 Sotomayor pointed me to before, which is the question of 23 whether or not there really is a basis for allowing the 24 States to independently investigate and to independently 25 adjudicate these matters. And what is the evidence that
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Congress did not intend that? 2 Justice Breyer quoted from the House report, 3 recognizing not everybody accepts that, but it does seem 4 to me to articulate a very commonsense limitation that 5 says you have to have a Federal adjudication in the 6 first instance, and once you've got that, then the State 7 is allowed to add that sanction. 8 That -- that principle, it seems to me, is 9 reinforced by the limitation on what you can use the I-9 10 for. Justice Alito, you asked that question, but it 11 does seem to me quite clear that what Congress 12 envisioned in 1986 when it adopted this is you're going 13 to have an exclusively Federal enforcement scheme 14 including the adjudicatory process, and it is only in 15 that context that you are allowed to use the I-9. And 16 the notion that the State could adopt a standard of 17 intentional or knowingly, and not be able to have the 18 I-9 materials available, seems to me flatly at odds with 19 each other, and, therefore, it cannot be that Congress 20 intended under those circumstances to allow these 21 matters to be adjudicated in that particular fashion. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What can -- Mr. Phillips, 23 what can the State do that would be complementary rather 24 than conflicting? 25 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- it seems to me the
56

1 easiest -- and of course, this has nothing to do with 2 what Arizona does -- but the easiest is, if a -- an 3 employer is convicted of -- of violating IRCA and a 4 criminal sanction, and he happens to be a barber, and 5 the State licensing law says if you're convicted of a - 6 of a Federal crime you will lose your license, it is 7 available to the State under those circumstances -- and 8 I think this is exactly what Congress had in mind -- to 9 issue a notice to show cause why that particular person 10 shouldn't have the license revoked and then go from 11 there. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Convicted by -- by a 13 Federal Government that hasn't gone after many 14 convictions. 15 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the whole problem. 17 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. But, 18 Justice Scalia, it seems to me the whole question here 19 -- and first of all, I don't think pre-emption can be a 20 moving target. I think you have to decide it on a basis 21 of what Congress had in front of it in 1986. But 22 remember, Congress was balancing three, at least, very 23 difficult problems: minimizing burdens on the 24 employers, minimizing discrimination against people who 25 are permitted to be hired, and avoiding hiring people
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 who are not permitted to do so. 2 And how you properly reconcile that is very 3 difficult, but the one thing that seems to me clear is 4 that that was a choice Congress meant to leave to itself 5 and to the Federal Government to sort out and not to 6 give the States the opportunity to come in where they 7 did. 8 And to say one last word about E-Verify - 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except - 10 well, you're just kind of blinking over the savings 11 clause: except through licensing and similar laws. So 12 that's not a real reservation by Congress of this power 13 to itself. 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you -- if you 15 interpret the savings clause as I do, which means truly 16 as a supplement to Federal -- Federal adjudication, then 17 it is a very narrow limitation on that basis, because at 18 that point you've already invoked the entirety of the 19 Federal scheme, and it doesn't modify the balance on 20 those broader legal issues, Your Honor. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 22 The case is submitted. 23 (Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the 24 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 25
