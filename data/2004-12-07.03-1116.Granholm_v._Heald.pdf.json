    "speech": "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: For 124 years, as state power over alcohol has ebbed and flowed, one principle has remained virtually constant, that states may regulate alcohol by one set of rules, not by two. New York and Michigan consigned out­ of-state wine, and only out-of-state wine, to the three­ tier system for closing the market to thousands of small family-run wineries and their customers for the benefit of a liquor distributor oligopoly. Discrimination is the core concern of the Commerce Clause, and it sends a powerful signal that the state is engaged, not in legitimate regulation, but in economic protectionism. The states and the liquor distributors make a sweeping argument that this Court has consistently rejected, that the Twenty-First Amendment creates plenary state authority."

I read the briefs in that case. The briefs presented that Court -- you could have written those briefs.

    "speech": "No, Justice Souter, that is not expressly on the record. What is on the record, however, is that the Court was aiming -- or, excuse me, the Congress was aiming at specific Supreme Court decisions. There -- and it -- and the one case that was clearest on point on discrimination was Scott versus Donald, applying both the Commerce Clause and the Wilson Act to forbid discrimination. And there was -- there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that Congress intended to overturn that decision. And as this Court has held in Craig versus Boren, and elsewhere, by enacting the Twenty­ First Amendment, Congress clearly intended to incorporate both the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act and to restore to the states the police power that they had before prohibition. Emphatically, discrimination was not a part of that police power. It was a very accepted context. So, too, is it today. When the -- when the liquor distributors in the states asked this Court to overturn the Bacchus decision and to adopt a plenary view of the Twenty-First Amendment, it is not just asking you to overturn the Bacchus decision; it is asking you to overturn cases starting with the Midcal decision in 1980, the more recent Healy decision, and others, that have held that the core purposes of the Commerce Clause and the Twenty-First Amendment must be harmonized, that the Commerce Clause was never intended to be obliterated. And when you look at the core values of the two clauses, they do not clash. The core purpose of the Commerce Clause is nondiscrimination. The core purpose of the Twenty-First Amendment is temperance.

As Justice Scalia said in concurrence in Healy, a liquor law's discriminatory character eliminates the immunity afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment. It's really the state's position, aided by their wholesaler allies, that it is the sweeping one. Their position is that every state law that regulates the importation of liquor is, per se, valid if it has any conceivable rational connection to a state purpose. So, for example, if Michigan wanted to simply bar all California wines, facially exclude California wines, saying, \"There are too many of them, it interferes with\" ­ ­"

And the Wilson Act -- to go back to Justice Souter's question and Justice Ginsburg's question -- Congress could authorize it as it has done, for example, in the McCarran­ Ferguson Act, allowing the states to discriminate against out-of-state industry with respect to the industry of insurance. It has not done so here. Webb-Kenyon did not authorize discrimination, and the Wilson Act forbade discrimination for just -- reasons Justice Ginsburg described. It said you may regulate imports of liquor in the same manner as local liquor laws. And, of course, the purpose of Section 2 was to allow to the dry states to keep dry by preventing all those original packages from piling up in the railway stations and being open to bootleggers throughout the state, undermining the dry policies of the state. Wilson forbade discrimination. Web Kenyan didn't authorize it. And in Congress' most recent articulation of its view of the harmony between the Twenty-First Amendment and the rest of the Constitution, the Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act, passed in 2000, enacted in 2000, Congress has a rules-of-construction section that says, \"We view any state plea to the federal courts to enforce their laws as reflecting the jurisprudence of this court.\" And, in fact, floor debate on that rules-of-construction section reflected allusions to Bacchus, Healy, and the other cases that said dormant commerce -- the negative implications of the Commerce Clause, no less than the Equal Protection Clause or the Due Process Clause or the Establishment Clause, constrain the states in their regulation of importation of liquor. So with all respect to Justice Brandeis, Justice Breyer, the Young's Market statements about discrimination have been superceded. What New York and Michigan have done here is say that one set of exceptions apply only to in-state producers, just as Connecticut, in Healy, said, \"If you just sell beer within our state, you don't have to face price ceilings that you have to face if you do business over in Massachusetts or Rhode Island.\" Just as in Bacchus, the -- you struck down a decision -- an excise tax exemption that said, \"If you're an importer of liquor, you have to pay an excise tax, but if you're a local producer of locally produced wine and spirits, you get out of that restriction.\""

Neither Michigan nor New York has shown that the facial discrimination here is necessary to protect minors or to protect the collection of taxes. Let's start with minors. The Michigan claim that it's protecting against under-18 sales is belied by the fact that Michigan is allowing 40 Michigan wineries and, at last count, 7500 Michigan retailers to deliver directly to consumers. The way to protect my -- so just as in Craig v. Boren, the exception for young women to drink 3.2 beer, as opposed to young men, belied the state's interest in temperance.

And, by the way, Michigan does not collect taxes, Justice Kennedy, through the distributors. Michigan collects taxes from the wineries, whether they're in-state or whether they're out-of-state wine shippers.

There are substantial differences between licensed in-state vendors of alcohol and out-of-state vendors that are not subject to the full extent of state regulatory and taxing powers. Because of those differences, Michigan requires that sales, including direct shipment of alcohol, be performed only by licensed, strictly regulated, in-state vendors.

    "speech": "With direct shipping, Justice Scalia, we can personalize things. In terms of the Bacchus case, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, New York, like Hawaii, conceded protectionism. It is very rife in the legislative record in 1970, when the direct shipping was extinguished. In 1995, when Governor Pataki vetoed a bill that would have solved this problem, he said, and I quote -- and this is in the record, the Joint -- the Second Circuit Joint Appendix, at 442 -- he said, and I quote, \"Since the vast majority of this country's wines are produced in California, I believe that this bill would inevitably lead to a significant increase in mail-order wines from that state into New York. This increase could, in turn, lead to a decrease in sales for New York liquor stores and their distributors, and shrink New York wineries' market share. That is protectionism.\" And, finally, the notion that small winemakers could go to all 50 states and open offices in order to do this -- if you could drive out to Middleburg and visit Juanita Swedenburg's winery -- and she invites you to do so -- [Laughter.]"

Our clients cannot compete with the liquor distributors in the political marketplace in their -- in their -- in their home states. They can, however, compete in the economic marketplace. The Commerce Clause protects that right, that level playing field. The Twenty-First Amendment was never intended to take it away. We ask this Court, respectfully, to honor 124 years of precedent in the National Economic Union. If there are no further questions, thank you."
