3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   We'll hear argument

4 next this morning in Case 14940, Evenwel v. Abbott.

5             Mr. Consovoy.

6          ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. CONSOVOY

7                ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

8             MR. CONSOVOY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10             This appeal presents a fundamental question.

11 That question is whether the oneperson, onevote rule

12 affords eligible voters any reasonable protection.  We

13 submit that the answer must be yes under this Court's

14 decisions, and as a consequence, Appellants have stated

15 a claim under the the Equal Protection Clause.

16             The districts at issue here, District 1 and

17 District 4, have deviations as measured by eligible

18 voters approaching 50 percent under any metric of

19 eligible voters.  No decision of this Court has ever

20 sustained vote dilution of that magnitude under a

21 oneperson, onevote case.  Beginning with Gray,

22 continuing to Wesberry, through Reynolds, and the

23 Court's many decisions since then, the issue has always

24 been vote dilution.

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the many times

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the Court has said that the  the principle is equal

4

2 representation of the population?  And we have had now,

3 for half a century, population  that the population is

4 the  the legitimate standard.  We have never held to

5 the contrary.

6             So we have the States overwhelmingly for

7 half a century using population as shown in the census,

8 and now you're saying they can't do that anymore.

9             MR. CONSOVOY:  I can answer the question

10 in  in three different ways.

11             First, with respect to the phrase "equal

12 representation for equal numbers of people."  That

13 sentence originated in Wesberry.  But that's only half

14 the sentence.  There's a dash, and it continues:

15 "Therefore, for us to hold that within the States

16 legislatures may draw the lines of congressional

17 districts in such a way as to give some voters a greater

18 voice in choosing a congressman than others would be

19 unconstitutional."

20             And in fact, in every time the Court uses

21 that phrase, which is the only one, I believe, my

22 friends rely on, it is either within the same sentence

23 or bracketed on one side or the other by protection of

24 voters.

25             Now, as to tradition, to  actually, to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 word "population," we don't  we  we see that as

5

2 asking the question, not answering it.  Burns explains

3 that Reynolds used population without distinguishing.

4 Burns itself reserved on the question.  Hadley confirms

5 that Burns reserved on it.  And here we are today.

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought  I thought

7 Burns said it approved a deviation from population but

8 it took great pains to say, we're not saying you could

9 do that in every case.  Burns seems to be the only 

10 the only case that you have, and Burns involved this

11 really peculiar situation of Hawaii with a tremendous

12 military temporary population.

13             MR. CONSOVOY:  I  I read Burns as

14 reserving on it completely, to not choose one way or the

15 other.  It certainly did say that you do not have to use

16 the  the census to draw districts.  That supports our

17 position.  It certainly says that you can protect

18 eligible voters.  That supports our position.

19             And  and further back to Your Honor's

20 question about tradition, if tradition were the rule,

21 Baker would have come out the other way.  Before Baker,

22 for centuries, geography was the basis.  And the Court

23 said in Baker, as a matter of jurisdiction, and then in

24 Reynolds as a matter of  of equal protection law, that

25 tradition doesn't trump the individual rights of a voter

Alderson Reporting Company

1 to be protected.

6

2             And we don't have to guess about that

3 because we know from standing.  In all of those cases,

4 standing was predicated on the right of the voter.

5             It would be unusual if someone who couldn't

6 vote came to this Court and says  said my one  a

7 child, for instance  my oneperson, onevote rights

8 have been violated.

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem is that 

10 what you're forgetting is the dual interest.  There is a

11 voting interest, but there is also a representation

12 interest, and it's that which has led us to  to accept

13 the total population base because States have to have

14 some discretion to figure out who should be having the

15 representational voice.

16             Burns made it very clear that we were

17 deferring to the State because it had a legitimate

18 reason for its need.

19             And  but Burns was in the 1960s, when we

20 picked total population as a perfectly legitimate way

21 because there's a representational need at issue as

22 well.  Not just voting.  A State has to be able to

23 say  I think just as the Federal government did 

24 we're  the legislature is protecting not just voters;

25 it's protecting its citizens  or noncitizens.  The

2             MR. CONSOVOY:  So if I can just clarify:

3 It's not really a representational interest that's being

4 claimed on the other side.  They  a nonvoter will

5 be  there's 31 senate districts in Texas.  A nonvoter

6 will have one representative under our rule, and they

7 will have their one representative under theirs.  It's

8 an access claim that's being made.  That's what the

9 Garza opinion from the Ninth Circuit said.

10             And it's not even really an access claim.

11 It's a diminishing access claim.  That's how far from

12 voting the interest on the other side goes.  It is that,

13 if we have districts that are overpopulated with

14 nonvoters, we will have diminishing access to our

15 representative.

16             We don't deny that access is an interest,

17 along with county lines, along with other interests that

18 the State can take into consideration, and the

19 10 percent framework allows for that.  This is not a

20 situation where we are here complaining about a

21 deviation of 15 percent or 10.1 percent.  We're

22 complaining about a deviation of nearly 50 percent.  No

23 interest such as diminishing access could ever overcome

24 the individual right of a voter to an equal vote.

25             And if you 

Alderson Reporting Company

8 1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Consovoy, of course it's 2 true that when we apportion House members, we use total 3 population as the metric.  And the question that's 4 raised by your position is why it would be the case that 5 the Constitution requires something with respect to one 6 apportionment that it prohibits with respect to another. 7             MR. CONSOVOY:  Apportionment and intrastate 8 districting are fundamentally different concerns. 9 Apportionment at the time of Article I's framing was 10 focused on taxation issues, on giving States autonomy 11 with respect to voter qualifications.  And there was a 12 real concern.  That's why it was a  the great 13 compromise. 14             What the Court held in Reynolds, as a matter 15 of equal protection, is that that compromise does not 16 justify this kind of injury. 17             And we don't have to guess about this 18 either.  In  in Reynolds Alabama came to the Court and 19 said, "semi" we surrender.  How about a plan that 20 mirrors the House precisely?  Every county gets one 21 representative, and the rest is done on a population 22 basis.  Not only on a population basis.  The precise 23 formula used for the House of Representatives.  Reynolds 24 said no. 25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's interesting is in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Reynolds is the reason they caved was because,

9

2 constitutionally, the Arizona Constitution required

3 total population.  It's that fact that they deviated

4 from their own Constitution that led them to court.  So

5 it wasn't a caving compelled by Federal law.  It was

6 mostly a caving compelled by State law.

7             MR. CONSOVOY:  Well, the  not that this

8 Court found the case, because it wouldn't  couldn't be

9 before this Court on a State law ground.  It could only

10 be before this Court 

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  But what I'm saying

12 is that we  we acceded on the ground that using total

13 populations was permissible.

14             MR. CONSOVOY:  There's no doubt that

15 Reynolds thought, in that case, total population.  The

16 Court in Reynolds thought it was permissible.

17             Of course, Baker, the Tennessee constitution

18 apportioned unqualified voters, and there was no

19 suggestion in Baker that that was an additional problem

20 with the Tennessee constitution.

21             But the fundamental issue has always been

22 the individual right.  And I think Gray is the best case

23 to show that.

24             Gray is about election for statewide

25 offices, so it can't be a representational issue.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 There's going to be one governor.  That governor is  2 everyone is going to have the same access to that 3 governor or not.  There are no districts. 4             And yet Gray is the case that establishes 5 this rule.  Gray is the case that says, voters are 6 entitled to an equal vote.  You can't marry up the 7 representational interest that's asserted on the other 8 side with Gray.  It doesn't  it doesn't make any 9 sense. 10             We also know from  with respect to 11 congressional districting, as late as 1969, in 12 Kirkpatrick, the Court assumed, for purposes in that 13 case, that Missouri could district at the congressional 14 level on the basis of eligible voters.  So I don't think 15 it would be fair to say that this issue has somehow been 16 clouded or decided by uses of the words "population" or 17 using the census in prior cases. 18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm  I'm sorry.  Did I 19 just understand you to say that you think that the  20 the House apportionment rule is not clear? 21             MR. CONSOVOY:  No.  The  that 22 congressional districting intrastate at the Federal 23 level as opposed to the State level. 24             So if  if 1969 Kirkpatrick v. Chrysler 25 says  because the United States has argued that not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 only is apportionment required at the Federal level but 2 intrastate congressional districting.  And my point  3 they  and they rely solely on Westbrook for that  4 excuse me  Wesberry for that proposition. 5             My point is in 1969 the Court flatly 6 rejected Wesberry as having decided that issue.  There 7 is no decision of the Court that resolves this question. 8 It is  it is completely open. 9             And the only way to make sense of the 10 oneperson, onevote rule is to make it about eligible 11 voters.  They are the ones who have standing.  They are 12 the ones who can bring a claim.  They are the ones who 13 are injured.  And not only is that our view and the case 14 law's view, that was  that was Congress's view. 15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it your view that what 16 the Fourteenth Amendment means is that in all the years 17 between  what was it?  1868 and 1920, it was wrong 18 for the States to include, for these purposes, women? 19 They were not eligible voters. 20             MR. CONSOVOY:  Any  there is no question 21 that was a problem.  It was an  it was an issue in the 22 '60s with minorities as well who were  who were 23 disenfranchised.  The  the Court in Reynolds at the 24 time was doing more than one thing at once. 25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you're saying that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1 that was wrong.  I mean, in your interpretation of the 2 Fourteenth Amendment from 1868 until 1920, the State 3 should not have been counting women for  for purposes 4 of determining representation in the State legislature. 5             MR. CONSOVOY:  For purposes of the  of the 6 Equal Protection Clause, the oneperson, onevote rule 7 protects voters.  If disenfranchisement of women or 8 minorities is an issue, those cases could have been 9 brought.  Eventually, that issue was resolved by this 10 country, as was minority representation. 11             But the Warren court in Reynolds was 12 accomplishing several things.  And equal weight for 13 voters has to matter.  A noncitizen or any other 14 disenfranchised person would not have the ability to 15 bring a oneperson, onevote claim. 16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but here we have  I 17 want to go back to Justice Kagan's question.  And this 18 is something that  it seems everyone is arguing this 19 is as if this is an equal protection problem.  And 20 certainly, the  Reynolds v. Sims does deal with equal 21 protection.  And it did deal with instances in which 22 voters and everything else were malapportioned.  So I 23 don't think the court really considered this. 24             But if you step back from the Equal 25 Protection Clause and say there are other parts of the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 Constitution that, in fact, are relevant here  maybe 2 it's the Republican Form of Government Clause.  But the 3 words that Justice Kagan read are words about what kind 4 of democracy people wanted.  And those words say if you 5 look to other parts of the Constitution, such as those, 6 or Republican Form of Government, that what we actually 7 want is the kind of democracy where people, whether they 8 choose to vote or whether they don't choose to vote, are 9 going to receive a proportionate representation in 10 Congress. 11             And if you take that as a constitutional 12 principle, that shows an objective of some of the 13 clauses of the Constitution.  Then you have to retreat 14 from the idea that the Equal Protection Clause, as 15 interpreted in Reynolds v. Sims, solves this case.  And 16 indeed, it argues against you. 17             MR. CONSOVOY:  So two answers. 18             One is to argue that this is justiciable on 19 the other side as a Guarantee Clause claim, I think 20 shows just how far the logic has to go to come up with 21 something on the other side of the ledger here.  This 22 Court has never  in fact, in Baker, the Court rejected 23 the Guarantee Clause as a basis for hearing these cases. 24 To turn around now, and turn 180 degrees, so that a  a 25 somewhat abstract Guarantee Clause claim, that

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not making it.  I'm

3 making  I'm pointing at her  she didn't quote the

4 Guarantee Clause.  Maybe I shouldn't have thrown that

5 in.  But it's the same point.

6             MR. CONSOVOY:  If I could  but Reynolds, I

7 think, does speak to this, because that exact theory

8 would be the one that would have sustained the model

9 that Alabama brought to the Court, that  that followed

10 the House of Representatives, which does take account of

11 these issues.

12             And even if, Justice Breyer, even if you're

13 correct, that theory is correct, that doesn't solve this

14 case.  We have alleged in our complaint that Texas could

15 have done much more to  to manage both

16 representational equality, as it's called, and voting

17 equality to get both within 20 percent.  To say that we

18 have not 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You had an expert say

20 it, but you didn't have an expert prove it.  He did not

21 come in with a map that did that.

22             MR. CONSOVOY:  We did not come in with a

23 map.

24             One, we're still at the motiontodismiss

25 stage in this case, so our allegation, which is at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 paragraph 22 of the complaint, has to be taken as true. 2             But second, the reason we didn't come to a 3 map is fundamental here as well.  We don't want the 4 Court or ourselves to write this map for Texas.  We want 5 the Texas legislature to do its job. 6             Texas, by State law, was precluded from 7 taking voter equality  8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is  does practical 9 possibility play into this discussion at all?  I mean, 10 the ACS, which you posit is the way that you can find 11 who the eligible voters are, has been  has been  I 12 think almost decisively been proven as being inadequate. 13 It only measures cities with populations or places with 14 populations over 65,000.  Just on that ground alone, 15 there are going to be districts that can't rely on it. 16             MR. CONSOVOY:  I  I think  sorry. 17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's flawed on many 18 levels.  We could  take my assumption.  It's flawed. 19             Does that practicality have any play in our 20 decision? 21             MR. CONSOVOY:  I will take the assumption 22 and then I will try to argue again against it, if you  23 you'll allow me. 24             But practicality, if the Court were to hold 25 that  two different questions.  As the Court explained
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 in Tennant just recently, it's our burden to bring in 2 evidence showing that total population census didn't 3 protect individual rights. 4             We believe  at this stage, we have alleged 5 it, so it has to be taken as true.  If we can't prove 6 it, then we have failed to meet our burden. 7             It would be a different question if the 8 Court held yes, the evidence you brought in is 9 sufficient to show that your rights have been violated 10 through the ACS data, but not sufficient to draw a new 11 map.  Then I think the Court is in a very unusual place, 12 where I think the answer is we're back to Baker, which 13 would then become  that would be the argument of the 14 dissent in Baker, which is you have a violation but no 15 judicially manageable way to solve it, so now we're back 16 to political question. 17             But if I could get back to the fundamental 18 premise, which is the ACS data, the ACS data  I think 19 Your Honor was talking about the 1year ACS data, but 20 States for redistricting used the 5year ACS data.  That 21 matters  measures populations going down less than 22 3,000 people.  The only group it doesn't have is 23 individual block group data, and that data is rarely 24 used for districting that we're talking about here. 25             Moreover, we know the ACS data is good
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1 because it's used in Section 2 every day, and not just 2 for a vague and general purpose.  Under Strickland, 3 under Bartlett against Strickland, to bring a successful 4 Section 2 claim, you have to show that you have a 5 majority of the citizen votingage population in your 6 district to  to get through the first factor for 7 Section 2. 8             That means if there's 50.1 percent minority 9 eligible voters in your district, you can proceed; if 10 it's 49.9 percent, you cannot.  This data is used to 11 determine that question. 12             If it can do that in every circuit court in 13 the country  and in this Court's opinions in LULAC and 14 Strickland supported using this data for that purpose  15 if it can do that, it can bring a deviation of 16 47 percent to somewhere between 10 and 20. 17             And I don't want to leave this abstract.  If 18 you look at the Supplemental Appendix, the data is 19 actually in there.  If you turn to page 5 of the 20 Supplemental Appendix, there is a column called "CVAP" 21 and it lists all of the CVAP numbers for every Texas 22 Senate district.  I would point out that Texas asked for 23 these numbers to draw this map.  They used CVAP to draw 24 this map. 25             If you pull those numbers and look at
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
18 1 District 1, it has 557,000 people.  Right next to that 2 is the plus or minus with numbers.  It says 6,784. 3 That's the margin of error.  That's the margin of error 4 for CVAP data. 5             So if you took all of those margins of error 6 and used them against our position at every turn  so 7 for underpopulated district, assume up; for 8 overpopulated district, assume down  assume it at 9 every turn against us, and you ran the numbers, it would 10 move the deviation from 47 percent to 45 percent. 11             This is not an issue about margin of error, 12 about data.  This is not an issue about the availability 13 of data.  This data is used if  by every demographer 14 to draw statewide districts at every turn. 15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Consovoy, could I go 16 back to the question that Justice Breyer raised and 17 can  stripped, if he'll permit me, of the Guarantee 18 Clause, because the Fourteenth Amendment is actually 19 quite  you know, the framers of the Fourteenth 20 Amendment explicitly considered this issue, and, you 21 know, made a decision. 22             So Senator Howard, who introduces the 23 Amendment on behalf of the joint committee that drafts 24 it, talks about these deliberations.  And he says the 25 committee adopted numbers as the most just and
Alderson Reporting Company

19 1 satisfactory basis, and that's the principle upon which 2 the Constitution itself was originally framed, referring 3 back to the original drafting.  And then he says 4 numbers, not voters; numbers, not property; this is the 5 theory of the Constitution. 6             Now, this is the theory of the Constitution 7 as to one thing, which is not the thing that you are 8 talking about.  This is the theory of the Constitution 9 as to House apportionment. 10             But again, I'll go back to this question. 11 This is such a clear, explicit choice that was made 12 about what it meant to  to have equal representation 13 with respect to that area.  And how you go from that 14 being mandated to it being prohibited in the State 15 context is something that I still can't quite work 16 myself around. 17             MR. CONSOVOY:  Justice Harlan agreed with 18 you.  He did. 19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's a good person to be 20 on the side of. 21             MR. CONSOVOY:  Yes. 22             (Laughter.) 23             MR. CONSOVOY:  But his  his position was 24 rejected 81 in Reynolds.  Because that exact argument 25 was brought forth by Alabama.  They presented a plan
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that was not only somewhat generally modeled on an

20

2 apportionment standard, it mirrored it exactly.  So I

3 think there are reasons why that's not correct as a 

4 just a legal matter, because apportionment was concerned

5 with many other things.  They wanted the States to have

6 taxation basis.  They wanted  there was an issue with

7 suffrage, for sure.  There was an issue with voter

8 qualifications.  It was a complex, Federalismbased,

9 sovereignty comprise that does not apply within a State.

10             I can't do any better, I apologize, than say

11 Reynolds 

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I hear you as to that it

13 does not apply.  I mean, I guess I can  I can

14 understand.  I might not agree with, but I can

15 understand the position that says that the requirement

16 might not apply.  But you are suggesting that we go

17 beyond that, and to say, not only does the requirement

18 not apply, but that States have to do it the exact

19 opposite way.

20             MR. CONSOVOY:  So, two answers.

21             We take our cue on that from the right that

22 is supposed to be protected.  It all follows from the

23 right, and it starts with voting.  We start with the

24 proposition that one person can't be given two votes

25 while their neighbor be given one vote, and from there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1 the Court moved in Gray to say, well, you can't do it by 2 calling it weighting under some sort of electoral 3 college model.  That's the same thing. 4             Then the third step was you can't accomplish 5 that same invidious voter discrimination by drawing 6 lines.  Now if you accept all of that as true, that I 7 can't be given five votes and my neighbor be given one, 8 then even if it follows from the apportionment model and 9 you  and you defend it on that basis, if it causes 10 that injury, I have a claim.  And to say that I don't 11 have a claim because a different constitutional 12 provision protects a different right in a different way, 13 I  we find, you know, not a satisfactory response 14 beyond which Reynolds itself rejects  rejects the 15 argument. 16             And turning back to Section 2 for a moment, 17 Congress agreed with our position.  Congress relied on 18 Reynolds being a votedilution case to enact Section 5, 19 not only in the Senate report that's been so widely used 20 in those cases, but in this Court's opinions as well, in 21 Perkins and in later cases.  The Court has held that  22 and  and in Bolden, both the plurality and 23 Justice Marshall's dissent, said Reynolds is about vote 24 dilution. 25             And Section 2  the same argument could be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 made, Justice Kagan, about Section 2.  Section 2 only 2 counts eligible voters.  No one argues that we're 3 discriminating against nonvoters by not taking them 4 into consideration.  If the Court were to proceed with 5 that kind of representational model, we would have one 6 rule that minorities get the  excuse me  the benefit 7 of under Section 2, and no protection for people who are 8 not minority status under oneperson, onevote.  There 9 is a  there is a real fundamental disconnect there. 10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In  in your view, the 11 States would have a choice between the citizen 12 votingage population or they could use the registered 13 voters?  Either one would be okay? 14             MR. CONSOVOY:  Well, we start with the 15 proposition that Burns said.  It's not the method by 16 which you distribute legislators that count.  It's the 17 distribution of legislators that count. 18             Therefore, as Burns explains, the State can 19 truly use any metric that adequately and fairly 20 distributes legislators.  We think registered voters is 21 not ordinarily going to be the right one for two 22 reasons: 23             Gray says those who hold the oneperson, 24 onevote right are those who meet the basic 25 qualifications of voting.  So there, registered voters

1 run into trouble.

Official

23

2             And then Burns essentially doubles down on

3 that argument by saying it depends upon political

4 activity.

5             And where we're drawing lines at essentially

6 the beginning of the game, we shouldn't make the right

7 depend upon who ends up deciding to enter the fray and

8 choose to vote.

9             So we think the data that we principally

10 rely on, the  the ACS measure of citizen votingage

11 population is ordinarily going to be the fairest and

12 most accurate measure.  But that's for the legislature

13 to decide when it  when it reviews all this

14 information.

15             And the Texas legislature  I think it's

16 important to keep in mind when they drew this map, they

17 did everything that we're asking to be done here.  They

18 took all of this data  the total census data, the

19 citizenship data, the registered voter data, the  the

20 precinct data  and they put it all into a computer.

21 And they drew their districts.

22             And they used our data to draw districts in

23 this map.  They just used it to comply with Section 2

24 and when  and then closed their eyes and didn't want

25 to look at  to see what kind of deviations it caused

2             All we're asking the legislature to do is

3 open its eyes.

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think they did

5 that invidiously?  Did they do it purposely?

6             MR. CONSOVOY:  Well, under oneperson,

7 onevote, a deviation over 10 percent, as the Court just

8 recently heard 

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They knew that, and they

10 intentionally decided to have deviations greater than

11 10 percent?  That's what you're saying?

12             MR. CONSOVOY:  I don't think we can know 

13 we'll ever know because they were handcuffed by State

14 law.  There was an attorney general interpretation from

15 1981 that precluded Texas from considering voter

16 eligibility.  It  so it's really arbitrary 

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That goes both back to

18 my point that they decided that they wanted to make this

19 a representational matter.  But do  so they were

20 precluded  intentionally decide to exclude it?

21             MR. CONSOVOY:  No.  Under the oneperson,

22 onevote rule, a deviation exceeding 10 percent, we

23 establish, as we  we argue as a matter of eligible

24 voters, itself is prima facie evidence of invidious 

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we have  we have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 plenty of case law that says you can have deviations

25

2 greater than 10 percent  Hawaii did  if you have a

3 legitimate reason.  And so why would  the great

4 representational need that Justice Kagan was talking

5 about not be an adequate reason?

6             MR. CONSOVOY:  We think it is a  a reason

7 to go over 10 percent.  That's  we do not want the

8 perfect to be the enemy of the good on this issue.  We

9 understand that things need latitude.  We are asking for

10 nothing more than to bring them within the 10 to

11 20 percent range that the Court has always held.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're  you're now 

13 you're now saying 10 to 20 percent is okay instead of

14 10 percent when we use total population.

15             MR. CONSOVOY:  The  the Court has up 

16 held up the 16.5 percent, and  and Mahan 20 percent as

17 the outer limit.  We take our cues from those.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose Texas said here, we

19 want children to be represented?  That's all.  Children.

20 See, they're not voters.  So suppose  if we take

21 children out of it, what's the deviation?

22             MR. CONSOVOY:  We haven't examined it.  We

23 only examine on the basis of eligible voters.  But

24 children are represented at the polls.  They're

25 represented at the polls by their parents.  If there are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1 parents here who have been disenfranchised, they were 2 disenfranchised by the State.  States like California 3 and Texas and New York have  4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, how about  5             MR. CONSOVOY:   have  6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about children who 7 are citizens when their parents are not, which is fairly 8 common in many areas? 9             MR. CONSOVOY:  And  and when  when they 10 become eligible voters, they will move into this base. 11 They are not counted for Section 2, and don't  haven't 12 heard any argument that Section 2 discriminates against 13 children. 14             If I might, Mr. Chairman, reserve the 15 balance. 16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 17             General Keller. 18             ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER 19                ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES 20             MR. KELLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 21 and may it please the Court: 22             The only question the Court has to resolve 23 here is whether the Equal Protection Clause requires 24 every State to change its current practice and use voter 25 population to reapportion.  The answer is no.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1             Texas validly used Federal census data to 2 equalize total populations States have done for decades. 3 And the framers of the Equal Protection Clause accepted 4 total population as a permissible apportionment base in 5 Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, as Justice Kagan 6 said earlier. 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why don't they 8 use that under Section 2, then? 9             MR. KELLER:  In Section 2 of  10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Voting Rights. 11             MR. KELLER:  The Voting Rights Act? 12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes. 13             MR. KELLER:  Section 2 of the Voting Rights 14 Act for tax voters  and our position, unlike the 15 United States's position, is that only voters are 16 protected under the Voting Rights Act.  So in 17 considering whether there is an opportunity to elect a 18 candidate of one's choice, only voters would count for 19 that inquiry.  Indeed I  20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it is  it is 21 called the oneperson, onevote.  That seems to be 22 designed to protect voters. 23             MR. KELLER:  It does protect voters, but 24 there are multiple legitimate bases here on which a 25 State can redistrict.  Electoral equality is one of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 them.  Representational equality is another.

28

2             And if I can back out, what we're dealing

3 with here is the general Equal Protection Clause's test

4 which  it guards against invidious discrimination.

5 The Court has noted before a mere disparate impact does

6 not violate the Constitution.  And so really the claim

7 that's being alleged here is one of invidious vote

8 dilution.

9             But Texas, by using total population, as

10 States have done for decades, and no State today uses

11 voter population, did not invidiously target groups to

12 cancel out their voting power or reduce their ability to

13 elect representatives of their choice.

14             Rather, what Texas was doing was making the

15 legitimate choice to use representational equality,

16 which, as this Court's cases have noted, is a legitimate

17 interest that the State can account for in

18 redistricting.

19             What the State cannot do is submerge the

20 population principle.  In other words, as Reynolds held,

21 we cannot base apportionment on geography.  We have to

22 take account of population.  And we have done that.

23             There is no allegation here that our

24 8.04 percent deviation of total population would not

25 satisfy the Court's oneperson, onevote doctrine unless

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we are required to use voter population.

29

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  There are at least two

3 arguments that could support your position.  One is that

4 it's oneperson, onevote, and what counts is giving

5 each person an equal chance of affecting the outcome of

6 the election.  But total population figures are a good

7 enough proxy for eligible voters.  That's one possible

8 argument.

9             And that's  that's what the census

10 measures, and that's close enough.

11             Another argument is that representational

12 equality is the real basis, and therefore that's why you

13 use population.

14             So which argument are you making?

15             MR. KELLER:  I don't believe we're making

16 either of those arguments, Justice Alito.

17             Total population is not permissible because

18 it tracks voter population.  At the same time, while the

19 Court doesn't have to reach this question,

20 representational equality is not the only basis on which

21 a State can redistrict.

22             It's our position that we could choose a

23 reliable measure of votingeligible population without

24 running afoul of the Equal Protection Clause's

25 guaranteed against invidious discrimination.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1             JUSTICE ALITO:  It seems to me that the two 2 interests are not always consistent.  They can be in 3 great conflict. 4             You can have a situation if you  if you 5 want to equalize population, you may have a situation 6 where you cause great inequality in the  the chances 7 of any  of voters affecting the outcome of the 8 election.  On the other hand, if you choose eligible 9 voters only, then you may have a situation where every 10 person within two districts does not have an equal 11 representation defined in some way in the legislature. 12             I don't think you can just say, well, 13 it's  you know, we serve both.  What do you do when 14 they come into conflict? 15             MR. KELLER:  I believe what this Court said 16 in Burns is you allow the States to choose the theory of 17 representation.  And indeed, the decision to include or 18 exclude nonvoters, Burns said, was left to the States, 19 because part of what this Court's doctrine has 20 recognized is States need leeway, and that this is a 21 core sovereign function.  It is part of the dignity of 22 State sovereignty to be able to structure elections. 23             And when a  when a State is choosing 24 either representation or equality, when the two are in 25 tension, that's not an illegitimate basis upon which to
Alderson Reporting Company

1 reapportion.

Official

31

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if the voter

3 population is a permissible basis under the

4 Constitution, I assume that's because there is  is an

5 ethical, a good government, a liberty interest in

6 protecting these voters.  That's a valid interest,

7 correct?

8             MR. KELLER:  Correct.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if in a case like

10 this where there is a 45 percent deviation, something of

11 that order, then why isn't Texas required at that point

12 to recognize that these interests that are legitimate

13 under the Constitution, which are voter based, should

14 not be accommodated, and so that you should at least

15 give some consideration to this disparity that you have

16 among voters?

17             MR. KELLER:  Well, first off, the court in

18 Gaffney upheld the use of total population while

19 recognizing that there could  there was, in New York

20 at least, a different State, a 29 percent deviation in

21 voter population.  Yet the court there said it was quite

22 sure that a prima facie case in invidious discrimination

23 had not been made out.

24             And so while a State can, and legitimately

25 does consider both representational equality and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 electoral equality, the Equal Protection Clause's

32

2 general language doesn't mandate that either must take

3 precedence over the other.

4             So of course it would be legitimate for the

5 State to look at that data.  At the same time, when we

6 have Federal census data, which is the most robust data

7 set available, it is not invidious for Texas to use that

8 enumeration rather than a different data set when it

9 reapportions.  And all we have under the census data is

10 total population data.

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  What we have  and that's

12 why I think Justice Alito's question is important  is

13 a table on page 9 of the Blue Brief.

14             Now, just looking at that table, by

15 inspection, I don't know whether the true  whether

16 this is true or false.  So I thought the major

17 difference between the two here is probably that some

18 areas of  of the State  there are a lot of people

19 who are working and they have children.  I mean, it

20 can't all be explained on the basis of illegal

21 immigration or something.  It just can't be, given those

22 numbers.  I don't think so.

23             And if we accept the principle that it's

24 voter equality, we are saying that the family of two of

25 certain age that has eight children or whatever is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 getting no representation for those other people or

33

2 human beings.  And if we accept the opposite, we have to

3 put up with inequality of  of power of voters.  You

4 have to  you have to say the one or the other.  And

5 you could take your position it's up to the State.

6             But I mean, that seems to me to be what's

7 actually behind the numbers that he's  that  that

8 are being quoted, but I'm not sure.  So I'd like your

9 reaction.

10             MR. KELLER:  Sure.  Justice Breyer, I

11 believe there's a difference between diminishing access

12 to representatives and actually having representation.

13 The United States has said that if Texas or another

14 State reapportioned on the basis of voter population,

15 that nonvoters would be invisible to the system.

16 That's not right.  They would still be represented.

17             The issue is does State  does a State have

18 to have the same amount of constituents per

19 representative?  And a State can do so.  It's a

20 legitimate 

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  That sounds an awful lot

22 what they had in 1750 or something, where the British

23 Parliament said, well, don't worry, America, you're

24 represented by the people in England because after all,

25 they represent everybody in the British Empire.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. KELLER:  Which is 

34

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, that people are

3 being represented through somebody else is a little 

4 possible, but tough.

5             MR. KELLER:  Well, for instance, a child in

6 my congressional district would still be represented by

7 that member of Congress.  So the issue is  really is

8 diminishing access to the representative.  And while

9 that's a legitimate basis for a State to reapportion

10 under, there is no Equal Protection principle that would

11 elevate that as a rule of constitutional law that would

12 say that the Sate of Texas invidiously discriminated.

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why is one option

14 exclusive of the other?  Why can't you have both?  You

15 have population equality and voter equality, both,

16 especially when you have indicated that a voterbased

17 apportionment is  is valid and serves important

18 purposes.  And here it's being completely  it's being

19 very substantially disregarded with this huge deviation.

20             Why can't you use both?

21             MR. KELLER:  Well, first of all, there's

22 been no demonstrative plan that was submitted to the

23 Texas legislature, which has a noticeandcomment

24 procedure on this, or to the district court, that both

25 of these could have been equalized within 10 percent.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
35 1 Indeed, their demographer didn't specify the extent of 2 the deviations.  Their demographer simply said, well, 3 the deviations can be reduced. 4             If the Court were to try to go down the road 5 of requiring States to equalize within 10 percent of a 6 deviation, both total and voter population, States would 7 inevitably have to disregard many other traditional 8 redistricting factors, like compactness, continuity, 9 keeping communities together.  And that would be the 10 opposite of what the Court has said that States have in 11 this context, which is the leeway to structure their 12 elections as part of the core function of their 13 sovereignty. 14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That sounds highly 15 probable to me. 16             Has anything been written on this, or any 17 studies on this  18             MR. KELLER:  I  I  I don't  19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   in  in the context of 20 Texas. 21             MR. KELLER:  I  I  I don't believe so. 22 We're not aware of any.  And we're also not aware that 23 this would be practically feasible.  Indeed, if they had 24 a plausible allegation that this was possible, we would 25 have expected to see a demonstrative map at this phase

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have any idea

3 how often this is a problem?  I mean, it is a case that,

4 of course, around the country, people use total

5 population.  But it seems to me that there will be a lot

6 of areas where, in terms of the actual numbers, it's not

7 going to make a difference.

8             Do you have any idea?

9             MR. KELLER:  I believe New York's amicus

10 brief suggests that in places such as California,

11 Alaska, possibly New York, certainly New York City, the

12 issue will absolutely come up.  However, even 

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But only in  only

14 in those particular handful of 

15             MR. KELLER:  A few more examples

19             By no means would this necessarily be a

20 problem anywhere.  However, if there were a rule that a

21 State had to consider voter population, that would

22 change the nature of redistricting.

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what if it

24 were you had the same minor or de minimis deviation

25 allowed there?  In other words, if you're within  the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
37 1 deviation between total population and voter population 2 was within  under 10 percent, does that take care of 3 many of the areas where it's a problem? 4             MR. KELLER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, for 5 the reasons I just suggested to Justice Kennedy, I 6 believe that would be quite an onerous burden and change 7 the nature of redistricting.  Could there possibly be a 8 situation out there in which a plan might be able to get 9 within a 10 percent deviation of total population and a 10 10 percent deviation of the fiveyear rolling average 11 sampling in the American Community Survey?  Maybe.  I'm 12 not aware of any such scenario. 13             And to back out to first principles, I don't 14 believe that would be a test of invidious 15 discrimination.  That would be moving much further in 16 the direction of a disparate, impactlike test that the 17 Court has never fashioned to determine whether someone's 18 voting power is being canceled out, or is fenced out of 19 the political process. 20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you explain why 21 the ACS  your adversary says ACS is fine; it's used in 22 Section 2 and Section 5.  Why would it be inappropriate 23 to use it in  in deciding the impact on an equal 24 voting analysis? 25             MR. KELLER:  Well, our position is that if
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
38 1 the ACS data is reliable enough to hold the State liable 2 under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, it would also 3 be reliable enough to use in apportionment. 4             Now there could be issues about the 5 granularity of the data.  For instance, the fiveyear 6 averages.  We do get at censusblock level, which is 7 about five to 600 to 3,000 people. 8             The smaller you would get for district 9 levels, depending on if you were at a city plan as 10 opposed to our State Senate plan.  There may be issues 11 where you couldn't use the data to get within the 12 10 percentdeviation. 13             But certainly in larger districts, like the 14 Texas State Senate plan, you could use the fiveyear 15 CVAP data, and you could do that to get within the 16 10 percent deviation.  Of course, we're not 17 constitutionally compelled to, because as the Court 18 recognized in Burns, that is up to the States in 19 choosing a legitimate population basis. 20             If I could briefly address the 21 United States's argument on Section 2 of the Voting 22 Rights Act.  We disagree on this point. 23             Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not 24 protect nonvoters.  And earlier when we discussed 25 Section 2, I'd like to return to that to cite to the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Court the Persily amicus brief of page 26, because I

39

2 think this cuts against the United States's theory on

3 Section 2.

4             Persily brief says, "If the minority group

5 has very low rates of citizenship, then the

6 redistricting plan is not to blame for their lack of

7 representation.  Rather, their lack of sufficient voters

8 is."

9             So the United State's suggestion that there

10 could be packing or cracking claims of communities that

11 have nothing to do with packing or cracking voting

12 blocks, that is an incorrect interpretation of

13 Section 2.  It is not consonant with the tax, and it

14 would render Section 2 unconstitutional, as not

15 congruent and proportional with the right to vote that

16 is being protected.

17             If the Court has no further questions, thank

18 you, Mr. Chief Justice.

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.

23                         APPELLEES

24             MR. GERSHENGORN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

25 it please the Court:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             Redistricting on the basis of total

40

2 population, as Texas did here, vindicates the principle

3 of equal representation for equal numbers of people that

4 is at the heart of Reynolds and Wesberry.  We thus agree

5 that Texas was not required to redistrict on the basis

6 of some asyetundefined measure of voter population.

7             However, we disagree that the Court should

8 go on to decide that Texas is free in the future to

9 redistrict on the basis of some measure of population 

10 voter population if it so chooses.

11             There are, in our view, at least four

12 reasons why voter population cannot be required.

13             First is the one mentioned by Justice Kagan.

14 We think it would be a very odd interpretation to say

15 that the Constitution forbids for State legislative

16 redistricting what it requires for congressional

17 redistricting.

18             Second is the very long history of States 

19 of States redistricting on a basis other than  other

20 than voter population.  At the time of the framing of

21 the Fourteenth Amendment, there were the vast majority

22 of states redistricted on otherthanvoter population.

23 In the wake of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress in the

24 apportionment acts required districting on the basis of

25 inhabitants.  And, of course, over the last 50 years,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 States have unanimously redistricted on the basis of

41

2 total population, not voter population.

3             Third is the  is  are the data problems,

4 and they are real.  The ACS data has a number of

5 limitations.  First of all, it is not constitutionally

6 required, unlike the census.  It would be very odd, we

7 think, for the Court to demand, as a constitutional

8 standard, data that does not even have to be collected.

9             Second, it does not measure what the  what

10 the plaintiffs suggest is required.  It is not a measure

11 of voter eligibility.  CVAP does not include 

12 citizenvotingage population data, for example, does

13 not include felons.  It does not include overseas

14 voters.  It does not include the mentally ill.  That

15 kind of data just does not exist.

16             And third with respect to the data, picking

17 up on Justice Sotomayor's point, the data in the ACS

18 does not exist at the level of granularity, accuracy,

19 and timeliness needed to redistrict.  To be clear, the

20 data level does not exist at the census block level,

21 which is where districting happens.  It is not issued on

22 a timely basis.  The census data comes out, for example,

23 in April 2021.  The ACS data, the fiveyear average

24 comes out in December, and it has data from 2016 going

25 forward.

42 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's often used 2 for Section 2. 3             MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, it's used for 4 a very different purpose with respect to Section 2.  In 5 Section 2 it is used as one factor among many to 6 determine whether electoral opportunity has been  has 7 been given.  So it's used along with  with population 8 data, voting data, turnout data, a whole variety of 9 socioeconomic factors. 10             That's very different than this Court saying 11 every State and thousands of local jurisdictions 12 throughout the country have to use that data as the sole 13 measure for redistricting. 14             I'd like to then pick up on Justice 15 Kennedy's question. 16             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, can I ask you this? 17 Who has standing to bring a Reynolds v. Sims claim?  Is 18 it anybody who is counted in the census? 19             MR. GERSHENGORN:  So Your Honor, that's a 20 question this Court noted and reserved in Baker v. Carr 21 in footnote 23.  And it's a question that this Court has 22 never had to resolve in the context of Wesberry, which 23 of course has the exact same rule. 24             We think that nothing  not much turns on 25 it because, as a practical measure, you can get a voter.

43 1 You can always find a voter in the district.  But let me 2 explain why we don't think it, sort of, is dispositive 3 here, and this goes to a number of those issues  4             JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you going to tell me who 5 has  6             MR. GERSHENGORN:   we've heard this 7 morning. 8             JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you going to tell me who 9 has standing or not? 10             MR. GERSHENGORN:  Yes, Your Honor.  We think 11 that it is  we think that the  the better 12 understanding is that a nonvoter would have standing. 13 But I  here's why I don't think it matters:  Because 14 you can view our position as through either lens, 15 through a representational lens in which what's 16 happening is that the Reynolds v. Sims right is a way to 17 ensure that all persons covered by the Equal Protection 18 Clause who can't  even those who cannot cast a ballot 19 still have a voice in representational  20             JUSTICE ALITO:  That includes everybody who 21 is counted in the census. 22             MR. GERSHENGORN:  Yes, Your Honor. 23             JUSTICE ALITO:  It includes  24             MR. GERSHENGORN:  But let me say  25             JUSTICE ALITO:  It includes aliens.  It

2             MR. GERSHENGORN:  And let me 

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  It includes undocumented

4 aliens.

5             MR. GERSHENGORN:  But let me explain why I

6 don't think it's necessary.

7             JUSTICE ALITO:  But does it include all

8 those groups?

9             MR. GERSHENGORN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor?

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Does it include members of

11 all of those groups?

12             MR. GERSHENGORN:  So we think it might, but

13 we don't think that you have to agree with that to rule

14 in our way.  Because we do think that the right at

15 Reynolds is also viewed, as we said on page 14 of our

16 brief  and we think this is important  as a voter

17 right.  The way to think about this, as Reynolds did,

18 was to view this as a right  consistent with the way

19 Reynolds thought about it, was to say that, when you

20 have twice the representatives in  twice the  the

21 inhabitants in a district, you get half the vote.

22             What Reynolds said, picking up on

23 Plaintiff's counsel's position, was that of course it

24 would violate the Constitution to count somebody's vote

25 as two or five or ten times.  But then what it said in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the next sentence:  "Of course, the effect of State

45

2 legislative districting schemes which give the same

3 number of representatives to unequal number of

4 constituents is identical."  That is exactly the point

5 we're making here.

6             And if I could pick up, then, on

7 Justice Kennedy's and the Chief Justice's point about

8 why can't you do both.

9             The reason is very much  and we agree with

10 General Keller that the problem with doing both is that

11 it  it largely eliminates a State's flexibility to

12 deal with the traditional redistricting factors.  What

13 you are forced to do is take a large, for example, Anglo

14 population in one part of the State that has high

15 citizen rates and pair it with the situation where it

16 has  with  with populations that have low

17 citizenship rates in another part of the State.

18             Or to take an example from the amicus

19 briefs, Manhattan has 9 percent children.  Brooklyn has

20 30 percent.  If you have to do both, what you're doing

21 is pairing people from the  from part of Manhattan

22 and  and pairing them with part of  of voters in

23 Brooklyn.  What ends up happening is to do both at the

24 level of 10 percent is to eliminate a State's ability to

25 take into account things like political subdivisions, to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 take into account compactness, and all of the other

46

2 things that this Court has said is critical in

3 redistricting.

4             As to the Chief Justice's question about

5 whether this is a big deal or not, or whether it's 

6 "big deal" isn't the right word  whether it would have

7 a large practical effect  I would assume it's a big

8 deal.  That's why we're here.

9             (Laughter.)

10             MR. GERSHENGORN:   as to whether it would

11 have a large practical effect.  I think the answer to

12 that is yes.

13             What we're talking about is not just 50

14 States but thousands of jurisdictions around the

15 country, local jurisdictions, none of whom use voter

16 population as a measure for redistricting.

17             What the amicus briefs show is this is not

18 just a situation in which things are affected  States

19 are affected where there are citizenship differences

20 between citizens and noncitizens, but that children

21 actually are a critical part of it.  It's not just that

22 Manhattan is 9 percent and Brooklyn is 30 percent

23 children.  In Texas, the counties range, the amicus

24 briefs suggest, from 9 percent in some counties to 35

25 percent in other counties.  In Alaska the difference

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
47 1 between rural and urban is 20 percent children in some 2 and 30  37 percent in another. 3             This is an issue that is going to affect 4 States and local jurisdictions throughout the country. 5 And local jurisdictions, to be clear, don't have the 6 data at the level and  at the level in which this 7 Court would now be requiring as a constitutional matter. 8             Now, I'd like to pick up on one other point 9 that Plaintiff's counsel raised, which is that, in his 10 view, it's quite unclear as to what Wesberry actually 11 holds.  We think that that is really a fundamental 12 misreading of Wesberry. 13             What Wesberry said was  the whole point of 14 Wesberry was that the  the method of apportioning or 15 allocating representatives to the States had to be the 16 same as the method for allocating within districts in a 17 State.  That was the reason that  when what Wesberry 18 said was that the great compromise had to be reflected 19 into  into redistricting. 20             That principle in Wesberry was exactly the 21 principle that then the Court adopted in Reynolds, 22 what  what the Court said in Reynolds.  It was 23 Wesberry that clearly established the fundamental 24 principle of representative government in this country 25 as one of equal representation for equal numbers of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1 people, without regard to race, sex, economic status, or 2 place of residence within the State. 3             So it is precisely that same principle from 4 Wesberry which looked at the  looked at the  looked 5 at the framing and looked at the discussion of  of 6 calculation of representatives at the framing, which 7 looked at the drafting of the Fourteenth Amendment, and 8 took that history, and then translated that  9             JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't your argument that 10 voters are  are irrelevant? 11             MR. GERSHENGORN:  So Your Honor, I don't 12 think our argument is that voters are irrelevant.  And 13 first of all  so a couple of points on that. 14             First, of course, the question here is, when 15 Texas has chosen to use total population, is that 16 permissible?  And we think that clearly is. 17             Second, we don't think voters are irrelevant 18 for the reasons that I've said.  The  what Reynolds 19 did was  and the Reynolds line of cases was to use 20 total population to vindicate the voters' right.  It is 21 a voters' right  because Reynolds understood that, 22 when you have twice the inhabitants in the district, you 23 have half the  half the voice before your 24 representative. 25             JUSTICE ALITO:  What would you say about the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 extreme case  I mean, your time is going to going to 2 expire  an extreme case.  And maybe this would never 3 come up, but what if it did? 4             Suppose you have a district  you have a 5 rural district, and suppose it's a State where the  6 the total number of  the total population per district 7 is  is fairly small.  You have a rural district with a 8 huge prison and very few other inhabitants.  So you  9 and you have a neighboring district that has no prison. 10             So in one district, you have that 10 percent 11 of the population are eligible voters; and the other 12 district, 90 percent of the  the population are 13 eligible voters.  That would be okay? 14             MR. GERSHENGORN:  So Your Honor, two points 15 in response. 16             First, this Court has recognized  and we 17 don't dispute  that census data isn't the sole data. 18 A State can  and this Court approved it in Mahan  19 make adjustments to census data to more accurately 20 capture actual residents in the State.  We think that's 21 what has been happening in Hawaii, and that's what Mahan 22 said. 23             Remember in Mahan, what the State had 24 done  what Virginia had done was count all of the Navy 25 personnel as home ported, which is what the census had

50 1 done.  And the Court said you have to make an adjustment 2 to that. 3             Thank you, Your Honor. 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 5             Mr. Consovoy, you have four minutes 6 remaining. 7         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S.

If that were the principle 12 of Reynolds against Sims, in a statewide election, a 13 State could give five votes to a family of five and one 14 vote to an individual. 15             That would  16             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm just thinking that I'd 17 like to know, before knowing whether this is mandatory 18 or not, your position.

There 4 are children involved, of course. 5             But  but our point is more fundamental. 6 If  7             JUSTICE BREYER:  Illegal immigrants. 8             MR. CONSOVOY:  Some.  But who have not  9 who the State has chosen not to allow to vote.  The 10 State can solve this problem themselves.  These States 11 can enfranchise these people and give them the vote. 12 The States come here to say we do not want them to vote, 13 but we want them to count for districting.  That should 14 be rejected by this Court. 15             Second  16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not quite 17 accurate.  For  for most States, too many, they 18 disenfranchise prisoners, except for those who come from 19 that locale, which is quite rational.  Most States 20 disenfranchise the mentally ill.  So how are they  who 21 else are they going to disenfranchise? 22             MR. CONSOVOY:  I'm not suggesting  we're 23 not suggesting we should choose for the State who they 24 allow to vote.  We are  we are arguing that we should 25 not allow the States to come to this Court and argue
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1 that they should get the benefit of them counting when 2 they make the choice, that is their right, to 3 disenfranchise them. 4             You cannot disconnect this rule from voting 5 and allow it to stand up.  The whole thing collapses. 6 Wesberry has the famous sentence now that says all other 7 rights are illusory if the right to vote is taken away. 8             That's  the authors of that sentence would 9 be surprised to learn that the oneperson, onevote rule 10 has literally nothing to do with voting; that you could 11 have a system that crowds, in 31 Senate districts, all 12 eligible voters but 30  30 of them into one, and give 13 each other person their own district.  That plan would 14 be sustainable, absent some evidence of racial or 15 political discrimination. 16             The State comes in to say we know we can't 17 do it, but we'll never try.  That's not how oneperson, 18 onevote works.  The StatebyState law forced 19 themselves not to try this by saying they weren't 20 allowed to.  If they were told by this Court that they 21 could at least  to your point, Justice Kennedy  do 22 both, they would go back to the drawing board and try. 23 If they failed, they may win that case.  We suspect, and 24 we have alleged, so it must be taken as true, that they 25 can do both.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             And Justice Kennedy, it will not be

53

2 traditional interest like districting, or county lines,

3 or anything like that will be  that will inhibit them.

4 It is political and racial gerrymandering that they want

5 to do, and that our rule, and especially a rule

6 balancing both, will stop them.  And we don't know that

7 abstractly; we know that from the case the Court heard

8 just before us.

9             The actual deviations in Arizona  the

10 hypothetical case  they are claiming it's an 8 percent

11 deviation.  On page 26 of their own jurisdictional

12 statement, they concede that the CVAP deviations are

13 54 percent.  And in District 8, the district mostly at

14 issue, is underpopulated by 22 percent.

15             If Arizona had to go back to the drawing

16 board with the Districting Commission and accommodate at

17 least voter, but at least  or maybe both, there would

18 be no opportunity to engage in the political and racial

19 gerrymandering that has come to dominate the

20 redistricting process.  That would not involve the Court

21 in those issues anymore.  It would be solved

22 legislatively, as they should.

23             Section 2 does not work without this

24 understanding.  As Justice Scalia pointed out in his

25 dissent in Chisom v. Roemer, there is nothing to measure

 5 against?  The baseline is equal voting power of voters
 6 absent discrimination.  It completely unravels.
