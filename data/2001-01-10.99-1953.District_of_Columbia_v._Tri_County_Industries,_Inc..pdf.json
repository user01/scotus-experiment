    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, it is, and our position is, can any rational judge have made that decision. Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper, when a trial court in ruling on a motion to set aside a trial, to order a new trial, he has a fresh perspective on the evidence, he has just seen it go in, he has also got a fresh perspective on the effect, the impact of the evidence on the jury --"

    "speaker": "REISCHEL",
    "speech": "Well, the -- there is one minor difference, and that is, the court has to look to whether the trial court applied the proper standard.  That is, when he sets side a verdict that's contrary to the weight of the evidence, the question is, can a rational judge have made that decision?  That is, was it clearly contrary to the weight of the evidence."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Sometimes the evidence would be evidence that juries have particular ability to evaluate, or at least the power is given to them saying witness demeanor.  There could be other cases in which the matter is not particularly one that's suited to a jury. I mean, it turns -- he gives a new trial because of something to do with a document and its admissibility or something like that.  Would you at least say that where it's a matter that the juries are entrusted with the has a much better take on both the force of the evidence and the impact on the jury."

    "speech": "No, if that's true, would you be satisfied with that result?  Suppose this Court said, well, in a sense it's the same standard, but what searching inquiry means is, it means, after all, here you are upholding the jury, not going against the jury, and if you were going against the jury there are many reasons why you should be very careful.  Does that satisfy you?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REISCHEL",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that's queer -- that's a queer description of credibility.  I mean, on that basis any facts that don't make sense are incredible.  Yes, I suppose that's right, but I wouldn't consider that a credibility determination.  I'd consider that a determination of whether there was substantial evidence on the record. If there's something on the record that is utterly incoherent and makes no sense, that's not evidence.  It's not adequate evidence, and a court of appeals can evaluate that. that this turns -- this power relates only to the credibility of witnesses.  I thought the judges exercised their determination to turn over a jury verdict based on maybe a whole range of things that occur at trial, including a judge might feel, I gave instructions that would pass muster with the court of appeals, so they're reversal-proof, but the jury didn't understand a damn word I was saying. Or a judge might say, I excluded certain evidence that was favorable to the defendant.  That, too, could survive appellate review, but on thinking it over I should have admitted the evidence and, either way, the court of appeals wouldn't touch me. Those kinds of considerations don't go to credibility of witnesses."

But --"

    "speech": "Those things -- my point maybe wasn't clear.  I'm not saying that eyeball credibility is the only thing that the district judge can take into account. Of course he can take into account these other things, but these other things are evaluable by the court of appeals just as readily as they're evaluable by the trial judge. A court of appeals can say, well, this stuff was excluded. It could have been let in, and if it had been let in, then it would be different. earnings was Dr. Morris, Dr. Morris who came on as a Ph.D. and said, I've read a ton of things and I'm an expert in this field, and I can do all these mathematical things, but when he was cross-examined said, yes, but I based all of my industry stuff on -- all my prices on the Apex report by DiRenzo, and what DiRenzo's report said was that prices were being driven down so that they barely covered costs."

    "speech": "Okay.  Well, if it is abuse of discretion there is still room within that standard, I suppose, to say that a jury fact-finder determination on credibility of witnesses is not to be disturbed by the trial judge, and if the trial judge does, it's an abuse of discretion."

The judge took the position that a million dollars of damages, which would have been a 5- percent return on investment, was about right because there was a -- well, I assume because there was a differential for transportation costs, but to project 49- percent return each of 7 years in a declining industry where the last person failed is not a reasonable projection, and the judge said, this is pro forma.  It has nothing to do with reality. He said, at page JA-79, how do you explain this in light of the fact that prices are being driven down to costs?  How do you explain, he said in his decision --"

It didn't have anything to do with the perspective that the court of appeals was to take vis-a-vis the trial court judge, and it didn't say anything about the difference between, if there is any between grant or denial, so I did not understand Gasperini to address this question."

If a reasonable judge couldn't have, then there's room to disagree."

Here, I take it it's the former, because the judge said, remittitur, or if you won't take the jury awarded, much less the 124 percent per year gain that the financial expert projected. But the court did say several different things. Two rulings, the rulings on mitigation, which was a ruling that if, as Tri County testified, that they thought they were going to be $2 million a year in profits -- $2 million a year in profits from this new entity that they were going to set up -- is it reasonable for them to do absolutely nothing? They didn't respond to a letter inquiry about what their position was.  They didn't pay a $50 fine, which said on its face if you don't pay this your license is going to be suspended.  They didn't show up at a hearing, and they said --"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Reischel, you're still arguing the merits of this particular ruling and what the court of wrote one sentence that I thought was a throw-away line, frankly, where it said that there's a more searching inquiry when the judge grants a new trial motion than where he denies it. Then I thought to myself naively, where he grants a motion, the court of appeals has to see if he invaded, say, the credibility province of the jury, and where he denies it they don't have to do that job, so obviously it has to be more searching, and that stopped right there. All right, now, what's the response to that naive argument?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REISCHEL",
    "speech": "The response to that naive argument is, the D.C. Circuit's standard boils down to, if there's sufficient evidence to go to the jury, that's the end of the inquiry."

  {
    "speaker": "REISCHEL",
    "speech": "The standard as the D.C. Circuit has explicated it, particularly in the Taylor case, which respondent cites at page 26 of its brief, explains what the D.C. Circuit understands, and it says that when a trial court sets aside a jury verdict, the appellate court's normal allegiance to the trial court falls away, and its allegiance is to the jury, and that drives them to the point, which they did in this case, of saying, if there's enough evidence to go to the jury, that's the end of the inquiry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right.  May I put my question in a different way?  I think it's the same question that Justice Breyer has been asking.  Here are two ways of looking at the problem, and after I've stated the two ways I'm going to ask you whether there is anything other than a verbal difference between them. verdict -- I'm sorry, to an appellate -- to a trial court decision that grants a new trial, that vacates the verdict, we have to look very carefully at the facts and the record for the simple reason that we do have great respect for the jury verdict. In each case, we're applying the same standard, abuse of discretion, but in the two cases we have to look to different kinds, or at least to different degrees of factual data.  That's one way of looking at it. Another way of looking at it is to say, when a trial court in effect denies a new trial, we say, well, abuse of discretion.  That's all we look at.  But when a trial court grants the new trial we engage in reviewing it in a more searching inquiry because, in fact, we have great respect for the jury verdict. Is there any difference, except a verbal something beyond a verbal difference in the way they are applying it?"

    "speaker": "REISCHEL",

If the standard is not, was there sufficient evidence to go to the jury, which I assume is the same as saying, could a reasonable jury, on the basis of this evidence, have found for the plaintiff, if that is not the test that the appellate court is supposed to use in deciding whether it was wrongful for the trial court to set aside the jury verdict, then what is the test?

They said on three occasions they reviewed for abuse of discretion, nothing more, and if they intended more searching inquiry to mean stricter abuse of discretion, they would have said it, but they never -- the very least, a more close look at the evidence, but --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay.  Let's take a more close look, rather than more searching inquiry.  Both a pretty much the same thing, and it means a greater willingness to reverse in the case of grant of a new trial than denial of a new trial."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "No, I disagree with that.  I think you're making a jump in terms of an outcome that is suggested by that standard that is not accurate. I  think it just -- it says we're going to look at it.  We're not favoring the plaintiff.  We're not looking at favoring the defendant.  We're just going to look at what happened more closely."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you don't have to favor a plaintiff or a defendant in that sort of an equation.  You favor the person who got the jury verdict."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "Or a defendant.  I mean, it's not always the plaintiff."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, okay, whichever.  In the case of a remittitur it's always going to be the plaintiff, but --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but it's still true that even though it's more searching than the converse, it still has to be an abuse of discretion, and an abuse of discretion standard itself tends to protect the trial judge from reversal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "An abuse of discretion is a deferential standard, I would agree, but at the same time --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Do you support the court of appeals decision or do you not?  I can't tell from what you say."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "Oh, I do, Your Honor."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "They got it right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And they said they applied a more searching inquiry, was that right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "Yes, that's correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So they did do that, and that's okay?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "That's okay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "But my other point, too is, just looking under, if this verbal formulation was omitted from the opinion it would still be the correct result.  It was still an abuse of discretion by the trial court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But if the court of appeals had not applied that standard, maybe it would not have been in your view the correct result.  Maybe they would have affirmed the trial court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "Well, I think -- discretion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Then we shouldn't dismiss the writ as improvidently granted."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You'd be happy with that, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Nothing turns on it.  But there is one feature of this, we go back for the Seventh Amendment to how things were at common law, and at common law, as I understand it, the appellate bench had no role at all in any of this, that it was the trial court, it could be the poll court at Westminster, but here it's kind of an irony that the appellate court that shouldn't have been in it at all is exercising muscle vis-a-vis the trial court that at common law had the only word on whether there be a new trial."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "Well, I don't think that this is allowed if the judge makes an error to have that decision set aside and a new trial, or the original jury verdict reinstated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But the discretion on setting aside a verdict as against the weight of the evidence was entirely, as I understand it, in the hands of the trial bench.  Just, not any errors of law made, no errors in the charge, no errors, no reversible errors in the admission of evidence, but against the weight of the evidence was trial court business and not appellate business."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "Well, I guess that depends on whether the en banc court was looked on as operating in an appellate capacity in reviewing the facts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, Mr. Emig, you didn't give us any assistance by discussing that common law in your brief, but I have scratched around and I think there was I'm -- you know, I'm -- now, where does that leave me?  If I thought we were wrong in Gasperini, and there were several on this who joined me, in allowing appellate review at all -- we allowed appellate review there on the basis of abuse of discretion.  I guess to be consistent we should have an even stricter standard when there's review in the situation where the jury verdict is ignored, so I guess there should be something beyond abuse of discretion, or should -- I don't know."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "Well, I -- my position in this, Your Honor, is that it was not set aside, the jury verdict, because it was against the great weight of the evidence, that there was no evidence in this case of damages."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You want to reargue your case.  Now, why did you take it as an assumption that if you lose on this issue it's going to go right back to the D.C. very well your uncertainties, because what it says is, there are all kinds of verbal formulations all over the place, and you say the D.C. Circuit has adjusted to this over 30 years, and I expect other circuits have adjusted over similar periods of time to different verbal formulations, and if we start fooling around with those in this case, there is no matter so close to the heart of the trial bar, and suddenly we will discover different circuits doing different things in light of what we say. So if we say you're right on these words, searching inquiry, some other circuit is going to take that as a signal that they're wrong and, therefore, if we allow the D.C. Circuit to do what it did for 30 years, some other circuit will be unable to do what it has done for 30 years, so what do we do?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "I think the one thing that can be position is, it's entirely unclear in terms of what they meant and how it was applied."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But I thought one of your arguments in answer to the petitioner was, petitioner, you knew all along that the D.C. Circuit is applying a stricter standard when it's reviewing grants than when it reviews denial.  You knew it, and you didn't tell the D.C. Circuit when you were before that court, so it's too late.  If you knew that they were going to apply a stricter standard to grants than denials, you should have told them, D.C. Circuit, don't do what you're doing for 30 years.  You didn't tell them that, so you effectively forfeited the point. You made that argument in your brief to us."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "EMIG",
    "speech": "I did."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So you must think that this was a when the decision comes, and there's this verbal formulation of a more searching inquiry. But the fact of the matter is, the D.C. Circuit only says, abuse of discretion, and I think that under those circumstances that was the correct standard to apply, and that they were certainly entitled to review the record more carefully because a jury verdict had been set aside."
