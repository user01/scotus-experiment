  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is a repeat of Quality King v. L'anza with only one pertinent difference. Both cases involve goods not authorized for importation into the United States. Both cases involve arguments that the first sale doctrine must be narrowly construed, thus the Copyright Act's importation ban, section 602(a), be given less than its supposedly intended scope. The only difference is place of manufacture of the goods. Quality King involved U.S. manufactured goods; this case involves goods made in Switzerland. From 1790 to 1891, foreigners were categorically ineligible to hold U.S. copyrights. From 1891 to 1986, the United States discriminated against foreign manufacturing of copyrighted goods through a series of so-called manufacturing clauses, including section 601 of the 1976 Act. If Congress intended to make the first sale doctrine discriminate in favor of foreign manufacturing at the same time, one would expect some note to be taken of that fact in the legislative history, but none is. And yet the Ninth Circuit held that Congress in 1976 altered the long-established first sale doctrine to make it uniquely favorable to foreign manufacturing of copyrighted goods and did so through the obscure phrase, \"lawfully made under this title,\" in section 109. No one in all the briefs in this case has identified a single reason why Congress would have wanted to do so. Moreover, the words \"lawfully made under this title\" are used elsewhere in the Copyright Act, and they never mean what the Ninth Circuit said works teachers may show students in their classroom without fear of copyright liability, Congress referred to works lawfully made under this title. Our briefs have pointed out the absurdity of construing the phrase in section 110 to mean made in the United States, and it's very revealing how Respondent and its amici have tried to answer that point. Omega says \"lawfully made under this title\" means either made in the United States or authorized for distribution in the United States. That argument gives up any pretense -­"

    "speech": "We don't draw a line between those two, Your Honor. The line is -- depends on whether the copyright owner has given exclusive foreign rights to someone else. And the reason the exclusivity of the foreign rights matters is because that is the example given in the legislative history of 602 and in the paragraph in Quality King. the purposes of anything. Drawing a line between the exclusive grant of rights, whether by license or assignment to a foreign manufacturer -- or a foreign distributor, rather, and not granting such exclusive rights is perfectly consistent with the rationale -­"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "You are talking about the first sale doctrine. The perfectly consistent rationale would be whether there is a first sale. So -- so 109, though it doesn't say it, but if you look at the history and title, there has to be a transfer. So in fact, if a British publisher with a British right given by an American author or publisher makes this, 109 doesn't apply -- I mean, 109 doesn't apply until there's a sale. Now, that makes -- you -- you haven't adopted that. Nobody -- I guess maybe one of the amicus briefs does, but I don't see why that isn't perfectly sensible and I find no authority against it."

  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, since that's them, if not millions. What I don't see is why you don't just say: The first sale doctrine has always meant there was a transfer or sale. It meant that in 1792, when I took Phil Arita's antitrust course, and he used to bring it up. You go back to the 18th century. It's always meant there has to be a sale or transfer. So why don't we just read 109 that way, and there you give meaning to everything, and there is just no problem? Now, I raise that not because -- I raise it because since there's only a few people really supporting this, there must be some problem with what I say. So what is it?"

What it says is in a situation in which rights have been divided and exclusive territorial rights have been given in two different countries, or to put it in copyright language, in the language you also used in the legislative history, when the copyright owner has divided its rights because an innovation of the '76 act, the Copyright Act, the copyrights became divisible."

    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Englert, also talk about what, if anything, 602(a)(1) does, then. It seems 602(a)(2) is dealing with infringing goods, with pirated goods. So given the first sale doctrine as you construe it, what does 602(a)(1) protect?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "602(a)(1) is limited to imports and doesn't confer a private right of action. 602(a)(2), which was enacted after the Ninth Circuit ruled in this case, adds a private right of action and Court is construing is five words, \"lawfully made under this title.\" And those five words are used several places in the Copyright Act, including section 110, \"for educational use.\" The government says \"lawfully made under this title\" can mean two different things in section 109 and section 110, provisions of the same chapter of the Copyright Act enacted contemporaneously. As a fallback position, the government says there is nothing wrong with having copyright liability for teachers who show foreign-made films in the classroom as long as they know they weren't made in the United States. So, for example, showing an Ingmar Bergman film, The Seventh Seal, in class would be copyright infringement according to the government. Even the people who make movies don't agree with that argument. The Motion Picture Association of America has filed an amicus brief in this case, and on page 19 of its brief, the MPAA says that the result the government says is A-OK is, quote, \"a nonsensical and unintended consequence.\" The MPAA goes on to say there remains a powerful argument that Congress didn't use the phrase to mean \"made in the United States.\" There is nothing extraterritorial about construing \"lawfully made in this title\" as a choice of law clause, which means: Lawfully made according to standards of the U.S. Copyright Act anywhere in the world. In that respect, this case is no different from Quality King, in which the court rejected an extraterritoriality argument in a two-sentence footnote."

    "speaker": "SCALIA",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "Okay, sir. Yes, that is the phrase Congress used to express a certain disfavored class of goods, goods that would have been infringing if this title would have been applicable. 110 -- 109, excuse me, and 110 are a different purpose. They are the purpose of favoring goods, goods that have been lawfully made under this title. So, yes, Congress could have chosen to use a variation of the phrase \"if this title had been applicable\" under 109, but it didn't. And we are left with the language Congress enacted, but it is language that Congress uses at least four different places in the Copyright Act, and we have a pretty good idea that it doesn't mean \"made in the United States\" and it doesn't mean what Omega says it means, which is \"made in the United States or authorized at any time for distribution in the United States.\""

But what does Court had to address that question for the first time in Quality King, and the Court rejected the argument that 109 is inapplicable to imported goods altogether. The Court did say in a dictum which has been discussed already this morning that if a British and an American publisher divide rights, then section 602(a) does have a role to play. But the Court did not say books manufactured in Britain are not subject to the first sale doctrine."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "Correct, and the concurring opinion cited two distinguished copyright treatises that suggested there was some concern about extraterritoriality in this case. Well, even the government has conceded there is no concern about extraterritoriality in this case, so the rationale of those treatises, learned though they are, is undermined. If one looks more closely at those treatises argue that this Court's dictum in Quality King drew a distinction based on place of manufacture, but it's only the concurring opinion, not the dictum in the court's opinion that mentions place of manufacture. So it's a vert thin reed to say that the case turned on place of manufacture. And again, one can find nothing in the Quality King dictum, nothing in the legislative history of 602, nothing in the legislative history of 109 that talks about place of manufacture."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",

And those are the statements that the Court said in dicta presumably reflected congressional intent, and so I am relying on those statements for the limitation of section 109 to accommodate section 602. But again, if the Court disagrees with me and wants to give less of a role to 602 and more of a role to section 109, that is, of course, further assistance to my position. I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal."

That is, the making of the copies was not subject to or governed by U.S. copyright law. The decision of the court of appeals should not be affirmed for three basic reasons, and the first depends on the plain language of section 109(a), which applies only to copies that were lawfully made under this title."

It also includes the addition of any necessary intellectual property rights that would permit distribution in the United States.

Section 202 of the Act draws a -- a distinction between the material object and the intellectual property rights that are involved in the copyright. And it makes sense. The word \"made\" is not -- does not correspond to the word \"reproduced\" in section 106(1). It's a broader term that can also refer to the addition of these necessary intellectual property rights. And the -- what is, I think, important is the decision whether the copy was lawfully made under this title will, of course, be made at the time of the sale. It is not -- the decision doesn't need to be made at the time of -- of manufacture, because the question is: How should section 109(a) or another provision apply to that particular copy?"

Section 602(a)(1) is designed to permit a U.S. copyright owner to exclude legitimate copies, and if you ask where Congress said that, it's right in the House Committee report, in the legislative history."

The more significant point is that section 602(a)(1) is designed to permit a U.S. copyright owner -- as Costco admits, it's designed to permit a U.S. copyright owner to exclude legitimate copies that are made overseas. If the only issue were one of contract, there would be no need for section 602(a)(1) because there would be no need to create a copyright remedy where contractual remedies are sufficient; that is, in circumstances where there is privity between the U.S. copyright owner or the U.S. copyright owner's direct party and the foreign copyright owner."

    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "That's why I started with the first sale doctrine, because if you apply the first sale doctrine as it traditionally has been applied and if you believe that 109 incorporates that, there is loads of room for 602(a)(1) to act. That's all the instances where the British publisher published -- makes the book. What they do is they have a license and they try to send it to the United States and they can't"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PANNER",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, section 602(a)(1) refers specifically to copies that have been acquired outside of the United States. So it does not make sense to say that it's limited to the publisher, because the publisher hasn't acquired the copies. It has produced the copies."

  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "That's all right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PANNER",
    "speech": "So I think that the difficulty with Costco's reading, by contrast -- and I think that some of the Court's questions brought that out this morning -- is that either they -- Costco's reading tends to eliminate any practical effect for section 602(a)(1) by making it not apply to legitimate copies or it makes substantive rights turn on formalities of title, which is quite inconsistent with the structure of the Copyright Act, which actually goes out of its way to make clear that the nature of the rights that are held by the copyright owner, which is defined to mean the owner of any of the many rights that comprise the copyright, are the same regardless of whether there's been a transfer. And so when Costco says, for example, that Omega would have the right to exclude foreign-made copies that were produced by a transferee, but cannot do so if it manufactures the copy abroad itself, it really draws a distinction that has absolutely no basis in the text of the Copyright Act and that would make substantive rights, the value of the rights under 602(a)(1) and 106(3), turn on formalities and, again, transfers that really should make no difference in terms of the substantive rights that are available to the copyright owner."

Our position is that \"lawfully made under this title\" would include a copy that was manufactured in the United States, but that it is not so limited, and that if you look at section 1(e) of our brief, we discuss the  traditional understanding that section 109(a) is intended to reflect an exhaustion principle. So where a U.S. copyright owner has exhausted rights with respect to a particular copy by having been compensated for a right that has been invested into that copy, that can be included in the making."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",

It has no right to exclude the making of a copy, whatever you want to say the making means, in Switzerland.

That copy carries with it a license to be distributed in the United States, which would include then the right for a lawful owner to resell it. Again, that's consistent with the language of \"made\" and it gives proper effect both to section 602(a)(1), which is clearly intended to allow the owner of the U.S. distribution right to exclude legitimate copies that were made overseas, and it also sensibly construes section 109(a) to give affect to the exhaustion principle that underlies it. Which is where a U.S. copyright owner has exercised his U.S. distribution rights with regard to a particular copy."

    "speaker": "PANNER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, it doesn't create any sort of a preference, as Mr. Englert -- Mr. Englert suggests that this is somehow -- prefers the -- the -­ the copies that are made abroad. But in the same breath, he suggests that this will actually promote the sale of U.S. -- U.S.-manufactured goods because foreign-manufactured goods may therefore be of suspect legitimacy for purposes of resale in the United States. But the key point is that in Quality King this Court looked at the language of section 109(a), and it says -- and -- and -- and it emphasized that to determine the scope of the first sale doctrine that text is what matters. And it says section 109(a) applies to goods that are lawfully made under this title. There was no dispute that goods that are reproduced in the United States are lawfully made under this title, because one must have a U.S. -- the U.S. right in order to lawfully make a copy in the United States. the -- the tracing of the language is -- is helpful, actually, to understand how section -- the current section 60 -- excuse me current section 109(a) differs from section 27, which is, in section 27, what happened was is that Congress codified in 1909 the idea that the material object is different from the copyright. And when it did that, it added that language as a tag-on to that principle to ensure that it did not end up overruling legislatively Bobbs-Merrill. And when the -- when the Congress recodified the provision in 1976, it actually took section 202, put it separately, and it -- it codified 109(a) in a way that is significantly different and then it says notwithstanding the rights under 106(3) the owner of a copy lawfully made under this title is entitled to resell it. And that needs to then be read in harmony with section 602(a)(1), which after all, was part of the same act in 1976, it must be read in such a way as to give section rule 602(a)(1) sufficient room to perform"

    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If the government's interpretation of section 109(a) is a little bit different from either of the parties, since I want to make clear precisely what it is, in our view, the words \"lawfully made under this title\" mean made subject to and in accordance with Title 17. And because the Copyright Act doesn't apply abroad, in order for a copy to be made subject to Title 17, it would have to be created in the United States. Now, I think our interpretation of the statute still gives it a slightly different meaning from the alternative \"lawfully made in the United States,\" because at least in theory, it would be possible for the lawfully made under this title, because it would be made subject to and in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Copyright Act. Now, with respect to the types of copyright materials at issue here, the watches are clearly very different from what Congress had in mind when it enacted section 602(a)(1). But in other respects, what Omega was trying to do in this case was exactly what Congress intended to allow when it expanded the importation provisions beyond restrictions on importation of radical copies. The ideal was to allow a copyright owner to segment markets either to give -- either retain for itself or to give to another entity exclusive rights within the United States, but give other rights abroad to other producers. And consequently, we argued in Quality King and we are arguing here that the Court should construe section 109(a) in a way that doesn't prevent section 602(a) from performing that function. And the Court in Quality King grappled with Court specially said it wouldn't apply to copies that were made -- lawfully made under the law of the foreign country. Now, the Court didn't refer specifically to the place of manufacture. In giving the example of the British publisher who would be creating copies under the law of Great Britain, it didn't specifically say that's because British law would apply when the copies are made in England. But I think that's the necessary inference, because the Court's analysis made quite clear that it viewed a particular copy as being lawfully made under the law of one and only one question -­"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, what is your answer to the argument that if \"lawfully made under this title\" means basically made in the United States, that provides a great incentive to manufacture goods abroad and that can't possibly be what Congress intended?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "Well, I think there are -- I think we would say a couple of things. The question has been raised whether this gives favored status to a this makes foreign manufactured goods disfavored because they were harder to get into the country than would be the case if they had been manufactured within the United States and had then been sent abroad and -- and reimported. I guess the best we can say about the treatment from the copyright owners' prospective, the differential treatment of foreign and domestic manufactured goods is that at least with respect to goods that were made within the United States, the copyright owner has exercised rights under United States law. He has -- it has exercised its exclusive right to produce the copies in the first instance, whereas the manufacturer in Omega's position by creating and then selling the watches abroad, never exercised any of its Title 17 rights. And the theory underlying the first sale doctrine tracing it back to -- to Bobbs-Merrill, the first articulation by this Court of the -- the doctrine of the copyright context, the theory is that a copyright Omega with respect to the watches at issue here, never exercised any its rights under title 17, not -- not when the watches were made and not when they were sold. I do also want to address the question of what happens in the circumstance where Omega manufactures watches abroad, but then voluntarily imports them into the United States, sells them here; can it place restrictions on resale because I think it's an important policy question and here again we get to the same point in the end as the Respondents do, but we have a somewhat different textual route to get there. Our view is that in that circumstance section 109(a) still would not apply, because even though the goods were imported into the United States, they were made abroad, and that's what counts for determining whether they were lawfully made under this title. But section 109(a) is simply a safe harbor. It doesn't prohibit anything. Section 109(a) says if your conduct falls within these contours then what you are conduct is unlawful. The consequence is that you look to other provisions of title 17 to see whether it is lawful or not."

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, in your example, if there is a lawful importation of the foreign-made good, then if you interpret \"made\" as causing to exist of appear or under these laws, as the library brief suggests, the first sale doctrine would operate."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "I think we would still be looking to other provisions of the Copyright Act rather resell them, would that be an infringement of Omega 17's rights? And the only claim that Omega could -- I mean that -- Omega could plausibly make in that circumstance would be to say, that is a violation of my exclusive right to distribute copies to the public protected by section 106(3). And I think the response would be under Bobbs-Merrill, the Court already held that once the copyright owner exercised its exclusive right to vend -­ the word which appeared at the statute at the time -­ once it had exercised its exclusive right to vend the copies, it was done with them and had no more rights to assert. And there is no reason to give the right to vend -- the right to distribute under the current law a broader reading than the right to vend had at that time, simply because Congress has enacted section 109. And -- so I think that the -- it would still be the case that in order to prevail in a copyright suit, Omega would have to show that not only that in the end, its words: \"This is exclusively a question of statutory interpretation.\" It -- it based its holding on the language of the Copyright Act as it existed at that time, specifically the exclusive right to vend; and the exclusive right to distribute copies to the public is no different for these purposes under the current statute."

    "speaker": "BREYER",

And they trace this back to Professor Nimmer's 1965 letter, and they say that the point there was that they were reading Bobbs-Merrill as it was a pre-emption question, that they thought that the copyright law was not pre-empting State law of contract, and State law of contract had the exception in it which applied the first sale doctrine. Now if that's the reasoning, that reasoning would seem to me to apply. We could look up what the State law is, but my guess is that the first sale doctrine applies just as much to goods that come from abroad as to goods that are here at home."

  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",

I think the language was chosen in part at least to make clear that although Omega under in that hypothetical circumstance would have no remedy under the Copyright Act, it might potentially have a breach of contract suit against the retailer if the retailer had breached the agreement with Omega, and that nothing was -- in the Federal law was intended to preempt the State law contractual remedies that would otherwise be available.

    "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. Justice Ginsberg asked Mr. Panner what policy Congress could have had in mind to give this different status to foreign-made goods than to U.S. made goods, and Mr. Panner's answer, and Mr. Stewart said something similar, was that in one respect Congress is disfavoring foreign goods under their interpretation by making them harder to import. That's not true. Under both of their theories, as long as the the goods. In the briefs in this case you will not find anyone making any policy argument as to what Congress could have had in mind to favor foreign-manufactured goods. The heart of Mr. Panner's argument was that Costco's position either eliminates any significant role for section 602(a)(1) or makes section 602(a)(1) turn on formalities of transfer of title. Neither of those propositions is true. This Court in Quality King addressed the role that section 602(a)(1) has to play if section 109 is applicable to imported goods, and the answer was it still applies to nonowners. That was the Court's first answer. The dictum that has been much discussed this morning was another answer but the Court's first answer was that it still applies to nonowners, and because, for example, software is licensed there is a very live issue about whether the first sale doctrine applies to lawfully acquired copies of -- of software. So Quality King make 602(a)(1) turn on formalities of transfer of title. Our position can perhaps be criticized and has been criticized this morning not for having a textual basis, but it cannot be criticized for making anything turn on formalities. Our position turns on the economic realities of the situation. If the copyright owner gets its one reward, the first sale doctrine applies; if the copyright owner doesn't get its run reward, because for example it has given the exclusive foreign manufacturing rights to someone else, and retained or assigned or licensed the exclusive U.S. manufacturing rights, then 602(a)(1) has a role to play. So neither of Mr. Panner's criticisms of our position is correct. Mr. Panner asserted that section 109(a) differs from section 27, the predecessor statute in the 1947 Act, which in turn was Section 41 of the 1909 Act. This Court said the exact opposite in Quality King. It said there is no evidence of any attempt to narrow the first sale doctrine through the language restates and confirms the principle that where the copyright owner has transferred ownership of a particular copy or phonorecord of a work, the person to whom the copy or phonorecord is transferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale, rental or other means. No hint that using \"lawfully made\" under this title to narrow the doctrine. The last sentence of the relevant part of the House report: To come within the scope of section 109(a) a copy or phonorecord must have been lawfully made under this title though not necessarily with the copyright owner's authorization. For example, any resale of an illegally pirated phonorecord would be an infringement, but the disposition of a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory licensing provisions of section 115, would not. So what does the House report on section 109 tell us? It tells us that lawfully made under this title was intended to expand the category of covered works beyond just those made by the copyright owner, or U.S.-made goods. With respect to the policy incentives that it creates it's undeniable that it creates an incentive for outsourcing of manufacture. The government admitted that in its cert stage brief, and again, in its brief in this Court. Obviously if Congress wants to create an incentive for outsourcing, that's probably within its power as long as it can be said somehow to advance science and the useful arts; but there is simply not a shred of evidence in text or legislative history that Congress intended to encourage outsourcing; quite the contrary. The very controversial section 601, the adjacent section to section 602, required that nondramatic literary works in the English language be manufactured in the United States or Canada or else they would not be eligible for a U.S. copyright.
