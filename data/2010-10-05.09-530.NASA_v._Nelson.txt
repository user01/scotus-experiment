1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:05 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 09-530, National Aeronautics 5 and Space Administration v. Nelson. 6 Mr. Katyal. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL K. KATYAL 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 GENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, 10 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 Background checks are a standard way of 12 doing business. The Government has required them for 13 all civil service employees since 1953 and for 14 contractors since 2005. If the Ninth Circuit in this 15 case held that a constitutional right to informational 16 privacy precluded asking the questions it asked, that 17 was wrong for two basic reasons. 18 First, the background checks' mere 19 collection of information with accompanying safeguards 20 vitiates no constitutional privacy interest. These 21 checks have been going on for millions of employees for 22 dozens of years. They are part of the employment 23 process. They are manifestly not roving checks on 24 random individuals. And, second 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, is there any

1 limit to what questions the Government can ask -2 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, the -3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- an applicant? 4 GENERAL KATYAL: The -- the limits are -- in 5 this case, are the ones on SF-85 and Form 42. And we do 6 think that that's a fairly -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What does that mean? 8 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, those two -9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you ask somebody, 10 what's your genetic make-up, because we don't want 11 people with a gene that's predisposed to cancer, 12 whatever other -- could you ask that? 13 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think that the 14 Court doesn't need to confront that fairly -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We do, because I have to 16 start with the question of what are the limits on the 17 Government, if any? Are you taking the position that, 18 as an employer, there are absolutely none, or are you 19 taking the position that there are some, and what would 20 they be? 21 GENERAL KATYAL: Our position is, in a case 22 such as this, where there are collections on the 23 Government's dissemination of the information -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you are saying 25 is, there's no limit?

1 GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I think that this 2 Court in Whalen -- and there is no decision thus far 3 that has recognized any constitutional limit on the 4 Government's collection of information, so long as there 5 are accompanying safeguards on the disseminations and -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Katyal, why are 7 we getting into this? Because this case, it seems to 8 me, is a challenge -- your challenge to a preliminary 9 injunction which was quite narrow. There was only one 10 question at issue. There is no cross-appeal, is there? 11 GENERAL KATYAL: There -- there is no 12 cross-appeal. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we have Form 85. The 14 only thing that's in contention there is the question 15 about treatment or counseling. Nothing else. So why 16 are we talking about the universe of what questions 17 might be asked? 18 And on the other form, I take it, it's just 19 the so-called open-ended questions, not everything on 20 the form. 21 GENERAL KATYAL: I quite agree, Justice 22 Ginsburg. That's what I was trying to say to Justice 23 Sotomayor; that is, I think that this case doesn't force 24 the Court to answer questions it has never really 25 answered, which are the outer limits of what the
5

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Government can do in terms of the collection of 2 information. 3 Here you have a narrow decision by the Ninth 4 Circuit, one whose reasoning, I think, could radiate 5 very broadly and undermine Government -- the 6 Government's background checks generally. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what do you think has 8 been -- there hasn't been a formal injunction entered, a 9 preliminary -- a preliminary injunction, has there? 10 GENERAL KATYAL: It's only -- it's at the 11 preliminary injunction stage. 12 But our -- our point is that the reasoning 13 that the Ninth Circuit used, if adopted -- if adopted to 14 create a permanent injunction, could preclude the 15 Government from asking all sorts of questions in 16 background -- in background checks, not just the ones it 17 isolated here, but more general ones, because the Ninth 18 Circuit decision is essentially a how-to manual on how 19 to question, various individual questions, and 20 micromanage them and inject Federal courts into -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the -- the 22 entire Form 85 was approved, and there's no question you 23 could ask about, have you used drugs within the last 24 year? It's only the question about treatment and 25 counseling that's -- that is at issue, right?

1 GENERAL KATYAL: That's -- that's all that 2 the Ninth Circuit ruled on at the preliminary injunction 3 stage. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that -- does 5 that ruling stop you from asking that question right now 6 throughout the Ninth Circuit? 7 GENERAL KATYAL: Which question? The drug 8 treatment question? 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. The -10 yes. Yes, the counseling and treatment question. 11 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, there's a -- the 12 mandate has been stayed -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 14 GENERAL KATYAL: -- so we haven't been able 15 to -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if we sustained 17 -- if we sustain the preliminary injunction, the 18 Government can't ask that question throughout the -19 the -- the reach of the Ninth Circuit? 20 GENERAL KATYAL: That's exactly correct. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and if we did so, 22 it would be because there is an underlying privacy right 23 that's somewhat ill-defined or undefined? 24 GENERAL KATYAL: Exactly, Justice Kennedy. 25 And if this Court were to embrace that reasoning -- and
7

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this is my answer to you, Justice Ginsburg, as well -2 then it doesn't just reach drug treatment. I could 3 imagine other litigants doing it for other forms of 4 questions, whatever they may be. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the circuit 6 precedent, as far as the other questions on Form 85 -7 the circuit said that's okay. It's permissible to ask 8 those questions. 9 GENERAL KATYAL: Thus far, that's correct. 10 But I could imagine other litigants coming in, and maybe 11 not just with respect to these questions but questions 12 on SF-85P or Form 86, any number of other things. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Katyal, what is the 14 well-defined, the well-defined, constitutional right to 15 institutional -- to informational privacy that the 16 Government is -- is willing to acknowledge? You -- you 17 apparently don't -- don't challenge the existence of 18 such a constitutional right. 19 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, our 20 position is that the Court doesn't need to answer that 21 question. It's just like Whalen, because in Whalen this 22 Court assumed the existence of some sort of 23 constitutional right and then said: Is that right 24 violated here? 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a strange way to
8
 Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1 proceed. We normally don't do that, see? If there were 2 a constitutional right, would it cover this? 3 GENERAL KATYAL: I agree -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we do that in cases? I 5 don't think so. 6 GENERAL KATYAL: I agree that in many other 7 contexts, it might not be appropriate, but here I think 8 there are some good reasons why. This Court has had 9 special reticence to the rule broadly in the range of 10 privacy, and I think the reason is privacy is something 11 that is in flux in ways that other things aren't, both 12 in terms of our social understandings, technology, and 13 legislation itself. 14 And for that reason, I think this Court has 15 spoken narrowly whenever it's dealt with -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would justify not 17 defining it broadly or narrowly. It wouldn't justify 18 not reaching the question of whether there is any such 19 constitutional right at all. 20 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that's what 21 this Court has done throughout its history. And Whalen 22 was a unanimous decision, and Nixon, on that particular 23 question, I don't think there was a disagreement about. 24 So -25 JUSTICE ALITO: How can the Court determine
9
 Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that the right is not violated here without having some 2 idea about either the existence or the contours of the 3 right? 4 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think it would just 5 be like in Whalen itself. So in Whalen, the Court said 6 there might be some right to informational privacy, but 7 so long as there are safeguards on the disclosure, the 8 Government's dissemination of the information, that 9 means that there is no -10 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it -- is it your argument 11 that the Government can collect whatever information it 12 wants from private individuals so long as the 13 information is not publicly disseminated? 14 GENERAL KATYAL: No, that's not our 15 position. Our position here is that the Government can 16 collect information so long as it is not disseminated in 17 the employment context. And this case, unlike Whalen, 18 is one that has that added fact to it, that the 19 Government here is asking -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, does it -- does it 21 help us in finding what this residual background right 22 is and asking you: Why is it that you can't disclose 23 it? 24 GENERAL KATYAL: I'm sorry? 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't you disseminate
10

1 the information? 2 GENERAL KATYAL: Surely -- we are restricted 3 by statute, the privacy of -4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume no statute. 5 GENERAL KATYAL: If you assume -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, this is 7 just testing whether there is some background 8 constitutional right and how to define it, if we have to 9 use that as a beginning premise. 10 GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. If we took out 11 all of the safeguards that are at issue here, then the 12 case wouldn't be like Whalen or Nixon, in which you had 13 those -- in which you had safeguards in the 14 dissemination. And then you would have to confront the 15 question, which we think you shouldn't confront in this 16 case, for the reasons I said to Justice Scalia. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would be your 18 position if the -- all this information were disclosed? 19 Or that there was an attempt to disclose all the 20 information, and they asked you for your advice -21 GENERAL KATYAL: Right. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- on a constitutional 23 basis? 24 GENERAL KATYAL: Right. I mean, our 25 position is that the Court really shouldn't, for all of
11
 Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the reasons I said, get into it, but if the Court had to 2 get into it and ask is there some constitutional right 3 that would be violated, Justice Kennedy, by your 4 hypothetical, our answer would be no. 5 But we do think the way that this has been 6 traditionally been handled is legislation. Safeguards 7 for political processes -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when you say your 9 position would be no, you mean that there is no right of 10 any kind under -- I know you don't want us to reach it, 11 but you would say there is no right of any kind for a 12 citizen to tell the Government that that's none of your 13 business. The Government will decide that it can ask 14 anything of a citizen, so long as you don't disclose it. 15 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, in the 16 employment/proprietor context. Okay? So if the Court 17 had to confront that question, it would apply the matrix 18 that Justice Scalia has talked about, the Glucksberg 19 matrix, of whether a right -- the right is firmly rooted 20 in the traditions of the people, and -- and ask: Is the 21 Government's collection -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it's 23 firmly rooted in our traditions that there is some right 24 to tell the Government that's none of your business? 25 GENERAL KATYAL: I think there is some
12
 Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1 right. The question about whether it employs in the 2 unique employment/proprietor context is one the Court 3 hasn't confronted, and our strong -- our strong position 4 here is the Court shouldn't confront it. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the test -- what is 6 the test for determining what sort of questions can be 7 asked in the employment context? Is there any limit? 8 Suppose the -- suppose the Government says, 9 well, we want to know all about your diet; we want to 10 know whether you smoke cigarettes; we want to know 11 everything you read; we want to know what your hobbies 12 are, what forms of entertainment you enjoy, sexual 13 practices, every aspect of your private life, just 14 because that gives us a better picture of who you are as 15 an employee. Is that okay? 16 GENERAL KATYAL: Sure. No, there are 17 limits, and I should have said this earlier. If the 18 Government's collection of information or the disclosure 19 of the information burdens some other fundamental 20 constitutional right, that is certainly one limit. 21 So if the Government were collecting 22 information, Justice Alito, on sexual practices of its 23 employees, it may burden the exercise of other rights. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that's 25 putting those aside. I mean, what about some of the
13
 Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1 hypotheticals that Justice Alito posed? Your diet? 2 GENERAL KATYAL: Right. So -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's certainly 4 relevant in the employment context, right? They're 5 going to have to pay for your health care, worry you 6 might miss things, miss days of work. 7 So I guess the point is: Do you think the 8 Government's right to inquire in the employment context 9 is exactly as broad as a private employer's right? 10 GENERAL KATYAL: I do think that if the 11 private employer -- the private employers are a good 12 template. If the Government is simply mirroring what 13 private employers do, as Justice Scalia said in O'Connor 14 v. Ortega, that's a good suggestion that what it's doing 15 is reasonable. 16 Now, to the extent, Justice Alito, that they 17 are gradating far beyond what private employers do, in 18 terms of asking about eating habits and the like, I do 19 think that that may pose -- that there may be some 20 limits. The Court doesn't need to confront that here. 21 It simply needs to look at the Ninth Circuit's decision, 22 which recognize a broad, free-standing right against 23 informational collection of its employees to make sure 24 and -- and realize that that is a serious problem for 25 the way the Government does business.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: We do have a legislature, 2 don't we, that can place some limits on what the 3 Government asks employees or anybody else? 4 GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the same legislature 6 that prohibited the Government from disclosing a lot of 7 information, isn't it? 8 GENERAL KATYAL: That's precisely correct. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's possible that 10 that's the protection that the Framers envisioned, 11 rather than having courts ride herd on -- on Government 12 inquiries. 13 GENERAL KATYAL: It's certainly possible, 14 Justice Scalia. I think that all of these hypotheticals 15 are enormously interesting, but the -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Were these two forms 17 approved by Congress? 18 GENERAL KATYAL: The forms themselves were 19 not approved by Congress, but the Privacy Act, which is 20 the main restriction -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a restriction on 22 disclosure, but the same Congress can change that, 23 correct? 24 GENERAL KATYAL: That's absolutely correct. 25 The Privacy Act has been around since 1975, and the

It's been used 553,000 times 3 in the last 4 years, and we have not seen the types of 4 disclosure or complaints that I think animate the worry 5 that my friends on the other side are saying. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the 7 reason -- I've had trouble putting my finger on it -8 that you need the information about counseling? 9 You already have the information, have you 10 used drugs in the past year? I couldn't tell if you 11 thought the question about counseling was for the good 12 of the employee -- oh, you are taking steps to -- or was 13 it to allow you to show, well, it must be serious, 14 because you need counseling. 15 GENERAL KATYAL: It is for the good of the 16 employee, so it's a -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now that's -18 whenever the Government comes and says this is for your 19 own good, you have to be -20 (Laughter.) 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you have to be a 22 little suspicious. 23 I mean, if it's -- the employee gets to 24 expand upon his or her answer. They say, tell us about 25 it. And they can say, don't worry, I'm in counseling or

1 treatment. And even then, that doesn't sound like it's 2 for their good. It's one thing to say, I had a drink. 3 It's another thing to say, I'm in AA. 4 GENERAL KATYAL: Mr. Chief Justice, the way 5 the question is framed is, first, they are asked, have 6 you used illegal drugs in the last year? And then -7 and then, if the answer is yes, provide details and then 8 indicate any treatment or counseling received. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, I had a 10 question about the way it's worded. You're supposed -11 it says, if you've used it in the last year, detail your 12 involvement with drugs and any counseling you received. 13 Do you understand the counseling question to 14 be limited to the past year, or to reach back as far 15 as -16 GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I think that the 17 question itself is vague. 18 Now, the way that our -- that the Office of 19 Personnel Management will process such a form is it will 20 process anything so long as there is information about 21 just drug use on the question -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But do you think 23 it's required? I mean, you do sign at the end, this is 24 true to the best -- do you think it's required to 25 disclose counseling and treatment you received more than

1 a year back? 2 GENERAL KATYAL: No. This is unlike, for 3 example, SF-86, which does ask for treatment and 4 counseling back up to, I think, a 7-year period. 5 So I think this is a much more narrow 6 inquiry, and I think the reason for that inquiry is to 7 help the employee. The Government -- the background 8 investigation -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The answer to that is 10 obvious. It was raised by the other side. If it's for 11 the good of the employee, make it voluntary. 12 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 13 think that that's the type -- that that's the type of 14 inquiry that this Court rejected in Whalen. Because in 15 Whalen, the whole debate in the court, in the district 16 court below, was, well, if you want to stop doctor 17 prescription mills people from providing too many 18 narcotics, you don't need the names and ages of the 19 patients. We could change the triplicate forms and 20 redact that. 21 But what this Court said on the second page 22 of its opinion was it called that Lochnerian, that 23 Federal courts shouldn't be policing forms and excising 24 or suggesting random different -- you know, a few 25 different words here or there.

1 And here, experts put this form together to 2 try and get at, basically, are you using drugs and are 3 you using treatment which might ameliorate the fact that 4 you had used illegal drugs in the last year. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I had thought before 6 the argument that one of the purposes for asking about 7 treatment was to identify employees who may have 8 undergone treatment on numerous occasions and dropped 9 out of programs and been unsuccessful, so as to identify 10 chronic drug abusers. But I guess in light of what 11 you've just said, that this only reaches back 1 year, 12 that is not a purpose of this -- this question. 13 GENERAL KATYAL: That is correct, and in 14 preparation for this, we did survey all of the NASA 15 different centers to ask, has treatment ever been used 16 in any sort of way to hurt an employee? And the answer 17 that came back was, no, it has not been used. It has 18 only been used to help. It is to retain someone who did 19 use illegal drugs but is taking steps to mitigate. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you 21 know -- how do you know that? I mean, you ask a lot of 22 questions on these forms, and they say, well, we're not 23 going to hire you. How can you go back and say it was 24 because you put in, you know, in treatment for -- for 25 drug abuse?

1 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, the process by which 2 this takes place is the form is filled out. It is 3 ultimately sent to an adjudicator if there is negative 4 information, and that -- and that information is then 5 discussed with the candidate for employment or the 6 employee to see if they have an explanation. And of the 7 times that this has happened, that someone has been 8 denied -- and I think the number is 128 times over the 9 -- over the last 5 years -- none have been denied for a 10 positive answer to drug treatment. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Over the last 5 12 years, this has only come into play 128 times across the 13 Federal bureaucracy? 14 GENERAL KATYAL: For Federal contractors. 15 That is correct. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Federal contractors. 17 GENERAL KATYAL: Yes. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm not sure 19 I understand the answer. Only 128 times has somebody 20 identified themselves as a drug user? 21 GENERAL KATYAL: One hundred and 22 twenty-eight times, the SF-85 process, is my 23 understanding, has been used to deny someone a 24 credential of the Federal contractor -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it could be for any

1 other answers as well? 2 GENERAL KATYAL: For anything. Exactly. 3 About -- and I think there have been about 74,000 4 contractors that have sought -- sought badges through 5 the SF-85 since -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you representing to 7 us that every employee who is rejected will know the 8 reason? 9 GENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. That is 10 part of -- that is part of the regulations that are in 11 place, so that if someone is denied a credential -- and 12 this is, I think, at Joint Appendix page 180 -- they are 13 told the reason for that denial. They are given an 14 opportunity to explain themselves, and a process is then 15 put in place. There is then also robust appeal and 16 other things that may happen as well. 17 But one thing that doesn't happen, Justice 18 Sotomayor, is that JPL, the contractor, is not told the 19 basis for why the person is denied a credential, that it 20 is private as between the Government -- here, NASA -21 and the individual employee. And that is the -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So where does the 23 suitability matrix come in? 24 GENERAL KATYAL: It doesn't. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't?

1 GENERAL KATYAL: It doesn't. 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And NASA has never used 3 it? You're representing that to the Court? 4 GENERAL KATYAL: I'm representing that NASA 5 has -- NASA will not and does not use this employee 6 suitability chart to make contractor credentialing 7 decisions. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did it come from? 9 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's -- it's been 10 hard to actually pin down where it came from. I think 11 it is derived from earlier Office of Personnel 12 Management materials at a time when it listed out what 13 various crimes were. And so some of those things that 14 are on there that are quite salacious are things that 15 OPM, at earlier points in time, looked to, not for 16 contractors, but for Government employees. 17 But I can represent to the Court that NASA 18 does not and will not use this chart for credentialing 19 decisions. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- do you have a 21 clear idea of how the Form 42 would have to be amended 22 if the Respondents are correct? Form 85, we know, is 23 the excised "counseling or treatment." What in the Form 24 85 did the Ninth Circuit say -- it said "open-ended 25 questions," but I looked at the form, and it's not clear

1 to me which ones they considered open-ended. 2 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, I quite 3 agree with you. I don't think that the Ninth Circuit's 4 reasoning is capable of being ameliorated easily. 5 So we talked before about how the drug 6 treatment was just a narrow part of the Ninth Circuit 7 decision, but this Form 42 -- the invalidation of Form 8 42, goes to the heart of what the Government does all 9 the time and what all employers do. They ask open-ended 10 questions to figure out whether someone is trustworthy 11 and reliable. I think as Judge -12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General -- I'm sorry. 13 Go ahead and finish. 14 GENERAL KATYAL: I think as Judge Kleinfeld 15 said, that's how law clerks are hired, and that's how 16 baristas at Starbucks are hired. You have to ask these 17 open-ended questions because as an employer, you don't 18 really know what -- where the pressure points or danger 19 spots in an individual application are. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your position today 21 that our ruling should say that the Government is free 22 to ask, as a private employer or a contractor -- it is 23 free to ask any question it wants whatsoever? 24 GENERAL KATYAL: That is not what we're 25 saying. We --

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you were not saying 2 that, then what's the narrower ruling? Because that's 3 what I thought I heard at the beginning of our colloquy 4 today. 5 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, the 6 narrow rule is what we said in our petition and what we 7 said on the very last page of our reply brief and all 8 throughout, which is, this Court should simply say what 9 it said in Whalen, which is assuming that there is some 10 sort of right to informational privacy, the -- the use 11 of a background check with accompanying safeguards to 12 collect information doesn't violate any constitutional 13 right to privacy. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, why wouldn't that 15 violate it if the question involved a fundamental right? 16 If you were asking the question that Justice Alito 17 asked, which is, what's your sexual practices in the 18 bedroom, if there are security checks against you 19 disclosing it, you're saying even that would be okay? 20 GENERAL KATYAL: I could imagine a 21 circumstance far afield from this one in which the 22 Government's just mere collection of information about 23 sexual practices might burden the exercise of those 24 rights. I'm saying it's not at all present here, but -25 and I don't think the Court should get into it.

1 But that's a really different question than 2 the one here, which is: Is there some free-standing 3 right to constitutional privacy that is unburdened by 4 the fact that there are protections against the 5 disclosure of information? Here, the Privacy Act 6 imposes strong protections against the disclosure of 7 information. And so what's left is a very residual 8 interest in the part of the employees. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Don't -- this is a bit 10 unsatisfying because you start by saying to us, as long 11 as there are some nondisclosure protections, then 12 virtually any question, whether it impinges a 13 fundamental right or not, would be okay, because 14 there's -- I don't even know what the Government's 15 interest is in asking every question it wants to. 16 There has to be a need for a set of 17 questions, doesn't there? 18 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I could imagine an 19 as-applied challenge to, for example, you know, the 20 hypothetical on sexual practices or whatever. 21 I do think, as Justice Scalia said, the real 22 check on that is the political process check. The fact 23 is that the Government doesn't ask those kinds of 24 questions, and -- and to the extent it ever did, the 25 Court could confront that in an as-applied challenge.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I still don't see why 2 that -- why the universe is before us, because the Ninth 3 Circuit said some of this form is okay; most of Form 85 4 is okay, and some of Form 42 is okay. I thought it was 5 only the questions under 7 and 8, the open-ended 6 questions. I didn't think the Ninth Circuit had 7 enjoined anything other than those questions. 8 GENERAL KATYAL: Those questions, 9 Justice Ginsburg, are really the heart of the form. I 10 mean, those are the most -- in many ways the most 11 important questions, because they're the ones that 12 employers have to ask because they don't know the 13 weaknesses in an individual applicant's background. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There are a number of 15 statements in, I guess, the concurrence from the denial 16 of en banc, explaining how JPL is fairly open, and it is 17 close to the Pasadena courthouse. Pasadena residents 18 and judges visit JPL often. 19 Are there any statements of fact that you 20 don't agree with that are not in the record, other than 21 the matrix question? Leave that aside. 22 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, yes, I mean, I would 23 say a few things. Number one is I think that the 24 concurring judge did -- did, I think, underestimate how 25 important security is there.

1 First of all, there are armed guards when 2 you're coming in. It is not the campus-like atmosphere. 3 It's not like a campus I'm familiar that she described. 4 The information at the debate -- at JPL is sensitive, 5 quite sensitive, both, you know, in terms of 6 scientifically and with respect to our nation's secrets. 7 And I think more important point about this 8 is the badge that the Plaintiffs were seeking access to 9 don't -- doesn't just give them access to JPL. It will 10 also give them other access to all other NASA 11 facilities. And it's such an important credential that 12 it would allow them to get within, for example, 6 to 10 13 feet of the space shuttle as it's being repaired and 14 readied for launch. So this is a credential not just 15 for JPL and getting onto JPL, but other places as well. 16 If I could reserve the balance of my time. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 18 Mr. Stormer. 19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN STORMER 20 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 21 MR.

STORMER: It would mostly fall -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's a very nice 14 thing that the Government shouldn't ask intrusive 15 questions. I also think it's a nice thing that the 16 Government should pay a living wage to its employees, 17 but I don't feel authorized to go around saying how much 18 the Government should pay each of its employees because 19 there is nothing in the Constitution about that, and the 20 question is left to Congress. 21 What do you rely on in the Constitution that 22 enables me to decide how much intrusiveness is too much, 23 rather than leaving that to Congress? 24 MR. STORMER: It would flow from the ordered 25 concept of liberty component of the Fifth Amendment, as

STORMER: Well, the Whalen case, the 14 Nixon case, and to some extent, the Reporters Committee 15 case refer to this concept of privacy. And they are, in 16 fact, vague, but they do talk about the concept of 17 privacy as being the right to control information about 18 oneself. 19 And -- and both -- and all of the -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I like that, but I 21 just don't see it anywhere in the Constitution. That's 22 all I'm taking about. 23 MR. STORMER: Well, I -- there -- those 24 cases, in fact, do not refer to a term called 25 "informational privacy." Those terms have grown from
29

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the various cases that have flowed from the 2 determinations in Whalen and Nixon and, to some extent, 3 Reporters Committee. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that right is subject 5 to what level of scrutiny? Is it always strict 6 scrutiny? And how do you square Whalen and Nixon's 7 balancing with strict scrutiny? 8 MR. STORMER: The -- the standard would 9 be -- I think the appropriate standard was applied by 10 the Ninth Circuit, which is a legitimate state interest 11 narrowly tailored to meet that need. 12 In this case, there is some -- like the Von 13 Raab case, which is not cited in our brief but which is 14 a Fourth Amendment case, the -- this Court used a 15 compelling state interest standard for a Fourth 16 Amendment invasion. And in that case, the Court 17 remanded on the issue of whether or not the positions 18 involved classified or sensitive materials. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: So what is your view of 20 what the liberty -- you're saying that the words in the 21 Constitution that protect the right that you claim was 22 violated are the words, "No person shall be" -- I 23 guess -- "deprived of life, liberty, or property, 24 without due process of law." I guess you mean the word 25 "liberty."

Because as broadly as you've defined 13 that, it would include all of that. 14 MR. STORMER: It -- the -- the nature of 15 what is included can be intruded upon based upon a 16 governmental need. So if there's a rational basis for 17 knowing Social Security numbers, driver's license, 18 census information, that type of information, then -19 then there's not an issue. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this gets back to 21 Justice Sotomayor's earlier question.

It's -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in the case of a 7 date of birth for a driver's license, you say it's 8 rational basis? 9 MR. STORMER: Yes. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: And so, what -- how do we 11 decide? I'm a little interested, if you could spend 2 12 or 3 minutes elaborating this. 13 A number of laws, Federal laws -- I imagine 14 the regulations fill this room, and I think many -15 maybe more, maybe several rooms. And many of them 16 involve asking people for information. And the number 17 of forms that ask people for information, I guess, about 18 themselves, might fill several rooms. And I can imagine 19 in a country of 300 million people, you would find 20 someone objecting to many of the questions. 21 And so, how is the system supposed to work, 22 in your view, where judges will decide whether a 23 particular question -- I'm not saying you're wrong. I 24 just wanted to get an idea from you as to how this legal 25 system works, where any question asked by the Government

STORMER: I would agree that -- that in 15 that instance, "I hope the space shuttle blows up," 16 would certainly implicate some First Amendment issues, 17 but the Government should know that information. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: And now, what's the 19 alternative to acquiring that information through an 20 open-ended question?

You can ask those questions, but any employer 13 can't require, as a condition of employment, that you 14 sign a release that gives them all manner of information 15 as to where you shop, how you shop -16 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what is the 17 specific thing about question 7 that you think is 18 unlawful or should be changed? What words do you object 19 to in that question? 20 MR. STORMER: Well, other matters, general 21 behavior or conduct, certainly. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So they cannot 23 ask, do you have any information about this person's 24 employment, residence, or activities concerning general 25 behavior or conduct or other matters? Now, I am an

1 employer and I'd like to find out if he's going to do a 2 good job. So what am I supposed to say? There doesn't 3 seem to be a place here other than that to get into that 4 question. 5 MR. STORMER: That's because these -- this 6 question for the types of situations is not needed. The 7 question that is needed is, what are the characteristics 8 that you feel he has for this job? 9 JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say a private 11 employer could not ask a question of such detail? Why 12 could not -13 MR. STORMER: Primarily because of the 14 release. That's the sixth page of Standard Form 85. 15 That release just allows the Government -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why could a private 17 employer not -- not do it? 18 MR. STORMER: Because, in virtually every 19 State, there are laws requiring the disclosure of 20 private information -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you mean that 22 legislatures take care of these matters? I find it 23 curious that in order to establish a Federal 24 constitutional right, which turns this area over to this 25 Court, you invoke laws that have been democratically

1 enacted by State legislatures. I mean, if indeed that's 2 -- that's the criterion, maybe you don't need us. 3 MR. STORMER: I -- the reason I invoke that 4 is because the Government has stated that any private 5 attorney could ask these questions, and that's a 6 misstatement of the law in most States. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you this question 8 about the question on drug treatment? Would it be 9 unconstitutional for the Government to take the position 10 that to require an employee or applicant for employment 11 to disclose whether this individual had violated Federal 12 or State drug laws and take the position that if the 13 person gave an affirmative answer that was 14 disqualifying, would that be unconstitutional? 15 MR. STORMER: If they've said I violated 16 State or Federal laws, not on its face so long as if it 17 said voluntarily you may show mitigation that -- that 18 would show that this is not a problem that would make 19 you unfit for the job. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: So they could -- they could 21 say, have you bought, sold, used drugs in violation of 22 Federal or State law? If so, you're disqualified, 23 unless you can show that you have had treatment. And 24 then it's up to you to disclose whether you've had 25 treatment.

1 MR. STORMER: That's correct. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: What's really the difference 3 between that regime and this -- and what you have here? 4 MR. STORMER: The difference is here is 5 because it is compelled. It's a compelled disclosure 6 and not offering you the opportunity to make a showing. 7 And in this concept, the appeal right that you have from 8 this is not a robust appeal right that was described. 9 It's a very limited appeal that's internal to the 10 department, that does not have a right to confront or 11 cross-examine -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I ask you to clarify 13 your understanding of what has been enjoined? We know 14 it's easy for Form 85. For Form 42, you mentioned the 15 releases. I thought that the Ninth Circuit's order 16 covers parts of question 7 and perhaps question 8. I 17 didn't see -- is there something, maybe I missed it, 18 that says they can ask for release of the records? 19 MR. STORMER: There was in the emergency 20 order specific reference to the -- to the release. 21 There was not in the final order, but the order -- the 22 question can't -- has to be read in the context of the 23 release, because that's how they get to -- if you go to 24 the Betty Ford Clinic -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they didn't say,
51

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Government, you can't ask for the release. 2 MR. STORMER: They did not. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They said you can't ask 4 open-ended questions. 5 MR. STORMER: That's correct. They did not 6 say that, but it has to be implicit in their ruling 7 because in many of the cases -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If somebody is going to 9 be enjoined, I mean, it can't be implicit in the ruling 10 if you are enjoined. Because it has been stayed, you 11 don't have a formal order, but you can't say, well, it's 12 implicit in the, how many page, opinion. 13 MR. STORMER: The -- well, in the court 14 below, for instance, the argument that the Government 15 made was that they needed to have the medical records, 16 not that they just needed this information, that they 17 needed to have the medical records. 18 The question that logically flows is, what 19 can they do with this information once they learn that 20 you had counseling? Then I guess they can ask you who 21 the counsellor was, what you told the counsellor, what 22 was the purpose of -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand this 24 process, this is not an oral interview. It's not -- you 25 fill out a form, you meet somebody, and they ask
52

1 follow-up questions. This is -- this handled on the 2 papers, right? 3 MR. STORMER: It's handled -- first you 4 reveal the information, and then there are 22 approvers 5 at JPL, civilians who are not employed by NASA. They 6 review it; then it goes to NASA and then there's a whole 7 series -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But is there -- is 9 there an oral interview in this process? 10 MR. STORMER: There is not. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So then they wouldn't 12 say -- it says here, so I'm going to ask this, that, and 13 the other thing. There's this -- it's a 14 written procedure. 15 MR. STORMER: I may have misspoken. It 16 doesn't preclude an oral interview. I am not aware of 17 oral interviews having been made or taken. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You said there are 22 19 people at JPL that are involved in the employment? 20 MR. STORMER: There are 22 in the -- the 21 Government has approved 22 so-called approvers, who are 22 at JPL, who look over -- who are eligible to look over 23 these forms and the responses to the forms. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you 25 understand the scope of the preliminary injunction to
53
 Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1 be? Does it bar the solicitation of this information 2 throughout the Ninth Circuit or only with respect to 3 JPL? 4 MR. STORMER: At this point, it only applies 5 to -- well -- this is not before the -- part of the 6 record, but when it went back to the district court, the 7 district court and all parties agreed that it would only 8 apply -- HSPD-12 would be limited to these 28 9 individuals, that investigation. 10 Thank you. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 12 General Katyal, you have 4 minutes. 13 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 14 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 15 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, you had 16 asked earlier whether this was a narrow decision on just 17 a couple of questions, and I think that the argument 18 that you just heard from my friend illustrates that it's 19 not. He asks for a, quote, "free-standing right to 20 control information" -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But whatever he asks, we 22 are reviewing a judgment. 23 GENERAL KATYAL: Right. And the judgment -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the judgment is not 25 the universe; it's certain questions can be asked.
54
 Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1 GENERAL KATYAL: And the judgment is based 2 on the following rationale -- this is from the Petition 3 Appendix at page 18a from the Ninth Circuit. "If the 4 Government's actions compel disclosure of private 5 information, it has the burden of showing that its use 6 of the information would advance a legitimate state 7 interest and that its actions are narrowly tailored to 8 meet the legitimate interest." 9 Now, that reasoning was used to invalidate a 10 question, as Justice Kennedy said, on Form 42, that 11 employers ask all the time. Banks ask it and the like. 12 And it's a -- and it's used to invalidate parts of a 13 standard form that the Government uses day in and day 14 out and that employers generally use in order to make 15 employment decisions. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you conceding you 17 can't meet that standard, or are you saying that the 18 Ninth Circuit misapplied that standard? 19 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, no, we're not 20 conceding that at all. I do think we would meet the 21 standard, but our point is it's the same point as in 22 Engquist, in the Chief Justices's opinion in Engquist v. 23 Oregon, which is forcing the Government to have to march 24 into court every time and justify a question here or an 25 employee there or soup clerk here or whatever, all of
55

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 those different inquiries pose practical burdens on the 2 ability of the Government to operate. And so -3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think there's 4 something wrong with the Government having to explain 5 why it seeks information? I mean, I would think that 6 would be fairly simple in virtually every situation. 7 GENERAL KATYAL: I think -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ask that question 9 because that begs the question of can you ask anything 10 you want regardless of why? 11 GENERAL KATYAL: I think that political 12 process ensures that the Government generally has to ask 13 -- has answer that question writ large, but in order for 14 the Ninth Circuit's reasoning to apply, it would permit 15 any individual person here or there to ask the 16 question -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see how that's so 18 because, at least if you're in the Ninth Circuit, you 19 know that the Ninth Circuit has blessed all the 20 questions on that form but one. 21 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, that's only -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, I mean, you could 23 raise the question, but you'd be out of court in a 24 minute. 25 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, I think
56
 Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that's only because the challenge -- or the Petitioners 2 here only challenge certain questions. Now, I could 3 imagine other petitioners challenging other questions. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they did in the 5 lower court but abandoned it here, challenge the 6 question about the drug use. 7 GENERAL KATYAL: The drug use piece, but I 8 could imagine all sorts of inquires about other aspects 9 of the form. And, indeed, the rationale, the language 10 that I just read to you is a road map for anyone to be 11 able to come in and say, well, this -- this question 12 isn't -- isn't necessary for me because I got a 13 background clearance before, I'm rehired, or whatever. 14 And it would be a huge practical burden in the same way 15 as recognizing the cause of action in Engquist was a 16 practical burden. Instead, we think what the Court 17 should do here is what it did in Whalen, which is 18 recognize governments collect information all the time, 19 collect -20 JUSTICE ALITO: How much of the information 21 that's at issue here can be released and to whom? 22 GENERAL KATYAL: The information that can be 23 collected that's released here is governed by the 24 Privacy Act. And so there are -- the appendix to our 25 brief lists out precisely to whom they could be released
57
 Alderson Reporting Company

1 to, and that has been around since 1975. We've seen 2 virtually no complaints about the Government disclosing 3 this type of background information on the SF-85. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that also within the 5 Government itself? I know the Privacy Act says the 6 Government can't disclose, but how about checks -- I 7 mean, we have a vast government -- checks about 8 circulating the information within the Government? 9 GENERAL KATYAL: If it is for a -- if it is 10 to further the Government purpose for which the 11 information is collected, it can be distributed to other 12 folks in the Government. There are restrictions on 13 that, so -- and they're specified in the Privacy Act, 14 and they're quite extensive. And to the extent the 15 Court is concerned that there is something that isn't 16 robust enough in the Privacy Act, we suggest that would 17 -- that could wait for an as-applied challenge down the 18 road when information is disclosed. 19 And we don't think it will, but if, heaven 20 forbid, that happens, that's the basis for an as-applied 21 challenge down the road. But here what they're asking 22 you to do is invalidate questions and forms that the 23 Government asks all of its employees and now just wants 24 to ask contractors. 25 Thank you.
