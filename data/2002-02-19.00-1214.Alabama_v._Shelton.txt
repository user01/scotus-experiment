 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 now in No. 00-1214, Alabama v. LeReed Shelton.
 5 General Pryor.
 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. PRYOR, JR.
 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 8 MR. PRYOR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
 9 may it please the Court:
 10 30 years ago in Argersinger v. Hamlin and then
 11 more than 20 years ago in Scott v. Illinois, this Court
 12 established the principle that, under the Sixth and
 13 Fourteenth Amendments, a State is not obligated to provide
 14 an indigent defendant in a misdemeanor case court-
 15 appointed and taxpayer-funded counsel, provided that the
 16 defendant is not actually imprisoned upon conviction.
 17 8 years ago in Nichols v. the United States,
 18 this Court reaffirmed that principle. 
 19 The Supreme Court of Alabama distorted this
 20 well-established and workable rule and held that a
 21 probated or suspended sentence, which actually liberates a
 22 defendant to return to free society, nevertheless triggers
 23 a right to court-appointed and taxpayer-funded counsel. 
 24 There are three arguments that I would like to
 25 address this morning.

3
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Do you -- do you concede that the
 2 State can never impose the original sentence of time in
 3 jail? 
 4 MR. PRYOR: Your Honor, obviously that is not a
 5 court -- a question that this Court has directly addressed
 6 in either Argersinger or Scott. Our best reading --
 7 QUESTION: I'm asking whether the State of
 8 Alabama concedes that it can't ever impose that original
 9 sentence. 
 10 MR. PRYOR: Our reading of Scott is that -- that
 11 we cannot activate the suspended sentence. We acknowledge
 12 that Mr. Fried, as an amicus, certainly has a plausible
 13 reading that would allow the court to activate that
 14 sentence. In our judgment, that original sentence relates
 15 back to the original offense and that the court --
 16 QUESTION: What -- what happens in Alabama if --
 17 if a -- a criminal defendant is convicted of a misdemeanor
 18 and placed on probation and then violates probation? Does
 19 that enable the State to impose the original sentence for
 20 violation of the probation?
 21 MR. PRYOR: Yes, ordinarily it would. But for
 22 the problem presented involving an uncounseled defendant,
 23 it would allow the State to activate the suspended
 24 sentence. 
 25 QUESTION: Well, then we're jumping probably

4
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 ahead into what you're going to tell us, but while we're
 2 at this point, it seems to me that if -- if you say that
 3 the sentence cannot be reimposed, you're saying that the
 4 State courts are in the position of imposing a sentence
 5 that is something of a rouse. Why should you put your own
 6 courts in this position? I -- I just don't think it's
 7 very sound for us to tell the State courts, well, you go
 8 ahead and tell these people that they can -- might be put
 9 in prison, but that that won't really happen. It seems to
 10 me that that's your position. 
 11 MR. PRYOR: Well, there's still a risk of
 12 imprisonment, the same risk of imprisonment, under our
 13 reading of Argersinger and Scott, that -- that is
 14 accompanied with the judgment of a mere fine. Every court
 15 has the power to enforce any judgment as an essential
 16 aspect of the administration of justice through the power
 17 of contempt.
 18 QUESTION: But you're -- you're treating the
 19 contempt proceeding, in effect, as a separate proceeding
 20 then, and I take it, though I'm not sure that I remember
 21 this from your briefs -- I take it that on -- on your view
 22 of the way the scheme ought to operate in the contempt
 23 proceeding, before there could be any confinement on a
 24 finding of contempt, that counsel would have to be
 25 provided then if -- if the individual is indigent and

5
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 didn't waive it.
 2 MR. PRYOR: That's -- that's correct, Justice
 3 Souter. 
 4 QUESTION: So, it's the separate counseled
 5 proceeding that distinguishes your case from -- from the
 6 case that Mr. Fried argues for. 
 7 MR. PRYOR: That -- that's correct, Justice
 8 Souter. And -- and at a minimum I would say, although I
 9 don't think the Court has to ever address this question
 10 because there's been no violation of probation -- at a
 11 minimum the State would have the same power to enforce its
 12 judgment that it would a judgment of a mere fine which
 13 this Court held squarely in Scott does not trigger a right
 14 to court-appointed --
 15 QUESTION: From your point of view, General
 16 Pryor, what does the State gain as -- as opposed to what
 17 the Supreme Court of Alabama said, by following --
 18 following your -- your line of reasoning? I think as
 19 Justice Kennedy said, it -- it imposes a sentence, but a
 20 sentence that everybody knows can't be enforced.
 21 MR. PRYOR: The State gains the powerful tool of
 22 probation to rehabilitate an offender that the State
 23 believes is a good risk, a risk to return to free society
 24 who can be rehabilitated, depending on whatever mechanisms
 25 of probation have been adopted by the trial court. 

6
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Meanwhile, the State is preserving its scarce judicial
 2 resources to incarcerate more dangerous offenders and
 3 provide counsel in more serious cases. 
 4 QUESTION: But what -- how effective is
 5 probation going to be if there isn't the threat of -- of a
 6 sentence in case of probation violation? 
 7 MR. PRYOR: I think at a minimum, the probation
 8 is going to be as effective as a judgment of a fine
 9 because the State is going to still have the flexible
 10 power of contempt, whether civil or criminal in nature, to
 11 ensure that its orders are followed and -- and will
 12 continue to exercise jurisdiction of the probationer
 13 during that period of probation. 
 14 QUESTION: Is it the -- is it the case in
 15 Alabama that probation cannot be imposed without a
 16 suspended sentence?
 17 MR. PRYOR: That is correct. Technically that
 18 is how probation is imposed, Justice Souter. 
 19 QUESTION: Wouldn't -- wouldn't we have at least
 20 a more candid system or wouldn't the interaction of
 21 Argersinger and -- and the Alabama system, as you view
 22 Argersinger, produce a more candid system if -- if we took
 23 the position that, no, they can't impose a suspended
 24 sentence, and Alabama would then presumably amend its laws
 25 so that probation could be imposed without imposing a

7
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 suspended sentence, and you on your view would have your
 2 -- your contempt remedy. We wouldn't be -- in effect, the
 3 -- the two systems wouldn't be producing this kind of
 4 silly effect of -- of a sentence which everyone realizes
 5 as such cannot be imposed. 
 6 MR. PRYOR: Alabama certainly has the freedom to
 7 adopt I think either system without running afoul of the
 8 Constitution, which is the -- the issue before this Court.
 9 Although it might make more sense and not seem as silly to
 10 impose probation without going through the mechanics of --
 11 QUESTION: Well, is -- is there any State which
 12 imposes probation without a suspended sentence that you
 13 know of? 
 14 MR. PRYOR: I know from the amicus brief of the
 15 National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers that
 16 there are some States that impose, in fact, pretrial
 17 probation, that that is something that --
 18 QUESTION: How about post-trial, after a
 19 conviction? 
 20 MR. PRYOR: I just don't know. I know that
 21 there were several States that were cited in Shelton's
 22 briefly correctly that -- that used the same mechanism
 23 that Alabama does. There were several cites --
 24 QUESTION: General Pryor --
 25 QUESTION: Well, what -- what authority would --

8
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 would the State have to -- to put somebody on probation
 2 unless -- unless it is the suspension of -- of a judgment
 3 of incarceration? I mean, can a State just go around
 4 saying you're going to be on probation? 
 5 MR. PRYOR: Well --
 6 QUESTION: It seems to me the only -- the only
 7 reason it -- it has that grip over the person is that --
 8 is that it has a right to incarcerate him. 
 9 MR. PRYOR: The States certainly view that as an
 10 effective mechanism in most --
 11 QUESTION: I'm not sure there's an alternative
 12 to it. I'm not sure you can just pass a law saying judges
 13 can put on probation whomever they want to put on
 14 probation.
 15 MR. PRYOR: I think that -- that the Alabama
 16 legislature has the inherent power to define what a
 17 sentence is, whether a sentence is a fine or whether a
 18 sentence is imprisonment. And in fact, I think the State
 19 would have the flexibility to define a sentence -- one of
 20 the sentencing options as -- as probation.
 21 QUESTION: I take it what they would do on that
 22 scheme would be to say, upon conviction of offense A, the
 23 court may impose probation, and if the conditions of
 24 probation are violated and are shown in a separate trial
 25 or proceeding to that effect, the violation itself can be

9
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 punished. That would be the way the scheme would work,
 2 wouldn't it? 
 3 MR. PRYOR: That's correct.
 4 QUESTION: If -- if Alabama wanted it. 
 5 MR. PRYOR: If Alabama wanted it. But -- but
 6 this is really -- in my judgment this would be elevating
 7 form over substance because the -- the effect is the same
 8 with whichever system Alabama wants to adopt --
 9 QUESTION: General Pryor, explain to me how some
 10 other States approach it. If I understand correctly,
 11 there is no trial. It's a deferred prosecution on
 12 condition that the -- the defendant abide by certain terms
 13 and conditions. Is that how it works? 
 14 MR. PRYOR: That's -- that's correct.
 15 QUESTION: And if -- if the defendant then
 16 doesn't live up to it, then it proceeds to trial.
 17 MR. PRYOR: Then it proceeds to trial. 
 18 QUESTION: How many States use a system like
 19 that?
 20 MR. PRYOR: I believe the -- the brief listed 23
 21 States.
 22 QUESTION: Well, these are pretrial diversion
 23 programs which have been very helpful in the drug context,
 24 but they're extremely expensive to administer. 
 25 MR. PRYOR: Absolutely. Absolutely. And -- and

10
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 many States may very well feel that -- that there's
 2 something almost unseemly about using this kind of
 3 bargaining process before you have adjudicated guilt or
 4 innocence, and -- and the State certainly should have
 5 the --
 6 QUESTION: Well, why is it any more unseemly
 7 than the ordinary plea bargain? 
 8 MR. PRYOR: Because at least in the -- in the
 9 case of the ordinary plea bargain, the defendant comes
 10 forward and admits the wrongdoing. There's an indicia of
 11 reliability there for the State that's not present in this
 12 kind of pretrial system. And -- and the States who trust
 13 their system to adjudicate innocence or guilt may find
 14 that that's a -- that the system that Alabama has is a
 15 preferable system. 
 16 QUESTION: But Shelton was not given any
 17 pretrial diversion. He was convicted, was he not? 
 18 MR. PRYOR: That's correct, and Alabama doesn't
 19 have it in this context except with respect to drug
 20 offenders. 
 21 QUESTION: General Pryor, I can understand a
 22 line between a fine and any kind of confinement, and
 23 probation may involve no immediate incarceration, but it
 24 does involve what could be very significant restraints on
 25 the person. So, isn't it more logical to draw the line

11
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 between money only on the one hand and confinement, be it
 2 in jail or under terms and conditions of probation?
 3 MR. PRYOR: Justice Ginsburg, I'd say no for a
 4 couple of reasons. This Court has recognized that
 5 imprisonment is an intrinsically different form of
 6 punishment that has special constitutional significance. 
 7 The probation system is one that is meant more as
 8 rehabilitation and not as punishment to give an offender a
 9 second chance in free society. And -- and even with the
 10 judgment of a fine, as I mentioned earlier, there -- it --
 11 it is accompanied by the risk of imprisonment should the
 12 defendant willfully refuse to pay that fine. So, even in
 13 that context, in the judgment of -- of a fine, there is at
 14 least that risk, the same risk that would exist under the
 15 regime that we propose.
 16 I do not discount the fact that probation has --
 17 can have serious restrictions on liberty, but it's not the
 18 -- the deprivation of liberty, the loss of physical
 19 liberty, that is, physical confinement that this Court has
 20 held triggers a right to court-appointed counsel under the
 21 Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. 
 22 QUESTION: Under your view, if you enforced the
 23 jail sentence through the contempt mechanism and reached
 24 the same result, I take it you now have a second jury
 25 trial. 

12
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PRYOR: Well, I guess it would be dependent
 2 in part on the nature of the contempt proceeding. If it's
 3 civil contempt, if it's a direct contempt or an indirect
 4 contempt, but if it's criminal contempt, I would imagine
 5 -- I say that. In Alabama, a criminal contempt procedure
 6 only has a maximum term of imprisonment of 5 days. So,
 7 I'm not sure that -- that there would be a right to a jury
 8 trial. 
 9 For more than 20 --
 10 QUESTION: But then -- but then the contempt is
 11 -- is really not a substitute of an equivalent for the --
 12 for the imposition of the suspended sentence. They're not
 13 equivalent. If it's just 5 days, that's not equivalent to
 14 the suspended sentence.
 15 MR. PRYOR: Oh, absolutely. That's absolutely
 16 right, although I would argue that -- that the threat of
 17 imprisonment is still enough to give the probationer an
 18 incentive to follow the orders of the court. It's
 19 absolutely correct that there is a material difference
 20 between activation of the probated sentence in this case
 21 and the use of -- of the criminal contempt remedy that's
 22 provided by the code of Alabama. There's no doubt about
 23 that. 
 24 The -- what is at stake in this case is -- is
 25 the use of probation, a valuable tool for the States that

13
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 allow them the freedom and flexibility again to ensure
 2 that scarce judicial resources can be preserved for more
 3 serious cases to provide counsel and to incarcerate more
 4 serious offenders. 
 5 If there are no further questions from the
 6 Court, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance
 7 of my time for rebuttal. 
 8 QUESTION: Very well, General Pryor. 
 9 Mr. Fried, we'll hear from you.
 10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED
 11 ON BEHALF OF THE AMICUS CURIAE
 12 IN OPPOSITION TO THE JUDGMENT BELOW
 13 MR. FRIED: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
 14 may it please the Court:
 15 First, if I might just refer to the deferred
 16 prosecution point, which was raised by Mr. Duke in his
 17 amicus brief and in one of the questions. I think that's
 18 a red herring because, as Mr. Duke points out, the
 19 deferred prosecution requires the consent of both the
 20 prosecutor and the defendant. Obviously, the kind of
 21 prosecutions we have here are usually not consented to by
 22 the defendant. 
 23 I think it is --
 24 QUESTION: Why -- why is that a red herring? 
 25 Because I got from your brief the impression that the --

14
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the -- there's a practical problem that a lot of States do
 2 without giving people lawyers. Perhaps thousands and
 3 thousands of cases say, go plead guilty. We'll give you
 4 some light sentence that won't involve prison, but then
 5 they attach to that a suspended sentence. And what I
 6 wondered is, well, isn't the solution to this to say --
 7 it's called pretrial diversion or pretrial probation or
 8 they call it different names, but to say if you violate
 9 the condition, what happens to you is not prison, what
 10 happens to you is the trial that we haven't yet given you
 11 with a lawyer. And I thought maybe that works as a
 12 practical matter in a lot of these States in a lot of the
 13 cases to which you referred. 
 14 MR. FRIED: It -- it does work. For instance,
 15 we use it a great deal in the Commonwealth of
 16 Massachusetts where there is a quite different rule from
 17 -- from the Argersinger rule where in Massachusetts we say
 18 if there's a risk of imprisonment, you must get a lawyer. 
 19 And a number of States have that rule which is perhaps why
 20 they also have the deferred prosecution. 
 21 I say it's a red herring because what we're
 22 considering today is not the very best possible system but
 23 what is the constitutional minimum. Our emphasis in the
 24 brief on Nichols is not in order to show that Nichols
 25 somehow resolves this question in favor of allowing the

15
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 probated sentence and in favor of allowing it then to be
 2 activated on violation, but rather Nichols shows that the
 3 question is an open one. Nichols doesn't resolve it, but
 4 then neither does Argersinger. And I think it's a mistake
 5 and it's a mistake the Alabama Supreme Court made to treat
 6 Argersinger as having resolved this question. 
 7 Argersinger made quite clear that there is a
 8 continuum here all the way from mere due process, which
 9 was the law prior to Gideon, to a criminal -- to the right
 10 of a criminal defendant having a counsel in any criminal
 11 case. And it picked a point. It picked a point which the
 12 Court recognized had a certain arbitrariness, and it
 13 picked it for reasons of practicality and fairness. And
 14 those considerations of practicality and fairness require
 15 no more than that there be counsel if the person is
 16 sentenced immediately then and there to prison. 
 17 The fairness aspect is, as the Illinois court
 18 pointed out, that in these cases the defendant carries the
 19 key to the prison in his own pocket. Whether he ends up
 20 in prison is a matter of his choice whether or not he
 21 violates the terms of the probation. 
 22 That's why I think Mr. Duke enters two more red
 23 herrings into the argument. The stay on appeal. 
 24 Obviously in a stay case, the keys are not in the pocket
 25 of the defendant, but in the pocket of the appeals court. 

16
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And the 30-day or $30 prison which is executed
 2 immediately, in those cases the fine is either an illegal
 3 fine under the -- this Court's decision in Bierdon -- the
 4 person doesn't pay because he cannot, and that is itself a
 5 constitutional violation -- or once again, he is
 6 imprisoned because he chooses not to pay. And once again,
 7 that is the fairness point. The keys are in his pocket.
 8 That is a reasonable place to draw the line
 9 because of the very important practicalities. The
 10 practicalities are the literally millions of misdemeanor
 11 cases, the very large number -- it's hard to say exactly
 12 what the number is -- the very large number of
 13 probationary misdemeanor sentences, and the fact that
 14 those probationary sentences overwhelmingly are intended
 15 to serve a rehabilitative or preventive function. Don't
 16 drive again. Take a anger management course. Go to
 17 counseling. And the -- this is meant to keep people out
 18 of prison, not to put them into prison. 
 19 Unfortunately, if you insert a mandatory
 20 formality into something which is a little bit like family
 21 court proceeding, necessarily you will have a perverse
 22 effect. The State has to spend more time, has to spend
 23 more resources. It will do this less frequently, but it
 24 will make sure it gets more of, if you like, deterrent
 25 bang for its buck, and the result will be perverse. 

17
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 This system, as simply a constitutional minimum,
 2 allows the States the flexibility which this Court from
 3 the beginning, from Argersinger on, has recognized.
 4 QUESTION: You do allow the possibility that
 5 counsel could be provided in the event the probation is
 6 revoked. 
 7 MR. FRIED: I think that's a very real
 8 possibility. Ganyon talks about that in terms of due
 9 process, and I think the practicalities change --
 10 QUESTION: But the issue with the revocation
 11 hearing would not necessarily be whether he committed a
 12 crime. It would just be whether he violated a term of
 13 probation such as leaving the jurisdiction or something.
 14 MR. FRIED: That is correct. 
 15 QUESTION: He can get counsel to defend him
 16 against that. 
 17 MR. FRIED: That is correct. 
 18 QUESTION: Not against the crime itself.
 19 MR. FRIED: That is correct. 
 20 QUESTION: Well, it would -- it would also
 21 cover, I take it, whether or not the plea was voluntary
 22 and knowingly made originally. 
 23 MR. FRIED: That could be brought up. Nothing
 24 -- nothing precludes bringing that up. What you have is a
 25 funnel with a very large opening, and in terms of the

18
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 statistics, a very small tube at the bottom. It would
 2 not --
 3 QUESTION: Well, is it your view that at the
 4 probation hearing you reexamine the validity of the
 5 original offense, the original conviction?
 6 MR. FRIED: The -- Alabama is a good example of
 7 what is open at probation. In most jurisdictions, oddly
 8 enough, not in Massachusetts -- in most jurisdictions, the
 9 court on probation is free to impose new -- the revocation
 10 proceeding -- new conditions, the sentence that has
 11 already been imposed, or a lesser sentence in light of all
 12 circumstances, and it mentions specifically
 13 depreciating --
 14 QUESTION: Yes, but all those alternatives
 15 assume the original conviction is valid.
 16 MR. FRIED: I don't see why in those
 17 proceedings --
 18 QUESTION: At least in a typical case. 
 19 MR. FRIED: -- the lawyer could not argue, look,
 20 you're asking whether this will depreciate the gravity of
 21 the original offense. Let me tell you a little bit about
 22 that. And I would think the judge would listen, and he
 23 has the discretion to impose a lesser sentence. 
 24 QUESTION: This is all pretty speculative, isn't
 25 it, since that question doesn't confront us here? 

19
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FRIED: No question. And I simply want to
 2 emphasize that that is open and is an important question
 3 perhaps best considered in a case where it can be fully
 4 developed. But I don't think the Court should decide this
 5 case on the assumption that that possibility might not in
 6 a later case be open. And I think that leaves the kind of
 7 flexibility which is very desirable in these low level but
 8 very frequently encountered cases. I think that's what
 9 will serve the -- the Constitution and the interests of
 10 rehabilitation best. 
 11 QUESTION: Do we have any idea of the 1.4
 12 million to 1.8 million people who are on probation for
 13 misdemeanors, of what percentage of those cases the -- the
 14 probation -- or the defendant was not offered a lawyer? I
 15 mean, the relevant feature is --
 16 MR. FRIED: We try --
 17 QUESTION: That's a rather -- yes.
 18 MR. FRIED: We try to infer that in the brief. 
 19 It's -- the statistics are not kept in a transparent or
 20 useful way. But it may be in the hundreds of thousands. 
 21 It may be in the hundreds of thousands because as -- as we
 22 explain in our brief, there are a very large number of
 23 persons on probation who did not have lawyers, and given
 24 Argersinger, we may assume that they were misdemeanors.
 25 So, it's a very large number. 

20
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 But the number of persons who are actually
 2 incarcerated for breach of those conditions is quite
 3 small. It's in the thousands. And that's why I think it
 4 becomes quite practical to offer an attorney to help in
 5 that condition, but really I think very confining and
 6 perhaps with a perverse effect to require it as a
 7 constitutional minimum in the much larger -- very much
 8 larger number of cases where the matter is first
 9 considered. After all, if the person has to be sent to
 10 prison, that's a failure. 
 11 I thank the Court for its attention. 
 12 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Fried, and thank you
 13 for your participation as an amicus.
 14 Mr. Duke, we'll hear from you. I'm sorry. Mr.
 15 Mills.
 16 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. MILLS
 17 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 18 MR. MILLS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 19 the Court:
 20 It obviously is apparent here that both the
 21 petitioner and the respondent come to this Court relying
 22 on the same authority, the -- primarily the Argersinger
 23 and Scott cases. 
 24 It seems that the State is taking a rather
 25 shallow view, in our judgment, of the Argersinger and

21
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Scott cases both as to their background and how
 2 Argersinger is -- is implemented and the effect of that
 3 implementation.
 4 QUESTION: Do you agree that neither of those
 5 cases squarely control the outcome here? 
 6 MR. MILLS: It -- it would be my position that
 7 Argersinger does by the -- some of the pronouncements that
 8 it makes.
 9 QUESTION: Certainly the holding does not.
 10 MR. MILLS: The holding does not certainly.
 11 And it would further be my position that -- that
 12 the Scott case has something to say to us about this issue
 13 also, although the holding -- the -- the facts certainly
 14 do not coincide with this case. 
 15 It seems to me that the background of the
 16 Argersinger and Scott cases, of course, are the -- the
 17 Powell v. Alabama, Gideon v. Wainwright series of cases. 
 18 And in those cases, it seems that the Court has
 19 established the purpose of the Counsel Clause which if we
 20 -- if we reduce to its barest terms is this. The purpose
 21 of the Counsel Clause is to prevent, to the extent humanly
 22 possible, the conviction of the innocent in an adversary
 23 proceeding. That seems to be what Justice Sutherland said
 24 in Powell v. Alabama and what Justice Black said in Gideon
 25 v. Wainwright, that what is to be done is to eliminate the

22
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 risk that the innocent may be convicted.
 2 And when we come to the Argersinger case,
 3 although the -- the Gideon case had -- had spoken of this
 4 as being a -- or nobel idea was the -- were the words used
 5 -- but I believe spoke of counsel for every defendant in
 6 every case as being a constitutional ideal. I think in
 7 Argersinger, the Court was faced with the argument of
 8 practicability and expense and -- and the other arguments
 9 that -- that the State makes in this case, that the
 10 mandate can't be absolute, that there must be some
 11 accommodation to those arguments.
 12 And in Argersinger, it -- it seems that the
 13 Court made those accommodations. And if we include --
 14 QUESTION: Well, the Court basically said, fine
 15 only? Okay. We're not going to extend the Sixth
 16 Amendment to that. 
 17 Now, here we have a State that says, well, we
 18 know we can't enforce the sentence. It's a toothless
 19 tiger. We'll say probation, but it -- we don't mean it. 
 20 I mean, we'll -- we'll maybe have proceedings, but we --
 21 we can never enforce the sentence. In light of that,
 22 should we be concerned here? 
 23 MR. MILLS: Well, that -- that puzzled me
 24 somewhat when the State made that concession in its reply
 25 brief that this was in -- in effect a sham sentence. And

23
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 I see no authority in the law of Alabama or any other
 2 State that I'm aware of that authorizes a court --
 3 QUESTION: Well, if that's the case, what do we
 4 think about this? 
 5 MR. MILLS: Perhaps we're dealing with a sham
 6 sentence. And perhaps that's the way the Alabama Supreme
 7 Court treated it. But certainly there shouldn't be, from
 8 this Court or any other court, an authorization for a
 9 trial court to enter a sentence that can't be enforced.
 10 QUESTION: Would you just clarify one thing for
 11 me? Did the Alabama Supreme Court endorse that view, or
 12 is that the Attorney General?
 13 MR. MILLS: That's the Attorney General's view. 
 14 What the Alabama petit court -- Supreme Court did was
 15 merely strike the sentence.
 16 QUESTION: I guess whether you strike it or not
 17 is a matter of State law, isn't it? I mean -- I don't
 18 know what the remedy should be for a sentence that's not
 19 -- not an enforceable sentence and the person writes it in
 20 the -- the judge writes in the book, suspended sentence. 
 21 And the State and everyone else, let's say, agree that
 22 that isn't a lawful sentence. So, the State Supreme Court
 23 says, erase those words. Strike them. Did anyone suggest
 24 that was a matter of Federal law or what you do under
 25 State law when a --

24
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MILLS: Well, I believe the Alabama Supreme
 2 Court said it was -- it was a matter of Federal law. 
 3 QUESTION: That it be struck rather than just
 4 left to lie there unenforceable.
 5 MR. MILLS: I'm not sure they articulated in
 6 those terms, but their -- their basis for reaching the
 7 decision they reached was the Federal cases that deal with
 8 the right of counsel. 
 9 QUESTION: One of the things that didn't happen,
 10 we know for sure, in this case was that an offer of
 11 counsel. Was that merely a -- an inadvertence on the
 12 court's part or does Alabama not provide assigned counsel
 13 for indigents in -- in a misdemeanor like this? 
 14 MR. MILLS: Perhaps it was inadvertence, but the
 15 -- the Alabama rules of criminal procedure have that as a
 16 part of the -- the processing of any -- any case. 
 17 QUESTION: In any misdemeanor?
 18 MR. MILLS: Any criminal prosecution, yes, sir.
 19 QUESTION: All right. So that if -- if there
 20 had been -- if there were an offense in Alabama that
 21 carried as much as a 1-day sentence, the State would
 22 provide counsel for an indigent, at least if requested?
 23 MR. MILLS: Not -- not in those terms. Not -- I
 24 believe the Alabama rules say where constitutionally
 25 required. And of course the --

25
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: So, they're not providing counsel in
 2 these cases now because, I take it, the State's position
 3 is it's not constitutionally required.
 4 MR. MILLS: That's correct, Your Honor.
 5 QUESTION: At what point do they regard it as
 6 being constitutionally required? When the sentence can
 7 exceed 6 months or what? What -- what I'm getting at is I
 8 want to know -- I want your response to the argument that
 9 there's going to be a -- a great practical difference if
 10 we say now you may not impose sentences like this at all,
 11 even though they're merely suspended. I want to know what
 12 the practical difference is.
 13 MR. MILLS: From the -- the wording of the
 14 Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure about appointment of
 15 counsel at the present time, I would assume that the trial
 16 judge must go through the process outlined in Argersinger,
 17 that is, make the pretrial determination of whether
 18 imprisonment is a likely punishment in this particular
 19 case, and if -- if so, appoint counsel. If not so,
 20 counsel is not appointed. 
 21 QUESTION: Well, any imprisonment? 1 day of
 22 imprisonment? 
 23 QUESTION: Isn't that what the Federal --
 24 Argersinger requires? 
 25 MR. MILLS: I think that's what Argersinger

26
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 says.
 2 QUESTION: Okay. But Alabama, in other words,
 3 is not doing something eccentric in this respect. 
 4 MR. MILLS: That -- that's correct. 
 5 QUESTION: The -- the only difference then
 6 between the cases in which -- misdemeanor cases, for
 7 example, in which counsel is offered, if an individual is
 8 indigent, and counsel is not offered are cases in which
 9 the judge says in advance I'm not going to put this guy
 10 away at all even if we convict him.
 11 MR. MILLS: Presumably that's the process that's
 12 being followed. 
 13 QUESTION: Now, do you have -- do you have any
 14 basis to tell us what practical difference it would make
 15 if the judge said, well, I may impose a suspended sentence
 16 and therefore I will have to offer counsel because I read
 17 Argersinger as requiring that? Do you know what
 18 difference that would make in practical terms? How many
 19 cases would counsel have to be offered and potentially
 20 provided for where it's not being offered and potentially
 21 provided for now?
 22 MR. MILLS: I don't have any data that would --
 23 would support that, but it -- but it would seem that if
 24 the trial judge makes the pretrial determination that any
 25 sentence, whether -- whether immediate or suspended, is

27
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 warranted or may be warranted in this particular case,
 2 that counsel should be appointed -- of course, that's the
 3 position. 
 4 QUESTION: I understand that. 
 5 MR. MILLS: That's the position. 
 6 QUESTION: Mr. Mills, there is one thing that I
 7 think is a piece of information that -- that is in the
 8 record, and that is that most non-indigent misdemeanors
 9 appear in court without counsel. So, the position that
 10 you're urging is kind of a superior justice for the
 11 indigents. Counsel, you would say, in every case where,
 12 at the end of the line, there may be any jail time,
 13 although most people who can't afford counsel do not have
 14 counsel in cases of -- of this kind.
 15 MR. MILLS: That perhaps is correct. I suppose
 16 my response to that would be that that's -- that that's a
 17 free choice that the non-indigent makes.
 18 QUESTION: Isn't it true also -- isn't it true
 19 also, at least according to some of the statistics quoted,
 20 that frequently these cases are not prosecuted by lawyers? 
 21 They're simply prosecuted by the arresting officer. 
 22 MR. MILLS: That happens occasionally in
 23 Alabama. It used to happen a lot. It's -- it's fairly
 24 rare at the present time. But -- but that does happen. 
 25 That does happen. 

28
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And, of course, in -- in Alabama, all
 2 misdemeanors, except those that are initiated by
 3 indictment, the first trial is in a -- a district or
 4 municipal court where there's no jury trial. And the jury
 5 trial, if there is a right to jury trial, comes only by a
 6 -- an appeal and a de novo trial in the circuit court,
 7 which is an administrative problem. I don't see that as a
 8 -- as a philosophical problem. It's -- it's still the --
 9 most misdemeanors are -- are being tried in courts where
 10 there is no jury, certainly all of them in the first
 11 instance or most of them in the first instance. 
 12 It seems that the petitioner's position
 13 overlooks the fact that -- that the Sixth Amendment is --
 14 is prophylactic rather than curative. Now, its -- its
 15 ideal is to prevent the convictions, not to do something
 16 about them after they occur. 
 17 Now, let me jump right quick to -- to the point
 18 that Argersinger deals with it somewhat in that way. 
 19 Argersinger is what we might call an outcome-based
 20 analysis of whether there's a right to counsel. And --
 21 and to that extent, maybe it's -- it's curative rather
 22 than prophylactic. 
 23 But if -- if it is to be outcome-based analysis,
 24 certainly it ought to be the -- the total outcome not just
 25 the immediate outcome, and if a suspended sentence results

29
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 in incarceration, when the probation is revoked, that
 2 certainly is a part of the -- of the outcome that
 3 Argersinger was -- was dealing that the trial judge is
 4 required to make some decision on before trial even
 5 begins. So --
 6 QUESTION: Do you suppose it would be
 7 constitutional for the State to offer the defendant at the
 8 outset the promise of imposition of a suspended sentence
 9 if counsel were waived? 
 10 MR. MILLS: If knowingly waived, I don't see a
 11 constitutional problem with that. And I'm sure that
 12 happens in fact. 
 13 QUESTION: Is that done sometimes in Alabama?
 14 MR. MILLS: It -- it is. It is done. And, of
 15 course, this is -- this is the distinction between the --
 16 the pretrial diversion mechanism that was addressed
 17 earlier and a trial. Most pretrial -- perhaps all
 18 pretrial diversions are by definition. 
 19 QUESTION: Well, put in its raw form, if the
 20 judge said, now, if -- if you agree not to have a counsel,
 21 I'll agree not to impose a jail sentence, that -- that
 22 wouldn't be permitted. I mean --
 23 MR. MILLS: Yes, sir, and it seems if --
 24 QUESTION: I assume. Correct me if I'm wrong. 
 25 I assume it wouldn't be permitted. 

30
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MILLS: I think that's correct. In fact, I
 2 think that's what Argersinger requires. I think
 3 Argersinger requires a trial judge to assure the defendant
 4 who goes to trial without a lawyer that he's not going to
 5 get jail sentence. And if he can receive a jail sentence
 6 somewhere down the line, the judge has given him a false
 7 assurance. But --
 8 QUESTION: The -- the jail sentence would not be
 9 for the original crime necessarily but perhaps just for
 10 breaking probation.
 11 MR. MILLS: Well, I couldn't speak to all
 12 jurisdictions, but certainly under Alabama law, there
 13 would be no -- no way to impose a sentence for breaking
 14 probation. It would either be the original sentence --
 15 QUESTION: Well, that's what I mean. But the
 16 reason this -- the original sentence now becomes effective
 17 is because he broke probation.
 18 MR. MILLS: This, of course, is correct. This
 19 is the -- the carrot and stick analogy which -- which
 20 the --
 21 QUESTION: Well, maybe I misunderstood General
 22 Pryor's argument, but I thought he was here arguing no, he
 23 wouldn't impose the original sentence ever. We'd just
 24 proceed on contempt, maximum 5 days. Did I misunderstand?
 25 MR. MILLS: I think that's what he -- he said. 

31
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 I'm sure he -- he told us the whole story about contempt
 2 under Alabama law. Each day that a contempt continues can
 3 be a separate violation, a separate contempt, and -- and
 4 could warrant a -- an additional 5-day sentence. So,
 5 contempt -- if a person was cited for violating his
 6 probation because he quit his job --
 7 QUESTION: Well, but that wouldn't -- that
 8 wouldn't involve imposition of the original sentence. 
 9 That's something else. 
 10 MR. MILLS: That --
 11 QUESTION: That was what I understood --
 12 MR. MILLS: That would be something else. That
 13 is -- that is for the contempt itself. 
 14 QUESTION: What is your position in the case of
 15 the individual who refuses to pay the fine? No suspended
 16 sentence of incarceration, simply a sentence of a fine,
 17 and he refuses to pay it. Assuming the facts are
 18 otherwise the same, he did not have counsel and he was not
 19 offered counsel if indigent. Could the fine be enforced
 20 by a contempt sanction? 
 21 MR. MILLS: I think this Court has addressed
 22 that issue that it constitutionally can, and I -- I assume
 23 there's no -- no impediment to that under Alabama law.
 24 QUESTION: Well, does -- is there -- is there
 25 some tension between the position you take about the

32
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 inability of the State to enforce a -- a condition of
 2 sentence or a condition of suspension in the position that
 3 you take or acknowledge about the ability to enforce the
 4 -- the sentence of fine? Why should the two cases be
 5 different? 
 6 MR. MILLS: Well, I think the -- the difference
 7 is if the suspended sentence is imposed, a person is being
 8 imprisoned because he committed a crime. That would
 9 never --
 10 QUESTION: And if the fine -- if the fine is
 11 imposed, the fine is being imposed because the individual
 12 committed a crime.
 13 MR. MILLS: Well, this is true, but only if he
 14 willfully refuses to pay it where he has the ability to do
 15 so.
 16 QUESTION: Well, is the -- is the difference
 17 that you're making willful? That -- that violations of
 18 the conditions of suspension are not willful and refusals
 19 to pay a fine are willful?
 20 MR. MILLS: Well, I believe willfulness --
 21 willfully refusing to pay a fine would be a -- a
 22 precondition to -- to a contempt sentence.
 23 QUESTION: All right. Then let's assume that
 24 we're talking about the class of -- of breach of -- of
 25 conditions of suspension that are willful. Let's assume

33
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 there's a condition of suspension that says you will be
 2 home every night at 9 o'clock to keep you away from the --
 3 you know, the bad influences you've had, and he willfully
 4 refuses. I take it your position is that the suspended
 5 sentence still cannot be imposed. Is that correct?
 6 MR. MILLS: That -- that's --
 7 QUESTION: But that's just as -- the willfulness
 8 factor is the same in the refusal to abide by that
 9 condition as it is in the refusal to pay the fine. So,
 10 I'm having difficulty seeing why you -- why on your view
 11 the -- the two should come out differently. 
 12 MR. MILLS: Well, the -- the fine and the -- the
 13 contempt for willfully refusing to comply with some other
 14 conditions, I -- I could not distinguish those. 
 15 QUESTION: No.
 16 MR. MILLS: Of course, let me add one other
 17 thing about the contempt process to -- to enforce. Under
 18 Alabama law, it wouldn't save the State any money. It
 19 would -- in fact, it would cost the State a lot of money
 20 because of the formalities required in a criminal contempt
 21 proceeding. There must be a separate proceeding. I think
 22 there probably would not have to be a jury trial, but
 23 certainly there would have to be counsel if it is
 24 anticipated that imprisonment will be one of the
 25 punishments for willfully refusing.

34
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: But -- but it would only -- it would
 2 only undergo that expense where there has been a breach of
 3 the conditions of -- of probation. Whereas, you're
 4 arguing that the State must undergo the expense of counsel
 5 in all cases. The number of cases where there's a
 6 violation of probation is -- is presumably quite small,
 7 and -- and to say that the State has to provide counsel in
 8 those cases in order to get the contempt sanction is -- is
 9 not nearly as much of an imposition as -- as you're urging
 10 us to impose. 
 11 MR. MILLS: Well, I would say one thing. 
 12 Perhaps the -- the number of cases would not be as large
 13 as -- as might be anticipated. Presumably in many of the
 14 suspended sentence cases, the judge perhaps has already
 15 made that decision, this is a possible jail case or this
 16 is not a possible jail case. Or if he's made a decision
 17 it is a possible jail case, appoints counsel, he may, of
 18 course, impose a suspended sentence rather than an
 19 immediate sentence. So, perhaps many of the cases are
 20 already being appointed counsel. So, the -- the number
 21 may not be that large.
 22 I thank the Court.
 23 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Mills. 
 24 Mr. Duke, we'll hear from you. 
 25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN B. DUKE

35
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL
 2 DEFENSE LAWYERS, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
 3 MR. DUKE: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the
 4 Court:
 5 Were this a petty offense prosecution, perhaps
 6 the only legitimate, appropriate question would be the one
 7 that has occupied the Court thus far this morning, but
 8 this is a not a petty offense prosecution. This is a
 9 serious offense prosecution. As such, it is a criminal
 10 prosecution within the Sixth Amendment. 
 11 The Sixth Amendment guarantees counsel
 12 regardless of the sentence or sanction imposed. There are
 13 two reasons why this is so. One is textual; the other is
 14 common sensical. 
 15 QUESTION: You're not saying it would guarantee
 16 counsel if only a fine were imposed.
 17 MR. DUKE: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. The counsel
 18 would be guaranteed in any serious offense prosecution.
 19 QUESTION: Well, how do you reconcile that with
 20 Argersinger?
 21 MR. DUKE: Because Argersinger, Mr. Chief
 22 Justice, was a petty offense case. Argersinger explicitly
 23 assumed that if it were a serious offense case, there
 24 would be the right to counsel. In fact, the lower court
 25 said there would be a right to counsel, but the lower

36
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 court said he can't have a lawyer here because this was a
 2 petty offense. 
 3 QUESTION: Well, but wasn't the basis on -- the
 4 basis you're submitting now wasn't the basis on which the
 5 Supreme Court of Alabama ruled, was it? 
 6 MR. DUKE: It -- it was not the -- the
 7 rationale, but it -- it does support the result of the
 8 Alabama Supreme Court's decision. 
 9 QUESTION: But I thought that the main issue
 10 that we had here is the one we've been talking about, is
 11 you have to give a person a lawyer when it is a petty
 12 offense. And the fact is that there's going to be a
 13 suspended sentence. So, what about that question? 
 14 I mean -- and I -- I thought that Mr. Fried's
 15 main point was don't do it because if you say you have to
 16 give a person a lawyer, where it's a petty offense and the
 17 only key thing is is a suspended sentence, I'll tell you
 18 there are 1,800,000 people who have received probation in
 19 petty offenses. And there must have been some stick if
 20 they violated probation, and that stick is like a
 21 suspended sentence. So, deal with it when you worry about
 22 the probation violation; don't worry about it up front. 
 23 That's -- that's what, I take it, is basically the
 24 argument. 
 25 And I've been waiting for you to talk because I

37
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 thought you might be a person who'd know the statistics. 
 2 So, you might know if that's really so if -- or which
 3 seems hard to get at how many of those $1.5 million
 4 walking-around probation people did -- were never offered
 5 a lawyer. What's --
 6 MR. DUKE: We don't know. 
 7 QUESTION: We don't know. So, what are we
 8 supposed to do? 
 9 MR. DUKE: The -- the studies that I've seen
 10 suggest that in misdemeanor -- petty misdemeanor cases,
 11 frequently the -- the people are offered a lawyer in a --
 12 in a group and it's suggested that most of them don't need
 13 lawyers because they're not going to jail. 
 14 But I submit, Justice Breyer, that the -- that
 15 the real red herring in this case is treating this as a
 16 petty offense. This is not a petty --
 17 QUESTION: And it's not offense because? 
 18 MR. DUKE: Because the authorized sentence in
 19 this case was 1 year, which made the jury trial right --
 20 guaranteed him a right to a jury trial under the Sixth
 21 Amendment, and because this was a criminal prosecution.
 22 QUESTION: But the question presented is this. 
 23 In light of the actual imprisonment standard established
 24 in Argersinger, refined in Scott, does the imposition of a
 25 suspended or conditional sentence in a misdemeanor case

38
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 invoke a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel?
 2 Now, I think what you're saying is that the
 3 Supreme Court of Alabama decision could be supported on
 4 another ground, but I'm not sure it -- it fits within the
 5 question presented. 
 6 MR. DUKE: Well, I submit it does, Mr. Chief
 7 Justice, because as I suggested, Argersinger dealt with a
 8 petty offense. Scott dealt with the question of
 9 imprisoning somebody, but the -- but the fundamental
 10 question here that -- that this Court should not allow
 11 itself to get embroiled in it to repeat the mistake is to
 12 treat this as if this is a trivial case because -- or to
 13 put it this way, at some point someone has to ask the
 14 question how is it that this defendant in this case had a
 15 constitutional right to a jury trial under the Sixth
 16 Amendment because this was a criminal prosecution, but he
 17 did not have a right to assistance of counsel.
 18 QUESTION: Our -- our cases have reached
 19 different results on those two issues.
 20 MR. DUKE: But, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the
 21 Scott opinion, which you wrote, did not actually address
 22 the serious offense 6-month distinction because the
 23 parties were not addressing it.
 24 QUESTION: Where do you get that from? You're
 25 appealing to the text of the Constitution. Aren't all

39
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 misdemeanors criminal offenses?
 2 MR. DUKE: All --
 3 QUESTION: Aren't all misdemeanors criminal
 4 offenses? 
 5 MR. DUKE: They're criminal offenses but they're
 6 not criminal prosecutions.
 7 QUESTION: And -- and what does the Constitution
 8 say? 
 9 MR. DUKE: Pardon?
 10 QUESTION: And what does the Constitution say? 
 11 It says in all criminal prosecutions. 
 12 MR. DUKE: Yes. 
 13 QUESTION: So, if you're appealing to the
 14 Constitution -- and -- and you say it's clear language. I
 15 don't think it is. But if -- if you think it's clear
 16 language, you should be arguing that even in petty
 17 offenses you're entitled to counsel.
 18 MR. DUKE: I -- I don't think I have to argue
 19 that, Justice Scalia.
 20 QUESTION: No, only if you rely on the text of
 21 the Constitution, which is what I thought you were doing.
 22 MR. DUKE: I'm saying that the right to a jury
 23 trial exists because and only because it's a criminal
 24 prosecution under the Sixth Amendment. Logically,
 25 therefore, if it is a criminal prosecution under the Sixth

40
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Amendment, then there is a right to counsel because the
 2 Sixth Amendment says there is. But what the right to
 3 counsel should be in petty offenses is a different issue.
 4 QUESTION: Why? It's a criminal offense. If --
 5 if you're arguing --
 6 MR. DUKE: It's a criminal offense --
 7 QUESTION: -- from the text of the Constitution
 8 that says in all criminal prosecutions, it includes petty
 9 misdemeanors as well as what you call major misdemeanors.
 10 MR. DUKE: I'm not arguing that all petty
 11 offenses are criminal prosecutions. They plainly are not.
 12 QUESTION: I know you're arguing it. 
 13 MR. DUKE: They're not. 
 14 QUESTION: They are not criminal prosecutions?
 15 MR. DUKE: No, otherwise there would be a right
 16 to a jury trial. There is not a right to a jury trial.
 17 QUESTION: Has this Court held that there is a
 18 congruent right to a jury trial and --
 19 MR. DUKE: No. 
 20 QUESTION: No. All right.
 21 MR. DUKE: But nor has it --
 22 QUESTION: Now, before I wrote an opinion
 23 signing on to that, I'd like to see a brief. 
 24 MR. DUKE: Nor has it --
 25 QUESTION: I'd like everybody to --

41
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DUKE: Nor has it held otherwise.
 2 QUESTION: What? 
 3 MR. DUKE: Nor has it held otherwise.
 4 QUESTION: Fine. But before I decide something
 5 like that, I'd like to have everyone present their point
 6 of view. I actually read the briefs. I'm interested in
 7 both sides. And -- and suddenly to decide it in this
 8 case, what would you suggest we do? I'm not going to
 9 decide something like that myself without having it fully
 10 briefed. And -- and so, what would you suggest we do with
 11 this case? 
 12 MR. DUKE: Then -- then I urge the Court to at
 13 least reserve the issue of what is the appropriate right
 14 to counsel in a serious offense where, as in this case,
 15 the defendant has a constitutional right to jury trial.
 16 Let me just briefly quote Justice Powell, joined
 17 by then Justice Rehnquist, on the following proposition. 
 18 Wherever the right to counsel line is to be drawn, it must
 19 be drawn so that an indigent has a right to appointed
 20 counsel in all cases where there's a right to a jury
 21 trial. If there is no accompanying right to counsel, the
 22 right to a jury trial becomes meaningless. No Justice of
 23 this Court, so far as I know, in the last 40 years has
 24 disagreed with that proposition. 
 25 QUESTION: But the jury trial line is 6 months'

42
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 imprisonment, isn't it? 
 2 MR. DUKE: Yes.
 3 QUESTION: And here, under Argersinger, it could
 4 be 1 day. 
 5 MR. DUKE: Argersinger dealt with a stop-gap
 6 issue about where there's no right to a jury trial, can we
 7 deny counsel, and Argersinger said no, not if you send the
 8 person to prison because that's the basic due process
 9 proposition. There's no -- it's not a criminal
 10 prosecution under the Sixth Amendment. It's a due process
 11 issue as in Powell against Alabama. It's fundamentally
 12 unfair to send somebody to prison without giving him a
 13 lawyer. 
 14 With respect to the -- the argument that Mr.
 15 Fried makes, that this is essentially a little bit of an
 16 extension of Nichols, there's no way that a -- the
 17 sentence in this case could be activated, imposed without,
 18 in effect, holding that the defendant can be sent to jail,
 19 convicted of a crime and sent to jail, without providing
 20 him a lawyer. This Court --
 21 QUESTION: Well, it doesn't follow that he could
 22 be sent to jail without providing him a lawyer in the
 23 subsequent proceeding. 
 24 MR. DUKE: Yes, but --
 25 QUESTION: I mean, in Nichols, after all, we had

43
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 another conviction, and we had a lawyer representing the
 2 individual when the question came up whether the first
 3 conviction should be considered and so on. And that may
 4 well be so, let's say, on -- on Mr. Fried's view. There
 5 would be a subsequent proceeding, and there would at least
 6 -- this is not a position he's arguing for this morning,
 7 but it would be consistent with his position that counsel
 8 be provided in that subsequent proceeding. 
 9 MR. DUKE: Yes, but the crucial difference is
 10 that the defendant under this proceeding that Mr. Fried is
 11 -- is urging the Court to approve -- the defendant would
 12 be sent to jail without his guilt ever being determined in
 13 a criminal trial in which he was represented by counsel. 
 14 Never. 
 15 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Duke. 
 16 General Pryor, you have 6 minutes remaining.
 17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. PRYOR, JR.
 18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 19 MR. PRYOR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
 20 QUESTION: General, what was the -- assuming
 21 that Mr. Fried's position is adopted by the Court, what is
 22 the maximum time that the Alabama trial judge could
 23 sentence the violator to? What's the maximum time in
 24 prison?
 25 MR. PRYOR: The suspended sentence was 30 days,

44
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Justice Kennedy.
 2 QUESTION: The suspended sentence of 30 days.
 3 MR. PRYOR: That's -- that's correct. 
 4 QUESTION: Can I ask you before --
 5 MR. PRYOR: Yes, Justice Breyer. 
 6 QUESTION: There are -- at the bottom line of
 7 the Alabama Supreme Court has two phrases in it. The
 8 first one, it says, we reverse that aspect of his sentence
 9 imposing 30 days of suspended jail time. We reverse. 
 10 MR. PRYOR: Right. 
 11 QUESTION: Then it goes to say, we tell
 12 everybody to the trial court vacate that aspect which
 13 imposed the suspended jail time. Those are two things. 
 14 We reverse and we tell them to vacate. 
 15 As to the first, we reverse that aspect, the
 16 State of Alabama agrees because they were there arguing in
 17 the Alabama Supreme Court that a real suspended sentence
 18 that meant something could be imposed, and here you're
 19 saying it's not a real sentence because we can never carry
 20 it out. So, am I right in thinking it's the second part
 21 that you disagree with and not the first part? 
 22 MR. PRYOR: We're trying to make sense, as we
 23 understand it, of -- of the application of the rule of
 24 actual imprisonment. And I will acknowledge Mr. Fried may
 25 be right, and if so, we would welcome that. But our

45
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 understanding of Argersinger and Scott is we cannot
 2 activate the suspended sentence --
 3 QUESTION: I'm not really asking about your -- I
 4 just want to know if you agree or you disagree with their
 5 part which says we reverse that aspect of the sentence.
 6 MR. PRYOR: No. No, Justice Breyer, I don't
 7 agree with that. And -- and the reason I don't agree with
 8 that is because Mr. Mills said something that I think is
 9 correct when he said that the Alabama Supreme Court struck
 10 only the suspended sentence and based only on Federal law,
 11 and what I contend is a misapprehension of Federal law.
 12 But the suspended sentence itself is not a sham. It's a
 13 device to allow the court to impose probation, which is at
 14 a minimum then fully enforceable through the same power
 15 that's available to the -- to any court to enforce any
 16 judgment, including a mere fine, which Mr. Mills concedes
 17 does not trigger a right to court-appointed counsel.
 18 Now, I wanted to address one of the concerns
 19 raised by Justice Souter as to the practicality. There
 20 are some aspects -- some statistics we know as to the
 21 practicalities that are helpful, but I will admit we don't
 22 know everything that we need to know. We know that there
 23 are approximately 115,000 misdemeanors each year in the
 24 State of Alabama. Those are addressed in our reply brief,
 25 the yellow brief. We know that approximately 25,000 of

46
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 those result in supervised probation. We don't know from
 2 the administrative office of courts in Alabama how many
 3 result in unsupervised probation. 
 4 We also know in Alabama -- this is not addressed
 5 in our brief, but I checked it with -- with information in
 6 State government -- that between -- there are between
 7 2,100 and 2,200 attorneys in Alabama who accept court-
 8 appointed work. Unfortunately, the fact that we don't
 9 know is how many of these cases, whether supervised or
 10 unsupervised probation and in misdemeanor cases, involve
 11 indigent defendants. But I hope that's at least somewhat
 12 helpful. 
 13 QUESTION: Let me ask you one more question. 
 14 And I -- I don't imagine your statistics show this, but I
 15 want to pass it up. Out of the 115, do we know, A, how
 16 many of those were fine-only cases, not suspended
 17 sentences, but fine-only cases, and B, how many of those
 18 were motor vehicle cases? 
 19 MR. PRYOR: Were -- were?
 20 QUESTION: Were motor vehicle cases because the
 21 motor vehicle cases take you out of this problem, I
 22 assume, in fine situations because if the fine isn't paid,
 23 the motor vehicle -- I mean, the -- the motor vehicle laws
 24 simply provide a -- a purely civil administrative means of
 25 -- of remedying the problem. And if they are a

47
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 substantial part of the 115, then the -- the fear of what
 2 this will do, in fact, is somewhat -- the Alabama Supreme
 3 Court's view is -- is somewhat lessened. Do you know
 4 those numbers?
 5 MR. PRYOR: No, I don't. But -- but I do know
 6 that 2,100 lawyers to take -- when we have 25,000
 7 supervised probation and some number in excess of that of
 8 unsupervised probation, still means that it's a daunting
 9 task. 
 10 Justice Ginsburg, the point that you raised
 11 about the cost of counsel not being incurred by more
 12 affluent defendants I think is relevant from this
 13 standpoint, when you consider that it is reasonable then
 14 for the State to preserve its own resources, just as a
 15 more affluent defendant would -- would preserve its
 16 resources not to incur the cost of counsel in this kind of
 17 circumstance. 
 18 As to the argument that Argersinger would
 19 require the trial judge to inform the defendant that a
 20 sentence of imprisonment will not be imposed because
 21 counsel is not being appointed, that is not what
 22 Argersinger or Scott require. Argersinger and Scott
 23 merely deprive the trial court of that remedy upon
 24 conviction, but there's no requirement that the defendant
 25 be informed of that. 

48
 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 As to Mr. Duke's argument that -- that there's a
 2 distinction made in those decisions between petty and
 3 serious offenses, it's -- it's simply not there, and --
 4 and this is a misdemeanor case. It's clearly a criminal
 5 proceeding where the defendant not only enjoyed a Sixth
 6 Amendment right to retain counsel, but the record shows
 7 that he clearly understood that right to retain counsel.
 8 Thank you.
