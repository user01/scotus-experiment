1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in No. 04-1350, KSR International versus Teleflex, 5 Incorporated. 6 Mr. Dabney. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. DABNEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 This case concerns a very broadly worded 12 patent claim, claim 4 of the Engelgau patent, that the 13 Solicitor General and the United States Patent and 14 Trademark Office have both told this Court is invalid 15 under Section 103 of the Patent Act and was issued in 16 error. The Federal Circuit's vacatur of summary 17 judgment in this case is grounded in a judicially 18 devised test that is fundamentally inconsistent with -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask, if that's the 20 position of the PTO, why aren't they proceeding to 21 cancel the patent? 22 MR. DABNEY: The case is in litigation at 23 this point, Justice Ginsburg, and in patent litigation 24 district courts are vested with authority and this 25 Court is vested with authority to render a judgment of

1 invalidity under Section 282 of the Patent Act. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is, you 3 say the PTO has recognized that it issued this patent, 4 that it's an invalid issuance. So why aren't they 5 curing their own mistakes, never mind what a court is 6 going to do? 7 MR. DABNEY: Well, there is the possibility 8 of director- initiated re-examination of patents as 9 certainly an administrative remedy that does exist. But 10 where a case is in pending litigation such as this, the 11 traditional way that these disputes are resolved is for 12 a court to apply the law to the facts and render a 13 judgment on a defense of invalidity which has been 14 pleaded to the plaintiff's claim of patent infringement 15 in this case. This issue arises in the context of a 16 defense pleaded to a claim for patent infringement and 17 I'm not sure that the Patent Office really could swoop 18 in and cut off the plaintiff's claim in the manner Your 19 Honor is suggesting. 20 The Federal Circuit in this case applied the 21 approach it's applied in previous cases, which is a 22 categorical approach. The Federal Circuit says that no 23 matter what might be the nature of an alleged invention 24 or improvement, no matter how broad might be a claim 25 made in an issued patent, no matter how small might be

1 the difference between a patent claim and prior art, and 2 no matter how modest might have been the degree of skill 3 needed to devise subject matter described by a patent 4 claim, the Federal Circuit says regardless of any or all 5 of that a court of the United States can never, ever 6 sustain a defense of invalidity under Section 103 of the 7 Patent Act except in a very limited and narrowly defined 8 circumstance. 9 That circumstance is a record that includes 10 clear and convincing evidence, that yields a jury 11 verdict or specific finding showing what the Federal 12 Circuit calls a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to 13 combine prior art teachings in the particular manner 14 claimed by the patent at issue. The decision in this 15 case treats Section 103 not, as this Court has said, as 16 a codification of a condition for patentability whose 17 benchmark is skill and ingenuity. The decision in this 18 case treats section 1 as implementing a supposed 19 entitlement to patent protection that a court -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're talking about in 21 this case. 22 MR. DABNEY: Yes. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're talking about what 24 the law should be. Would you make, be making the same 25 argument if we were looking at the most recent decisions

1 of the Federal Circuit, the ones that they issued within 2 the year, and each as I remember they held that the 3 patent was obvious and therefore invalid? Suppose we 4 were dealing in what was, the cases were, what were 5 they, Kahn, Alpha, and Diestar? 6 MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, what the Federal 7 Circuit has done in recent times has been after a 8 certiorari was granted in this case to erect a series of 9 escape devices from what is otherwise a categorical test 10 that must be imposed in all cases. As a practical 11 matter the Federal Circuit still characterizes as an 12 issue of fact for determination by a jury the presence 13 or absence of teaching, suggestion, or motivation, and 14 so these seemingly remedial steps that have been taken 15 by the Federal Circuit do not materially affect the 16 problem that's praised by this case, which is the well 17 nigh impossibility nowadays of being able to have an 18 efficient, inexpensive, quick and predictable 19 determination of whether claimed subject matter meets 20 the statutory standard. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: But what is the difference 22 between asking whether something is implicit in the, in 23 the prior art and simply asking whether it would have 24 been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art? 25 MR. DABNEY: The statute and this Court's
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 precedents make the benchmark of patentability skill, 2 what degree of skill is needed to devise subject matter 3 in respect to an objectively defined problem, objective 4 looking at the claim and looking at the prior art? What 5 the Federal Circuit is talking about now is an inquiry 6 into motivation, not skill. Those two are very 7 different concepts. There is not a word in this Court's 8 precedents that says that whether a patent should be 9 granted or not depends on whether a hypothetical person 10 had hypothetical motivation to do what everybody knows 11 he could do. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the 13 reason that the Federal Circuit has devised this 14 additional test or gloss on Graham is that they say 15 obviousness is, it's deceptive in hindsight. In 16 hindsight everybody says, I could have thought of that; 17 and that you need -- if you don't have the sort of 18 constraint that their test imposes, it's going to be too 19 easy to say that everything was obvious. 20 MR. DABNEY: Well, the Court, Mr. Chief 21 Justice, the Court needs to be very clear what is meant 22 by the term "hindsight." If by hindsight is meant 23 looking at what's claimed now, the subject matter sought 24 to be patented, and comparing that to the prior art, to 25 call that analytical process improper hindsight is to
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 make a frontal assault on the statute itself. If by 2 hindsight means to posit a desired result, a clay 3 doorknob, and to ask whether more skill and ingenuity 4 than were required by ordinary skill in the art was 5 needed to do that, to say that that constitutes improper 6 hindsight is to make a frontal assault on the entire 7 body of this Court's precedents construing section 103 8 and its common law predecessors. 9 With regard to the kind of bias Your Honor 10 is talking about, this Court's precedents provide a 11 wealth of mechanisms for protecting against that, 12 including the statement towards the end of the Graham 13 opinion, which is the only source of the word 14 "hindsight" that I've seen cited in the amici brief, 15 which was a discussion of the secondary consideration. 16 So that in a case like Goodyear against Rayovac there's 17 an excellent case where the claimed subject matter seems 18 so simple in hindsight. This was a case decided by this 19 Court in 1944. A leakproof battery that had been a 20 problem that had defied solution for years and there was 21 all kinds of motivation to solve it, and the fact that 22 it was not solved was considered important by this Court 23 in sustaining the validity of the patent in that case, 24 which claimed nothing more than a sheet metal sheath 25 wrapped around the electrodes and materials generated in

1 the battery. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: I can understand, I think, 3 what a teaching is. I take it a teaching is you put all 4 the prior art -- that's what I guess that's what Judge 5 Rich explained, which I thought was very enlightening to 6 me in I can't remember the name of the case, Wigmore, 7 Winsmore -8 MR. DABNEY: Winslow. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Winslow. You put it all 10 around the room. All right, we've got it all around the 11 room, and I begin to look at it and if I see over that 12 it somehow teaches me to combine these two things, if it 13 says, Breyer, combine this and that, that's a teaching 14 and then it's obvious. Now, maybe it doesn't have the 15 teaching, it just has the suggestion. Maybe it says, we 16 suggest you combine this or that; okay, then it's 17 obvious. But I don't understand, though I've read it 18 about 15 or 20 times now, it though I've read it about 19 15 or 20 times now, I just don't understand what is 20 meant by the term "motivation." 21 MR. DABNEY: Well, the best I think anybody 22 could do would be to look at the opinion in this case 23 and try to figure that out. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: I tried. You've read a lot 25 of cases. You're a patent lawyer, and so what is the
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 understanding as best you have it of what is just meant 2 by the term "motivation"? To be more specific, if they 3 mean motivated to go look to the prior art, well, 4 anybody would want to look in the prior art. If I want 5 to invent something I'll look anywhere. I'll look to 6 the prior art. I'll look to the Library of Congress. 7 I'll look to my cousin. I mean, I'll look wherever I 8 can find it. So they can't mean that, and if they don't 9 mean that what do they mean? 10 MR. DABNEY: Well, in this case what the 11 respondents is Mr. Engelgau would have had no motivation 12 to look to the Asano-designed pedal because he was 13 trying to meet the requirements of Fort Motor Company 14 and Asano would not have met those requirements and 15 therefore Mr. Engelgau would have had no motivation to 16 start with Asano. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Say that again? You 18 wouldn't have a motivation to look to the prior art to 19 find your problem. What's an example where you have a 20 motivation distinguishing you from everybody else? I 21 mean, everybody has a motivation to look to the prior 22 art. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You disagree with the 24 motivation test. 25 MR. DABNEY: Yes.

DABNEY: I respectfully suggest -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have a 7 motive to answer that question right away. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, that's fine. 9 MR. DABNEY: I believe if you study 10 carefully this Court's precedence, including Graham 11 itself and just about every other case this Court has 12 ever decided, what this Court has said is the measure, 13 what our society agreed to pay off on is subject matter 14 that reflects a certain degree of skill. And this Court 15 has rejected time and time again the notion that someone 16 who was the first simply to take advantage of the known 17 capability of technology was entitled to a patent. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would it be, would 19 it be inadvisable for us to say the motive test teaches 20 us something important; it has a valuable place; it's 21 just not the exclusive test for what's obvious. 22 MR. DABNEY: Certainly. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do we have to reject it 24 all out of -- out of hand? 25 MR. DABNEY: The -- the presence or absence

1 of motivation to devise something. 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Motivation in this special 3 sense. 4 MR. DABNEY: Well, I'm not sure it is in a 5 special sense. What the Federal Circuit has done is 6 has, it has attributed controlling significance to what 7 is in most cases at best a factor, and in fact is 8 nothing more than a legal argument about the preemptive 9 effect of prior art. The motivation debate in this case 10 is all about what is the preemptive legal effect of the 11 Asano reference. It either invalidates the claim -12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, but, but my question 13 is does it not serve to show us at least one way in 14 which there can be obviousness? 15 MR. DABNEY: I would agree that if there is 16 -17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It may not be the 18 exclusive test. We're -- I'm asking what the test ought 19 to be. 20 MR. DABNEY: Well, the test, I mean in this 21 case, the specific claim at issue in this case is very 22 analogous to the claim that this Court considered in the 23 Anderson's-Black Rock case. What we have in this case 24 is no dispute as to any of the factual inquiries that 25 have traditionally defined patent validity analysis.

1 The prior art that we rely on, it's undisputed that it's 2 prior art and it's in the record. The level of skill is 3 undisputed. The quantum of difference between the 4 claimed subject matter and the prior art is undisputed. 5 The only issue in this case is what legal consequences 6 follow from that. What question do you ask to decide 7 whether or not that difference adds up to a patentable 8 invention? 9 It's very analogous to what was going on in 10 the Anderson's-Black Rock case. Anderson's-Black Rock 11 was a case like this in which someone had invented a 12 radiant heat burner and the patentee in that case had 13 seen that there was a market for using that by attaching 14 it to an asphalt spreader. So the patent claim in that 15 case was taking someone else's invention, the radiant 16 heat burner and hanging it on a standard painting 17 apparatus and using it for its, one of its marketable 18 purposes. 19 This Court held in this, in the 20 Anderson's-Black Rock case that the patentee had not 21 done anything patentable in that case. All he had done 22 was take a burner that functioned as a burner, and a 23 spreader that functioned as a spreader, and the two 24 components did not affect one another's operation at 25 all. It was in the parlance of this Court's precedents,

I 5 -- like Justice Breyer, I don't understand what the 6 motivation -- motivation element is. How would you have 7 applied the -8 MR. DABNEY: Well, if the patentee in that 9 case -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: He had no particular 11 motivation to use that earlier patent, did he? 12 MR. DABNEY: Well, actually in that case 13 there actually was quite a story. In that case there 14 was a story that for years and years you'd had this cold 15 joint problem of laying successive courses of asphalt 16 blacktop, and -- and this guy actually saw something 17 that was interesting, that you could use this radiant 18 heat burner to solve the asphalt blacktop problem. That 19 was not what he claimed, though. 20 What he claimed was an apparatus that just 21 had these two things together, and they didn't interact 22 with one another any more than if they had been both put 23 in the same shopping bag. And that's what we have in 24 this case. We have an adjustable pedal assembly that 25 does whatever --

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. No. It took 2 from 10 years to go from -- I think 10 years from Asano 3 to Engelgau, so it must have been not all that obvious. 4 MR. DABNEY: Well, the, on this record, and 5 even if you take at face value what's said in the 6 respondent's brief in this case, which is very largely 7 not based on the record, the story is, from Mr. Engelgau 8 is, Fort Motor Company had a particular requirement and 9 Mr. Engelgau sat down to design to it. He to design a 10 pedal that had would meet Ford's requirements and one 11 way that he did that was to come up with the kind of 12 pedal assembly that's shown in the figures of the 13 patent. 14 But we are not here talking about the 15 patentability of the figures of the patent. We are not 16 talking about the patentability of claims 1, 2 or 3 of 17 the patent; we are talking about claim 4 in which these 18 respondents got a little greedy. Claim 4 describes 19 almost nothing -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you, do you concede -21 do you concede that claims 1 through 3 are valid? 22 MR. DABNEY: We take no position on that. 23 They're not an issue in the case. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I had asked your 25 opinion as an expert would you --

1 (Laughter.) 2 MR. DABNEY: Well, Your Honor, with respect, 3 I would have no opinion on that question. 4 (Laughter.) 5 MR. DABNEY: I could stand here and make 6 arguments. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean it seems to 8 me that the whole argument that you're making as to Ford 9 is that anybody knows you could, you use an electronic 10 -- you have an electronic throttle, it serves a purpose; 11 the pedal serves a purpose; put the two together. 12 MR. DABNEY: Here's the -13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why doesn't -- don't 1, 2 14 and 3 do the same thing? 15 MR. DABNEY: Well, because -- because -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If they're invalid then I 17 have -- then I'm struggling to find what your test is. 18 MR. DABNEY: Here's the reason. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know what your 20 test is. 21 MR. DABNEY: Here's the reason. What's 22 shown in the figures of the Engelgau patent is an 23 adjustable pedal assembly that has a large bore tube 24 from which you suspended a pedal arm on a yoke, and it 25 slides back and forth along the tube. And that's the
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 way that it provides for adjustment. And in claims 1, 2 2 and 3 some of that structure is recited. So those 3 claims would not necessarily be invalid by the Asano 4 reference because the Asana adjustment mechanism doesn't 5 use a tube, and doesn't use a yoke; it uses pins and 6 slots and it provides adjustment by a different 7 mechanism. The respondents have not asserted claims 1, 8 2 and 3 in this case because those claims don't describe 9 anything remotely like the petitioner's pedals. They 10 limited their claim to claim 4 because only by claiming 11 this enormous verbal abstraction that is claim 4 can 12 they make a colorable claim of patent infringement 13 against the petitioner in this case. 14 So I would respectfully submit that the 15 Court does not need to decide whether 1, 2 or 3 would be 16 valid but the point would be, the question would be what 17 we did in the Hotchkiss case or in the Anderson's-Black 18 Rock case or any of these cases. Would it have required 19 more than ordinary skill to devise that claim structure 20 with those additional structural limitations to solve 21 some objectively defined problem, and that hasn't been 22 litigated or briefed. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Going back to the asphalt 24 case, were you suggesting that if they had made a claim 25 for a process patent, that it might have been valid?

HUNGAR 8 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 9 SUPPORTING PETITIONER 10 MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 11 and may it please the Court. 12 Construed as the sole means of proving 13 obviousness the teaching suggestion motivation test is 14 contrary to the Patent Act, irreconcilable with this 15 Court's precedents and bad policy. It asks the wrong 16 question and in cases like this one, it produces the 17 wrong answer. It should be rejected and the judgment of 18 the Court of Appeals should be reversed. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you 20 understand motivation to refer to in that test? 21 MR. HUNGAR: Well, it's not entirely clear, 22 Your Honor. I think that it's sometimes difficult to 23 distinguish, certainly between motivation and 24 suggestion. One way in which it is used for example, is 25 if there were some indication in the prior art that
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 doing something a certain way might save money and then 2 there would be a motivation to save money, which might 3 supply the requisite motivation for combining the two 4 prior art references. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that in that 6 context it would serve a valid purpose, i.e., can we -7 that is to say, can we keep the motivation test and then 8 supplement it with other, with other means of, other 9 ways of showing obviousness? 10 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. We agree that 11 teaching suggestion and motivation are valid means of 12 proving obviousness, valid considerations for the Court. 13 And this Court's precedents are entirely consistent with 14 that. A number of cases cited by respondent show that 15 the Court has looked to suggestion as a means to 16 determining whether a patent is obvious. 17 The problem with the Federal Circuit's test 18 is it makes that the exclusive test and precludes 19 obviousness determinations in the absence of 20 satisfaction of that test which this Court's precedents 21 are clearly not consistent with. In fact in Graham 22 itself, in the Sakraida case, in Dann against Johnston, 23 lower courts had held patents valid because of a lack of 24 suggestion. This Court reversed without requiring or 25 even addressing the question whether there was some
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 explicit principle that had been proven by the party 2 challenging the patent, by clear evidence that there was 3 such a teaching suggestion motivation. It's just 4 foreign to this Court's precedents as a mandatory 5 prerequisite for obviousness. 6 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you make of the, 7 sort of the revolution argument that whether it's 8 contrary or intention with, in fact the, it's been 9 applied in what is now the Fed Circuit for what, 20 10 years, more than 20 years I guess. And to tip it over 11 now is going to produce chaos. What's the answer to 12 that? 13 MR. HUNGAR: Well, several things, Your 14 Honor. First of all, of course, there can be no 15 legitimate reliance in lower court precedent that's 16 contrary to Supreme Court precedent, and it was an open 17 secret in the patent bar that the approach being taken 18 by the Federal Circuit was inconsistent with cases such 19 as this Court's Sakraida decision. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I realize there's 21 been comment on it, but guess I'm -- I'm raising the 22 question that comes up in the old motto. I mean, if the 23 error is common enough and long enough, the error 24 becomes the law. And in effect is that what we are 25 confronted with here?

1 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. I just think 2 it would be dangerous proposition for this Court to 3 endorse that line of argumentation but even leaving that 4 aside, it's not justified here on the facts. And this 5 patent is a good example. No one is suggesting that 6 claims 1 through 3 are invalid; the problem here is that 7 claim 4 sweeps so broadly, so much broader than what the 8 applicant in fact invented, that it sweeps in obvious 9 manifestations. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but -- if we see it 11 your way, are there going to be 100,000 cases filed 12 tomorrow morning? 13 MR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor. 14 What we are talking about here are claims at the outer 15 boundaries of patentability, even under the Federal 16 Circuit's test. And in those cases there will no doubt 17 be some claims, such as the claim in this case that can 18 be resolved at summary judgment by a court, that the 19 court can simply determine as a matter of law, it's 20 obvious. Whereas under the Federal Circuit's test it 21 has to go to a jury and the somewhat unpredictable, at 22 the least -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, this is the 24 problem that I have with your test. I think I 25 understand you right, now, just to say teaching
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 suggestion motivation has its place; it's okay; but it 2 shouldn't be the exclusive test. 3 MR. HUNGAR: Correct. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what I understand 5 your brief to say is that it has to be supplemented with 6 what you have called, you've labelled "sufficiently 7 innovative." And then I begin to think well, what's 8 "sufficiently innovative?" How is a trier supposed to 9 know if something -- in other words I think what you're 10 suggesting as a supplement is rather vague. 11 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I think the 12 "sufficiently innovative" is more of a description 13 rather than a test; it's a description of what this 14 Court said in Graham. In Graham itself the Court laid 15 out the proper analysis which is you need to consider in 16 detail, not in the more cursory fashion that the Federal 17 Circuit's test encourages, but in detail the 18 capabilities of a person of ordinary skill and the 19 content of the prior art and the differences between the 20 prior art and the invention, and ascertain -- it's 21 ultimately a legal judgment informed by those detailed 22 factual inquiries, whether it is obvious or nonobvious 23 and entitled to patent protection. 24 And in addition I would point out that this 25 Court in Sakraida provided a framework for assessing
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 patents like this one, where each of the elements is set 2 forth in the prior art and each of the elements in the 3 claimed invention is merely performing its already 4 known, previously known function as set forth in the 5 prior art. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hungar, I have a 7 question that's sort of along the lines of Justice 8 Ginsburg's. It isn't just the Federal Circuit that has 9 been applying this test. It's also the Patent Office 10 and it's been following the Federal Circuit's test for 11 20 years or so. 12 What, what is -- assuming that we sweep that 13 test aside and say it's been incorrect, what happens to 14 the presumption of validity of, of patents which the 15 courts have been, have been traditionally applying? 16 Does it make any sense to presume that patents are valid 17 which have been issued under an erroneous test for the 18 last 20 years? 19 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I think that it 20 would make sense because the statute requires it, and as 21 a practical matter it shouldn't make any difference, 22 because the only category of cases in which the result 23 would change under our test is the category in which as 24 a matter of law, in light of the factual issues that are 25 required under Graham, as a matter of law the Court
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 concludes that the difference between the claimed 2 invention and the prior art is so trivial that it cannot 3 be given the protection of a patent. And in those 4 circumstances the presumption doesn't come into play. 5 It's a legal determination; the presumption has been 6 understood to effect the burden of proof, and in the 7 Federal Circuit's view the measure of the burden of 8 proof requiring clear and convincing evidence on the 9 underlying factual considerations, not the ultimate 10 legal determination. 11 But one of the problems with the Federal 12 Circuit's test is that it transforms what this Court 13 made clear in Graham is supposed to be a legal 14 determination. Ultimately it transforms it into a jury 15 question. Because in a case like this one where you 16 have as conclusory affidavits from respondent's experts 17 saying "oh, this would not have been obvious." And that 18 in the Court of Appeals view is enough to create a jury 19 question and then you then have to role the dice in 20 front of a jury in each one of these cases, except of 21 course the many cases in which the challenger can't meet 22 the teaching suggestion motivation test at all and 23 simply is unable to challenge the validity of the 24 patent, notwithstanding this Court's holding in Graham 25 that it's ultimately a legal determination -- admittedly
24

1 one informed by detailed factual inquiries. 2 Another problem with the Federal Circuit's 3 test is that it devalues and de-emphasizes the statutory 4 focus and this Court's focus in Graham on the 5 capabilities of the person of ordinary skill. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well when you talk 7 about the statutory focus, your innovation test -- I 8 mean, do you regard that, is that a legal conclusion of 9 nonobviousness? Or is it an additional test beyond what 10 the statute requires? 11 MR. HUNGAR: We haven't suggested an 12 innovation test, Your Honor. We were simply attempting 13 to describe in perhaps imprecise terms the holding of 14 this Court in Graham, and the holding of this Court in 15 Graham is that the ultimate inquiry for the court, 16 obviously suggestion, teaching, motivation, teaching a 17 way in the prior art, all of these are factual, 18 subsidiary factual issues that will shed light and a 19 great deal of light on the ultimate question in each 20 particular case, but ultimately the question for the 21 court is whether in light of all those underlying 22 factual showings the differences between the claimed 23 invention and the prior art are sufficient to, that they 24 would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in 25 the art. And that ultimately is a legal determination,

1 you can refer to that as sufficiently innovative to 2 justify a patent, but the ultimate question, the 3 ultimate test is the one set forth in the statute and in 4 the Graham decision. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case, would there 6 have been anything for a jury under your test? 7 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because in this 8 case it is perfectly clear that it would have been 9 obvious for a person of ordinary skill to take the Asano 10 patent, add the sensor, the electronic sensor in a 11 manner that that off-the-shelf sensor is designed to be 12 added, and voila, you have a winning combination. 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about claims 1, 2 and 14 3? 15 MR. HUNGAR: I don't know, Your Honor. 16 Those have not been litigated. Those have additional 17 limitations that are not present in claim 4 that, 18 depending on what the prior art might reveal about 19 those, we have no way of knowing whether they would or 20 would not be obvious because obviously, that question 21 has not been litigated. Certainly there is nothing in 22 the record in this case that would suggest they are 23 obvious. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the experts? 25 You said this was obvious and this should have, not have
26

1 gotten very far. But there were two experts, were there 2 not, who made declarations, that had all kinds of 3 credentials, and they called it elegant, novel and 4 nonobvious. 5 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. There are two 6 problems with that. Number one, the conclusory 7 assertion that an invention is nonobvious, just like the 8 assertion that it's obvious from an expert, should have 9 no weight because of course -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well these, these were 11 declarants who gave a whole declaration. They didn't 12 just say that bottom line. 13 MR. HUNGAR: But again, it's a legal 14 question. And moreover and more importantly, the 15 problem with the Court of Appeals analysis, one problem, 16 and with the experts' analysis, is that they're focusing 17 on the narrow definition of the quote unquote problem by 18 looking only at what this particular inventor was trying 19 to solve, but the scope of the claim is far broader. 20 Thank you. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 22 Mr. Hungar.

1 Justice, and may it please the Court: 2 I think the Court will want to have 3 available to it the red brief and also this big, which 4 is the supplemental joint appendix which has some of the 5 patents in it, and I'm going to quote from both of them. 6 I think you can't understand what motivation means and 7 what the whole test that the Federal Circuit is 8 employing means -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're right about that. 10 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- without -11 (Laughter.) 12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- without starting from the 13 statute itself. And so I want to start with the 14 statutory text and use that as the jumping off point 15 like the Court of Appeals has for the inquiry that it's 16 asking. It's reproduced at page 21 of the red brief. 17 And Congress said it's the first blocked quote, that a 18 patent may not be obtained though the invention is not 19 identically disclosed or described, as set forth in 20 Section 102 of this title. Those are the other 21 requirements for giving a patent. If the differences 22 between the subject matter sought to be patented and the 23 prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole 24 would have been obvious at the time the invention was 25 made to a person having ordinary skill in the art. So
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the term of art here is obvious, and the plain meaning 2 of obvious, if you understand that the outcome of this 3 case is obvious or if you think that the, what the 4 Federal Circuit means by its test is not obvious, is 5 something that's either apparent or not apparent, and 6 that's what the Federal Circuit is asking. It says 7 look, take the invention and see whether or not it was 8 apparent or not apparent, and what the Federal -- to a 9 person of ordinary skill at the time of the invention. 10 And what the Federal Circuit says is, we want to be 11 inclusive. 12 The other side takes these words, teaching, 13 suggestion, motivation, as if they were words of 14 limitation rather than these words of inclusion. And 15 what the Federal Circuit has said is what we mean by 16 teaching a suggestion or a motivation, and it can be 17 explicit or implicit, is anything that would have made 18 this invention apparent to a practitioner at the time. 19 That's what it's after. It wants to know, look, was it 20 apparent to someone else, a practitioner at the time of 21 the invention of Engelgau to take Asano and put the 22 electronic throttle control on pin -23 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if that's all it 24 means, why don't they say it? 25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: They do say that.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then what is this 2 word that confused me a lot, motivation? I found a lot 3 of enlightenment in Judge Rich's idea of taking all the 4 relevant art and putting it up around the room in 5 pictures. And then I thought, well, okay, if that art 6 teaches me to do what your client did, okay, it doesn't. 7 Does it suggest it? Not really. Well then, you say 8 motivated. Where does that get you? 9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I understand. Can I take 10 you to their, the Federal Circuit's answer? It's two 11 pages before the quote that I just gave you, page 19, 12 there's another blocked quote. The Federal Circuit has 13 explained what it's talking about when it means a 14 motivation. They say that they have repeatedly held 15 that there is an implicit motivation to combine. It 16 exists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from 17 the prior art as a whole, that's a teaching, but when 18 the improvement is technology independent and the 19 combination of references results in a product or 20 process. And these are common motivations. You would 21 do it because it's more desirable because it's stronger, 22 cheaper, faster, lighter, smaller, more durable, more 23 efficient. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: For who? For me? 25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: For a practitioner, yes.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: For me the inventor? 2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: I know that, because 4 otherwise -5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No. Justice Breyer, you 6 don't understand. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true. 8 (Laughter.) 9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The question is not -- I can 10 illustrate it with this case. The question is not do 11 you want more efficient pedals. If that's the test, 12 then everything is obvious because we always want more 13 efficient pedals, Justice, and I'll come back to this. 14 It's always going to be the case that if your test is 15 capability, every patent including the first three 16 claims of this one is going to be obvious, because 17 you're always capable of assembling a pedal. What it 18 says, what the Federal Circuit says, is there a 19 motivation to make this invention? Was there 20 motivation, and this was the heart of the Federal 21 Circuit's ruling in this case, their theory is that 22 Asano renders our patent obvious. And the Federal 23 Circuit said all right, what's the motivation to take 24 Asano and take the electronic throttle control and make 25 it responsive --
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the claim goes beyond 2 that. Your claim goes beyond the Asano combination and 3 in your brief you, you, you discuss the case as though 4 your, your limited claim 4 just relates to this 5 invention that you, you -- nobody would have thought of 6 using the Asano pedal in the Ford car given the limited 7 space available and so forth, and therefore, this was 8 really an invention. But that's not the claim. The 9 claim is simply combining the, any pedal, the Asano 10 pedal or any other one with the, with the automatic 11 electronic sensor. 12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: In a particular place, yes, 13 that's correct. Justice Scalia, the reason these 14 Federal Circuit judges were right notwithstanding your 15 correct point which is, just to be clear, our invention 16 is not limited to Asano. Our invention takes any fixed 17 pivot adjustable pedal and any electronic throttle 18 control and says combine it in a particular way. The 19 Federal Circuit's point is their motion rests on Asano. 20 The other side's theory is, we've got this 21 invention, Engelgau. As has been pointed out, nobody 22 did anything like this for 10 years. The other side 23 comes back and says yes, that it would have been obvious 24 to somebody who had an Asano to do the same thing 25 basically. And so the Federal Circuit said okay, show
32

1 us. If this isn't going to be hindsight, where we just 2 give you the invention and you just say oh, I could have 3 done that, they say give us any evidence that someone 4 would have done what you say, which is take Asano, it's 5 their argument, Asano -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: But why Asano? 7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: You'll have to ask them, 8 Justice Scalia. They filed a motion that it was 9 obvious. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're the one that's 11 standing up here making that argument. They're not 12 doing it. 13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, the patent 14 examiner gave us a patent, initially rejected this 15 patent as obvious, decided that it wasn't after 16 considering all of these things, a statutory presumption 17 of validity attached under Section 282. So we have what 18 we say is clear and convincing evidence, the question 19 isn't presented here, but whatever. The other side 20 comes in and tries to knock our patent out. They file a 21 motion, and the motion rests on a piece of prior art. 22 And so what the Federal Circuit said is, if we're not 23 going to knock all of these patents out by hindsight, 24 all we want to know is one thing and you know, on 25 remand, they may well be able to prove it. We don't
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 think they can. But all it's asking for is for the 2 district court to make a finding that says the other 3 side is right, that it would have been obvious to take 4 Asano, which is their only example, and combine it with 5 electronic throttle control in this way. That is what's 6 so -7 JUSTICE BREYER: You look at that thing, you 8 think what this genius did, and I don't doubt that he's 9 a genius, is there are wheels that turn around. And the 10 wheels turn around to a fixed proportion to when you 11 make the accelerator go up and down. Now I think since 12 high school a person has known that if you have three 13 parts in a machine and they each move in a fixed ratio 14 one to the other, you can measure the speed of any part 15 by attaching a device to any other as long as you know 16 these elementary mathematics. I suppose it wasn't 17 Mr. Engelgau, it was probably Archimedes that figured 18 that one out. So he simply looks to something that 19 moves, and he sticks a sticker on it. 20 Now to me, I grant you I'm not an expert, 21 but it looks at about the same level as I have a sensor 22 on my garage door at the lower hinge for when the car is 23 coming in and out, and the raccoons are eating it. So I 24 think of the brainstorm of putting it on the upper 25 hinge, okay? Now I just think that how could I get a
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 patent for that, and that -- now that's very naive, 2 that's very naive. But the point is, I don't see what 3 we're talking about, and what is supposed to happen with 4 all these affidavits. And the -- the -- Mr. Asano 5 himself, I would think at some point when the Ford 6 company decides to switch to electronic throttles, of 7 course will have every motivation in the world to do 8 precisely what your client did, because he can't use 9 that thing that pulls back and forth anymore. Rather, 10 he has to get a little electronic cap and attach it to 11 something that moves in fixed proportion to the 12 accelerator going up and down. Now those are my whole 13 reactions when I saw this and I began to think it looks 14 pretty obvious. What's supposed to go on, I don't 15 understand it. 16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Let me answer it in a 17 few different ways because I want to again specify and 18 make clear what it is that the Federal Circuit says is 19 included within teaching, suggestions, motivations. 20 Then I want to turn to our invention and the affidavits 21 in the case. The Federal Circuit has said, and I'll 22 just -- you can come back to it for future reference. 23 It's recorded at the bottom of page 19 of our brief. 24 Common sense, common knowledge, common understandings 25 are all included within teaching, suggestions or

GOLDSTEIN: Yes, it did. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you have to be 7 defending what the Federal Circuit did in this case. 8 And the fact that they say well now, what this means is 9 really in some other case, that seems to me that's 10 really irrelevant. 11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: If I could just clarify, 12 Dystar -13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I think you should 14 tell us when the case has been decided after, I think it 15 has much less, much less weight. 16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, I agree 17 that you have to distinguish two things rightly. The 18 first is the state of the law as it exists now, and 19 that's what we ask you to affirm. And that is, the 20 Federal Circuit has made quite clear that its test is 21 inclusive, and we think that that establishes that it's 22 not necessary to add some new sort of undetermined test 23 of -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say its test is 25 inclusive. I would say its test is meaningless. They
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 have essentially said, our test simply reduces to what, 2 what your opponents in this litigation say. If you 3 think that's being inclusive, you know -- it doesn't add 4 anything whatever to -- to the -- to the question, would 5 a person of the ordinary skill in this field have 6 conceived of this idea. 7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, I disagree 8 for the following reasons, and that is: What the 9 Federal Circuit is saying is that any amount of 10 evidence, any form of evidence is relevant to answer a 11 particular question. We have a question that we want 12 answered. They have a question they want answered. 13 Their question, the petitioner at least, I'm not sure 14 about the Solicitor General, the petitioner's standard 15 is, was somebody capable of doing this? We have a 16 different question. Would it have been apparent to, and 17 that's what we think the text requires, would it have 18 been apparent to one skilled in the art? And so the 19 Federal Circuit is saying whatever evidence you want to 20 bring to bear -21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Don't you think there's a 22 grammatical difference in the meaning of the word 23 obvious and the meaning of the word apparent? 24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I don't. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying that the
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 question is whether it's obvious? 2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, that's right. And what 3 the Federal Circuit is saying, you have -- what it's 4 saying is, if you just look to capability, and that is, 5 could you put Asano together on pin 54, you will miss 6 the most important part of invention. And that is, 7 invention isn't at the end when you put the two things 8 together. Invention is finding the problem, deciding 9 what pieces of the prior art to use, and deciding how to 10 put them together. Everybody is always capable of, it 11 will always be the case, I think, that a practitioner of 12 the art can put them together. Remember the very point 13 of a patent, when you look at our patent at the end of 14 the case, we were required to explain it in great 15 detail. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but your -- the 17 Federal Circuit is saying that, the gist of it is if and 18 only if the previous patents taught this. But you, you 19 can look at these two devices, and you're a good 20 mechanic, you've never seen a patent, you've never read 21 these patents, you've never read these claims, you've 22 never been to the Supreme Court, and you put them 23 together. 24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, that's 25 not --
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the Federal Circuit 2 said oh, it's not in the patent, it's not obvious. 3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, with 4 respect, that is not a fair description of the Federal 5 Circuit's test, and I will take you to the language that 6 addressed this claim. It's at the bottom of page 18 of 7 our brief and also at the top of 19, and we quote the 8 Solicitor General's brief. The Solicitor General 9 asserts to the contrary, that Federal Circuit precedent 10 focuses attention exclusively on a search for teaching, 11 suggestions and motivations in the prior art. That is 12 not accurate. That was a quote from their brief. 13 Here is a quote from the Solicitor General. 14 It is from a new opinion of the Federal Circuit, but it 15 is quoting, it is citing a series of old opinions from 16 the Federal Circuit. Under our nonrigid motivation, 17 suggestion, teaching test, a suggestion to combine need 18 not be found in the prior art. And then there is the 19 blocked quote that I read to Justice Breyer about making 20 things cheaper, faster, lighter, common knowledge and 21 common sense. 22 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, once you define the 23 teaching, suggestion and motivation test that way so 24 that it can be implicit, it can be based on common 25 sense, I don't quite understand the difference between
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that and simply asking whether it's obvious. Could you 2 just explain what that adds? 3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, all that it adds is an 4 analytical framework. It's an elaboration. The word 5 "obvious" -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It adds a layer of 7 Federal Circuit jargon that lawyers can then bandy back 8 and forth, but if it's -- particularly if it's 9 nonexclusive, you can say you can meet our teaching, 10 suggestion, or motivation test or you can show that it's 11 nonobvious, it seems to me that it's worse than 12 meaningless because it complicates the inquiry rather 13 than focusing on the statute. 14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the 15 reason that the Federal Circuit disagrees and over 30 16 years this special court has elaborated this problem -17 these judges alone, for example, have heard 300 cases on 18 nonobviousness -- is that we need a guidance, we need 19 guidance for the lower courts. We need to focus them on 20 the right question, and for patent examiners and patent 21 practitioners, and the right question is not is -- was 22 someone merely capable of putting the two together. The 23 right question is is there any reason to believe that it 24 would have been apparent at the time of the invention to 25 create this invention whether it's through a teaching, a
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 suggestion, a motivation. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or anything else. 3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Or anything else. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why don't you say that? 5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: They have. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is -- I agree with the 7 Chief Justice. It is misleading to say that the whole 8 world is embraced within these three nouns, teaching, 9 suggestion, or motivation, and then you define teaching, 10 suggestion, or motivation to mean anything that renders 11 it nonobvious. This is gobbledygook. It really is, 12 it's irrational. 13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, I this it 14 would be surprising for this experienced Court and all 15 of the patent bar -- remember, every single major patent 16 bar association in the country has filed on our side -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which way does 18 that cut? That just indicates that this is profitable 19 for the patent bar. 20 (Laughter.) 21 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, it turns 22 out that actually is not accurate. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: It produces more patents, 24 which is what the patent bar gets paid for, to acquire 25 patents, not to get patent applications denied but to
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 get them granted. And the more you narrow the 2 obviousness standard to these three imponderable nouns, 3 the more likely it is that the patent will be granted. 4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, that is not 5 the point of these bar associations' either. These bar 6 associations, including the American Bar Association, 7 the American Intellectual Property Law Association, have 8 lawyers on both sides of all these cases. They're 9 looking for a test that has balance and that is what the 10 Federal Circuit has done. Now, let me just say -11 JUSTICE BREYER: As you know, we've had a 12 series of cases and in these series of cases we have 13 received many, many briefs from all kinds of 14 organizations and there are many from various parts of 15 the patent bar that defend very much what the Federal 16 circuit does and there are many from parts of the patent 17 bar and others who are saying basically that they've 18 leaned too far in the direction of never seeing a patent 19 they didn't like and that has unfortunate implications 20 for the economy. So if you're going to these very basic 21 deep issues, is there a reason for me to think, which I 22 do now think, that there is a huge argument going on in 23 those who are interested in patent as to whether there 24 is too much protectionism and not enough attention paid 25 to competition or whether it's about right, or whether
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it goes some other way. 2 In other words, your argument now suggests 3 all this is well settled, but I tend to think maybe it 4 isn't well settled and maybe it is a proper thing for us 5 to be involved in. So what are your views since you 6 brought it up? 7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, there is a 8 big debate over whether or not there is too much 9 patenting in this country and Congress is involved in 10 the debate. What I don't think that there is that much 11 debate about is whether a properly applied test that the 12 Federal Circuit has articulated strikes the right 13 balance, because that is why all of the patent bar 14 associations have filed on our side, I think, and that 15 is it takes account of the interests of both sides and 16 that is it says, you're right, we have to be concerned 17 about overpatenting, it says on the other hand we have 18 to be very concerned about hindsight determinations of 19 obviousness. 20 But I do want to just step back and make a 21 point about judicial administration. If the ultimate 22 conclusion of this Court is that teaching, suggestion, 23 motivation just boils down into an inquiry into 24 obviousness, I still think that an opinion that says 25 that and says that it, that this Court believes that it
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is embracing the bottom line of what the Federal Circuit 2 has been doing, is the one that will be much better for 3 the patent system and for the courts, because we have a 4 real concern and that was articulated -- asked about at 5 least by Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia, and that 6 is if you purport to change the rules unnecessarily, if 7 you say we're going off in a different direction, this 8 test has -- underlies 160,000 patents issued every year. 9 There is no rhyme or reason to applying a presumption of 10 validity if you're saying the patent examiner applied 11 the wrong test. And it will create genuine dramatic 12 instability. 13 The question I think is if you think instead 14 that the teaching, suggestion, motivation test is 15 incomplete, what is it that you want to add on top of 16 it, and that's really what I didn't understand from the 17 first half-hour. If it's going to be -18 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't have to go on 19 top. It's just to say what you've been saying, that 20 what you're supposed to look to ultimately is whether a 21 person, as the statute says, who is familiar with the 22 subject, of ordinary skill in the art, whether to such a 23 person this would have been obvious. Now, there are 24 many, and this Court has listed several, factors that 25 might count in favor of it not being obvious, such as
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 people have been trying to do it for a long time and 2 they haven't been able to figure out how. That's a good 3 one, and there are some other ones here. If there's a 4 teaching right there, it seems to cut the other way. 5 But to hope to have a nonexclusive list 6 seems to me a little bit like Holmes trying to hope to 7 have an exclusive list of what counts as negligence. In 8 the law we have many standards that you can get clues 9 about, but you can't absolutely define them, and why 10 isn't this one of them? 11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I think 12 that's the dilemma that the Federal Circuit has been 13 facing and is in answer to the criticism of Justice 14 Scalia and that is the Federal Circuit isn't trying to 15 articulate every single possible thing that can show you 16 that it is obvious. What it's trying to do is focus you 17 on the right question. It's trying to say, here's the 18 process of invention: We have to figure out there's a 19 problem. We have to figure out what prior art you're 20 going to use. You have to figure out how you're going 21 to combine it, and then you actually combine it. 22 The act of invention, the thing that is the 23 discovery that we want to encourage, is there in the 24 middle. It's picking out the prior art and deciding how 25 to put it together.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Supposing we then were to 2 say exactly what this Court already said, that the 3 standard here is obvious, we list a few of these 4 additional factors that they've thrown in, and just as 5 the Court said before, all these additional factors are 6 there. They can be considered in an appropriate case, 7 but it is important to remember that the ultimate matter 8 which is for the judge is to apply the word "obvious" or 9 not in light of the evidence and what the experts say 10 and the facts as found by a jury or whoever is the 11 factfinder. Would you have any objection to an opinion 12 like that. 13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, in this case 15 let's assume that we all strike out on coming out with 16 the magic formulation. One of the ways the law 17 progresses is we go from case to case, and in this case 18 you have two standards of operation. One is a pedal 19 that basically operates by pressure. The other -- and 20 by levers. Other is by electronics, and these are two 21 different methods of making the carburetor release the 22 fuel. So why not, so somebody combines them. Why is 23 that such a big deal as, as claim 4 says it is. 24 Certainly this inventor would not be the only one to 25 think that the two could and should be combined.

1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, that's 2 absolutely right, and I just want to focus you on why it 3 is you now think I lose. We don't lose because that's 4 not our invention. The Federal Circuit's point was that 5 that this invention, claim 4, does not put an electronic 6 throttle control together with an adjustable pedal. 7 It's do it in a particular way. And let me take you in 8 summary judgment in this case to the declarations and 9 explain why it is that the experts here said you would 10 not have done this. And I just have to urge the Court 11 to cross the t's and dot the i's here and pay particular 12 attention to exactly what it is that we claimed and 13 exactly what it is that they said rendered our patent 14 obvious. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where in claim 4 do 16 you say it's putting it together in a particular way? 17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, if I can 18 take you to the big book that I asked you to -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, page 8. 20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Page 8, exactly. And that 21 is, there are six different pieces to claim 4 and I'm 22 going to take you to the relevant one. And they are the 23 last two paragraphs here. We claim an electronic 24 control attached to the support, so we specify where the 25 electronic control is going to be. And then we say
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 where, what that electronic control is going to be 2 responsive to, and that's the next paragraph: Said 3 apparatus characterized by said electronic control being 4 responsive to said pivot, and that said pivot is defined 5 above to be a fixed pivot. So here is the design. 6 Let me take you to a picture if I could, and 7 that's going to be at the back of the red brief. 8 Engelgau is the third foldout page. It looks like this. 9 What we say is there is going to be a fixed pivot. It's 10 the red pivot in our picture, and there's going to be an 11 electronic throttle control. That's actually on the -12 you can't see it because you're looking straight at the 13 device. That's on the next page. It's in green. 14 There's going to be an electronic throttle control and 15 it's going to respond to that pivot. 16 So we specify where we're going to put the 17 electronic throttle, on the support. That's what the 18 Federal Circuit recognized was our invention. Now -19 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it basically an 20 invention where in fact there are only four or five 21 moving parts on the thing that we have seen, every one 22 of the moving parts is moving with a fixed ratio to the 23 accelerator going up and down, as it must be because 24 they're also moving in fixed ratio with the throttle 25 thing coming out. And so, whichever of those four that
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you figured out you were going to attach it to, it's 2 obvious, isn't it, that you have to attach it either to 3 the pedal or to the throttle thing that comes out, or to 4 a part of the machine that moves in fixed ratio to the 5 movements of one of those two? Now, that's what I would 6 find fairly obvious. Why isn't that obvious? 7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: All right. Let me, Justice 8 Breyer. The experts say it's not obvious and the reason 9 nobody did it for 12 years and the reason that Asano was 10 never combined with an electronic throttle control is 11 explained in the record in this case and it's twofold. 12 The first is, and I have to take you now to the picture 13 of Asano because that's what the claim that is supposed 14 to make our invention obvious is. They say you would 15 have done this with Asano. What the experts say is this 16 Asano thing, no one would ever use it at all. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who do you get to be 18 an expert to tell you something's not obvious. 19 MR. GOLDSTEIN: You get -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, the least 21 insightful person you can find? 22 (Laughter.) 23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, we got a 24 Ph.D. and somebody who had worked in pedal design for 25 25 years.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly. 2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: And people who actually know 3 this industry. And they, there are two things that come 4 from the record in this case. The first is all of the 5 experts and Engelgau himself testified not simply, no, 6 this is not obvious, but you would have never used Asano 7 to solve this or any other problem with an electronic 8 throttle control. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You keep coming 10 back to Asano. Why do you keep coming back? Your claim 11 here does not say anything about Asano. 12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, the way 13 these cases are litigated, and properly so, is the other 14 side says this would be obvious in light of a particular 15 piece or collection of prior art. You may have a 16 nonprior art motivation to combine them, but you're 17 going to say something else already exists. They say 18 it's Asano, and you're going to combine it with 19 something else. This is their motion. Their argument, 20 the argument that was presented to the Federal Circuit, 21 was that you would take Asano. That's why -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think they happened to 23 use Asano simply because that's what you stuck it on. 24 But I think their basis, their basic point, is anybody 25 would have thought to stick it on, whether it's stick it
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 on Asano or stick it onto some other mechanical 2 accelerator mechanism. 3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, that is not -- we did 4 not stick it on Asano. Nobody stuck it on Asano. They 5 picked Asano because it was the prior art of adjustable 6 pedal designs. 7 Justice Scalia, you -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because 9 the Federal Circuit's approach focuses narrowly prior to 10 our grant of certiorari, allegedly more flexibly after, 11 on prior art, as opposed. 12 To I would say common sense. And so they 13 say we have to find something in prior art to show that 14 this was non -- that this was obvious. 15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's 16 not correct. Even under a capability standard, even 17 under an extraordinary innovation standard, you are 18 going to compare something to prior art. You're going 19 to take what exists now and compare it to what existed 20 before, no matter what standard you're employing. And 21 what they did is they compared it to the prior art, 22 which is Asano, and the Federal Circuit said, all right, 23 you want to say it will come from Asano. It would not 24 come from Asano for either of two reasons. 25 The first is you would never use Asano.
51

1 That's the expert testimony. The second is the reason 2 given by the PTO in its brief in this case and that is 3 you wouldn't put it on the pin that would render 4 Engelgau obvious. You would put it somewhere else. 5 They say that you would put it attached to a lever up 6 high. What I want to make clear is two things. The 7 first is, though the Federal Circuit has in recent 8 opinions been quite emphatic about how inclusive its 9 test is, it has consistently cited earlier Federal 10 Circuit precedent and said that the other side and the 11 people who claimed that their standard is too narrow and 12 misguided are mischaracterizing it. And the second is, 13 the judgment in this case quite explicitly acknowledges 14 and implies the implicit teaching, suggestion, 15 motivation standard. 16 So I don't want you to have the mistaken 17 impression that there has been some radical change in 18 Federal Circuit law. But no matter what one thinks 19 about the differential between Federal Circuit law today 20 and Federal Circuit law a year ago or two years ago, 21 there is a quite considerable cost by articulating a 22 desire to head off in a new direction, because there 23 will be dramatic instability in the patent system, the 24 incalculable investments that underlie current patents. 25 There is nothing fundamentally not functional about how
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the Federal Circuit is approaching this question. It 2 has had decades to look at this to try and elaborate a 3 standard. This court in cases like Sakraida and -4 JUSTICE BREYER: And it so quickly modified 5 itself. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: And in the last year or so, 7 after we granted cert in this case after these decades 8 of thinking about it, it suddenly decides to polish it 9 up. 10 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, if you 11 actually believe that, then you just don't believe the 12 judges in the Federal Circuit because in each of these 13 opinions they say quite explicitly we are not changing 14 it. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you dispute that in 16 some of the earlier cases, like Dembiczak with the 17 garbage bag that looks like a pumpkin, that this TSM 18 test was applied in a way that seemed to ask for 19 something quite explicit in the prior art? 20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I do think that you can find 21 outliers. I think that's fair. These judges as I said 22 have heard 300 of these cases. There are mistakes in 23 the Patent Office; there are mistakes by judges. The 24 Federal Circuit explains in Dembiczak what it was 25 actually looking for is an explanation. It wasn't
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 saying that you had to use the prior art, and it has 2 tried to make quite clear that the law is not that you 3 have to have prior art. Or that those decisions here 4 today. 5 You can't take, in a system that produces so 6 many patents, and say ah, look at this side swing 7 patent, or the garbage bags, and draw from that the 8 conclusion that the system is fundamentally broken. 9 Justice Breyer, I meant to come back to 10 that. We can look through the studies, we cite a series 11 of empirical studies in our brief that have looked at 12 this problem, the rhetorical claim that the obviousness 13 rule is leading to gross over-patenting. 14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Tell me again, just to be 15 sure I have it my -- tell me very briefly, what it is 16 that makes this invention nonobvious? 17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Two things. The first is -18 and they do arise from the other side's motion under 19 Asano. First you wouldn't have chosen Asano. The 20 second is the Federal Circuit explained -- excuse me, 21 the Solicitor General explains that you would have put 22 the electronic throttle control somewhere else, 23 technically on what's called pivot 60, which would not, 24 would have rendered, would have not have rendered 25 Engelgau obvious.

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: The invention, to use an 2 old-fashioned term, is the decision of where to put the 3 control. 4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is the extent of the 5 entire invention. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And just -- what 7 makes it nonobvious is that it's attached to a nonmoving 8 piece? 9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: An adjustable pedal that has 10 a nonmoving pivot, yes. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the claim doesn't 12 require that. 13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes it does. It does. I 14 promise. 15 (Laughter.) 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just to follow 17 up from Justice Stevens' question, what makes this 18 nonobvious is the decision to place the electronic 19 control on a part of the car that doesn't move? 20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: On the support -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 22 MR. GOLDSTEIN: And then a particular kind 23 of adjustable pedal. That's the state of the record so 24 far. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. Doesn't the
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 axis turn? 2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Does the pivot turn? 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't there an axis, and 4 the axis turns? 5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: The pivot rotates? 7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The pivot rotates, but it 8 doesn't -- the difference is that the pivot doesn't move 9 with the adjustment of the pedal. It spins around, of 10 course, you have to have something that you can -- but 11 the prior art, almost all that involved a pivot that 12 when the pedal moved out, the electronic throttle 13 control would go with it. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the wires would 15 get worn, worn down, right? And the invention here is 16 well, let's not put it somewhere where it doesn't move, 17 and so the wires won't move and it won't get worn down. 18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That would be a motivation. 19 That's absolutely right, why you would want to improve 20 on the part. The Federal Circuit said that you would 21 never do it in the way that was described here. You may 22 be able to prove it some other way on a remand. This 23 was a very specific motion, and the Federal Circuit 24 faithfully addressed the claim of obviousness that was 25 presented to it.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. 2 Mr. Dabney, you have three minutes remaining but you may 3 take four. 4 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES W. DABNEY 5 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 6 MR. DABNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 7 As someone who tries patent cases, there is 8 no legal regime that is a greater generator of patent 9 litigation than the teaching suggestion motivation test 10 that is urged by the respondent. Where in this 11 unbelievable situation where, in the District Court, 12 this Court's precedents were cited, were not followed. 13 In the Court of Appeals, this Court's precedents in 14 Anderson's-Black Rock and others were cited, not 15 distinguished, followed at all. 16 If the law of this Court had been applied in 17 the District Court I wouldn't be standing here right 18 now. The reason that we have this, this proceeding 19 going on is because of this extraordinary situation, 20 where notwithstanding that this Court has issued 21 precedents in a variety of circumstances dealing with 22 multiple technologies, lots of different kinds of 23 differences, lots of different kinds of alleged 24 innovation, they are simply not paid attention to in the 25 corpus of the Federal Circuit's case law up until about
57

1 a month ago. 2 So the, this Court could do no greater 3 service to the actual process of determining whether 4 claimed subject matter does and does not comply with the 5 statute than to decide with case. The worst possible 6 thing that can happen in this case is for the case not 7 to end here, and for the Court not to provide a 8 precedent as it has done in so many particular past 9 cases, and give the public an example of a particular 10 claim and a particular difference that does not meet the 11 standard. 12 What's made clear throughout the history of 13 patent decisionmaking is that no verbal formula is ever 14 going to get you there. What we have as a functional 15 approach; it's not as opposing counsel suggests -- is 16 "it" apparent, is "it" obvious, would it have been 17 obvious to do "it?" 18 What this Court has held over and over again 19 starting with the doorknob case in 1851 is to pose a 20 problem. Would it have -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about in this case 22 where the wires were getting frayed until this 23 disclosure? 24 MR. DABNEY: That's not, if you read the 25 affidavits carefully that is not an accurate
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 characterization of -- of any evidence put in by the 2 petitioner. That was an argument -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So suppose I read the 4 record the other way. Suppose I read the record as 5 saying this invention stopped the wires from being 6 frayed and therefore it was an advance. 7 MR. DABNEY: That would be, to the extent 8 that that -- if that is established that could be taken 9 into consideration along with other facts. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Why would that be? I mean, 11 I've worked out that the raccoons are gnawing the 12 machine, at the bottom of the garage door and that's a 13 problem. So I move it to the top of the garage door. 14 Does that suddenly -- nobody before thought of moving it 15 to the top of the garage door; nobody before had thought 16 of moving it to a different part that moves in a 17 constant ratio with the accelerator. 18 MR. DABNEY: What the statute calls for, 19 Justice Kennedy, is not to focus on a particular 20 subjective problem like fitting into a Ford F 350, or 21 particular difference between a prior art pedal that 22 provides wire chafing and a claimed invention. The law 23 has always required that the patentability be determined 24 by the smallest amount of difference. So if it were 25 true that there was wire chafing, that that was a
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 problem that would have had to have been overcome, if 2 you started with a prior art pedal that, that provided 3 for wires to move -- well then, maybe that combination 4 would not make the claimed subject matter obvious. 5 But that would not foreclose the defendant 6 from saying well, this other technology over here that 7 doesn't suffer from that problem, it's a simple matter 8 to modify that, so the premise of the question, that 9 because there is some other potential combination that 10 might have been, might have been more difference or less 11 reason to modify it than the one that's relied on by the 12 petitioner, is legally not material to the decision in 13 this case. 14 So I respectfully submit that the -- I 15 really have to emphasize this. I mean, this is a 16 litigation between, you know, two real businesses. The 17 justified expectations, Justice Souter that I think this 18 Court has recognized over and over again, are the 19 expectations of real innovators, who make real products 20 and have real inventions. And -- and I think it would 21 come as a great surprise to the owner of the Asano 22 patent to find as Justice Breyer suggested, that in 23 order to supply it to a modern vehicle maker it would 24 have to pay tribute to the Engelgau patent. 25 Thank you.
