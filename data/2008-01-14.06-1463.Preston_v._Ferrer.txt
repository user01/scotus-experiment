1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:06 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Case 06-1463, Preston v. Ferrer. 5 Mr. Schleimer. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. SCHLEIMER 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. SCHLEIMER: Thank you, Mr. Chief 9 Justice, and may it please the Court: 10 It's been a little less than two years since 11 this Court handed down the decision in Buckeye Check 12 Cashing Service v. Cardegna. Within nine months after 13 Buckeye was decided, the California Court of Appeal 14 issued its decision in this case excising the issue of 15 validity or legality of a contract from an entire 16 category of arbitrations, declaring it off limits to 17 arbitration. 18 The contract in this case couldn't be more 19 clear. It states quite specifically that the validity 20 or legality of the contract shall be arbitrated. So 21 there was no consideration given to the intent of the 22 parties. 23 The Federal Arbitration Act, of course, 24 applies in this case. There was never really a dispute 25 about that, because it'S a contract between the citizens

1 of two States and it was never disputed that the Federal 2 Arbitration Act would apply. 3 If left standing, the decision in this case 4 could result in a multiplicity of State law decisions 5 and statutes eliminating arbitration in entire classes 6 of cases through the mere expediency of having it go to 7 an administrative agency. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, It wouldn't 9 eliminate it. Your friend on the other side says it the 10 simply delays it, because you get to arbitrate de novo 11 after the commissioner's decision. 12 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, the assertion that we 13 get to arbitrate de novo is new in this Court. In the 14 courts below the parties agreed, and both sides briefed, 15 the fact that the de novo would be heard by the superior 16 court, not by the arbitrator. I don't know what -- by 17 what magical process the Respondent would think that we 18 would get to arbitrate the de novo, because the statute 19 on which the court of appeal based its jurisdictional 20 holding, Labor Code Section 1700.44, that's where the 21 labor commissioner gets jurisdiction from the same 22 statute and says the superior court hears the de novo. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess I 24 could let him answer, but I suppose he would say you go 25 to that court, and you get a motion to compel
4

1 arbitration. 2 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, we have brought a 3 motion to compel arbitration, which was denied based on 4 1700.44. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I couldn't find the order 6 that the court -- in the record it says that the order 7 would be -- the court granted a preliminary injunction, 8 the superior court, and then it said, according to an 9 order to be entered by the clerk. How long was the 10 arbitration stayed for? There was an enjoined -- there 11 was an injunction. What was the term of the injunction? 12 Just until further order of the court? 13 MR. SCHLEIMER: The injunction states -- and 14 I'm implying this, because it doesn't actually state how 15 long it lasts -- the injunction was requested and it was 16 granted with just the word "grant." So I interpret it 17 as meaning that what was granted was what was requested, 18 and what was requested was an injunction that would last 19 until the Labor Commissioner determined that she doesn't 20 have jurisdiction. Now, since the Labor Commissioner 21 had already determined that she does have jurisdiction, 22 it's effectively permanent or, as you say, 23 Justice Kennedy, until the court vacates it. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the Respondent at any 25 point indicate that after the Labor Commission, Labor
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Commissioner, made a determination that they would not 2 go to superior court for de novo review? 3 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, they actually had in a 4 sense an opportunity to do exactly that and chose not 5 to. The motion for reconsideration was brought before 6 the Labor -- before the arbitrator one day before the 7 injunction hearing. The arbitrator said: Well, it's 8 inefficient to have parallel proceedings and maybe I can 9 benefit from the Labor Commissioner's advice in this. 10 So while retaining his jurisdiction, he said: I'm going 11 to stay the arbitration until the Labor Commissioner 12 rules. 13 Now, at that point the Respondent could have 14 simply withdrawn the injunction and said, fine, we'll do 15 it the way the arbitrator says; what the arbitrator 16 wants, the arbitrator shall get. Instead, the next day 17 the arbitrator's decision became moot. Now, I think the 18 arbitrator, acting with an injunction looming the next 19 day, was proposing in a sense a kind of compromise: You 20 can both have a little bit of what you want. It's not 21 unusual in arbitrations for that to happen. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you may have a 23 right to go to arbitration under this context, to 24 proceed at once to arbitration. But could you stop a 25 parallel proceeding from going on before the Labor
6

1 Commission? In other words, your adversary says under 2 the arbitration contract I'm stuck, I have to arbitrate 3 at once, but I can go to the Labor Commission; there's 4 nothing in the Federal Arbitration Act that says I can't 5 do that. 6 MR. SCHLEIMER: Justice Ginsburg, I think 7 that if the motion to compel arbitration had been 8 granted -- remember there were two motions pending, my 9 motion to compel arbitration and the Respondent's motion 10 for an injunction to stop the arbitration. 11 If the motion to compel arbitration had been 12 granted, I think that would have been in effect a 13 mandamus to Judge Ferrer that he had to arbitrate and 14 not proceed. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought you 16 would -- you would say that when you have a contract 17 which says that any disputes under this shall be 18 arbitrated pursuant to the rules of the AAA or whatever, 19 that that does automatically exclude a parallel 20 proceeding. Otherwise, provisions like that make no 21 sense at all; they achieve nothing. 22 MR. SCHLEIMER: Justice Scalia, I would 23 certainly agree that it's a breach of the contract to 24 file a parallel proceeding. The question, of course, is 25 specific performance.

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- what do you 2 make, in answering Justice Scalia's question, what do 3 you make of the fact that this contract included, I 4 guess, a choice of law provision to the effect that 5 California law applies, and if California law comes in 6 so does the jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner? So 7 that in effect you have implicitly agreed to take the 8 Labor Commissioner as well as agreeing to arbitrate, and 9 the argument is the Labor Commissioner comes first. 10 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, Justice Souter, I have 11 two responses to that. My first is that, since there's 12 an express agreement to arbitrate validity or legality, 13 that there is certainly no basis for saying that there's 14 some implied intent to contradict the express agreement. 15 The second is that, assuming for a moment 16 that we have incorporated California law wholesale, and 17 California has a lot of law, one of the laws that 18 California has, as set forth in the case I cited, 19 Qualcomm v. Nokia, a Federal Circuit decision in 2006 20 under California law, California law has a rule that if 21 you incorporate the AAA rules into your agreement, you 22 meet the First Option standard that you have agreed to 23 arbitrate arbitrability. 24 Now, if we have incorporated California law, 25 we have incorporated the law that says the arbitrator's
8

1 decision, his initial decision saying I've got 2 jurisdiction, let's hear some evidence, then that's 3 incorporated in California law -4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you agree that the 5 question of implicit option of California law is at 6 issue in the case as it gets to us? 7 MR. SCHLEIMER: I don't believe that Volt is 8 properly in the case. If you look at the court of 9 appeals decision, the decision is based on jurisdiction, 10 it's not based on intent of the parties. Volt is all 11 about the intent of the parties that you imply from a 12 choice of law clause. And if the intent of the parties 13 is so clearly expressed that we're going to arbitrate a 14 particular issue, I don't think you even get to an 15 implied intention. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't that an issue in 17 the case, unless you're waiving the issue? Wouldn't it 18 be a question of contract interpretation as to the 19 meaning of the choice of law provision that should be 20 decided by the arbitrator? Unless you want to waive 21 that argument. 22 MR. SCHLEIMER: I that that Volt should be 23 rejected. But in the alternative, I think under First 24 Options it should be remanded to the arbitrator. If 25 they want to make an argument that we didn't intend to
9

1 arbitrate arbitrability, even though California law is 2 per se on that point in our favor, then you have the 3 option of remanding that question to the arbitrator. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I have to 5 confess I've never understood these choice of alaw 6 provisions. You incorporate California law. I assume 7 California law is interpreted consistent with Federal 8 law. If Federal law preempts California law, that's 9 what you're incorporating. It always struck me as kind 10 of circular. 11 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, I think lawyers do it 12 reflexively because out of fear that somehow the law in 13 some other State that they don't know is going to wind 14 up being the conflict of law -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say 16 California law applies, you don't mean to the exclusion 17 of Federal law? 18 MR. SCHLEIMER: Of course not. I mean, if 19 one incorporates California law, one doesn't incorporate 20 pre-empted California law. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Nor do you mean that 22 California applies even when it contradicts the express 23 provisions of your agreement? I mean, the specific 24 governs of the general? 25 MR. SCHLEIMER: Absolutely. The Federal
10

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Arbitration Act is all about effectuating the intent of 2 the parties to expeditiously and privately decide the 3 issue. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I must say that the Volt 5 case is written in rather sweeping language that's not 6 particularly helpful to you. On its facts, I think it's 7 different because there were other parties, independent 8 parties in the litigation. Don't you think that's the 9 best way to distinguish Volt in your case? 10 MR. SCHLEIMER: Certainly. To that I would 11 add the observation that under Volt, since there were 12 parties that were not bound by arbitration, you are 13 going to have all the expense of the other lawsuits, 14 anyway. So, you have in terms of the efficiency of the 15 proceeding, in Volt you were going to have a 16 multiplication of litigation no matter what you did. 17 Here that's not true. The only reason we had a 18 multiplication of litigation is because Judge Ferrer 19 filed a Labor Commissioner petition and then a Superior 20 Court lawsuit. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, would you 22 have any problem with a California law that said you can 23 arbitrate but the arbitrator must allow the Labor 24 Commissioner to file an amicus brief? 25 MR. SCHLEIMER: I don't know the Labor
11

1 Commissioner has ever attempted that. I wouldn't be 2 concerned about it. I know -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it goes on 4 and says, and you must allow the Labor Commissioner to 5 appear at the arbitration? 6 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, that is what 1700.45 7 says for talent agents. In 20 years I've never heard of 8 the Labor Commissioner doing that. But I can't imagine 9 anyone is going to be awfully concerned about it. I 10 certainly wouldn't be. If the Labor Commissioner wanted 11 to attend, they would be welcome. I don't think that's 12 based on a legal right because my client's a personal 13 manager and isn't regulated by the talent agency -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what if it says 15 you've got to wait for 30 days to allow the Labor 16 Commissioner to consider whether or not to intervene? 17 MR. SCHLEIMER: I'm not sure -- I 18 certainly -- personally, in this case no problem with 19 that. I don't think that's how it works. The statute 20 simply requires notice and an opportunity to attend; and 21 there's no issue in this case as to whether the Labor 22 Commissioner was deprived of that, because we never got 23 to that point. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the Labor 25 Commissioner have authority to commence proceedings on
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 his own motion or her own motion? 2 MR. SCHLEIMER: It's a little bit 3 complicated. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm sorry that I 5 asked already. 6 MR. SCHLEIMER: I have an answer for you. 7 The Labor Commissioner is considered a peace officer 8 under California law. They actually have the power to 9 arrest. At one point many years ago, there was an 10 arrest of a manager for soliciting and procuring. He 11 got Jane Wyman a job on a TV show called "Falcon Crest," 12 and there was an arrest and there was a criminal statute 13 at that time. And the legislature responded to this 14 incident by repealing the criminal statute. 15 So the only action the legislature has had 16 since deregulating the managers and taking them out of 17 the statute entirely was removing the criminal 18 enforcement power. In terms of the Labor Commissioner's 19 civil enforcement powers, there are statutes. The first 20 hundred sections in the labor code do give the Labor 21 Commissioner certain intervention powers. But, reading 22 those statutes, they would seem to apply in wage cases 23 and confiscation of tools, that sort of thing. They 24 don't really mention -- now would the Labor 25 Commissioner -- if the Labor Commissioner wanted to
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 intervene, I think that if you take the penumbra of all 2 these statutes probably the Labor Commissioner could. 3 I think, even though there's not in my 20 4 years handling these cases been a situation where the 5 Labor Commissioner filed any kind of a civil proceeding, 6 everybody assumes the Labor Commissioner could seek an 7 injunction if they wanted to. It just doesn't occur 8 because they're busy doing things like collecting wages. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the arbitrator 10 decide, I know I'm not required to do this but the Labor 11 Commissioner is the expert and I'd rather wait until the 12 Labor Commissioner acted before I proceed with the 13 arbitration? 14 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, in a sense, under the 15 gun of the injunction hearing the next day, that's what 16 the arbitrator did. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Take out the exception. 18 The arbitrator just thinks that it would be good to have 19 the advice of the Labor Commissioner because the 20 arbitrator is not so familiar with these talent agency 21 arrangements. 22 MR. SCHLEIMER: I would certainly protest, 23 but the arbitrator undoubtedly has the power to wait for 24 the Labor Commissioner to render an advisory decision. 25 In a sense that's what the arbitrator did. In a moment

1 of I think irrational exuberance he talked about the 2 expertise of the Labor Commissioner. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How was the 4 arbitrator chosen? Does he or she have any particular 5 expertise in this area? 6 MR. SCHLEIMER: Yes. Mr. Bosch has 32 years 7 as an entertainment lawyer. He knows the Talent Agency 8 Act considerable better than any of the civil service 9 lawyers at the Labor Commissioner. That's why I 10 referred to it as irrational exuberance, because the 11 Labor Commissioner -- some of them get pretty good and 12 then they move on to other jobs, and you wind up with 13 people who hear wage claims. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you go to the superior 15 court for de novo review, can you ask the superior court 16 for an order enforcing its decision? 17 MR. SCHLEIMER: Enforcing the Labor 18 Commissioner's decision? 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you get de novo 20 review. So do you ask the court for an order -- a 21 declaratory order, declaring that the person is a talent 22 agent or is not a talent agent? 23 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, that is what Judge 24 Ferrer asked the superior court to do, was first send 25 this to the Labor Commissioner. Then specifically the
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 complaint by Judge Ferrer sought declaratory relief, 2 that the arbitration is void, the guy is an illegal 3 talent agent, so he should never be allowed to 4 arbitrate. That was the declaratory relief that was 5 sought. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So do you think it would 7 be within the authority of the superior court to say 8 this is a judgment binding on the parties and the 9 arbitration will not proceed, or must proceed 10 consistently with my order? 11 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, absent -- our position 12 is that that's preemptive, of course. Absent the 13 arbitration agreement, it would be the superior court 14 that would decide it. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Well, but if the 16 Respondent prevails, don't you think that the superior 17 court has that authority? 18 MR. SCHLEIMER: If the Respondent prevails 19 in the Labor Commissioner? 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If Respondent prevails in 21 this case, don't you think that the superior court can 22 then say that its declaration is final and the 23 arbitration shall not proceed? 24 MR. SCHLEIMER: The position I've taken from 25 the beginning, including in my briefs to the court of
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 appeals was yes, that if the decision is correct, if 2 this Court affirms the court of appeals, that the 3 de novo would go to the superior court. Now, it is a 4 true de novo; in other words, it's not deferential to 5 the Labor Commissioner. It's simply a complete 6 rehearing from scratch of the whole case. 7 But it has always been my position and it 8 was until we got to this Court the Respondent's position 9 that the de novo would go to the superior court. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: What is it -- I should know 11 this, but I don't. Imagine that Jones and Smith, civil 12 engineers, builders, enter into a contract. They have 13 an arbitration provision suspiciously like this one. It 14 says we promise to arbitrate everything, any dispute, 15 including a dispute about whether this agreement is 16 legal or not itself. They have that. They go to the 17 arbitrator. 18 Jones says: You know, Mr. Arbitrator, you 19 don't know that much about civil engineering, but 20 there's a judge here who does. So I think what I'm 21 going to do tomorrow is file a lawsuit in the superior 22 court in California making the same claims I'm making 23 here and maybe that judge will decide it first and then 24 you'll be really helped. Now what stops him from doing 25 that in the law?

1 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, the Federal 2 Arbitration Act and the California Arbitration -3 JUSTICE BREYER: The Federal -- the Federal 4 Arbitration Act says what that makes it clear he can't 5 do that? 6 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well -7 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I grant you if he 8 can do it you might as well tear up the Federal 9 Arbitration Act and throw it out the window. But I just 10 want to know what is it in the law specifically that 11 stops him from doing that. 12 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, I think in Section 3 13 would -- there should be a stay of the judicial 14 proceedings so that the arbitration can proceed. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not positive 16 Federal law. What stops him from doing it is the 17 contractual agreement, isn't it, between the parties? 18 The FAA just says that the State will not set aside that 19 contractual agreement. 20 MR. SCHLEIMER: Yes, Justice Scalia. The 21 obligation comes from the contract. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: So even though it's not -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: When we say we'll arbitrate 24 all disputes under this contract, it means we'll 25 arbitrate all disputes under this contract; neither one

1 of us will go to court. 2 MR. SCHLEIMER: I think that's doubly so if 3 you incorporate the rules of the American Arbitration 4 Association, which provides you with the maximum 5 breadth. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that -- that's 7 what I'm driving at, and I think that's interesting, 8 that there's an implicit -- because it doesn't say it 9 explicitly -- there's an implicit promise not to 10 undermine this contract by running off to court. 11 MR. SCHLEIMER: I think it's a covenant of 12 good faith and fair dealing. If you agree to do it you 13 should do it. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And so you 15 can't -- no case comes to your mind where anybody has 16 tried that little end run? And -17 MR. SCHLEIMER: I think there are a couple 18 -19 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree, I don't see how 20 they could, but I just want to get to the bottom of it. 21 MR. SCHLEIMER: I think this entire area of 22 jurisprudence involves pre-dispute arbitration 23 agreements and then some party decides it's not to my 24 advantage and they run to court. That's almost every 25 case.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I used to teach contract 3 law, and I am sure that when you say you'll arbitrate, 4 it means you won't litigate. And even if I didn't ever 5 teach contract law, it would still be the law. 6 (Laughter.) 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Buckeye was -8 was such a case, going to court despite the arbitration 9 agreement. 10 MR. SCHLEIMER: At -- at the time we were in 11 the superior court, Buckeye had not yet been decided. 12 We were -- in December of 2005 was the injunction 13 hearing, and Buckeye I believe was published in February 14 of 2006. 15 I relied on the California case, the 16 Erickson case, which made Prima Paint the law of 17 California, and it wasn't persuasive. Then Buckeye was 18 handed down while we were on appeal. But I certainly, 19 when I read Buckeye, I said that's my price, because 20 Prima Paint was about fraud in the inducement. We were 21 in a situation where we were dealing with an attack on 22 the legality of the entire contract and I read Buckeye 23 and said, that's my case. 24 Mr. Chief Justice, if there's no further 25 questions, I'd like to reserve my time.

BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 6 please the Court: 7 The California Talent Agencies Act does not 8 invalidate the arbitration agreement between Mr. Preston 9 and Judge Ferrer. At most, it merely postpones 10 arbitration -11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the question is 12 obvious. The question just follows from what I said. 13 You were there nodding your head when everybody seems 14 seemed to agree that the Jones versus Smith, they can't 15 go run off to court. So you're just about to address 16 this, and I hope you'll include the answer to the 17 question, which is if they can't run off to the 18 Federal -- to the State court judge, the superior court 19 judge, to get his opinion on the matter, why can they 20 run off to this man, namely the talent agency expert -21 MR. BRUNSTAD: The Labor Commissioner -22 JUSTICE BREYER: -- who happens to be an 23 administrative agency? Why does it matter? 24 MR. BRUNSTAD: I think to answer your 25 question, Justice Breyer, it's helpful just to delineate
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the procedure of how it's supposed to work. You're 2 supposed to go to the California Labor Commissioner 3 first if there's any controversy arising under the 4 California Talent Agencies Act. That is an exhaustion 5 of administrative remedies concept that the California 6 Supreme Court articulated in Styne v Stevens. After the 7 California Talent Agencies Act has been administered by 8 the Labor Commissioner, either party has as of right the 9 ability to take an appeal to the California Superior 10 Court, at which point all of the California arbitration 11 rules apply, and a motion to compel arbitration could be 12 made at that point and arbitration could happen. And 13 now it's a de novo hearing from the Labor Commissioner's 14 proceeding, which means under California law, the 15 Waisbren case and the Buchwald case, that it's as though 16 the Labor Commissioner proceeding had not happened at 17 all. The -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did you take a position 19 below? Your friend says that this is brand new up here. 20 MR. BRUNSTAD: It's not brand new, 21 Justice Scalia.

1 We only got to the point whether we should have a 2 preliminary injunction so that the Labor Commissioner 3 could go first. Once the Labor Commissioner -4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The arbitrator already 5 agreed to do that. You didn't need the injunction for 6 that purpose. 7 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, the motion for the 8 injunction was filed because the arbitrator initially 9 denied a stay of arbitration. The arbitrator himself 10 then reconsidered his ruling a day before the hearing on 11 the injunction, and the arbitrator said I'd like to hear 12 from the Labor Commissioner because the Labor 13 Commissioner is expert. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- but if your 15 position is that we have to preserve the integrity of 16 the State system, the Labor expert and so forth and the 17 State builds in to that procedure, de novo review 18 Superior Court, it seems to me rather difficult for you 19 to now just say oh, well, the Superior Court doesn't 20 make any difference. 21 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, I 22 think that it is important -- this goes back to 23 Justice Breyer's question. Why is it a de novo 24 proceeding? Well, in the Sinnamon case, which we cite 25 in our brief, there are constitutional reasons under the
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 California's constitution. The Labor Commissioner 2 doesn't exercise any judicial authority and does not 3 have the power to finally decide this controversy. The 4 Labor Commissioner is merely exercising her 5 administrative power over this dispute because this is 6 part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would you want this to 8 happen? Why -- who would imagine such a system in which 9 you bring it to the Labor Commissioner and you prevent 10 the matter from being resolved immediately with an 11 arbitrator. I don't know how long does it take for the 12 Labor Commissioner? I don't know. 13 MR. BRUNSTAD: On average 8 months, Justice 14 Scalia. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Eight months. But then 16 when he's done -17 MR. BRUNSTAD: She, Your Honor. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: She. No matter what 19 happens, you go back to the arbitrator. Who in his 20 right mind would set up such a system? 21 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, there are valid 22 reasons. There are very compelling reasons why 23 California set up this system. California law says if 24 you're going to act like a talent agent, you're going to 25 procure employment -- that's the touchstone -- you're

That's how the Labor Commissioner 5 learns of disputes. The Labor Commissioner is supposed 6 to develop this body of law by interpreting it. All -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: This person is not a talent 8 agent. 9 MR. BRUNSTAD: The is person is a talent 10 agent, Justice Scalia. He was operating to procure 11 employment. And the statute says anyone who even 12 attempts to procure employment is a talent agent, and 13 that is all that Mr. Preston did. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Normally we say that 15 those types of disputes are for the arbitrator to 16 decide. The theory is that the arbitrator can apply the 17 existing law as well as a court, and if that's the 18 theory, couldn't the arbitrator apply the existing law 19 as well as an agency? 20 MR. BRUNSTAD: Chief Justice Roberts, there 21 are other things that the Labor Commissioner is invested 22 with jurisdiction to do. The Labor Commissioner has to 23 find out about these disputes. How does she find out? 24 Because parties bring these petitions. This is a great 25 deterrent for people from violating the California

Her expertise is advanced. She gets to 5 decide the controversy initially. And it merely 6 postpones arbitration. And critically, this is -7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be great as 8 a means of informing the Labor Commissioner, but it 9 virtually destroys the value of arbitration -10 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, but the -11 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- because the 12 expeditiousness of arbitration is gone once you start 13 down the California procedural road. They don't want to 14 go to arbitration 8 to 12 months later. They want it 15 now. 16 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Souter, it's 17 actually enhanced. It's enhanced for all the reasons 18 that, when exert brings his or her expertise to bear, 19 you can get a settlement; you get expedited resolution 20 the issues get refind. Most parties don't go to 21 arbitration after this because -22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then they probably 23 shouldn't have agreed to arbitrate, but they did agree 24 to arbitrate, and they want to arbitrate now.

Volt is very clear. It involves a third 6 party, litigation involving a third party who is not 7 bound by the arbitration agreement. Here you have only 8 two parties. They are both bound by the arbitration 9 agreement. I don't see how you can invoke Volt. 10 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because Volt simply was about 11 -- a case about postponing arbitration in favor of 12 litigation going forward, which has actually had a 13 greater impact -14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Litigation involving a 15 person who couldn't be brought into the arbitration. 16 MR. BRUNSTAD: True, but -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It makes sense to say 18 that piece of it involving a party who can't be before 19 the arbitrator should be -- should be -- go first. But 20 here you don't have anybody who isn't bound to go before 21 the arbitrator. You have no third party. 22 MR.

It's just because the Labor 7 Commissioner, he or she, is such an expert on this -8 your opponent says she's not at all -9 MR. BRUNSTAD: She is, Your Honor. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I imagine that's 11 highly debatable. 12 It's a different case where you say you have 13 to wait for a court decision which will be conclusive as 14 to many of the people in the case. 15 MR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Scalia, in Volt, 16 the State court litigation went forward, the related 17 litigation. It could have res judicata/collateral 18 estoppel effects on the arbitration. It has even more 19 of an impact on arbitration -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said something about 21 that in your brief, and I think that you got it wrong. 22 You said something about -- that the outcome of the 23 litigation can have preclusive effect in the 24 arbitration. But that would be so only if the result 25 favored the non-party to the litigation, because the
29
Alderson Reporting Company

1 non-party to the litigation cannot be bound by a 2 judgment that would adversely affect that party's 3 interest. That party wasn't in the proceeding. It 4 isn't bound by it. The parties to the litigation are 5 bound by it, not the non-parties to the litigation. 6 MR. BRUNSTAD: True, Justice Ginsburg, but 7 at least it can bind one of the parties and therefore 8 tie the hands of the arbitrator in the subsequent 9 proceeding. Here this is not possible. The parties 10 bargained for this in their agreement when they 11 bargained for the application of California law. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Could California law do 13 this? I mean could they say, you know, we have a 14 problem. By the way, this is just a hypothetical. We 15 think that our judges in the Superior Court don't know 16 very much about building disputes. 17 Now, I say it is a hypothetical because, in 18 fact, Superior Court judges in California are excellent 19 judges. But California thinks, no, they don't know 20 enough about it. So here's what we do. We say when 21 Jones and Smith enter into an arbitration agreement, if 22 it happens to concern a building dispute, they have to 23 go to Federal -- they can go to the Superior Court. In 24 fact, if they want to, if one of them wants to, the 25 other one doesn't. And everything is delayed while the

BRUNSTAD: But I understand your 9 hypothetical -10 JUSTICE BREYER: In my mind is what they do 11 is they have the same standard arbitration clause. So 12 I'm asking not about the parties; I'm asking about 13 California. 14 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Breyer. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: No. The answer is no. I 16 thought so. And so now you explain to me how this is 17 any different than what I just said, other than 18 substituting the words "Labor Commissioner" for 19 "California Superior Court" and substituting the words 20 "talent dispute" for the words "building dispute." 21 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because here what the Labor 22 Commissioner does is not what a court does. "Labor 23 Commissioner" is not synonymous with "the court" and 24 cannot be under California's constitution. Here you 25 have a complete, again, arbitration postponing rule and

In this case, does the California 7 provision for de novo review in the Superior Court apply 8 to stay the arbitration while that aspect of the 9 proceeding is completed? 10 MR. BRUNSTAD: Under California law -- it is 11 California law -- you must go to the labor commissioner 12 first before you go either to court or the arbitrator. 13 You must go to the arbitrator second. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My question was: You go 15 to the labor commissioner. You also have a de novo 16 right to go to the superior court. 17 MR. BRUNSTAD: That is correct. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the labor 19 commissioner said something absolutely silly. Wouldn't 20 you think you would have the right to go to the Superior 21 Court? 22 MR.

We have an arbitration clause. 7 MR.

That after the 8 proceeding is finished before the labor commissioner, 9 the parties have a right to go to arbitration before 10 there's de novo review in the superior court? 11 MR. BRUNSTAD: Specifically, Justice Alito, 12 no. What the California courts have decided is that 13 there is a de novo right, and -14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: A de novo right in 15 Superior Court? 16 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes. But the California 17 Supreme Court has also said, in construing its own 18 arbitration act, which is Section 1281, which is 19 basically the same as Section 2 of the FAA -- said, 20 look, when we have a right to go to court if you have an 21 arbitration proceeding, the -- a motion to compel 22 arbitration must be granted unless, for example, the 23 arbitration clause is invalid for some reason. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, you at least 25 have that additional step. It is -- particularly since
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you only have 10 days to appeal from the labor 2 commissioner, someone who wants to arbitrate has to 3 appeal, has to go to superior court and get a motion to 4 compel. 5 You can't even wait to see if your opponent 6 goes to superior court and -- well, if he has won, he 7 wouldn't go into court. But you have to go to the court 8 to get a motion to compel? You can't just go ahead and 9 proceed with arbitration. 10 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, the parties could 11 voluntarily do that. But, yes, if you don't do the de 12 novo proceeding, then the labor commissioner's decision 13 becomes binding. 14 So you must take the step of doing the 15 notice of appeal and then do a motion to compel. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You say -- I 17 thought you said it doesn't become binding. That it is 18 just advice to the arbitrator. Once you -- once you get 19 the remand to the arbitrator, it is not binding. 20 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Scalia. If I 21 made that impression, I'm sorry. I was mistaken. What 22 I am saying is that if -- if -- you have a right to take 23 an appeal to the California Superior Court. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 25 MR. BRUNSTAD: And once you get to the

So you have to do the appellate process, and 9 you must file a motion. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if you -- and if 11 you are successful and get from the superior court an 12 order to compel arbitration, your opponent can then 13 appeal it, I assume. 14 MR. BRUNSTAD: Your opponent can appeal the 15 decision compelling the arbitration if it were 16 improperly granted, yes. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you telling us that 18 under no circumstance, if you prevail in this case, 19 would you go to the superior court for de novo review 20 and -- and, as part of that, stay the arbitration? 21 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, if the 22 arbitration clause is valid and applicable, we will go 23 to arbitration. That validity and applicability has not 24 been tested by any court below. For example, are there 25 grounds --

So the case does not have 8 to be stayed, and you would not ask for it to be stayed, 9 in the superior court? 10 MR. BRUNSTAD: Labor commissioner goes 11 first. Then, we go to arbitration. If this Court rules 12 that the labor commissioner's jurisdiction is preempted, 13 then we go back to the -- to the lower court. If the 14 arbitration clause is valid and applicable, we will go 15 to arbitration. That is correct. Chief Justice 16 Roberts, you asked a question about the -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Brunstad, I'm looking 18 at the point in which you said this in your brief. You 19 said you go to the labor commission, and then you go to 20 the Superior Court. This is page 13 of your brief. 21 The court is required to grant a motion 22 compelling arbitration if the parties have executed a 23 valid and applicable arbitration agreement. 24 Well, who determines if the parties have 25 executed a valid and applicable arbitration agreement?
38
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. BRUNSTAD: Under First Options here, 2 were it not unmistakably clear that the parties said 3 that the arbitrator should decide arbitrability, that 4 would be for the court to decide. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we know -- this is 6 not a mystery in this contract. It says it in the 7 contract, and it says it under the AAA rules. But you 8 phrased this in your brief in a way that says, well, if 9 the parties have executed a valid and applicable 10 arbitration agreement, that's what the superior court is 11 going to decide. So it won't grant a motion to compel 12 unless it determines that the parties have executed the 13 valid and applicable arbitration agreement. 14 MR. BRUNSTAD: And what I meant in that 15 language, Justice Ginsburg, is simply this: For 16 example, if the arbitration clause were invalid because 17 the arbitration clause, itself, were, say, fraudulent 18 or -- for something, then it would not be validate and 19 applicable; or if the scope of the arbitration clause 20 were limited in some way, then the scope issue, the 21 arbitrability issue, is for the court to decide as this 22 Court decided in First Options. 23 Here we do not have the unmistakably clear 24 language that the parties intended that the question of 25 arbitrability, itself, to be to the arbitrator. So the

BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Breyer. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, Volt, 10 however, is a case, I take it, in which the stay that 11 was entered was a stay staying the arbitration pending 12 the resolution of a judicial dispute that was not 13 subject to arbitrability. 14 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Therefore, it seems to me 16 that the question here concerns the meaning of this 17 contract, and that's where we started. 18 MR.

And that is when the parties incorporated 10 California law, what did they incorporate? 11 Well, in Volt this Court answered: When 12 they incorporated California law, it was California law; 13 not California law with a gloss of Federal law, but 14 California law. And the California Supreme Court in the 15 Chronus case that we cite says exactly the same thing. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a question of 17 contract interpretation -18 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: -- for the arbitrator? 20 MR. BRUNSTAD: No. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: Why not? 22 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because that goes -- because 23 I think that this Court held that it to be no in Volt. 24 It said, look, where the -- because that goes to the 25 applicability, the validity, of the arbitration clause,
41

1 itself. 2 Here we don't have arbitrability, itself. 3 The First Options standard is not satisfied under this 4 case. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand -6 so you incorporate California law. I interpret that to 7 mean substantive law of California. 8 You say also incorporates -- and this is 9 what I find peculiar. California law gives you a 10 procedural right to go to the labor commission. But it 11 also gives you a procedural right to go to superior 12 court. And, yet, you acknowledge that the arbitration 13 agreement, when you say we will arbitrate, forecloses 14 your using the superior court. 15 Why doesn't it foreclose your using the 16 labor commissioner? I don't understand how you slice 17 the bologna that thin. To me, if it excludes California 18 procedures, it excludes both the labor commissioner and 19 the superior court. 20 MR. BRUNSTAD: Two reasons, Justice Scalia: 21 First, in the Buckeye case, for example, the 22 parties specifically selected as their choice of law the 23 Federal Arbitration Act. Here the parties selected 24 California law. This is no different than in Volt. 25 The second reason, Justice Scalia --
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me -- I want to 2 understand that answer. California law includes the 3 Superior Court as much as it includes the labor 4 commissioner. 5 MR. BRUNSTAD: In Volt, Your Honor, the 6 specific law that was -- the Court said was selected was 7 Section 1281 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, 8 which applies in a California court favoring a court 9 proceeding because California has this rule that says if 10 you have arbitration and related litigation, you can 11 stay -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Related litigation with 13 someone other than the parties that you bound yourself 14 to arbitrate with. That involved Stanford and two 15 companies, Stanford suing two companies or -- in 16 litigation with two companies with whom it had no 17 arbitration agreement. 18 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. But 19 here I think the Court has drawn the proper distinction 20 between, on the one hand, Volt and, on the other hand, 21 Doctor's Associates, Mastrobuono, Perry, Allied-Bruce, 22 all of those cases where the Court has said if it is an 23 arbitration negating rule, you don't incorporate it, 24 because that's fundamentally at war with the decision to 25 arbitrate.

1 But where it's merely an arbitration 2 postponing rule, which was the procedural issue in Volt 3 and the procedural issue here, then we respect that and 4 say that's not pre-empted, because it's not necessary to 5 pre-empt. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: How can we decide this case 7 on the assumption that this is simply an arbitration 8 postponing rule when there's no California case that 9 says that, do you acknowledge? 10 And a party resisting arbitration could well 11 argue that the California Code means that you go first 12 to the Labor Commissioner and then, as the statute says 13 explicitly, the parties are entitled to a de novo review 14 before the Superior Court without making any provision 15 for arbitration. Do you think it is inconceivable the 16 California courts could interpret the statute to mean 17 that, that there's no room for arbitration in the -- in 18 this scheme? 19 MR. BRUNSTAD: It is inconceivable, 20 Justice Alito, that the California court would say that 21 arbitration is not permissible in this case. The 22 California Supreme Court has reconciled previously in 23 the Aguilar case, which is 32 Cal. 4th 974. You had two 24 different provisions of law. One said you had 25 nonbinding arbitration for fee disputes between
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 attorneys, and the second was the California Arbitration 2 Act. 3 And the California Supreme Court said, as 4 this Court said, that it will indulge every intent to 5 give effect to such proceedings, the arbitration 6 proceedings, in Section 1281. It will harmonize the 7 statutes and say if you if you have a right to 8 arbitrate, we will respect that and we will harmonize 9 the laws so we respect that. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the California Supreme 11 Court would construct a system in which you get the 12 advice of this expert, the Labor Commissioner. One of 13 the parties thinks that this expert's advice is 14 ridiculous, just absolutely wrong. 15 Now, California law generally considers the 16 Superior Court smarter than the Labor Commissioner, 17 which is why you get de novo review before the Superior 18 Court. 19 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Scalia. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: No? 21 MR. BRUNSTAD: No. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is stupider than the 23 Labor Commissioner. 24 (Laughter.) 25 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Scalia. It is

And yet, one of the 7 parties who thinks the Labor Commissioner is dead wrong 8 doesn't get a chance to have this advice corrected the 9 way the California constitution envisions, by the ex 10 officio smarter Superior Court. 11 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that is the scheme that 13 the California Supreme Court is going to embed in 14 California law? 15 MR.

BRUNSTAD: It is not in the record, 24 Justice Kennedy, because there is no factual record in 25 this case --

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Therefore, don't make 2 factual averments here for the first time. 3 MR. BRUNSTAD: It's not for the first time, 4 Justice Kennedy. It was made all the way through the 5 proceedings below. We never got to an evidentiary 6 hearing. This case is still at the preliminary stages. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think, in the 8 briefs to this Court, you can make factual statements 9 that are not in the record? 10 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, that 11 would mean we could make no factual statements to give 12 the Court any background at all. I think it is 13 undisputed; it isn't challenged by the other side. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think they do say that 15 it is disputed. They do dispute that he clearly and 16 repeatedly sought to procure employment for Ferrer. 17 That's the whole issue in the case. 18 MR. BRUNSTAD: It's undisputed, that Mr. 19 Preston went and arranged the meeting with Judge Ferrer 20 initially with the folks at ABC. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But they said it is -22 they dispute that it is to procure employment. 23 MR. BRUNSTAD: I think, Justice Kennedy, I 24 will concede that it is not a matter of evidence, so 25 that qualification -- I will accept that

1 qualification -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In that light, on page 3 43, you say in this case, it is undisputed that Preston 4 was an unlicensed talent agent and that the contract he 5 drafted did not meet the requirements of Section 1700. 6 I thought it is very much disputed whether 7 he was a talent agent at all. I thought the position 8 was -- that your opponent is taking is that he was not a 9 talent agent, that he didn't come under the statute. 10 MR. BRUNSTAD: It is undisputed, 11 Justice Ginsburg, that Mr. Preston never had a license. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not what you 13 said here. You say it is undisputed that Preston was an 14 unlicensed talent agent. That's your statement. 15 MR. BRUNSTAD: Our argument, 16 Justice Ginsburg, is that he was unlicensed but he was 17 operating as a talent agent under section -- under the 18 California Talent Agencies Act. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: The latter is disputed. 20 The latter is vigorously disputed. 21 MR. BRUNSTAD: That is disputed, Justice 22 Scalia. And they have disputed that. But it is -- let 23 me qualify that then, Justice Ginsburg. It's undisputed 24 that he never had a license. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could I ask one question

BRUNSTAD: Ruled against us? We would 6 have filed an appeal to the -7 JUSTICE STEVENS: To the court? 8 MR. BRUNSTAD: To the court, correct. And 9 then there would have been a motion to compel for 10 arbitration. That -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That seems to me 12 completely inconsistent with your argument that 13 additional time was minimal. And if you have repeated 14 statements in your brief that require qualifications, if 15 in your former argument in Marshal, the Court is 16 concerned with the accuracy of one of your citations, 17 shouldn't we view with some skepticism what you tell us? 18 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Kennedy. I think 19 that all of our citations to the record and all of our 20 statements about the facts are, in fact, true. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What I just read you, 22 this one, you said it isn't. You say it is undisputed 23 that Preston was an unlicensed talent agent. And you 24 just admitted that that is disputed. 25 MR. BRUNSTAD: I'm sorry, forgive me,

1 Justice Ginsburg. It's undisputed that Mr. Preston 2 never had a license. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not what you 4 represented. 5 MR. BRUNSTAD: It is disputed whether he was 6 acting as a talent agent or not. I wish to clarify 7 that. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Schleimer, you 9 have nine minutes remaining. 10 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. SCHLEIMER 11 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 12 MR. SCHLEIMER: Thank you, Mr. Chief 13 Justice. 14 I would disagree that there wasn't an 15 evidentiary hearing. I don't think the evidence is 16 considered, but in addition to Mr. Preston's 17 declaration, I made an offer of proof which is in the 18 appellant's appendix at page 219. I offered to prove 19 that the Judge Alex television program is solicited and 20 procured by an agent of the William Morris Agency. I 21 had made two attempts to depose Judge Ferrer to prove 22 that, and I never got the chance. He didn't want to be 23 deposed. 24 So, there was a full evidentiary hearing. 25 The evidence just wasn't considered because the legal
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 standard that was applied was there's a colorable claim 2 under the Talent Agencies Act, so you can't arbitrate 3 until it's resolved. 4 Now I saw this as being a long trek through 5 the courts. I don't know when the arbitrator gets to 6 make his decision. If -- if the Labor Commissioner 7 rules that the contract is void and then we have a de 8 novo and the Superior Court does that, and the court of 9 appeal does it, and then the California Supreme Court 10 rules the contract is void, does the arbitrator get to 11 overrule that. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Regardless of the -- I now 13 understand better than I did what I take as a pretty 14 strong argument. I'm not saying convincing, but strong. 15 And that would be this: If you go look at 16 Volt, and in Volt the Court said that the California 17 Code meant that the individual who'd entered into the 18 arbitration contract could go and can ask a superior 19 court to stay an arbitration while some unrelated -20 some unrelated -- I mean directly related but not the 21 same parties -- litigation took place. 22 The Court didn't in Volt say that that 23 question of interpreting this contract is for the 24 arbitrator. I don't know why it didn't. But it didn't. 25 Now here he's making a parallel argument.
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 He's saying that the California Code says that people 2 should first go to that Labor Commissioner and that you 3 can stay arbitration while that goes on. 4 Now -- and I say well, why don't you go to 5 the arbitrator? He says I don't want to go to the 6 arbitrator on that one, but he points to Volt. 7 And so the puzzle is this: if the Court in 8 Volt didn't say this is a matter for the arbitrator, 9 whether the contract really means that you promise not 10 to go into court and make a motion to stay, why here is 11 it a matter for the arbitrator whether you implicitly 12 promised not to go into court and asked him to stay 13 pending the outcome of this administrative proceeding? 14 What do you think about that? 15 MR. SCHLEIMER: I certainly think that the 16 arbitrator had jurisdiction to arbitrate arbitrability. 17 And the reason for that is the Qualcomm case 18 and the Dream Theater case is a California case cited in 19 Qualcomm, and that the arbitrator should have decided 20 all these issues. 21 I would make this observation. If we -- if 22 we had gone to the arbitrator and Judge Ferrer had said 23 look, this contract is illegal, said you don't have 24 jurisdiction, and I want you to rule you don't have 25 jurisdiction, the same illegality issue would be a

1 defense on the merits. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- I accept that. 3 I see a lot of common sense on your side of it. But 4 imagine I'm writing an opinion in your favor and now I 5 come to the following paragraph which I have to write: 6 "Your opponent says that Volt controls here; but that is 7 wrong because" -- and now fill in the blank for me. 8 MR. SCHLEIMER: Assuming Volt -9 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm just saying I have 10 to write. I see all the common sense of your position. 11 I -- absolutely. But to get -- you only need one really 12 good argument. And he's saying whatever the other ones 13 are, here Breyer or somebody is going to have to write 14 the words, and Volt is different because -- so I would 15 like some help on that one. 16 MR. SCHLEIMER: Because in Volt the contract 17 was silent, and the Federal Arbitration Act was silent 18 on the issue that was presented, and State law supplied 19 the answer. The California Arbitration Act has a number 20 of -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's always the 22 case. It's always the case that the arbitration is 23 quiet on this. It is -- the Respondent's position is 24 that it is absolutely quiet, but it is also absolutely 25 clear that it is State law.

1 MR. SCHLEIMER: The contract here, I would 2 submit, Justice Kennedy, is not quiet because it says 3 that validity or legality shall be arbitrated. And 4 that's what we are talking about. So you don't have a 5 silent contract. You have a contract that speaks to 6 that question. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that Volt 8 would have been different. Volt is -- Volt is written 9 very broadly, it seems to me, in favor of the 10 Respondent's position. 11 MR. SCHLEIMER: Volt was written under the 12 California Arbitration Act, and speaking as a California 13 practitioner that had had a lot of cases, you might 14 notice that the same section in Volt was the basis for 15 my motion to compel arbitration. See codicil procedure 16 CC P 1281.2. CC P 1281 is almost identical to Section 2 17 of the Federal Arbitration Act, but the California 18 Arbitration Act has a number of provisions where the 19 Federal Arbitration Act is silent. One of those is 20 dealing with multi-party litigation where parties are 21 not bound. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think Volt would have 23 come out the same way if -- if in fact, all of the 24 parties in this other litigation had agreed to 25 arbitration? You have any doubt --

SCHLEIMER: I think the Labor 15 Commissioner probably does. I think it has to do with 16 the adjudicatory versus prosecutorial function of an 17 administrative agency. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is not a 19 proceeding brought by the administrative agency. 20 MR. SCHLEIMER: No. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: An agency like the EEOC 22 Waffle House. 23 MR. SCHLEIMER: This is -- this is an -24 this is an administrative agency providing an 25 adjudicatory forum.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is somebody who's 2 bound by arbitration invoking whatever authority the 3 Labor Commissioner has, quite different from the Labor 4 Commissioner commencing a proceeding. 5 MR. SCHLEIMER: Waffle House was all about 6 the prosecutorial or administrative power. This 7 is about the adjudicatory -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your friend 9 says that this agency has exactly that power, and the 10 reason you required these things to go before her, is 11 that she knows what's going on in the area and, if 12 appropriate, can take the supervisory authority or 13 whatever the equivalent of prosecutorial action is. 14 MR. SCHLEIMER: I think I pointed out in my 15 papers that nothing stops Judge Ferrer from putting a 16 dime in the phone, calling the Labor Commissioner and 17 complaining, saying there's been illegality here. They 18 may request some evidence at that point. But the point 19 is that the prosecutorial discretion will be exercised 20 by the Labor Commissioner acting in an essentially 21 executive branch function. 22 Here in our case, all they did was supply a 23 hearing room and a hearing officer, an adjudicatory 24 function. That's what the arbitrator is supposed to do, 25 is adjudicate the case. That's the distinction. And I
