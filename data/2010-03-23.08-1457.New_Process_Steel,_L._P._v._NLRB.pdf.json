One is here the government -- the board takes the position, as they say on page 29 in a footnote to their brief, that when a delegate group possessed of all of the board's power acts, it is acting as the board and not as an agent of the board. So first, we would say that the second quorum provision isn't even applicable to this group that was established -- of members Kirsanow, Liebman and Schaumber. And so we think the three-member quorum -­"

The government -- I'm sorry, \"the government.\" The NLRB in its brief in footnote 21 on page 29, as well as in the delegation, the minutes of the delegation in 2007, which are found in our brief in the appendix on -- I think it's pages 4a and 5a. Both say that when -- the NLRB says in the footnote \"When the delegee group possessed of all of the board's powers,\" which is what we have here, \"acts, it is acting as the board and not as an agent of the board. So our position is that when you become the board, as this group did, now you are subject to that minimum three-member delegee -- three member quorum requirement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But it's not an agent of the board because the three-member group that has a quorum of two has the full powers of the board. So the statute doesn't say anything about a three-member group that has a quorum of two being an agent of the board."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RICHIE",
    "speech": "It's a -- it's a group that is delegated authority, and therefore, whether it's a full delegation or partial delegation, we believe that the common law principles of agency and principal make that delegee group an agent."
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "RICHIE",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, it does not say the word \"agent\" in it. But the delegation that it's referring to is at common law a principal-agency relationship. So it's our position that once that delegation occurs that the -- in a normal situation, because you could have a three-member group of four members, a board of four or a board of five, and you could have a group with three members. When the delegation is made, it's our position and we believe that this is the position that the D.C. Circuit took as well, that that's an agent of the board."

    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "RICHIE",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it did say that. But it also went on to say that it was applying the rules, the common law rules of principal and agency, and that when the board without three members lost its authority to act, that the delegee group to which the delegation was made also lost authority to act. And in this case that's exactly what happened. We had a three-member board -- we actually had four delegate to three, and then two terms expired."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, just on this same point before Justice Breyer I think moves to another point. The statute does use the word \"quorum\" twice and, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, except that two members -- in its last phrase it uses the word \"quorum\" twice: \"Except that two members shall constitute a quorum.\" It doesn't say two members may act."

Quorum -- I think we agree within NLRB that a quorum is the minimum number of members of a body necessary to transact business. We have two different bodies defined in this statute. We have the board as one body and we have the group as a different body. And so when the -- when the exception appears in the statute, we agree again with the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of that as simply defining two different numbers of people necessary to fill out a quorum of these two different bodies that are defined within the statute."

Now, can the remaining four exercise the board's power?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "RICHIE",
    "speech": "Justice Breyer, the difference is that in this statute there is a clear statement that at all times the board must have a three-member quorum. In your hypothetical there were still four members."

    "speech": "Well, I know that, but I'm asking why does that make a difference?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RICHIE",
    "speech": "It makes a difference because the statute requires that at all times the board shall have a quorum of three members, a minimum quorum of three members."

    "speech": "Except."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "But isn't that tied to a quorum for the board as a whole to act? Once it's delegated a responsibility to a three-member board, it's already said, unless it takes another vote, that it's going to let those three people decide. It has -- I understand the word \"delegated\" to mean it's given over its power to a subgroup. If it wants to take it back, it needs a quorum to do that. That's what I understand."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RICHIE",
    "speech": "Well, I think the problem is, Justice Sotomayor, that the delegation to a group of three is indeed a valid delegation. We don't contest that. But what we have here is a phantom group. And what the -- what the board said, because member Kirsanow's term expired in December, about 11 days after the delegation. And if you look at the minutes of the board when they are delegating to the group, it says in the minutes that they \"are continuing to be a two-member quorum of a three-member group,\" as if member Kirsanow is a phantom . It's a fiction. The group ceases to exist and the board -- it's not just that the board falls below three and the board ceases to exist with all delegated powers to this group. The group ceases to exist."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "But that brings you back to Justice Breyer's hypothetical. There's five members on the board. Clearly they can delegate under the statute. Now there are only four members. Something happens to the fifth. Under your theory, the entity that originally delegated no longer exists and therefore the group, the entity that received the delegation of powers, must cease, must cease to act."

  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "RICHIE",
    "speech": "Well, we believe that the reason that it isn't, Justice Kennedy, the same is -­ terrible sentence. It's not the same because the statute contemplates vacancies on the board and multiple vacancies, so long as they don't go below three. The statute -- the vacancy clause in the statute doesn't apply to a group at all. So the delegating group in the hypothetical clearly is still in place as the board because it's the board that delegated. And the board still exists."

One is something that Justice Scalia was raising: It may work havoc as to what remains effective, what doesn't, what about the board staff decisions, which are, which aren't. I can see a lot of reasons for not doing it. But what are your best reasons for reading that vacancy clause the way you want me to read it?"

    "speaker": "RICHIE",

And what you have here is you have two members in a group and -- who have publicly announced that on more than one occasion over the last 2 years plus 3 months when this board has sat with only 2 members, that they have sometimes compromised their opinions in the interest of the institutional purposes, basically to keep the doors open. And so you don't have a full and robust debate. You don't have the potential for an expression of a dissenting view, and that's the -- that's the distinction that we see."

In 1947 when Taft-Hartley was passed, Congress intentionally increased the quorum and increased the size of the board. If it had intended to have only two members serve at any time as a two-member board, they would not -- that would be a strange way to do it, in a statute that not only increases the size of the board, but changes the minimum quorum requirement from two to three."

I think if the Court were inclined to -- to write a decision like that, we would try to look to, as you mentioned before, the de facto officer doctrine and the specific language of the delegations to the ALJ's and the specific language to the general counsels, to try to see if there is a way to preserve all of the board's action in this circumstance. Of course, that isn't before the Court at this point, but I understand that the dramatic consequences, potentially dramatic consequences of the D.C. Circuit's ruling, may inform the judgment."

And they said -- I'm reading from the appendix page 89 of our petition: The board forum requirement therefore must be satisfied regardless of whether the board's authority is delegated to a group of its members. A modifying phrase such as -- as this, talking about the \"at all times three members\" denotes that there is no instance in which the board forum requirement may be disregarded. And then the court said: \"It therefore defies logic as well as the text of the statute to argue as the board does that a Congress which explicitly imposed a requirement for a three-member quorum at all times would in the same sentence allow the board to reduce its operative quorum to two without further congressional authorization.\""
