1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 06-11206, Chambers v. United 5 States. 6 Mr. Hochman. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HOCHMAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. HOCHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Failure to report is not a violent felony 12 under the Armed Career Criminal Act because it presents 13 neither a serious potential risk of injury to others nor 14 involves violent and aggressive conduct. 15 The Government argues that failure to report 16 satisfies both the risk of injury and violent, 17 -aggressive conduct standards for the same reason: The 18 prospect that a offender will violently resist an arrest 19 -- resist arrest upon completion of the offense or upon 20 -- for having done the offense. That potential and that 21 potential risk alone is neither as a matter of fact nor 22 law sufficient to satisfy either the risk of injury or 23 the violent, aggressive conduct standard. 24 Beginning with the risk of injury: The 25 statute refers to a serious potential risk of injury,
3

1 and by using the word "serious" Congress indicated not 2 just any felony, not just any felony which carries 3 necessarily some risk of injury would be included. The 4 risk that must be generated must be one that's somehow 5 greater than, something that warrants singly out this 6 sort of offender as the sort of person who's deserving 7 of greater punishment for his recidivism. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it you 9 concede that a breakout as opposed to a failure to 10 report would be covered by the statute? 11 MR. HOCHMAN: Yes, Your Honor, I think it 12 would. I think that in fact one of the critical errors 13 that the courts of appeals have made and that the 14 Government made here is equating breakout, prison 15 escape, with failure to report. They are entirely 16 different. They are importantly different, both again 17 as a matter of analytically the categorical rule and 18 what would you look at to determine whether this sort of 19 person satisfied the violent and aggressive standard. 20 And we now know, in light of the Sentencing Commission's 21 report that was filed just last -- that was filed with 22 the Court just last week, that the risk of injury 23 associated with a prison breakout escape and failure to 24 report is dramatically different. And that mistake -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose it were shown
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 -- this is hypothetical. Suppose it were shown that 90 2 percent of all escapes under the escape statute were 3 breakouts involving weapons; 10 percent were failure to 4 report. Would that affect how we decide the case? 5 MR. HOCHMAN: This case? 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 7 MR. HOCHMAN: Well, since -- I think since 8 this is not a prison breakout case, I don't know whether 9 data about breakouts -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we look to the crime to 11 see generally whether or not it involves violence and 12 serious risk of harm? 13 MR. HOCHMAN: I think you -- I think the 14 categorical rule does require you to look at -15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that, in my 16 hypothetical, it would be a more difficult case than the 17 case we have here or would it be the same? 18 MR. HOCHMAN: I think in your hypothetical, 19 where a prison breakout-- where a prison breakout is 20 involved -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. My hypothetical is, 22 under the statute, if you look at the whole universe of 23 prosecutions under the escape statute, 90 percent of 24 them are for breakouts involving weapons. 25 MR. HOCHMAN: I don't think that you look to
5

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the universe under the escape statute. You can under 2 Shepard -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what we looked 4 to in Begay. 5 MR. HOCHMAN: But the issue under Shepard 6 and the approach under the categorical rule requires you 7 -- allows you to look at a narrower subsection of the 8 statute if the charging document and other reliable 9 indicia indicate that. And in this case, it's 10 undisputed that Mr. Chambers was convicted only of 11 failing to report. He was not convicted of the more 12 serious offense of prison breakout. And in fact in 13 Illinois they are punished at different levels, and the 14 evidence is absolutely clear -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe -- I don't 16 want to put words in his mouth, but I thought what 17 Justice Kennedy was asking is what if you have a statute 18 that is just escape or whatever and doesn't break it 19 down like that? At that point would we look to see what 20 the crime of escape was typically like, most of them 21 were breakout or most of them were the other thing? You 22 have, I gather, two separate provisions, but what if you 23 don't? 24 MR. HOCHMAN: Yes. And that -- that is a 25 difficult question under the categorical rule. I think
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that the first step would be to determine whether there 2 is anything in the record. Under Shepard, you can look 3 to other indications of whether the conduct at issue 4 that was found by the jury or that was pled to, either 5 from an indictment or from plea colloquy, whether there 6 is some more specific indication. If not, I think then 7 what you would look at -- and I think here you would 8 look at, to the extent you're looking at the risk -- on 9 the risk of injury side, you would look at the best 10 available information. If that -- if that gives you a 11 run of cases where you say typically -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. If 13 that's the case, I'm looking at 720 Illinois Statutes 14 5/31-6. It's reproduced a page 2a of the Government's 15 brief. And they don't -- it doesn't seem to be a 16 separate provision, whether it's a breakout or a failure 17 to report. 18 MR. HOCHMAN: But here the charging document 19 was clear, and under Shepard the charging document is 20 something you're also allowed to take into 21 consideration. And there is no doubt, under the 22 charging document, that he was convicted of merely 23 failing to report. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the sentence for 25 that?
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. HOCHMAN: It -- the sentence appears 2 that they extended his probation. He had to serve the 3 four weekends that he had failed -- for which he had 4 failed to report, and his probation was extended. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he didn't get any 6 extra jail time? 7 MR. HOCHMAN: He did not get any additional 8 jail time as far as I can tell from the record, Your 9 Honor. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is really a problem 11 about -- about what you suggest. It may destroy the 12 whole benefit of the categorical approach. I mean, you 13 can always shave something down to become a narrower 14 crime. An escape statute, for example, I suppose you 15 could look to see whether the particular escape in 16 question from the charging document was an escape that 17 used firearms or was an escape that, you know, that 18 injured or killed guards. And, you know, that gets us 19 into the case-by-case examination that it is the whole 20 purpose of the categorical approach to avoid. Now, how 21 do we -- how do we avoid getting to the bottom of that 22 slippery slope? 23 MR. HOCHMAN: I think this -- I think this 24 Court took that step in Shepard, and it did it in a very 25 narrow and circumscribed way. It did it by saying the
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 only things you're allowed to consider are things that 2 are as reliable as the charge itself and the elements 3 essential to -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I mean, the charge 5 mentions -- mentions a firearm. Anything that's in the 6 charge can be used to narrow the crime that we are 7 looking at. 8 MR. HOCHMAN: If the jury instructions were 9 clear, if it's clear that the jury had to find that the 10 presence of a firearm -- and I think it complicates -11 that is, I think some courts refer to it as the modified 12 categorical rule. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be an element of 14 the crime. If using a firearm is not an element of 15 escape, then I don't have to worry about it. 16 MR. HOCHMAN: If -- if -- correct. If it's 17 not an element in the sense that he either pled to it or 18 the jury necessarily found it as a necessary matter. 19 And that's really what Shepard says. It has to be 20 something that we necessarily know occurred from the 21 fact of conviction, and -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but it doesn't have 23 to be an element. So, if all the evidence in the case 24 was that, you know, he wrestled a gun from the guard and 25 made his way out of the prison that way, if the jury
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 found him guilty, that was the only basis on which it 2 could have found him guilty, that would be enough. 3 MR. HOCHMAN: I don't think that Shepard 4 permits you to look into trial transcripts of evidence 5 that was presented. It just says: What did the jury 6 necessarily find? And what I mean by "jury 7 instructions," how was the jury instructed? What did it 8 have to find? What did the jury have to find in order 9 to convict? 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that sounds like an 11 element. That sounds like an element. 12 MR. HOCHMAN: I think it is elements, but if 13 you look -14 JUSTICE ALITO: Well -15 MR. HOCHMAN: Please, continue. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: If you look at the cases 17 that we've had to decide under this statute in the last 18 couple of years, do you think they illustrate that the 19 categorical approach just doesn't work in this 20 situation? Because it puts us in a position for every 21 single crime that comes up here of making -- of trying 22 to ascertain what is the serious risk when we don't have 23 any empirical -- we don't have a number quantifying what 24 a serious risk is, nor can we generally find what the 25 risk is that's associated with a particular class of
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 cases. 2 Maybe when Congress enacted this they never 3 anticipated that it would be done on a categorical 4 basis. Why not just have a determination as to whether 5 there was a serious potential risk in this particular 6 case? So, if you have a -- a nonviolent person who 7 walks away, that's one thing. If you have somebody who 8 has a long list of convictions for violent -- violent 9 crimes and escapes, that's another situation. 10 MR. HOCHMAN: I think there are two problems 11 with that approach, Your Honor: First, as the Court 12 said in Shepard, the categorical rule, which was adopted 13 way back when the Court first confronted the statute and 14 has been consistently applied ever since, more or less 15 anticipated the Sixth Amendment Apprendi concerns that 16 might come from digging in and trying to attribute 17 conduct which has not been found by a jury, which 18 doesn't have that level of reliability, whether it's an 19 element or was on a special verdict form or some -- or 20 some other -- or was admitted to in a plea colloquy. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a separate 22 question? If it had -- if it has to be found by a jury, 23 it can be submitted to the jury? 24 MR. HOCHMAN: Well, if it was submitted to 25 the jury, then I think under Shepard it's something that
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 could be considered, and that would be part of what's 2 referred to as the modified categorical approach. I 3 think the problems with the categorical approach that 4 you're identifying, courts have tried and Shepard itself 5 in effect amended enough to provide some kind of 6 flexibility. 7 The other reason to hold back on such a sea 8 change is this is, after all, a statutory case and the 9 categorical rule has been this Court's approach from the 10 beginning. Congress could easily revise the statute. 11 If after 20 years it hasn't -12 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it could, and if it 13 had read these cases and it was paying attention to this 14 problem, you would think it would go through a list of 15 crimes and say, these fall within it and these don't 16 fall within it. But obviously it hasn't done that. 17 MR. HOCHMAN: I think that would make 18 everybody's job, the bar and this Court, much easier. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it might not, if it 20 just said "escape," and then you'd have this same 21 problem. 22 MR. HOCHMAN: That might be the case, 23 although if it just said "escape," I think I'd actually 24 have a substantially harder case than what we have here, 25 because what we have here doesn't resemble the kind of
12

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 violent, aggressive conduct that this Court in Begay 2 said is going to be the standard and exemplar of the 3 sort of conduct that Congress was thinking about. It 4 added -- this Court in Begay said that the serious 5 potential risk of injury is just one part of the 6 inquiry, that Congress was also singling out crimes 7 commit ted in a certain way, and if that, if that 8 requirement is going to have any bite, if it's going to 9 do the job of singling out and separating out cases, it 10 has to be something beyond the mere routine, 11 ever-present prospect that an offender might resist 12 arrest for having committed the offense after police 13 discover that he has done so. 14 And in fact if you step back for a moment 15 and just visualize -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely it depends upon how, 17 how, what should I say, how often that prospect is 18 realized. 19 MR. HOCHMAN: There is no doubt. There is 20 no doubt that the prospect -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the statute itself 22 lists robbery and robbery very often doesn't involve any 23 threat of injury, but all and all we think it does. 24 Obviously, Congress thought it did, right? 25 MR. HOCHMAN: Well in the -- I actually
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 think robbery would satisfy under the first clause 2 because it has as an element the use, attempted use, or 3 threatened use of physical force against another. But I 4 think the concern that escape is much more easily 5 detected than other crimes is obviously true. And so 6 the prospect that the offender will be arrested is 7 obviously greater than in other, in other crimes. 8 But the point is the standards, the standard 9 imposed by Begay and the notion that the conduct must be 10 violent and aggressive, if you step back and visualize 11 what it is about burglary, arson, extortion or the use 12 of explosives that can properly be characterized as 13 violent and aggressive, surely it is not the prospect 14 that an offender will have been found out for having 15 committed those offenses, police will be dispatched to 16 arrest them, and then the offender upon that 17 confrontation will violently resist arrest. It's 18 just -- it's not, it's not what those enumerated 19 offenses are doing in the statute. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to say 21 robbery. I meant to say burglary. Why is burglary 22 violent or aggressive? 23 MR. HOCHMAN: I think the reason is because 24 -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, burglary by its
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 nature is-- you do it at night. You don't want to be 2 detected. It's not violent or aggressive at all. It's 3 sneaky, is what it is. 4 MR. HOCHMAN: I assume that -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Robbery is violent or 6 aggressive. You're quite right about that. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: When you say burglary, if 8 you're at home, if you're at home it's going to get 9 violent and aggressive. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- that may be, 11 but it does not in its nature indicate violence or 12 aggressiveness. 13 MR. HOCHMAN: I think, Justice Souter, has 14 it exactly right. I think the reason why the Court in 15 Begay and Taylor, by the way, singled out burglary as 16 having some kind of inherent danger and potential for 17 violent and aggressive conduct associated with it is 18 because it involves an act of invading the space of 19 another, and cultural expectations and even common law 20 expectations about how others might respond suggest that 21 that scenario that you have willingly created, knowing 22 full well that another might respond violently to what 23 you've done in the event you've been detected -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: It gets you right back into 25 the soup. What you're saying is all it requires is that
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there be a potential for violence, for aggressiveness, 2 right? And that's what the Government says here: There 3 is a potential for violence and aggressiveness. 4 MR. HOCHMAN: What it -- what it requires is 5 the conscious creation of circumstances that you have 6 good reason to believe is going to ignite in violence. 7 And if we learned anything from the data that's been 8 submitted to the Court both by the Sentencing Commission 9 and by the Government, it's that there is very little 10 reason to believe that even the distant arrest scenario 11 for those who fail to report doesn't carry with it very 12 much of a risk of injury at all. In fact, in all the 13 materials that have been submitted to this Court, there 14 is not a single cited instance or case of an innocent 15 bystander or a police officer who has been injured in 16 connection with a confrontation from arrest for failure 17 to report. There are none. 18 Now to be sure, there are some instances of 19 violent confrontation and I'm not here saying it's 20 impossible that there would be injury associated with an 21 arrest scenario. The point is it's nothing different. 22 There is nothing in the record that would give us any 23 reason to believe this is the kind of special violent 24 conduct that Congress was singling out for special 25 treatment. I should also add that excluding failure to
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 report from the statute isn't going to create any kind 2 of crack through which the sort of people the Government 3 appears to be concerned about might fall through. And 4 the reason it this. The several anecdotal cases they 5 cite in their brief and a couple of the cases that 6 Massachusetts reported back to them which had involved 7 some kind of violent resisting arrest, those individuals 8 were charged, separately charged for assault and battery 9 and similar crimes on a police officer. It's 10 unsurprising that when that happens, those individuals 11 will be separately charged and convicted for their 12 violent conduct. 13 So the only work that is done by sweeping 14 away the categorical rule, doing serious damage to the 15 categorical rule, undermining Begay, the only work 16 that's done is to encompass people who we have reason to 17 believe didn't engage in violent conduct. That seems to 18 me a strange way to interpret the statute, certainly not 19 the sort of things this Court would want to close its 20 eyes to. 21 The last thing, Your Honors. It's important 22 to preserve the distinction in Begay between the violent 23 and aggressive standard on the one hand and the risk of 24 injury on the other hand, and Government's approach 25 collapses it. The Government says, why is this violent
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and aggressive? Because in their view we can -2 falsely, as we've discussed, but because in their view 3 there is a sufficient risk of injury on arrest. If 4 that's going to be the case, if you're going to be able 5 to show conduct is violent and aggressive simply because 6 there is a sufficient risk of injury associated with it, 7 the violent and aggressive conduct standard does 8 nothing. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't square with 10 the answer you gave me with regard to burglary. If what 11 you just said is true, burglary wouldn't be among the 12 listed crimes. 13 MR. HOCHMAN: No. The distinction I'm 14 drawing here is the act that you take of invading 15 somebody else's space and the prospect -- what you're 16 doing is you're consciously taking an act fully aware 17 that violence might ensue, which suggests that you are 18 the sort of person who is comfortable in a violent 19 situation or at least dangerously comfortable in such a 20 violent situation, regardless of how frequently that -21 that circumstance actually is realized. You're the sort 22 of person who has taken an action that expresses comfort 23 with that sort of situation. 24 Failing to report -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So invading
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 someone's space, so trespass would be covered by this 2 statute? You're invading someone's space. 3 MR. HOCHMAN: If it's -- if it's felonious, 4 trespass might be. You're invading someone's space in 5 the circumstance where the response is -- I think there 6 is a decent argument for trespass if for no other reason 7 than the act itself, on the violence and aggressive 8 standard side, the act itself is more or less the same 9 as burglary. It's not as if you can immediately tell 10 from observing the burglar enter the structure that he 11 has the intent, the requisite intent to commit another 12 crime. 13 But the other reason why I doubt that 14 trespass might be -- might satisfy the standard is 15 because there may not -- there doesn't appear to be a 16 serious potential risk of injury. The second -- the 17 other requirement may not be satisfied. I just don't 18 have any information about that. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that the 20 failing to report is not violent and aggressive and 21 therefore, no matter what degree of risk the statistics 22 might show, it would not qualify? 23 MR. HOCHMAN: I'm making both arguments, 24 Your Honor. But yes, that is one, that is one of them. 25 If there are no further questions, I'll
19

1 reserve the remainder of my time. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 3 Mr. Roberts. 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS 5 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 6 MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 7 please the Court: 8 Failure-to-report escape qualifies as a 9 violent felony under the ACCA's residual clause because 10 it creates a serious potential risk of physical injury 11 that's comparable in both kind and degree to the risk 12 that's created by the enumerated offense of burglary. 13 Failure-to-report escape is similar in kind to burglary 14 because it's purposeful, violent, and aggressive in the 15 same way as burglary. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, wouldn't 17 that be so of any crime? This is failure to report. 18 Any crime, any -- an arrest for any crime has a certain 19 risk that the arrestee is going to resist. Is there 20 anything different, is anything greater, about this 21 arrest for this kind of crime? 22 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. Two points 23 on that. First, escape and failure-to-report escape, 24 other types of escape and recapture, are linked ed in a 25 way that arrest and the typical crime aren't, because
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 escape inherently avoids -- inherently involves the 2 avoidance of custody and custody is the very obligation 3 that recapture is trying to impose. But avoiding arrest 4 isn't an element of the typical crime, so the connection 5 between arrest and the ordinary crime isn't close enough 6 to justify considering the violence in arrest -- in the 7 arrest in whether the crime is violent. Also the risk 8 -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Say that again. I didn't 10 understand it. 11 MR. ROBERTS: Okay. What I'm saying is it's 12 an element of escape that you're avoiding custody, and 13 escape is a continuing offense and so it doesn't end 14 until the avoidance of custody is over. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: What's that got to do with 16 increasing the risk of violence? I mean, I see -- I see 17 your kind of elements argument, but it seems to be 18 beside the point that -19 MR. ROBERTS: It shows the close connection 20 between the two. And so when you're -- when the 21 offender is committing the crime, it's appropriate to 22 hold him accountable for what he can see is so highly, 23 closely connected to the crime and which, in fact, has 24 to happen in order to end the crime; whereas -25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the crime is still
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 -- the crime that we are concerned with here is still 2 essentially a passive crime. He just doesn't show up. 3 MR. ROBERTS: Well -4 JUSTICE SOUTER: And given, you know, the 5 close logical connections, I don't see that the close 6 logical connections convert the passive crime into a 7 higher degree of resisting arrest from any other. In 8 fact, it suggests just the opposite. 9 MR. ROBERTS: To address the -- the passive 10 point, deliberately failing to comply with your legal 11 duty to report to prison is not -- it is not doing 12 nothing, as Petitioner says. It's not purely passive. 13 It is a criminal act. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know, you may 15 precisely be doing nothing. If I say, you know, it's 16 Monday morning at 9 o'clock, I'm supposed to -- to 17 report to prison, and I'm going to stay home, my purpose 18 is to stay put in my armchair. That's purposeful 19 conduct and it's about as passive as you can get. 20 MR. ROBERTS: It's purposefully inviting the 21 violent confrontation when the law enforcement officers 22 come to terminate -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can say the same thing 24 about failure to respond to a traffic ticket. 25 MR. ROBERTS: No. Because in -- in failure
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to respond to the traffic ticket the -- first of all, 2 it's not clear that somebody is going to come after you 3 and try to physically bring you in. 4 Second of all, the offender isn't expecting 5 them and on edge and prone to react violently. 6 Third, he hasn't demonstrated already that 7 he is unwilling to submit to custody. And the fact that 8 -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The offender is 10 prone to react violently if he doesn't respond to a 11 traffic ticket? 12 MR. ROBERTS: No. I'm saying just the 13 opposite of that. I'm saying that it's different 14 because here you've got somebody who is expecting the 15 police to come. He is looking over his shoulder all the 16 time. He knows they know he didn't come to prison. He 17 knows they know who he is. They probably know where he 18 is. If he is sitting at home, they know where he is. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your 20 understanding of the Illinois statute? It is, I take 21 it, only triggered by failure to report for confinement? 22 MR. ROBERTS: This -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about like, you 24 know, you've got to see your probation officer every -25 MR. ROBERTS: This offense that he was

1 convicted of is failure to report to a penal 2 institution, failure to report to prison. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you concede the 4 probation or parole situation? 5 MR. ROBERTS: I think a probation violation 6 is different -- different circumstances. It doesn't 7 involve the same refusal to submit to custody that this 8 offense involves, which -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we need not so 10 many -- not so much statistics about how many times 11 violence results, but statistics about how serious the 12 police are about picking somebody up? 13 MR. ROBERTS: I don't think you really need 14 the statistics, Your Honor. I think it's a common -15 it's common sense that the police are going to make 16 vigorous efforts to recapture people who fail to show up 17 to prison the way they are supposed to. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not common sense 19 that the person who has been guilty of a crime so 20 gentlemanly that they only made him report to prison on 21 the weekends would confront the policeman with violence 22 when he comes. This is not normally what you think of 23 as a violent type who has -- who has been told to report 24 weekends to the prison. 25 MR. ROBERTS: Well --

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: But did he get additional 2 time, by the way, when -- when they finally brought him 3 back? 4 MR. ROBERTS: When he was sentenced -- when 5 he was convicted of escape, he was sentenced to six 6 months in prison -- in jail, that was stayed; probation 7 for 30 months, and he violated his probation and he 8 ended up in jail for 5 years. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: So he just -- he just had 10 to make up the weekends that he had lost? 11 MR. ROBERTS: No. He didn't just have to 12 make up the weekends that he had lost. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what Mr. Hochman 14 told us -15 MR. ROBERTS: I know that, Your Honor. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- when I asked that 17 question. 18 MR. ROBERTS: But I don't think that's 19 accurate for the sentence for escape. On page 113 to 20 114 of this JA, Your Honor, which is the -- the PSR 21 describing what happened for this offense, it says that 22 he has 30 months probation. It's in the second volume, 23 the volume under seal. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this guy doesn't 25 sound to me like Jack the Ripper. He really doesn't.

1 MR. ROBERTS: You know, we are not supposed 2 to be looking at the individual offender here. It's the 3 categorical approach. But he had been convicted of 4 robbery and aggravated battery, Your Honor. So he -- he 5 is not somebody who has not done any violent crimes, 6 either. And what's -- what's different is that he has 7 now deliberately failed to comply with his legal duty to 8 report. He has now deliberately resisted custody, so -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But would the statute 10 apply if -- say he is supposed to go in on the weekends. 11 Instead, he goes out on a binge, and then he voluntarily 12 comes in on a Monday morning saying, yes, I failed to 13 report, and so here I am. 14 MR. ROBERTS: First of all, while he is out 15 on the binge, people could be coming and looking for him 16 and the violent confrontation could occur. 17 Second of all, even if in the unusual case of somebody 18 who comes in voluntarily hours late, a few days late, 19 there wasn't a -- a risk of -- of violence, which we 20 think there can be, but even if there was none, it 21 wouldn't matter because you're applying the categorical 22 approach here. And what you don't look at -- you don't 23 look at the unusual case. You look at the elements of 24 the offense in the ordinary case. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you -- can you tell

ROBERTS: I -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do you think they 21 automatically file it every time; and if not, how do 22 they define it? 23 MR. ROBERTS: I think generally that -- that 24 they look at the conduct that's been committed and they 25 -- that the policy is to charge the -- the maximum

1 charges that are supported by what the -- what the 2 defendant has done. But here you don't have -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do they ever look at the 4 -- do they ever look at the attorney? This attorney has 5 been giving us a hard time, and we ought to show him 6 that we really mean business? Do they look at the 7 nature of the -- the identity of the counsel of the 8 defendant? Do they ever look at that? 9 MR. ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm not aware of that. 10 I can't -- can't speak to the -- the fact that they 11 would do that, Your Honor. But here you've got in the 12 ACCA, you're got not one previous violation for escape; 13 you've got three violent felonies that you have to have. 14 And this was his third one with -- in addition to 15 robbery and aggravated battery and in addition to 16 distributing cocaine within a thousand feet of public 17 housing. And so we are not talking about -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood your 19 friend -- excuse me. I understood your friend to say 20 that you don't have a single example of failure to 21 report leading to a violent confrontation. 22 MR. ROBERTS: That's -- that's also 23 incorrect, Your Honor. Two of the four cases that we 24 cited in our -- in our brief, in our anecdotes, involved 25 injury to innocent bystanders. It's true we didn't

ROBERTS: We have those two examples. I 8 mean, I haven't gone out and looked for other cases. 9 Those are just two out of the four that we cited. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You haven't gone out 11 and looked for other -- I'm sorry. You haven't gone out 12 and looked for other cases? I thought you -13 MR. ROBERTS: In -- in addition to those, 14 no. I -- I went to get some sample cases. I haven't 15 gone to see if I could find more cases of those. In 16 addition, in the Massachusetts data there are -- there 17 are two of the 18. Admittedly, the sample is small in 18 Massachusetts -19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts -20 MR. ROBERTS: But it's 11 percent of the 21 people violently resisted, and they were charged with 22 assault and battery on a police officer. I think that 23 that's indicative of possible injury. And in any case 24 the question is -25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts, have you had
29

1 occasion to look at the -- the recent figures compiled 2 by the Sentencing Commission? 3 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. And I think 4 that the Sentencing Commission data also supports -5 although, again, the -- the sample size is small. But 6 the question here is: Is there a potential risk? And 7 what the sentencing data shows for the failure-to-report 8 escapees is that 7.1 -9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the magnitude of the 10 risk relevant? Suppose it happens one out of 10,000 11 times or 99 out of 100 times. Are they different cases? 12 MR. ROBERTS: We don't think that you should 13 be looking at the statistics at -- at all, Your Honor. 14 But -- and so -- I mean, you know, that's our -- our 15 fundamental point is that -- that the ACCA requires a 16 potential risk. The James case illustrates that you 17 decide these cases without statistics. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the potential risk is 19 based on an empirical assessment. What's -- how can we 20 make an empirical assessment without statistics? 21 MR. ROBERTS: What James says is that you 22 try to assess whether the degree of risk is comparable 23 to the degree of risk presented by one of the enumerated 24 offenses. And, as you did in James -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that's based on
30

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 our experience because we have these cases; we've been 2 lawyers; we know what they usually involve. We have 3 some sort of a -4 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- an instinct or a basis 6 for making a judgment. 7 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If statistics can inform 9 that, why ignore the statistics? 10 MR. ROBERTS: I'm not saying that you should 11 ignore the statistics, but the statistics are neither 12 necessary nor dispositive. And I don't think the 13 statistics cast any doubt on the commonsense conclusion 14 based on some of the factors I was talking about before, 15 about why there's a potential for violence during -16 JUSTICE SOUTER: But your argument goes 17 simply to whether there is potential and the statute 18 says "serious potential." Which gets us, it seems to 19 me, to the point that Justice Kennedy is making, and 20 that is, we've got to have something more than an 21 instinctive belief that something bad might happen. 22 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think James addresses 23 that, Your Honor. And James says that in deciding 24 whether you have a serious potential, you look to the 25 enumerated offenses and you determine if they can be
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 comparable. 2 JUSTICE SOUTER: They were taking as 3 examples cases in which there was serious potential. 4 But in any event, you can't lose sight of the modifier. 5 It has got to be more than a so-called "potential risk." 6 MR. ROBERTS: It has -- it has to be more 7 than a potential. It has to be serious in the sense 8 that it's similar in degree, comparable in degree, to 9 one of the enumerated offenses. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: What one are we to do 11 with -- Justice Stevens -- I think you should address 12 the statistics in the sentencing report. 13 MR. ROBERTS: Okay. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: As I read them, they put 15 together -- if you put together failing to report and 16 failing to return, you get 160 cases in their sample. 17 And the number of those cases, whether you looked at the 18 time when he had left or whether you looked at the time 19 he was apprehended, in which force was involved is zero. 20 The number of cases in which injury was involved is 21 zero. The number of cases where he had a dangerous 22 weapon is five. 23 MR. ROBERTS: That's right. And -24 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now there we 25 are.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. ROBERTS: It's a 3.1 percent -- 3.1 2 percent rate of having this dangerous weapon when he is 3 being -- being taken into custody for -- for this 4 offense. And, you know, looking at the -- at the 5 failure-to-report people, which is what this person is 6 charged of, of those 42 people, that was 7.1 percent of 7 those people that had a weapon. And if one of those 8 people had used that weapon, that would have been a 2.4 9 percent chance of injury. 10 Now, I'm saying the sample size is small, 11 and this shows why it's dangerous to put too much weight 12 on it. But that would have been a 2.4 percent rate of 13 injury. And in Tennessee v. Garner, this Court cited a 14 statistic in the 1970s about the risk of violence during 15 burglary. And this was household burglary, which you 16 think might be likely -17 JUSTICE BREYER: You had every opportunity, 18 when we have 160 cases out of the universe -- I guess I 19 don't know what the universe is, but sampling proceeds 20 through a small amount of cases. And you could, of 21 course, criticize the Sentencing Commission effort if 22 you have the statistician or someone who will tell us 23 that that sampling was not an appropriate method to 24 proceed. Is there any such person? 25 MR. ROBERTS: Well, no, Your Honor. And I'm
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 not criticizing it. I'm saying that you have to take 2 into account the sample size and you have to take into 3 account that there are -4 JUSTICE BREYER: No. Why -- that was my 5 question. Why take into account the sample size in the 6 absence of a statistician who would tell us that the 7 sample size is too small to reach the conclusion that 8 the commission reaches? 9 MR. ROBERTS: Because my point is that -10 take the 42 failure-to-report people, which is the 11 offense here, okay. Three of them -- three of those 42, 12 had guns. If one of those three had used the gun, that 13 would have been a use of force, an instance of actual 14 violence. 15 That percentage -- I'm not -- I'm not 16 questioning the statistical validity of anything. I'm 17 taking it on its terms. That's a 2.4 percent statistic 18 there. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they didn't use a gun. 20 MR. ROBERTS: 3.8 percent in -- in household 21 burglary. So I just think that -- that the statistics 22 are -- are very low, the risk of actual violence in 23 burglary as well. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, counsel. 25 One of my colleagues was trying to ask a question.
34
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: The problem is you say if 2 he had used a gun. And he didn't use a gun. I mean, to 3 come up with your statistics on the basis of something 4 that didn't happen is not using statistics; it's using 5 imagination. 6 MR. ROBERTS: Well, Your Honor, the statute 7 again talks about the potential risk. It doesn't talk 8 about the actual use of force or the actual injury. The 9 actual use of force is covered by clause one -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think those 11 statistics show a greater danger than the dangers from 12 drunk driving that were involved in Begay? 13 MR. ROBERTS: No. But I think the drunk 14 driving -- that what concerned the Court about drunk 15 driving was that the crime is a strict liability crime. 16 It didn't involve deliberate conduct. This conduct is 17 purposeful. Petitioner doesn't -- doesn't contest that. 18 And the situation here is a different kind of risk. 19 It's like the risk in burglary. It's the deliberate 20 commission of the crime despite the clear risk of an 21 ensuing violent confrontation. 22 And so, the parallel, there really isn't a 23 parallel to the strict liability crime there, where the 24 injury -- the Court said in Begay there is a serious 25 risk of injury. The problem is that the crime is just
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 not purposeful, so it doesn't show this willingness to 2 harm others. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that's 4 the point. Begay talked about purposeful violent 5 conduct, not just purposeful conduct. 6 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. But you have 7 to -- you have to talk about the violent conduct in 8 context. And what it said is that all these enumerated 9 crimes are violent crimes. But burglary is violent not 10 because the violence is some element of the offense. 11 There is nothing about the elements of the offense 12 that's violent. What makes burglary violent is the fact 13 that the offender deliberately commits it, even though 14 he knows it could trigger this violent confrontation. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The distinction between 16 this crime and crimes in general is that this person has 17 shown that he or she doesn't want to go back into 18 custody, is that -19 MR. ROBERTS: I think it's -- it's numerous 20 things, but the avoidance of custody is sort of a 21 categorical difference between this and all the other 22 crimes, Your Honor. It's an element of this crime that 23 he is doing that. 24 That also factors into the fact that the 25 risk of violence during recapture is going to be greater
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 than the risk of violence in apprehending an ordinary 2 criminal for several different related reasons. One -3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- there was, 4 this case comes to us from the Seventh Circuit, right? 5 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And am I correct in 7 understanding that since this case was decided, the 8 Seventh Circuit has changed its position and has gone 9 the other way? 10 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. The Seventh Circuit 11 thought that applying the purposeful, violent and 12 aggressive requirement of Begay required a different 13 result because it -- it thought that it meant that the 14 crime had to involve violent conduct itself; and it 15 didn't appreciate the point I was making before, that 16 burglary doesn't involve that violent conduct itself, 17 and that burglary is violent because of the prospect of 18 the violent confrontation. 19 And so, that's the -- that's what led the 20 Seventh Circuit astray the second time around. But it 21 -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The first time around, 23 didn't one of the judges suggest that there ought to be 24 a study comparing the frequency of violence in escapes 25 from custody to the frequency of violence in failure to
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 report, and isn't that what we now have from the 2 Sentencing Commission? 3 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. They did ask for -- for 4 statistics. But I would stress again why we think 5 that -- that looking to statistics as some kind of a 6 requirement is, you know, both perilous and not required 7 by the statute: One, because the statute requires just 8 potential risk, not actual injury. 9 Two, because these data are just generally 10 not going to be available. And you don't have even the 11 baseline for the other crimes, the enumerated crimes, 12 really to compare it to. And so the result, if you 13 start looking around for statistics and saying we need 14 these statistics to do it, is that virtually no crimes 15 are going to qualify under the residual clause. 16 And obviously, that isn't what Congress 17 intended when it adopted this broad residual clause. 18 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I -- may I -- may I ask 19 you just to get some sense about what will qualify? I 20 mean, I think we -- we all agree that the risk of 21 violence in arrest is probably going to vary depending 22 on -- categorically depending on the crimes. 23 I think I would probably agree that 24 white-collar crimes are not likely to -- to carry a very 25 high risk of violence on arrest. So I -- there's one
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 category. Can you think of others, other categories 2 outside of white-collar crime, that are going to have a 3 lower risk of arrest than, say, the failure-to-report 4 category? 5 MR. ROBERTS: What -- we wouldn't sweep in 6 any crimes based on arrest if the crimes don't 7 themselves involve as part of the crime the avoidance of 8 custody, because that shows the close link between the 9 crime that I was explaining before. That's sort of the 10 categorical difference, although I would agree with you, 11 certainly, that in white-collar crimes in many cases the 12 offender is going to submit voluntarily to custody; they 13 are not even going to come after him. And he hasn't 14 done anything to show his likelihood to resist in any 15 way, and so there is going to be a significantly less 16 connection there. 17 Violent crimes where you might think that 18 there is going to be a higher incidence are going to be 19 covered based on the violence of the crime, anyway. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: They are going to be in 21 category one. 22 MR. ROBERTS: Right. They are going to be 23 covered already. 24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 25 MR. ROBERTS: So you know, one, we think
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there is a categorical difference between this kind of 2 crime which has as an element avoidance custody, and all 3 of the ordinary crimes that you're talking about. But 4 even if you go and set that aside and don't draw that 5 categorical line, and you look at, well, what's the risk 6 of violence, here what you've got is you've got you know 7 that they are going to come after him; he knows they are 8 coming; he is already deliberately, he has already 9 indicated his unwillingness to submit to custody; they 10 know that; so they come prepared for resistance. And in 11 Illinois he is by definition a recidivist felon if he 12 has committed this crime, and those are characteristics 13 that are particularly indicative of dangerousness. So 14 we think this sets it quite apart from other crimes in 15 terms of the risk of violence that -- that we are 16 talking about. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you happen to know how 18 many additional crimes are likely to raise issues like 19 this under the residual clause? 20 MR. ROBERTS: Not -- you know, how many 21 could be covered altogether? Or -22 JUSTICE ALITO: Well after we decide this 23 case, how many more cases like this do you anticipate 24 that we're -- we may get under ACCA? 25 MR. ROBERTS: Well I'm hopeful that the
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Court won't have to decide too many other cases with the 2 guidance that will be given by Begay and James and 3 now -- and now this case. 4 So, you know, it has been -- this case, the 5 Court took; it had been holding the case for Begay and 6 it took it rather than vacating and remanding. So it's 7 not as if this is a case where some conflict has 8 developed after the Court was taken to resolve. We 9 think -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts, I'm sorry; do 11 you think a soldier who is AWOL commits a violent crime? 12 MR. ROBERTS: I think a soldier that goes 13 AWOL -- I mean, the soldier that goes AWOL does probably 14 invite somebody to come after them. It's a little bit 15 harder case here because he is not somebody who is a 16 recidivist felon. 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he has to be a 18 recidivist. This is one of three offenses for an 19 aggravated sentence. You never have the isolated 20 question. 21 MR. ROBERTS: Well, when he did it first -22 he could have done it in his first crime. So you don't 23 know when did this that he had the other two counting 24 under the ACCA. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: It would only be a crime
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 if it's his third crime and not if it's his first. 2 MR. ROBERTS: Well, you don't look to the 3 individual person; we're looking to the ordinary case 4 and we know from the elements here that you have a 5 recidivist -- you have a recidivist felon. I do think 6 that there is a risk of -- you know, there is a risk of 7 violent confrontation when a soldier goes AWOL, Your 8 Honor. 9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Sure. 10 MR. ROBERTS: I just don't think it's quite 11 as -- as clear a risk as it is -- as it is here, but you 12 know, I would have to say that there is some risk. Yes. 13 The -- if I could just address something 14 that Justice Kennedy had raised before about statutes 15 unlike Illinois's statute that has a -- that generally 16 prohibit escape. One -- one possible problem that could 17 arise from a holding that offenses like failure to 18 report are not violent felonies is that a statute that 19 broadly covered escape, the result would be that jail 20 break escapes would not be violent felonies under that 21 statute, because the statistics that are out there 22 suggest that 89 percent of all escapes are either 23 walkaways or failure to report. 24 And so unless the charging document 25 specifically charged it as a jail break escape, then the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 general -- something that was charged under the general 2 escape statute would not qualify for coverage under the 3 ACCA. 4 And aside from that, if the Court has no 5 further questions, we could ask that the judgment of the 6 Court of Appeals be affirmed. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 8 Mr. Hochman, you have 11 minutes remaining. 9 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HOCHMAN 10 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 11 MR. HOCHMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 12 Just to begin with where Mr. Roberts left 13 off, most states in fact do distinguish in their 14 statutes between failure to report and prison break 15 escapes. These are cited by both parties in the briefs 16 and you can review them, but there are clear 17 distinctions in the law. So the risk that prison break 18 escape is somehow going to escape -- escape, if you 19 will, from the scope of the statute as a result of a 20 reversal is -- is unfounded. 21 Just to make a couple of things clear. 22 First of all with respect to the sentence, Justice 23 Ginsburg, the -- he was sentenced to six additional 24 months but it was stayed as -- as was mentioned; and so 25 when I was answering that question he did not serve
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 additional time as a result of that, and that's what I 2 was referring to. 3 If you look at the sentencing transcript, 4 that's where the indication is that he did in fact serve 5 out four additional weekends. It's not noted in the -6 it's not noted as an additional sentence, punishment for 7 it. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was he serving those 9 weekends for? What was the crime? 10 MR. HOCHMAN: That was the armed robbery -11 the robbery crime, not armed robbery, the robbery crime. 12 That's the first predicate offense here. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: He just gets weekends for 14 that? How many weekends? 15 MR. HOCHMAN: 11. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Pretty good deal. 17 (Laughter.) 18 MR. HOCHMAN: Second, with respect to the 19 anecdotal cases, you know, we looked at them; you could 20 look at them. If there are two instances where there 21 are injury -- there are two instances where there are 22 injury, I didn't catch that, and I apologize if I 23 misspoke. 24 But it doesn't change the core of the 25 problem, which is that the anecdotal evidence
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 produced -- and that dates back all the way to 1977, 2 they looked back at cases -- they are covering on 3 extraordinary broad period of time in looking for this 4 stuff, and there is just not -- there is not a lot 5 there, if there is anything there at all, with respect 6 to injury associated with failure to report. 7 On the core substance of their argument, 8 Mr. Roberts emphasized that failing to report has as an 9 element avoiding arrest, avoiding confinement. I don't 10 actually think that's right. There is nothing about 11 concealment. There is nothing about hiding. There is 12 nothing about seeking to escape from a police officer 13 who comes to bring you back. He just didn't go; and in 14 fact we don't -- the record doesn't explain why; but you 15 know, it was the November to December period. It's the 16 holiday period of time for people when they, obviously, 17 for a variety of reasons might prefer to spend time with 18 their families. Whatever the reason was -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Statistics show that 20 the number of robberies increases during the holiday 21 season. He just needed to get -22 (Laughter.) 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought he did this 24 four times. I thought there were four. 25 MR. HOCHMAN: There were four periods from
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the end of November, four consecutive weekends from the 2 end of November into December. There is no indication, 3 Mr. Chief Justice, that any further robberies were 4 committed during that period. But the point is -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is no 6 indication he meant to spend time with his family over 7 the holidays. 8 (Laughter.) 9 MR. HOCHMAN: Not in the record. It's 10 absolutely not in the record, Your Honor. No doubt. 11 But the point is that while Mr. Roberts stood up and 12 said it's about avoiding arrest; it's about concealing 13 yourself; it's the sort of person that's prone to react 14 violently; the fact is, that's speculation; and 15 everything we know from the sentencing commission and 16 from their own efforts suggests the contrary. And 17 indeed even the dangerous weapon findings of the 18 sentencing commission, I think, should be excluded, 19 because under the guidelines, the mere possession of a 20 weapon is not a violent felony. 21 A felon in possession is not -- cannot be a 22 predicate offense under the guidelines. And so the mere 23 possession of a weapon, which is all you have on those 24 five instances -- by the way, the fact that they did not 25 double-count them as also including four suggests they
46

1 weren't used in any way, they weren't brandished in any 2 way. It's just not there. There is really nothing 3 there to support the Government's speculation.
