  {
    "speaker": "WAXMAN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The complaint in this case alleges that a national bank charged excessive interest. This Court has held repeatedly and consistently since 1875 that section 30 of the National Bank Act of 1864 provides both the exclusive standards governing the interest that a national bank may charge and the exclusive judicial remedies for any violation. And as a result, any claim that a national bank charged excessive interest necessarily arises under Federal law, whether that claim is brought in State court or Federal court. Any well-pleaded complaint would reflect that, and therefore, any claim of usury against a national bank, whether pleaded well or mistakenly or deceptively, falls within the original jurisdiction of the Federal courts and may either be filed there by a plaintiff or removed there by a defendant."

Let's say, it -- it creates a cause of action against the owners and -- and managers of nuclear facilities, but the cause of action must be based on something more than mere negligence. It has to be intentional malfeasance or gross negligence. Okay? Now, what if somebody comes in and brings a cause of action in State court, alleging mere negligence by the owners of the nuclear facility? Is it your position that that case is removable even though it wouldn't -- it wouldn't survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under -- under Federal law?"

The Federal statute says it has to be knowingly under section 86.

And if, when the court reads the complaint, it says there is a Federal question necessarily presented in here which has been inartfully not pleaded, the court then proceeds to adjudicate on the merits that claim. If the answer is no, if the answer is, hey, this guy pleaded a claim under State law and I have well pleaded it and it still doesn't raise a Federal question, then you remand. And it's that -- that's sort of -- I didn't mean to quibble with you, but the principle that we suggest is very straightforward is simply an application of this Court's decided jurisprudence, under arising-under jurisdiction, that removal jurisdiction follows original jurisdiction."

And the -- the perplexing thing about this case is the sort of almost Kafkaesque situation that we have that's exemplified by the amicus briefs on both sides where this particular instance where the plaintiff says usury under State law even though the Supreme -- this -- this Court has decided, since 11 years after the act was passed in the Civil War, that there is no such State claim, we now have a -- a group of plaintiffs' lawyers from California urging this Court to establish a right to plead something that in their own case they say is only, quote, defensively preempted."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If they had pled it correctly, they could still be in State court, but the defendant could remove. In other words, this is not -- although it's a Federal claim -- it arises only under Federal law -- it could be brought in State court or Federal court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WAXMAN",
    "speech": "Correct. There is concurrent jurisdiction as there -- as is the norm, as this Court has explained. And there are instances in which these cases are litigated to the merits in State court and instances in which they're litigated in Federal court either because they're brought there by the plaintiff, as the plaintiff could have here, or they're removed there as the defendant. And the other principle that this case reflects, as I said, is not just the importance of parity in Federal question jurisdiction between giving plaintiffs and defendants parity in invoking the Federal courts if they choose, but the requirement that this Court has stated over and over and over again that in -- in determining its own jurisdiction, the Federal court will construe the complaint as well-pleaded."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Waxman, one thing that troubles me about -- about the proposal that you make and that the Government makes is that it seems to me in the LMRA case that established this principle and in the ERISA case, which is the only other case that has -- has held to the same effect, those cases refer to this as being an extraordinary, an unusual event. But I don't think it's going to be an unusual event if we say that whenever there is created a Federal cause of action, and at the same time, State causes of action are preempted, it may be removed to Federal court. I don't think that will be unusual at all. And I sort of looked upon the -- the Labor Management Relations Act case as really sort of a -- a platypus, I mean, a very strange case in which the courts just didn't want these labor things to go into State courts because they didn't trust State courts. And so they said, boy, we're going to have Federal courts create this whole new law of -- of contracting, of collective bargaining. That's how I always regarded it. And now you're telling me it's really just a little piece of a much broader proposition which is not at all -- not at all narrow."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WAXMAN",
    "speech": "No. Justice Scalia, I think it actually is very, very narrow. And we can go through in detail, but almost all of the statutory schemes that the -- the State's amicus brief cites are not, in fact, examples of complete preemption. But it -- it comes up only in the instance where there is not only substantive preemption by Federal law and the creation of a Federal cause of action, but the determination that that cause of action is, in fact, exclusive. And that is the difficult and close question that this Court --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it is not a white horse case for you, that one."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WAXMAN",
    "speech": "I think it is a -- if I understand the reference, I think it is a white horse case in the sense -- in this sense, Mr. Chief Justice. We're not contending that the 1864 act evinced an intent to make these causes of action removable, even if pleaded under State law, because there was no general Federal question jurisdiction, and it wasn't provided in the law. The relevant question and the relevant question that this Court deemed to be close in Metropolitan Life in the ERISA context is whether -- okay, fine, Federal law has substantively preempted the field or by conflict or whatever. Is the creation of the Federal cause of action of such force that it should be deemed to be exclusive? And that, I think, is what this Court decided first in Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank by saying to the borrower in that case -- the borrower was maintaining that under New York State law, it was entitled to void not -- to forfeit not just the interest, but the note. And this Court said, look, New York State law has nothing to do with this. This is a claim of usury by a national bank. The Federal standards are exclusive, and the Federal penalty expressly will not permit forfeiture of the note. Only the interest."

The two cases that we have so far where we have recognized that there is only a Federal cause of action, that cause of action could have been brought just as well in State court, but it's up to the defendant to remove it. So we're not talking about an exclusive Federal forum."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WAXMAN",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And -- and I suppose one reason -- I was surprised when I went through. I thought there would be a whole lot of exclusive Federal cause of action, and -- and there are very few. But I suppose one of the reasons we don't get it very often is just what Justice Ginsburg said. There are other provisions where there's an exclusive Federal forum."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay, why didn't we express this -- this principle before instead of -- instead of adhering so narrowly? I mean, even the ERISA case, it didn't express this -- this broad theory. It says, this is -- this is very much like the section 301, and the legislative history referred specifically to 301, and therefore we come out the same way. Pretty -- pretty narrow."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WAXMAN",
    "speech": "Here's -- here's why, Justice Scalia. The very difficult -- this Court made clear in Metropolitan Life, if it wasn't clear before, that it wasn't going to infer from congressional silence very lightly that when Congress created a Federal cause of action, it meant it to be exclusive so that it would displace State causes of action. There's a very strong and longstanding presumption to the contrary. But that difficult question was decided in the context of section 30 of the National Bank Act beginning in 1875 for reasons that are explained in this Court's opinion and in the Comptroller's report that the Government cites that precipitated the enactment of section 30, which is that this was war legislation. This was a -- the creation of the national banks was hoped by Congress and President Lincoln that it would provide the means with which the Government could continue to fund the war, and national banks would knit the country together when the war was finished. And the one thing that comes out of the history of this case and is reflected in this Court's opinions is that they feared, based on their experience with the first bank of the United States and the second bank of the United States, that jealous States, States that were jealous of their State-chartered banks, which were issuing paper at the time, would engage in predations against the national banks that were created at the very same time that section 30 was enacted and, in essence, smother this important Federal infant in its crib."

In this case, there's no -- in National Bank Act, there's no -- there is no body of Federal law that could ever arise, and it's because the nature of the National Bank Act is really more of a hierarchy of State laws. It says, National Bank Act, you can -- you can charge either the interest rate in the State in which the claim is brought, you can charge the interest rate in the State in which the bank is located, or you can charge -- and there's a default Federal interest rate. So what you're going to have here is sort of a patchwork of State law decisions concerning the State -- State law of Delaware versus Alabama versus Kentucky versus Michigan."

I assume that it -- it is a given that merely setting forth all of the elements of a Federal cause of action in a complaint is not enough to provoke removal. That is to say, if there is both a Federal cause of action and a State cause of action which has the same elements, if you plead those elements, which would constitute a Federal cause of action, but you protest that you are not asserting a Federal cause of action, you are only asserting a State cause of action, that would not be removable. Would it?"

The same facts that I was discriminated against. If I make my choice that I want to bring it under, say, New York law rather than Title VII, that's my prerogative. And the defendant certainly can't remove that case by saying, well, you could have pleaded those same facts as a Title VII case. Quite different. That's where there's concurrent lawmaking authority, both State and Federal. Here the argument is there is no State lawmaking authority. There is no parallel source of law, State and Federal, and that's what makes it different from the ordinary case where you plead the facts and they would state a claim under either State law or Federal law. The pleader has her choice."

And it's -- in other words, the Alabama legislature certainly has the right to make -- make law regulating Federal banks. In fact, this Court decided way back in 1870 that national banks are subject to State law regulation. And in fact, the quote from the case something like in their daily activities, they're regulated much more under --"

So the only law -- I mean, the choice would be if you want to say, yes, I want to stick with Alabama law, no Federal 85, 86 for me, that case must get dismissed.

Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, of course, it's their prerogative to rise and fall on the causes of action that they choose to plead. However, I go back to the MetLife case which the Court said it's not the obviousness of preemption defense but the intent of Congress. And I think in answer to the question over there, is why -- why go that extra step? Well, because this Court has decided in MetLife that that extra step is necessary to stop this slippery slope down where every case that is removed out of a State court, you now have this other layer of -- of litigation over, well, is there another cause of action and -- and perhaps that we have to find some -- we have to litigate over whether it's an exclusive cause of action. And the answer to that is this Court has provided, for right or for wrong, since 1887 that we follow the well-pleaded complaint rule and it follows the language in the -- at the end of the Gully opinion saying that what you need is a clear bright line limitation. And only where we find some clear congressional intent, such as in the LMRA situation, such as in the ERISA situation, do we make this extreme and extraordinary grant of field preemption or complete preemption or whole preemption. If there are no further questions, I will sit down."

    "speech": "Your question was if -- if you -- you said this would take time, and it will. You pleaded all the elements of a Federal cause of action, but it also -- it also satisfies a State cause of action. If the Federal cause of action is not exclusive except in that rare instance, it is not removable. Justice Breyer, yes, indeed we say that you stop at point 3. That is, you determine whether or not this is the rare instance in which there's not only substantive preemption but exclusive Federal remedies. And the reason you stop is because we have Federal question jurisdiction. It says that removal is tied to original jurisdiction, and therefore, the question is, does the complaint well-pleaded necessarily state a cause of action? Justice Holmes indicated in a statement that is oft repeated and, if it's anything, is under-inclusive, as this Court indicated I think in Merrell Dow, that a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action. If the cause of action is exclusively Federal, in that rare instance, it's under arising-under jurisdiction. Justice Kennedy I think asked what for me is the most difficult question in this Court's sometimes not fully explicated arising-under jurisdiction, which is the question that was addressed in Merrell Dow and in particular in footnote 1 in this Court's opinion in Merrell Dow, which is if you have a State cause of action misrepresentation, but it has embedded with it as a necessary matter a conclusion about whether Federal law was or was not satisfied, does that State claim arise under Federal jurisdiction? In Franchise Tax Board, this Court repeated dicta that suggests that the answer is yes. And in Smith versus Kansas City Title and Trust, this -- this Court seemed to indicate yes. But in Moore versus Chesapeake -- the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court suggested that the embedded Federal question has to be central to the State cause of action and really important. And the result, as I -- as I think things stand now, is we have a very long footnote 1 in this Court's opinion in Merrell Dow that says many people have difficulty resolving our jurisprudence in this area, but in the Merrell Dow context, where there was a State tort claim that could -- may I finish my --"
