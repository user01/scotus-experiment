1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:02 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next 4 in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones 5 Telecommunications. Mr. Fisher. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may 9 it please the Court: 10 Complaints alleging violations of the FCC's 11 pay phone compensation regulations allege just that, 12 violations of regulations. The regulatory violations do 13 not give rise to private cause of action under section 14 206 and 207 of the Communications Act. The proper point 15 of departure in this case begins at section 276. There 16 Congress directed the FCC to create a system guaranteeing 17 pay phone providers compensation for the services that 18 they provide to callers who make dial around calls. 19 There can be little doubt that the FCC has ample 20 authority to enforce the system it created 21 administratively. 22 But nothing in Section 276 or anywhere else 23 in the Act contemplates that violations of the FCC's 24 implementing regulations should give rise to a private 25 cause of action for damages in Federal court.

1 Accordingly, this Court should reverse the Ninth 2 Circuit's decision allowing pay phone operators to bring 3 through the back door the kinds of cases that Congress 4 declined to allow through the front. 5 There's nothing upsetting about reaching 6 that result here. The Communications Act quite sensibly 7 limits private damages actions in Federal court to those 8 alleging violations of the Act itself. And claims that 9 long distance providers -- I'm sorry -- claims that long 10 distance providers have violated the pay phone 11 compensation regulations require the parsing and the 12 application of the extraordinarily complex and 13 ever-changing FCC rules and regulations and orders. 14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, may I ask you this 15 question? In your view, did the regulations create a 16 legally enforceable obligation? 17 MR. FISHER: Yes, Justice Stevens. 18 JUSTICE STEVENS: And where may that obligation be 19 enforced? 20 MR. FISHER: Our position is that can be fully 21 enforced in the FCC. And in fact, the FCC is hearing 22 complaints like this all the time. 23 JUSTICE STEVENS: By means of a private action 24 before the FCC? 25 MR. FISHER: Yes, by means of an administrative
4

1 action before the FCC. 2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Where the carrier -- where they 3 would file a complaint saying you owe us X dollars, and 4 the agency could order them to pay X dollars. 5 MR. FISHER: That's right. And if you look at the 6 Sprint amicus brief at page 23, the brief cites several 7 cases just like this one that the FCC has fully 8 adjudicated and in some cases awarded damages. 9 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is the obligation 10 enforceable in State court? 11 MR. FISHER: No, we believe -- of course, this 12 Court did not grant certiorari -13 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that. I'm curious 14 to know what your view is. 15 MR. FISHER: If this Court holds there is no 16 private cause of action in Federal court, then it is not 17 enforceable in state court either. Our position is that 18 there is only an administrative remedy that's available. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the administrative remedy 20 that you just conceded is a counterpart to a private 21 right of action, or isn't it? Would you get the same 22 thing? I complained to the agency, and say, I didn't get 23 -- the pay phone provider wasn't paid, and X under the 24 commission's regulations was supposed to pay it. So I 25 complained against X. Could I get before the FCC exactly
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 what I could get in court, so that we're only talking 2 about which form is proper, or is there a difference in 3 the remedy? 4 MR. FISHER: In terms of damages, we're talking 5 about exactly the same thing, Justice Ginsburg. The only 6 difference between being in Federal court as opposed to 7 the agency is that if you're in Federal court, the 8 Communications Act has a fee shifting provision. And we 9 think that further underscores the Congress's scheme 10 here, which is to reserve Federal court actions for 11 serious violations of the Communications Act, and that's 12 where fee shifting kicks in. Ordinary -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And before the agency, you 14 don't get counsel fees? 15 MR. FISHER: That's right. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Fisher, I realize you don't 17 concede, in fact, quite to the contrary, you deny that 18 the failure to pay the full rate is -- could be 19 considered a practice here. But let's assume for the 20 sake of argument that it is a practice within the meaning 21 of the text. 22 If the -- if the agency had explicitly said, what 23 we are doing here in defining this practice as unlawful 24 or unjust, is to define it as such within the meaning of, 25 what is it, 201(b), so they make explicit reference to
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the statute and they say, we are fleshing out the 2 statute, would your position be the same? 3 MR. FISHER: I think that's very much what the 4 Commission is contending here Justice Souter. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it wasn't textually as nice 6 as that? 7 MR. FISHER: Right. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they have made it that, 9 haven't they, in a later regulation? Haven't they said 10 just that. 11 MR. FISHER: In a later order, Justice Scalia. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: In a later order, yes. 13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume in the reg itself, 14 they were that precise. Would your position be exactly 15 the same? 16 MR. FISHER: Yes. The result would be the same. 17 And I think you're asking me to put aside for the moment 18 whether the FCC was correct in saying it was a covered 19 practice. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. 21 MR. FISHER: And in terms of the FCC calling this 22 unjust and unreasonable, the problem with that is that 23 the only reason the FCC has ever given that this is 24 unjust and unreasonable is because it violates its 25 regulations. And if there's one thing we know from the
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 structure of the Communications Act, it's that for 2 something to be remedial in Federal court, in other 3 words -- and if we know something violates 201, it is 4 remediable. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 6 MR. FISHER: It has to be. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: You invite me to change the 8 hypothetical, then, by jacking it up in this respect. 9 The FCC gives the reason. And it says, the reason it's 10 unjust and unreasonable is that the carriers are getting 11 a free ride on the pay phones, et cetera. 12 So they fill in the gap that you claim. 13 They have a reason. Would your answer or your position 14 still be the same? 15 MR. FISHER: Yes, because the reasoning the FCC 16 would give simply would not be a permissible construction 17 of the terms unjust and unreasonable in 201(b). 18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Are there any times under any 19 circumstances that you can think of in which the FCC can 20 adequately and validly define a practice as unjust and 21 unreasonable within the meaning of the statute so that, 22 in fact, in applying the statute, we would follow -- be 23 bound to follow the regs? 24 MR. FISHER: Of course, in the vast majority. Let 25 me give you some examples, and then I'll distinguish it
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 from this case. The easiest example is rate of return 2 regulations that the FCC can pronounce. So the FCC can 3 say how much long distance companies are able to charge 4 for certain services. Fleshing out the amount that they 5 can charge so that they're not in effect gouging 6 consumers is a regulation that this Court could look to, 7 but -8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But why can't they pass a 9 regulation that says don't gouge pay phone operators? 10 MR. FISHER: Well, that goes to the heart of this 11 case, Justice Souter, in the kind of regulations that we 12 have. What we have here is not the FCC telling long 13 distance providers to give pay phone operators money that 14 long distance operators ought to owe pay phone operators. 15 The money that's at issue here, the 24 cents per 16 call is the money that callers owe the pay phone 17 operators. If you look back at the D.C. Circuit's 18 decision -19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do they? I mean, the 20 statute of the United States says that -- I think I'm 21 correct -- the statute of the United States says they 22 can't be required, the caller cannot be required to put 23 in the quarter in order to get the 800 number and so on. 24 So as a matter of law, don't we have to say that 25 the, in practical terms, the caller doesn't owe?

1 Somebody owes. Somebody ought to pay for the use of this 2 facility. But Congress has said it is not the end user. 3 MR. FISHER: You are right, Justice Souter, 4 insofar as we're trying to capture the money here for 5 essentially the equipment rental or the access fee that 6 the caller is availing himself of. But Congress has not 7 said that money cannot rest on the caller's shoulders. 8 All Congress says in Section 226 is that the caller 9 cannot be required to pay in advance. 10 The FCC during its rulemaking proceedings actually 11 considered two alternatives where the caller would have 12 paid in full compliance with Section 226. One would be 13 the caller paying with a later billing device like a 14 credit card, billing it to their home phone number. 15 Another option the FCC considered would have been 16 where the long distance providers would have billed 17 customers on behalf of the pay phone operators. Either 18 way, the customer would have paid. Even the respondent 19 in his brief openly -20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the customer is going to 21 pay if, in fact, the long distance carrier is the one who 22 has to make the immediate payment, because that payment 23 is going to be figured in the long distance rate. So 24 that ultimately, the end user is going to pay for the 25 service he gets, and Congress is simply saying, the way
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to make this thing work in a sensible and simple way is 2 to require the long distance carrier to make the 3 reimbursement. 4 The economic end result is exactly the same as it 5 would have been if they had said, well, you can send a 6 bill for 25 cents to the end user. 7 MR. FISHER: The economic result may be the same, 8 but with all due respect, Congress has not decreed that 9 the administrative system work this way. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: It hasn't decreed 11 otherwise. 12 MR. FISHER: It hasn't decreed otherwise. 13 Congress essentially -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the classic situation 15 in which agencies are supposed to figure out what to do? 16 MR. FISHER: Congress gave the FCC power in 276 to 17 come up with a plan. But this case, as the Ninth Circuit 18 decided it is not under 276, it is under 201, so the 19 question is whether failing to comply with the 20 administrative plan -21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, as I understand it, it came 22 to the conclusion not that they were not acting under 23 276, but that, in fact, the cause of action has to refer 24 back to 201. 25 MR. FISHER: That's right. I'm sorry. It brings
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 us back to the question that you asked: Whether the 2 Ninth Circuit, or the FCC for that matter, can shoehorn 3 this into 201 as an unjust and unreasonable practice. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your answer for why 5 they can't, Justice Souter's comment is a classic, this 6 is what administrative agencies do all the time in 7 typical rate regulations. They make a determination that 8 utility shareholders have to bear this cost. The rate 9 payers can bear this cost. And at the end of the day, it 10 is a determination that a rate is reasonable or 11 unreasonable. 12 And it seems to me that that is just what is 13 involved here. I don't know why their determination 14 about how to allocate who has to collect the rates, and 15 whether they can pass them on or not makes it an 16 impermissible interpretation of what's unjust or 17 unreasonable under 201. 18 MR. FISHER: Well, Chief Justice Roberts, the FCC 19 was unquestionably acting under 276 when it did this. So 20 the question is whether you can go back to 201. And as I 21 said, you need to start with section 206 and 207 because 22 we're in Federal court. And that says that violations of 23 the Act are remediable but not of regulations, in 24 contrast to numerous other sections. 25 So the question in asking whether it violates 201,
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it has to be something more than simply the FCC's 2 regulation wasn't followed. And we need to ask ourselves 3 what kind of regulation is it. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are rate making regulations 5 issued under 201, do they purport to be the FCC's 6 definition of what is just and reasonable compensation? 7 MR. FISHER: That's right. That's what I conceded 8 to Justice Souter earlier. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: They are issued under 201. 10 MR. FISHER: I think largely they are. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: So they are an interpretation of 12 the statutory language in 201. 13 MR. FISHER: That's right. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say this one is not. 15 MR. FISHER: That's right. And this Court can 16 look several places, but it can first look to 17 these -- this regulatory regime that was created, which 18 was always thought of as being triggered by section 276. 19 And then asking -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say it was always 21 thought of as being triggered by 276, did the FCC 22 reference 201 in issuing its determination that a failure 23 to follow these regulations was unjust and unreasonable? 24 MR. FISHER: In its order, it references 276 and 25 201. In the regulations -- I thought I was being asked
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 about the regulations -- it leads with 276. 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it issued the regulation 3 after notice and comment, and said -- violation of the 4 pay phone order is an unjust and unreasonable practice, 5 would the case be different? 6 MR. FISHER: No, it wouldn't be. And I think I 7 want to flesh out and make sure I've gotten across the 8 distinction between the rate making -9 JUSTICE BREYER: You haven't. Maybe -- if this 10 doesn't clarify it. I think everyone has about the same 11 question. You have a bunch of pay phone operators. And 12 if the AT&T were charging them too much, I think everybody 13 would say that the FCC can say, hey, that's too much. You 14 owe them 2 cents a call refund, and everybody would agree 15 that the people who are hurt could go into court and bring 16 a lawsuit and get the 2 cents. Right under 47 U.S.C. 17 201(b). 18 Now, the only difference here seems to be that it 19 wasn't AT&T that was charging, in my example, too much. 20 They weren't paying what they owed. They should have 21 paid what they owed. And that, says the FCC, is, under 22 201(b), an unreasonable practice. And, therefore, go in 23 and collect it in court. Now, what is the answer to 24 that? 25 So far I have heard nothing that suggests
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that this couldn't be an unreasonable practice under 2 201(b), which is just what the FCC said it was. Now, 3 what's wrong with what I said? I'm simply trying to 4 focus you upon what I think is the question that's 5 bothering some of us. 6 MR. FISHER: There are two things that are wrong 7 with that, Justice Breyer. The first thing is that in 8 contrast to ordinary rate making regulations, here, in 9 the absence of regulations, long distance providers would 10 owe pay phone operators zero. There's no reason why long 11 distance providers would give money to pay phone 12 operators. 13 The 24 cents here is to capture what callers 14 owe the pay phone operators. And so the FCC has come up 15 with an administrative system. But there's nothing 16 unjust or unreasonable about long distance providers not 17 giving money to pay phone operators before the regulatory 18 regime drops into place, whereas there is plenty that is 19 unjust and unreasonable about overcharging, for example 20 -21 JUSTICE BREYER: So, my answer -- not answer, but 22 my characterization of what you have just said is that the 23 FCC did say it was an unreasonable practice. But in your 24 view, it was not an unreasonable practice not to pay. 25 And you want us to go back and second-guess, which
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we could, if their view of unreasonable practice is 2 unreasonable itself. And I guess you would have to 3 overturn it. I didn't know that was what the case was 4 about, but are you saying now that that's the issue? 5 They said it was an unreasonable practice not to pay this 6 money, you think it is a reasonable practice not to pay 7 the money. There is a dispute. That's what we should 8 do. 9 MR. FISHER: No. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then what should we do? 11 MR. FISHER: Well, what you should do is reverse 12 the Ninth Circuit. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say it would be a reasonable 14 practice not to pay the money, but for the existence of 15 the regulation. 16 MR. FISHER: That's exactly right. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Just like AT&T when, in fact -18 or any other utility that, in fact, runs into situations 19 every day of the week, where but for an FCC regulation, 20 they would not be overcharging, because they have a way 21 of doing it that isn't on its face unjust. But the FCC 22 writes some regulations and now it is unjust. So I guess 23 to take that argument would overturn, I guess, about a 24 hundred years of rate making law. Wouldn't it? 25 MR. FISHER: No, it wouldn't. Justice Scalia, I
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 think, has captained that position. And what we're 2 saying is the FCC can pick a fair rate once it is 3 something that long distance providers or any common 4 carrier ought to be compensating somebody for. But what 5 we are saying here is, this is a purely administrative 6 creature. And then it gets to the second reason why -7 JUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, you are saying 8 -- I think it is common that the FCC might write some 9 accounting rules, for example. And they might say, 10 before these accounting rules, Mr. Bell's system in San 11 Francisco, you could charge people 8 cents a call. But 12 given the way we set up the accounting rules, we think 13 this month you have to do 7 cents in the first six 14 months, 7 cents, in the next six months, 9 cents. And 15 any deviation from that is unreasonable. And the company 16 does deviate. I would have always thought when they do 17 deviate, they are behaving unreasonably, and someone who 18 pays too much could go into court and get money back. 19 Am I wrong about that? 20 MR. FISHER: No, you would have been right, 21 Justice Breyer. We're not asking -- even the Louisiana 22 Public Service Commission is another example of 23 something. And that brings me -- I think I should go 24 back to what -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you go back, let's hear
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 about the accounting rules. What would they be issued 2 under? Would they be issued under 201? 3 MR. FISHER: They might. The question that we 4 would ask is whether it affects carriers' relationships 5 to their customers. Now, under Justice Breyer's 6 hypothetical, and this is the Louisiana Public Service 7 Commission -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me accounting rules 9 -- in order to decide what is just and reasonable, you 10 have to have accounting rules. So the accounting rules 11 fit very comfortably under 201. 12 MR. FISHER: I don't think we're disagreeing. 13 What I want to do is distinguish those from the case we 14 have here, and go back to Justice Souter's -15 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I focus your return to me? 16 Because I want to take up with where your answer to 17 Justice Scalia left off. As I understand it, you were 18 saying that the rate in this case is unreasonable because 19 the party or the person who is responsible for the use of 20 the pay phone facilities is the person who's making the 21 call, not the long distance carrier. 22 My question to you is, isn't that simply a choice 23 of characterization? Because another way of looking at 24 it would be that the person who makes the call wants to 25 use long distance facilities to get to the person he
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 wants to talk to. And, therefore, the long distance 2 facility in every pay phone case is using the pay phone 3 in order to get the customer to what the long distance 4 facility provides. 5 Why then isn't it just as fair to characterize the 6 use of the pay phone here as for the benefit of the 7 carrier as for the benefit of the customer? And if that 8 is just as fair, doesn't that end the distinction that 9 you drew with Justice Scalia saying that it is not fair 10 in this case. 11 MR. FISHER: No, for two reasons. The first is -12 I just want to be clear, we are not challenging the FCC's 13 authority to have created the regulatory regime it did 14 under 276. So the FCC could well have picked, as it did, 15 long distance providers to be on the ultimate hook here. 16 But the reason -- but the problem with saying that 17 -- I'm sorry. I lost the train of thought in your 18 question. 19 JUSTICE SOUTER: My question is simply, you can 20 say -- one way of looking at this transaction is, it is 21 the guy making the call who's using it. Another way is 22 to say the long distance facilities carrier is using it 23 to get the call to the long distance facility. If you 24 look at it in way B, doesn't your argument for 25 unreasonableness disappear?
19

1 MR. FISHER: Thank you. That would be an entirely 2 different case than the one we have here, Justice Souter. 3 The 24 cents that the respondent is seeking to recoup 4 here, if you go back and look at the regulatory system -5 and that's what they are asking for, is the 24 cents that 6 the FCC regulations entitle us to -- was calculated -- in 7 fact, the D.C. Circuit made the FCC go through this 8 exercise three times to get it right. So to calculate 9 that 24 cents, it is purely a function of the amount of 10 money that the caller owes the pay phone operator. 11 JUSTICE SOUTER: What difference does that make? 12 What difference does that make? The use of the phone is 13 of a value of 24 cents. But the value of using the phone 14 is a value not only to the caller, but to the long 15 distance provider who couldn't provide anything to the 16 caller without the pay phone? Why isn't the alternative 17 characterization just as easy, regardless of how they get 18 to 24 cents? 19 MR. FISHER: I think another way to perhaps 20 characterize your position is, why is this like a 21 commission that they are seeking. And the reason why is 22 because that number may be very different than 24 cents. 23 If there was such a commission that could exist, it would 24 be far less. And the respondents are not seeking that 25 amount of money.
20

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me, but aren't you arguing 2 with the 24 cents, as opposed to creating an argument 3 about what is the proper characterization of the 4 transaction? 5 MR. FISHER: I don't think so. All I'm saying is 6 if you started with trying to compensate pay phone 7 operators for the service they provide -- that you're 8 characterizing as the service they provide to long 9 distance carriers, you end up with a far different 10 number. Who knows what you would end up with. Probably 11 end up with zero. Because take an example of somebody 12 who rents a cell phone for the weekend. They might make 13 lots of long distance calls on the cell phone, but nobody 14 has ever thought that a long distance carrier ought to be 15 kicking back money, for example, to the store that rented 16 the cell phone to the customer over the weekend. 17 And I want to return, I think in Justice Breyer's 18 question -19 JUSTICE SOUTER: The reason is that the store that 20 rents the cell phone is getting rental income from the 21 cell phone. And in the case of the pay phone, the pay 22 phone operator is going to get zero, unless there is some 23 such scheme as this. 24 MR. FISHER: Right, but then we're back to the 25 rental income question, and the question of whether it
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 would be unjust or unreasonable for long distance 2 providers, absent the regulations, to be the ones paying 3 that rental income. 4 And the answer, we submit, is no. And the problem 5 that I think we've gotten off on a couple times brings us 6 back, I think, to the assumption you asked me to make at 7 the beginning of the argument, that something is a 8 covered practice under the Act. 9 And so another way to understand the distinction 10 between the accounting rules, the rate making exercises 11 and all the rest in this case is that section 201(b) of 12 the Act doesn't cover everything in connection with a 13 communications service. It only covers certain practices 14 in connection. And the history, as well as the text and 15 structure, shows that it regulates common carriers acting 16 as such. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't cover certain 18 practices in connection. It covers all practices in 19 connection. 20 MR. FISHER: I think we agree with respondent, Mr. 21 Chief Justice, that in looking at 201(b), you have the 22 word such communication practices. And to understand 23 what that is referring to, you look back up at 201(a) and 24 see the universe. Now, the beginning of 201(a) is what 25 we colloquially call the carrier customer section of the
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Act. And that's the core of 201(b), which says that when 2 a common carrier is providing service, it needs to act 3 justly and reasonably. Here -- and with accounting and 4 rate making and all the rest, those are things that 5 affect rates and service to customers. 6 What we have in this case is something very 7 different. This is a carrier-carrier relationship. So 8 you need to look somewhere else. And what respondent 9 says is you look to the end of 201(a), which talks about 10 physical interconnections between carriers. But the 11 problem with that argument, and the reason why this falls 12 outside 201(b), even if it is somehow unjust and 13 unreasonable, is that the carrier-carrier relationships 14 are governed only when the FCC has ordered physical 15 interconnection. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying that, 17 putting aside 276, it would clearly be impermissible for 18 the FCC to say one way that long distance carriers 19 provide service to their customers is when those 20 customers use pay phones; and, therefore, we're setting 21 up this rate regime in connection with that service. You 22 would say that would be outside the scope of 201(a)? 23 MR. FISHER: As we're still talking generically, I 24 don't think it necessarily would be. Because it could 25 regulate the relationship between long distance providers

1 and their customers. I mean, that's the core of what 201 2 is about. It's about how much they can charge, what kind 3 of practices they can have in relationship to their 4 customers. But here we're not talking about a long 5 distance provider that is a common carrier in 6 relationship to its customers or in relation to its rates 7 and practices. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: That's actually -- that's, I 9 think, your strong -- to me that was the strongest 10 argument. When I finished reading it, I thought, well, 11 so what. You know, I mean, can you see why I thought 12 that? I mean, today's rule is different. It is true 13 that you don't have simply a single telephone company 14 providing service ultimately directly to the customer. 15 You have everything mixed up. And there are a lot of 16 inter-carrier things. Language covers it. Purpose 17 covers it. Facts and circumstances change. 18 MR. FISHER: We submit it is a not a "so what," 19 Justice Breyer. Because section 201(b) is broad, but 20 it's not all-encompassing. And Congress plenty of times 21 in section 276, and in lots of other sections of the 22 Communications Act, has responded to modern necessity by 23 giving the FCC expanded jurisdiction, just as it did, as 24 I said here, in section 276. 25 But our core position here is that when Congress

1 expands the FCC's authority, and it doesn't create a 2 concomitant Federal right of action along with it, it is 3 telling the FCC to handle these things administratively, 4 use its expertise, craft regulations and enforce them 5 accordingly. 6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, can I go back to the 7 first question I asked you? Would the FCC have had 8 authority to create an administrative remedy that had a 9 fee shifting provision in it? 10 MR. FISHER: The FCC might have that authority. 11 Section 154(i), as well as other sections in the Act, 12 give the Commission broad authority in crafting its 13 administrative enforcement regimes. I haven't focused on 14 that exact question, but it might well be able to say 15 that in order to have this properly enforced, we need to 16 have fee shifting. 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: It could certainly impose 18 penalties of some kind. 19 MR. FISHER: Yes, it could, and the FCC could 20 double fine -- the FCC could do lots of things. That's 21 our very purpose, is that the FCC ought to be the single 22 forum deciding what kind of an enforcement mechanism is 23 best, not leaving it to Federal courts across the 24 country. And as Ninth Circuit invites, state court 25 rulings across the country with varying rules.

ENGLERT, JR., 6 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 7 MR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 8 may it please the Court: 9 It is not particularly unusual for the grants of 10 authority in the FCC -- to the FCC throughout the 11 Communications Act to be enforceable through the 12 provisions of section 201(b) barring unjust or 13 unreasonable charges, classifications, rates, or 14 practices. 15 Justice Scalia asked a question during Mr. 16 Fisher's argument about, what about the accounting rules? 17 Would they be prescribed under section 201? They would 18 be prescribed under section 220, which is the provision 19 of the Act that governs accounting. And they would also 20 be prescribed under the last sentence of section 201, 21 which is the general authority given to the FCC to 22 promulgate all of its rules. 23 But nothing in those facts would keep a violation 24 of those rules from being enforced as an unjust or 25 unreasonable practice under Section 201(b).

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: What can't -- what can't be 2 sucked in under section 201? I mean, once the FCC issues 3 a regulation, it's easy to say that any violation of that 4 regulation is unjust. And that's what's happened here. 5 And this just makes a farce of the provision that says 6 the only private causes of action are for violations of 7 the statute and not for violations of the regulation. 8 It seems to me if this thing, 276, can get sucked 9 into 201 simply by reason of the fact that failing to 10 obey an FCC regulation is unjust, that provision is a 11 nullity. 12 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, first of all, the 13 FCC has never argued, and we have never argued that all 14 FCC regulations are enforceable through a private right 15 of action. I mean, to give an example, as -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm saying you'd have to 17 argue that if the theory you're propounding for this case 18 is correct. Violation of an FCC regulation is unjust. 19 Failing to comply with an FCC regulation is unjust. 20 MR. ENGLERT: No, no, Your Honor. The phrase 21 unjust or unreasonable is a classic phrase delegating to 22 the administrative agency the authority to make the 23 determinations in the first instance of what's just and 24 reasonable. If, for example, there were a violation of 25 the regulation forbidding giving credits to political
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 candidates, the FCC could decide in the first instance 2 whether the violation of that regulation rises to the 3 order of unjust or unreasonable. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: So can -- every FCC regulation 5 can be enforceable by private action? All the FCC has to 6 say is that violation of this regulation is unjust. 7 MR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: No? 9 MR. ENGLERT: There are also examples of things 10 that fall outside of charges, classification, rates or 11 practices. There are examples in the case law. There 12 are old ICC cases in which providing a particular type of 13 boxcar was deemed not to be a charge, classification, 14 rate -- held not to be a charge, classification, rate or 15 practice. 16 There is a recent D.C. Circuit case involving an 17 attempt to dictate, in the FERC context, to an energy 18 company who can be on its board of directors. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But at least -- at least any FCC 20 regulations relating to charges, practices -- and you 21 want to interpret practices very broadly -22 classifications, and regulations for and in connection 23 with communication service, all of those regulations can 24 be sued upon in Federal court with all the diverse and 25 contradictory rulings that that will produce, so long as
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the FCC says that the failure to obey this regulation is, 2 in our view, unjust. 3 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, let's start with 4 statutory text. Section 206 says that there is a damages 5 action for anything in this Act declared to be unlawful. 6 Section 201(b) says unjust or unreasonable 7 classifications, practices, et cetera, are declared to be 8 unlawful. So we have a very precise match in statutory 9 text between 201(b) and 206. 10 Now, what Mr. Fisher's argument amounts to is to 11 say that if it is covered in a regulation, it is exempted 12 from being called an unjust or unreasonable charge, 13 classification, practice, et cetera, because that would 14 allow the FCC to enforce too much. But if we start with 15 the text Congress enacted, there is a precise match 16 between 201(b) and 206. 17 And to say that that which the FCC hasn't 18 regulated is more subject to judicial review -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think he's saying that. 20 I don't think he's saying that if it is covered under 21 regulation, it can't be unjust. Some regulations do 22 relate to justness and reasonableness, but not 276. 23 I think what he's saying is 276 established a scheme. 24 It didn't have to be this scheme. It could have been 25 some other scheme. Nothing in the nature of things says
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that the long distance carrier has to be the one liable 2 for this. 3 It rather was simply imposed by the FCC. That's 4 fine. But to say that it would be unjust for them not to 5 do that is just unreal, unless you're going to allow any 6 violation of any FCC regulation to be unjust. 7 MR. ENGLERT: Your Honor, our position doesn't 8 require us to argue that it would have been unjust for 9 the FCC to adopt some other scheme. Our position is that 10 once the scheme is in place, it is unjust to depart from 11 that scheme in the way Global Crossing did, just as once 12 a scheme of rate regulation is in place, even though 13 there could be many different schemes of rate regulation, 14 it may be unjust or unreasonable to charge a higher rate 15 than that. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the rate regulation is -- is 17 established in order to determine what reasonableness and 18 justness requires. And 276 is something quite different. 19 MR. ENGLERT: I respectfully disagree, Your Honor. 20 276 is, asks -- was a delegation by Congress to the 21 agency to fill in the details of a plan to make sure that 22 pay phone service providers were fairly compensated, a 23 phrase not very different from just and reasonable, for 24 each and every completed interstate and intrastate pay 25 phone call. They really fit quite nicely together as

1 opposed to being in tension with one another. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it possible -- I was worried 3 somewhat about, I think, the problem Justice Scalia 4 raised, that old regulations become unjust and 5 unreasonable. And then I thought, no, but tell me if 6 this is right. That they're going to fall within 201(b) 7 only if a violation is unjust and unreasonable. 8 Now, we could say, and moreover, the FCC has to 9 find that a violation of these rates is unjust and 10 unreasonable, that is, it has to focus on it, make that 11 determination. And then, of course, that determination 12 has to be a reasonable interpretation. In other words, 13 it can't just call anything unjust and unreasonable -14 MR. ENGLERT: That's right. The usual -15 JUSTICE BREYER: And it has to focus on the fact 16 that their doing so will create this private remedy in 17 the courts. 18 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor -19 JUSTICE BREYER: That that -- if you have that 20 tough -- which I haven't seen anywhere, but I mean, if 21 you had that tough a requirement, so they actually have 22 to focus on it, it would tend to minimize the problem of 23 a thousand different actions in ten thousand different 24 courts and a big mess. 25 But I mean, how much is written into those words
31
Alderson Reporting Company

1 unjust and unreasonable? I'm certain you can't squeeze 2 any rate -- it is not the case that any and every 3 regulation can be -- fall within. 4 MR. ENGLERT: No, that's right. The usual Chevron 5 limitations apply. And in your question, Justice Breyer, 6 you added to the usual Chevron limitations that the FCC 7 has to focus on -8 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah -9 MR. ENGLERT: Well, that's fine. Here the FCC did 10 focus on it and is criticized for having focused on the 11 consequences for judicial action. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but reasonably 13 criticized for it. I would have thought your answer 14 would be unjust or unreasonable has, for generations, 15 been given a very expansive reading. And you don't need 16 to say that the FCC has to do what typically I would have 17 thought was a job for a court, which is to determine 18 whether there's a private right of action to bring its 19 action within a boilerplate term like unjust or 20 unreasonable. 21 I would have thought the contact point was what I 22 was talking about with Mr. Fisher earlier, which is 23 whether or not this is such communication service under 24 201(a), which is -- which is, again, I suppose, something 25 that the agency gets deference on. But it would seem to
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 me, that's where the limitation would come. 2 MR. ENGLERT: Mr. Chief Justice, let me address 3 the interplay between 201(b) and 201(a), because Mr. 4 Fisher has simply misunderstood our position. 5 We cited the second half of section 201(a) not to 6 say it applies of its own force here, but to say that it 7 disproves the contention that the communications services 8 referred to in the phrase such communications service in 9 201(b) have to be limited to carrier-customer relations, 10 because 201(a) isn't limited to carrier-customer 11 relations. 12 Yes, all 201(a) does of its own force is allow the 13 prescribing of through routes and interconnections. But 14 there is no possible way to read 201(b) as limited to 15 carrier-carrier communications in light of the full 16 breadth of practices covered by 201(b). So that's the 17 reason to cite 201(a) is simply to disprove Mr. Fisher's 18 contention about the limits on 201(b). 19 The phrase such communications service is actually 20 used in 201(a) and in 201(b), and the antecedent in the 21 first few words of 201(a), the such communications 22 service, is interstate or foreign communication by wire 23 or radio. So 201(b) isn't necessarily restricted to 24 either carrier-carrier or carrier-customer relations, but 25 such communication service relates back to all
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 communication by wire or radio, which is what we have 2 here. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but wait. Wait. 4 Wait. It says to furnish such communications service, is 5 what (a) says. And they don't furnish such 6 communications service to your client. 7 MR. ENGLERT: No, but -- well, that's debatable, 8 but what 201(b) refers to, in any event, is in connection 9 with -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Such communications service. 11 MR. ENGLERT: Right. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I would think that would mean 13 such communications service that was furnished. 14 MR. ENGLERT: Well, they have furnished a 15 communications service to a customer, not to us, but to a 16 customer. So again, this is connected with that 17 communications service. And as the colloquy with Justice 18 Souter earlier touched on, the caller pays sooner or 19 later. 20 Under the FCC's regulatory scheme, and in part 21 because of the prohibition on advanced caller payment in 22 226(e)(2), what happens is the long distance carrier gets 23 the money, and they're saying there's no private right of 24 action to make them give it back. In other words, the 25 world would look quite different without a regulatory
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 scheme, but it would not be a regulatory scheme in which 2 they get all the money they are currently purporting to 3 keep. 4 Now, Mr. Chief Justice, you also asked a question 5 about the flash point on whether the FCC was improperly 6 or suspiciously commenting on the scope of the private 7 right of action as opposed to interpreting a substantive 8 provision. The private right of action provisions are 9 206 through 208, the provisions that let the complainant 10 go to either court or the Commission. 11 The FCC said nothing controversial about the scope 12 of 206 through 208. The controversy is over the scope of 13 201(b), which is a substantive provision. But once you 14 have something brought within the scope of 201(b), after 15 the application of traditional tools of statutory 16 construction with Chevron deference, the private right of 17 action follows automatically under 206 and 207. 18 It is not a matter of the FCC reaching out to say, 19 we are going to create a private right of action. It is 20 a matter of the FCC construing a substantive term with 21 consequences for a private right of action. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that's 23 right, but that's also why I guess I don't regard it as 24 particularly helpful that the FCC opines on what the 25 consequences of its determination that something is
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 unjust or unreasonable under the statute are, with 2 respect to a private right of action. 3 MR. ENGLERT: Well, it may not be particularly 4 helpful, but it is surely not particularly harmful. And 5 they did have a reason -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except that it is none of 7 their business. 8 MR. ENGLERT: If they were trying to construe -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: We -10 MR. ENGLERT: -- 206 through 208, Your Honor, I 11 might agree. But they construed 201(b) and commented on 12 the consequence. And this is quite important, that it is 13 their business, because 208 is the provision under which 14 each and every one of those Commission proceedings cited 15 in the Sprint brief, which Mr. Fisher alluded to, has 16 proceeded before the agency. 208, just like 206, 17 requires a violation of the Act, so it is very much their 18 business to decide whether these pay phone controversies 19 state violations of the Act. If they don't, the 20 Commission has absolutely no power to proceed under 208, 21 which is the only provision under which any 22 administrative proceeding has ever gone forward. 23 There are some arguments made here that they 24 clearly have the authority to proceed administratively 25 even if you can't go to court, but Mr. Fisher hasn't
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 identified the source of that authority. And the sources 2 identified in the brief are section 4(i), which has been 3 problematic, and others -- and other sections on which 4 the FCC has never relied on in this setting, and some 5 kind of divination of an action within Section 276 6 itself. 7 The question was put at one point to Mr. Fisher, 8 could the FCC mandate fee-shifting as part of this 9 administrative remedy it's going to create. Well, if you 10 read 276 broadly, it's giving the Commission great powers 11 to create administrative remedies, notwithstanding 208, 12 which was supposed to be the administrative provision, 13 then maybe anything goes. But we're getting awfully far 14 from the statute that Congress wrote and giving the FCC 15 awfully expansive powers to construe 276, while also 16 denying the FCC rather mundane powers to construe rather 17 ordinary phrases of administrative law, "unjust or 18 unreasonable," in 201(b). 19 Now, with respect to the question of whether this 20 is a practice in connection with a communications 21 service, Mr. Fisher argues strenuously that it is not. 22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just be sure I understand 23 your argument on 208. You're saying that 208, like the 24 earlier provision of the statute, requires a violation of 25 the statute, not just regulations, in order for there to
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 be an administrative remedy. 2 MR. ENGLERT: Yes, Justice Stevens, and section 3 207 expressly gives the complainant a choice of forums. 4 JUSTICE STEVENS: So the same statutory 5 requirement for the remedy that your opponent challenges 6 is the one he acknowledges is available. 7 MR. ENGLERT: That's correct, and in fact, Global 8 Crossing -- Global Crossing went so far as to argue 9 before the Ninth Circuit that there is no administrative 10 remedy, that there's simply nothing to do except get 11 fines under sections 502 and 503, and has reversed its 12 position before this Court. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you should be arguing, 14 then, that we should give Chevron deference to the 15 Commission's interpretation of Section 208. And once we 16 do that, if 208 governs this thing, then so does 206. 17 MR. ENGLERT: I'm happy to make that argument. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you should be. 19 MR. ENGLERT: With respect to the question whether 20 practices are limited to carrier-customer relations, I've 21 already touched on that by talking about the interplay 22 between 201(a) and 201(b). But there's another angle of 23 approach for that issue, which is that in the Louisiana 24 Service -- Louisiana Public Service Commission case, this 25 Court was asked to draw the inference, just as it has
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 been in this Court, from other provisions in the 2 Communications Act, that those phrases always refer to 3 carrier-customer relations. 4 And the Court said, no, that phrase can also refer 5 to depreciation rules, so it's not limited to 6 carrier-customer relations, the inference from other 7 provisions of the Act doesn't flow. And the reason is 8 there are words of limitation when those words, "charges, 9 classifications, rates or practices" are used in those 10 other sections that make it clear that they apply only to 11 tariffed services. You find no such words of limitation 12 in 201(a) and 201(b) -- or in 201(b), excuse me. 13 Now, there remains the argument that there's a 14 mismatch between section 201 and the relevant regulations 15 because the regulations apply to intrastate as well as 16 interstate calls, and section 201 applies to interstate 17 or foreign communications. 18 That argument appears for the very first time in 19 merits briefing in this Court. It wasn't made below. It 20 wasn't made in the cert petition. It wasn't made to the 21 agency. And that's a problem, because the limits of the 22 FCC's ability to regulate jurisdictionally mixed 23 communications depend on factual determinations, factual 24 determinations neither the agency nor even the lower 25 courts have ever been given a chance to make.
39

Alderson Reporting Company

1 But had this issue been raised in a timely 2 fashion, I suggest that it would have been appropriate 3 for the FCC to reach intrastate as well as interstate 4 communications because long distance -- dial-around calls 5 are overwhelmingly long distance, overwhelmingly 6 interstate, and it is difficult to sort out which calls 7 are which. In fact, the seven years of rulemaking the 8 FCC underwent in this case largely were because of the 9 difficulties of keeping track of particular pay phone 10 calls. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I saw that argument. I 12 have to say I don't understand it. Why is it so 13 difficult? I get a bill every month that easily sorts 14 out which are interstate and which are intrastate. 15 MR. ENGLERT: Sorting one call from one carrier 16 that has a relationship with you is not difficult, or 17 sorting 100 calls from a carrier that has a relationship 18 with you is not difficult. 19 But when you go from a PSP to an inter-exchange 20 carrier to a switch-based reseller, matching up the 21 information of all three is -- has proven, in practice, 22 to be quite difficult. And it's especially difficult in 23 an era in which you can't just tell by area codes, for 24 example, whether something is interstate. If I dial 202 25 to 202, I may be dialing someone's cell phone out of
40

Alderson Reporting Company

1 state. 2 Now, the judgment below could be explained 3 on the alternative ground that a violation of the 4 regulations constitutes a violation of section 276. 5 Before I even get to the substantive discussion, let me 6 respond to the absolutely groundless claim that that 7 argument has been abandoned. Global Crossing cites a 8 bunch of cases involving section 1291 appeals in which 9 people didn't appeal a particular order after final 10 judgment, and says that's an abandonment of the claim. 11 That's both correct and irrelevant. This is 12 a 1292(b) appeal and there is no final judgment on any 13 claim in this case, certainly not on the 276 claim, so my 14 client certainly hasn't abandoned it. 15 My client was also a party to Greene and lost 16 Greene and has argued the merits of the section 276 17 position all along. On the merits, section 276 contains 18 rights-creating language that creates a concrete monetary 19 entitlement, focuses on the party benefitted, and does 20 not have an aggregate focus. Global Closing doesn't even 21 try to defend the Ninth and D.C. Circuits' reasoning that 22 the statute does not contain rights-creating language. 23 That leaves the tricky question whether a 24 violation of the regs can be deemed a violation of the 25 Act itself when Congress specified only the right, but
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 didn't specify what fair compensation was, and didn't 2 specify who had to pay the compensation. 3 In that respect, I think Alexander v. Sandoval, 4 though it's been cited against us repeatedly, is actually 5 helpful to our position. That case says it's meaningless 6 talk about a violation of the regs separate from a 7 violation of the Act, and that a Congress that intends an 8 Act to be enforced intends the regulations filling out 9 the Act to be enforced. 10 I think the theory of Chevron itself is also 11 helpful to our position in this regard, because the point 12 of Chevron is that the use of broad language constitutes 13 an administrative -- a delegation of authority to the 14 administrative agency, not just to fill in details, but 15 to give definitive content to a statute whose direct 16 content is less than definitive. 17 So it is perfectly appropriate to talk about this 18 statute, section 276, and its rights-creating language as 19 ordering the FCC not just to create a plan, but ordering 20 the FCC to create a plan that has a particular goal such 21 that violation of that goal can be deemed a violation of 22 section 276 itself. 23 Thank you. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Englert. 25 Mr. Feldman?

1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN 2 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 3 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT 4 MR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 5 the Court: 6 There is no dispute in this case that under 7 sections 206 through 208 of the Communications Act, a 8 party damaged by any violation of the Communications Act 9 may bring an action either in Federal court or before the 10 Commission to obtain damages. The scope of the remedies 11 before the Commission under the kind of standard primary 12 provision of the Act that deals with damages, 208, and 13 207 mentions it as well, the scope of the action before 14 the Commission and before the court is exactly the same. 15 Now, because petitioner's -- therefore, if -16 well, because petitioner's failure to pay fair 17 compensation to respondent was an unjust or unreasonable 18 practice -19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask this. Is it the 20 same with respect to fee-shifting? 21 MR. FELDMAN: No. The Act in 207 -- I believe 22 it's 207 -- specifically says that you may, the court may 23 award attorneys' fees in an action in court. It doesn't 24 provide that -- there's no similar provision for actions 25 before the Commission. But the scope of the kind of
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 thing that Congress decided that a complainant could 2 bring either to the Commission or to court is exactly the 3 same. There's no way to drive a wedge between them. 4 There are other provisions of the Act, as Mr. 5 Fisher said, where Congress specifically authorized the 6 Commission -- an action before the Commission for 7 damages. But those are -- those provisions which 8 Mr. Fisher cited are in section 226, which do not have to 9 do with common carriers. They have to do with automatic 10 dialing, with do-not-call lists, with things like that, 11 where the person who's violating it is definitely not the 12 -- never going to be a common carrier. 13 In those provisions, Congress found it necessary 14 to say, okay, we have to now give you the authority to 15 create a damage action. 16 But in other provisions, where you are dealing 17 with common carrier, 206 through 208 provides Congress's 18 determination of what the scope of a damage action should 19 be either before the Commission or before a court. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a position on 21 whether or not Chevron deference is owed to the 22 Commission's determination of whether or not their action 23 creates or gives rise to a right of action? 24 MR. FELDMAN: I think that -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are two different,
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it seems to me, two different Chevron questions. The one 2 is the deference on its interpretation of what's unjust 3 and unreasonable. The other is the question of whether 4 or not they have anything to say about whether that means 5 there is a private right of action in court. 6 MR. FELDMAN: I think that -- I guess we don't 7 have a position on whether 276, independent of 201, would 8 be sufficient to have a prior right of action under 206 9 through 208. But as for 201(b), once -- the FCC does 10 certainly gets deference, has gotten deference for a 11 hundred years for its determination of what is an unjust 12 and unreasonable practice. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's never gotten 14 deference, at least I guess from this Court, on whether 15 or not there is or is not a right -- whether there is a 16 right of action to enforce its regulations. 17 MR. FELDMAN: No, and I don't think the FCC here 18 is claiming that there's a right of action to enforce its 19 regulations. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but they're certainly 21 entitled to deference as to whether an administrative 22 action can be brought under 208. 23 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct, and that's why under 24 -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Once you say that it can, then a
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 court action can be brought under 206. 2 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct. That's correct. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you think we don't owe them 4 deference for 206, but we do for 208. And if you give 5 deference for 208, 206 automatically decides itself. 6 MR. FELDMAN: Right. But 208, like 206 -- maybe 7 I'm not understanding the question. Both provisions 8 address only violations of the statute. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 10 MR. FELDMAN: So in order for the FCC to decide 11 that there's an action either before the agency or the 12 court, it has to identify a violation of the statute. 13 Here it's identified 201(b) as being the provision that's 14 violated. It's absolutely standard for a hundred years 15 that -- I mean, Mr. Fisher says, well, you can't look at 16 201(b) and decide who is supposed to pay and how much 17 they're supposed to pay. That is absolutely standard 18 from the very beginning of the Interstate Commerce Act, 19 that you can't look at the words "just and reasonable" 20 and decide whether a rate was just and reasonable or the 21 practices that a carrier is using are just and 22 reasonable. In fact, the whole -23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is your position -- I want to be 24 sure I understand you. Your position on the two 25 different questions that the Chief asked you is, they get
46

1 deference on question one. And with respect to question 2 two, it follows from the plain text of the statute. 3 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct, that's correct. I 4 would add also, with respect to the Commission's 5 determination about what is just and reasonable, it was 6 not just a question of saying that a violation of the 7 regulations is just and reasonable. The Commission was 8 charged here with the responsibility for adopting a 9 compensation scheme that would provide for fair 10 compensation for each pay phone operator for each and 11 every call. And it spent a number of years and a number 12 of different attempts working out what is a fair 13 compensation. 14 I would submit that all of that reasoning about 15 what is a fair compensation scheme is also reasoning why 16 it's unjust and unreasonable for a carrier not to pay the 17 compensation. It's not just simply a question of an ipse 18 dixit, it's a question of years of rulemaking and working 19 out what the scheme should be, so it's fair. 20 Once it did that, it didn't require a lot of 21 explanation for why a failure to pay fair compensation 22 that had been worked out over this period of time, a 23 failure to pay that was unjust and unreasonable. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you making the point that 25 Chief Judge Ginsburg made in the D.C. Circuit that it is
47

Alderson Reporting Company

1 necessarily unjust and unreasonable to refuse to pay a 2 charge that is fair and reasonable? 3 MR. FELDMAN: Yes. I'm really expanding on that 4 point, that it didn't -- the FCC has always gotten 5 deference for what -- determining what is unjust and 6 unreasonable under the Act. And it didn't require a 7 great deal of explanation. The FCC's explanation here 8 was more than adequate in light of its years of 9 explanation about why this -- this scheme with these 10 rates and these carriers and the primary economic 11 beneficiary being the one who pays. All of that were 12 reasons why this was fair compensation. 13 Once it decided all of that, it didn't take much 14 to say that a failure to pay fair compensation is unjust 15 and unreasonable. That was adequately explained and 16 didn't require a huge additional amount of explanation. 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: What -- sorry, go ahead. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would have a 19 different position here if 276 said something like, we 20 think there ought to be more pay phones; in order to 21 promote investment in pay phones, we're going to have 22 this scheme. In other words, it has nothing to do with 23 whether it's fair or not, it's a subsidy. Then you'd say 24 that could be something that's not covered by the "just 25 and reasonable" provision?

1 MR. FELDMAN: I think in that case also, I would 2 probably be here arguing that maybe if the FCC had 3 determined that it's necessary, for whatever regulations 4 they came up with under that scheme, in order for the Act 5 to function correctly, that they have to be complied 6 with. I think I would also argue that that was unjust 7 and unreasonable. 8 But this case, if the question is, did the 9 FCC adequately explain what it did here, I think that all 10 of the years of explanation of why something is fair are 11 also reasons why it was unjust and unreasonable not to 12 pay the compensation. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there regulations, FCC 14 regulations, the violation of which would not be unfair 15 and unreasonable? 16 MR. FELDMAN: I think there probably are. Mr. 17 Englert mentioned a couple. I mean, there's probably 18 numerous ones that wouldn't be. And in fact, the 19 question about most FCC action, or at least a lot of FCC 20 action, regulations, adjudications, and so on, most of 21 them have to do with carriers' obligations, and most of 22 them are things that have to do with what's unjust and 23 unreasonable under the Act. And they've been enforced 24 for years, in the -- you know, from the very early cases 25 under the Interstate Commerce Act.

1 Mr. Fisher also suggested that there's a 2 difficulty with numerous district courts deciding these 3 issues as opposed to the FCC. Well, I would suggest that 4 Congress decided that these kinds of actions can go 5 either to district court or to the FCC. And in fact, by 6 making damages actions, the scope of damages actions, as 7 opposed to other remedies, co-extensive, did anticipate 8 that there would be that result. The primary 9 jurisdiction -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Depending upon how broadly you 11 think Congress intends regulations to be sucked into the 12 terms of this statute. I mean, your interpretation means 13 Sandoval really didn't say a heck of a lot. 14 MR. FELDMAN: I don't think that that's correct. 15 It means that in the context of a statute that gives the 16 agency authority -- that prohibits unjust and 17 unreasonable action, which was not the case in 18 Sandoval -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but you could say any 20 violation of a regulation is unjust. 21 MR. FELDMAN: No. I think it is possible that the 22 FCC could determine that any violation of a regulation is 23 unjust, and the FCC is entitled to deference for its 24 determinations about what is unjust and unreasonable, 25 that's been --

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: So Sandoval doesn't mean a heck 2 of a lot. All the FCC has to say is, we think violation 3 of this regulation is unjust. 4 MR. FELDMAN: No. I think the FCC's determination 5 has to be reasonable under the ordinary types of Chevron 6 standards. But, in fact, when you look at questions of 7 what's just and unreasonable over the years, it is -- it 8 has always been the case that the agency entrusted with 9 determining that and getting the communications system 10 working or getting common carrier systems -- common 11 carriers to fulfill their obligations, does have a lot of 12 leeway in determining what is unjust and unreasonable in 13 that context. 14 Thank you. 15 THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Feldman. 16 Mr. Fisher, you have three minutes remaining. 17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 19 MR. FISHER: Thank you. Let me begin, Mr. Chief 20 Justice, with your question about whether the FCC can 21 opine on remedies. All you need to do is look to what 22 the FCC was telling everybody it was deciding in these 23 order proceedings. It was deciding, and asked for notice 24 and comment, on whether PSPs have a remedy for violations 25 of the pay phone regulations. That is cited everywhere
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 in the briefs. It never asked for notice and comments, 2 or considered whether failure to pay under the 3 regulations is a violation of 201(b). 4 So the question this Court needs to ask itself is 5 when the FCC, by its own acknowledgment, until now, is 6 simply opining on the presence of a Federal court remedy, 7 whether it gets deference simply because it hangs the 8 hook on a substantive provision of the statute. 9 Now, there are three problems with what the FCC 10 has done in construing section 201. The first is that 11 this is not a covered practice, because I want to make 12 clear our position, it's that the FCC has plenty of 13 authority with respect to carrier-customer relationships, 14 but not with respect to carrier-supplier relationships. 15 And that's what we have here. 16 On unjust and unreasonable, I think we need to 17 unpack two separate questions. One is whether the rate 18 the FCC chose is reasonable, whether the amount of money 19 that it said needs to be put into pay phone operators' 20 pockets is a fair and reasonable choice. We have no 21 dispute about that. And we think that in and of itself 22 could generate deference. 23 But the FCC's determination to put the payment 24 obligation on long distance carriers simply can't be 25 shoehorned into the unjust and unreasonable phrase in
52

1 201(b), because if that's -- the only reason why 2 anything, us failing to pay the money, would be because 3 of the regulations. 4 And you hear it again and again in their argument, 5 the FCC having concluded that long distance companies are 6 the ones that pay, the failure to pay is unjust and 7 unreasonable. There's no way to get there without the 8 regulations, and that's what distinguishes -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not true. You can 10 say that this is a way you make a lot of money from your 11 customers that you wouldn't otherwise make, because if 12 there wasn't a pay phone there, they wouldn't be able to 13 use your service. 14 MR. FISHER: The FCC might have said that, but as 15 I said to Justice Souter, that would be a very different 16 proceeding and a very different scheme than we have here, 17 and a very different dollar figure or cent figure that 18 the FCC might have come up with when it was trying to 19 encapsulate that figure, which we think is zero, but 20 under your reasoning may be something very small. But 21 that would be a very different case. 22 Two more things. One is, on the jurisdictional 23 mismatch question, Mr. Chief Justice, you are exactly 24 right. It is not hard -- there are plenty of hard things 25 in this case, but figuring out whether a call is
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 interstate or intrastate is not one of them. 2 All you need to know is where the call originated from, 3 and the number that was dialed, and pay phone operators 4 have that information. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the cell phone 6 example? 7 MR. FISHER: This is a pay phone case. So all you 8 need to know is the cell phone number and 9 that -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't know, the 11 cell phone holder may be right next to the pay phone or 12 he may be across the country. 13 MR. FISHER: I think it still constitutes a long 14 distance call, depending on where the cell phone owner 15 lives. And that's still an easy thing to figure out, 16 where the area code is. 17 Finally, Justice Stevens, you asked a question 18 about the co-extensive nature of the remedies under 206 19 and 208. We don't dispute that the statute itself is 20 co-extensive. What we're saying is that 276 gives the 21 FCC more than ample authority to do what it's doing. 22 Nobody has denied that, and so we think that that's the 23 place to look for the FCC to craft the arrangement under 24 Southwestern Cable. Combined with section 154(i), the 25 FCC would have ample authority to do that.
