  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The petitioner in this case, Shakur Muhammad, is a state prisoner who has brought a civil rights action alleging that a prison guard framed him on a false disciplinary charge in retaliation for his having exercised his constitutional right to seek redress in the courts for this same prison guard's previous misconduct. For three reasons, this Court should not engraft onto this type of Section 1983 claim a favorable termination requirement that would make this prisoner have to win his claim in another forum before he can seek his remedy in Federal court. First, the favorable termination requirement is a habeas protecting advice - device - that was borne of this Court's recognition that Congress would not have wanted a general civil rights action to be the vehicle for undoing a state criminal judgment, particularly given the more specific habeas exhaustion requirement. Second, extending the favorable termination requirement beyond this original rationale lacks any basis in the statute's terms or history, and it's devoid of the kind of common law pedigree that might suggest Congress envisioned a broader application to cases that do not look like habeas cases in that they don't involve a direct or an indirect challenge to the fact or duration of custody. And finally, any remaining qualms about Congress' intent are resolved by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, where, after carefully weighing the interests of overburdened courts and of prison officials, Congress imposed an administrative exhaustion requirement, not a favorable termination requirement."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But I don't understand this about this case. I'm having an awfully hard time understanding this case, and - and it seemed to me what had happened was that the - your client, who's certainly well represented, he is sitting there at lunch and he makes some faces or gestures and the prison guard then has him up for a couple of charges and he basically is acquitted of the more serious one and they punish him for the more - less serious, threatening behavior, no, it's insolence or something like that. He never says a word about retaliation, never says a word about it. He never appeals, which he could have done, his conviction. He never says to the prison authorities, hey, throw this out. The whole thing was based on the guard's desire to retaliate. And now suddenly have his - not having done any of that, we're in Federal court, and the Federal magistrate says, you know, he has no evidence of retaliation, or at least not enough. And now we're up here arguing about Heck v. Humphrey, sort of like the Finnegan's Wake of the habeas corpus law, and I - I can't really understand how we even got here. I - I don't understand why, if you're right, this isn't an unexhausted claim, or at least the magistrate said you don't - your client, unfortunately for him, has not enough evidence. How do we get into this?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I suppose one of the reasons you got into it was that the Sixth Circuit said that you had - had to comply with Heck against Humphrey, and you didn't agree with it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "Well, that's right, and you know, this is undoubtedly a valid First Amendment retaliation claim. The idea here is our - our client is saying, you know, he - he made perfectly appropriate allegations in the courts against this prison - this prison guard in prior lawsuits, and the guard set out to get him -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Can we reach this - I can't reach the Sixth - the question that the circuit thought was here. I don't see what we're supposed to say. What are we supposed to say? That - that this unexhausted claim, nonetheless, in 1983 states a claim?"

    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "It's not - I don't believe it's an -"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If I said what I said, is that correct what I've said?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "I don't think so, because it's not an unexhausted claim, and I believe the whole point of this case is the - is the misstatement of the law by the Sixth Circuit that would deem this a non-civil rights claim, basically a habeas claim completely contrary to this Court's precedent in Preiser. We have, you know, Preiser v. Rodriguez, which set up the way, you know, followed up on by Heck v. Humphrey, the way that we decide which way these cases should go. Is this a civil rights claim? It should go through 1983. Or is it something we're worried might swallow the habeas exhaustion requirement?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, does the Heck Humphrey issue that comes to us one that is affected by whether good- time credits are lost?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "The - whether good-time credits are lost is a - is a consideration and whether this is a fact or duration case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "And this case is nothing about -"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So after all the briefing, the additional briefing that's gone on, do we know now for sure whether good-time credits are affected here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "I think we do. The most important point on that question, Justice O'Connor, is something that I - a point I unfortunately made in a footnote instead of in the text, footnote 6 on page 5 of the yellow brief, which I wish had been the first sentence of my issue in bold, and that point is that it doesn't matter, because we're not - no part of our constitutional claim challenges the insolence conviction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But is - is that really the point? It's not what you challenge, it's the implication of what you want to be held."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "It - that's right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And those are quite different things. I mean, if in fact good-time credits are lost, even though you are not asking for any adjudication on good-time credits, then it necessarily follows that the length of the sentence can be affected, and it necessarily follows that at some point there could be a habeas claim because the individual was not being released."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "That's right, but there's nothing about this claim that would ever, you know, ever lead to the result, under the test necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of good-time credits, which, by the way, I don't believe we were deprived of good-time credits, because of the reasons I state in my brief. Our client is a habitual offender and this claim was not raised in the lower court but -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, let - let's - could we just make a short excursus there? Assuming that no good-time credits are lost with respect to the minimum sentence, the point of - determining the earliest point at which he could be paroled, isn't it the case under state law that good-time credits still would be applied to the maximum sentence?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "That - that is true. I don't believe that would ever -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Then - then isn't that the end of your argument -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "I don't think so."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "- because doesn't it - I mean, let me just finish -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "Sure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "- my - my question so you know where I'm going. If - if - if the good-time credits would apply to the maximum sentence, then it seems to me that if he is not released at the point at which he says he should be entitled to good-time credits, he's got a habeas claim."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "I don't think that - I think that that aspect of the claim, you know, aside from waiver and aside from not challenging the conviction that led to the good-time credits, if they exist, is still not true, I don't think. It - it's too hypothetical. Most of these cases are like Preiser, where there would be immediate release. He has to serve his minimum sentence under Michigan law, so he's not ever going to get out earlier than his minimum. He - those will not be shortened by good-time credits. After that, he's going to see the parole board several times. He's going to be 103 years old when he hits his maximum sentence. The likelihood that he would actually not be dismissed until his maximum sentence, you know, be discharged as opposed to paroled earlier than that and have his sentence terminated long before his maximum, you know, just makes it impossible that this would be anything but hypothetical -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but for ease of judicial administration, do we really want to have to look at how old he's going to be and all of these things? Is it not possible to say at the end of the day, good-time credits still apply to the maximum, so you're out of here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "Well, that may be true in another case, but it's not true in our case, because we're not challenging, you know, nothing about our constitutional claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of that insolence conviction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, sticking with Justice O'Connor's question, suppose good-time credits were involved here, but insofar as the prisoner is concerned, it was wholly peripheral, and assume that the good-time credits would not click into operation for another 20 years. Would it make sense for us to insist on Heck v. Humphrey in those circumstances?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "In - I mean, I think that - that Preiser created a clean line, and this Court has decided repeatedly that good-time - the loss of good-time credits falls on the fact or duration side of that line, and I think it makes sense to continue to maintain that clean line, and it's the kind of thing where good-time credits are the hard case. There's -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So you think it does - so you think that if good-time credits were unequivocally involved here, that the Heck rule would apply?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "I don't - I - I think that's what this Court's precedents would suggest. There might be room for reconsideration of the good-time credits in the future when it - when it starts to get real hypothetical or when there - if there might be some abuses, such as prison, you know, evidence that prisons were, you know, had the perverse incentive of tacking on good-time credits to -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, this is - this is very strange when we - when the original idea, I thought, of Heck was typing the kind of claim. I think the Court said in that case, this is not a prison condition case like my dietary law is not observed, am I not getting medical treatment, but it - it is like - there was an analogy to malicious prosecution, and here this has the same flavor, that this is - the complaint is that this guard had it in for me, and there were trumped up charges. And the way you get around - would you say you're not really attacking the insolence, what he - he was convicted, so you're only concerned with the six days pre-hearing detention, but I don't see how you can, in all candor, chop up your complaint that way, because if the officer hadn't been retaliatory, the officer wouldn't have confronted him in the first place, he wouldn't have been insolent, and nothing would happen. So how you can say is, well, we'll accept the insolence but really we don't because this is a retaliation and there never would have been any charge at all."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "Well, I - that's - part - along the lines of the argument the respondent makes in trying to use a - sort of a but-for kind of take, or test, or a relevance kind of test, but that is not the test. The test is whether the claim, the constitutional claim, would necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or sentence -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I - I thought your response to that was that provocation was no defense to the charge -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "That's right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "- to the charge of insolence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "The respondent is - is arguing that - that it goes to credibility. Credibility is not enough. That's about relevance or admissibility."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But is not your position, and I don't know that the other side has contested it, that provocation would not have been a defense to the charge of insolence?"

    "speech": "That's right. There's no -"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How - how do I decide that, because that, it seems to me, is why I kept thinking I'm having trouble with this case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "Well -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It is inconceivable to me that under any law of any place that if a guard has gone and brought this whole thing about as a way of retaliating against a First Amendment right, I can't imagine a tribunal that wouldn't throw out the whole thing. I mean, I know you say, oh no, that isn't what they would have done. If he had gone to that disciplinary body and it said, look, I have proof here that this is total fake by the guard in retaliation for my First Amendment right, what that body would have said is, we convict you still of insolence but not of the greater charge. That to me is inconceivable, but whether that's so or not is a pure matter of state law, and - and it seems to me that this case then turns on a pure matter of state law, because I think if it is totally separate maybe you're right. If it isn't totally separate, I don't see how you could be right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You couldn't - you couldn't say, hearing examiner in the prison, I want to tell you something. The guard's doing this because I filed some earlier claims against him. What - what would be so hard about doing that?"

  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "In fact, we actually - the hearing officer himself, in his deposition, which is at joint appendix 102 to 103, indicates he - he - retaliation was not a defense. It might go to credibility, but he can't consider that -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but that's a - that's an issue of fact. And the thing that's bothering Justice Breyer is the same thing that's bothering me, and that is it seems a - it seems like a very strange statement of law to say that there would be no retaliation defense, and if - and yet it seems to me you've got to say that in order to avoid Heck and Humphrey. So what's your basis for saying it? Do you have -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "It's -"

You just assumed that?"

A police officer who's charged with a civil rights violation for - for whacking a demonstrator cannot please - plead as a defense, I was provoked.

I think his complaint says, I'm sitting there, the officer made some faces, lured me into this whole thing, and then what he charged me with was false. So I - I didn't see - it's what Justice Ginsburg, I think, was talking about at the beginning. I'm just - maybe you have nothing else to say on it, but I saw this being chopped up.

Humphrey part, the exhaustion part -"

I mean, the gist - the most tangible part of - of the complaint is that I was overcharged, you know, and I had to do pre-hearing detention, six days in pre-hearing detention that I would not otherwise have had to do because this guard was retaliating against me for suing him, for exercising -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "This is the amended complaint. It was not his original complaint, and one of the many puzzling features in this case is the Sixth Circuit is addressing the original complaint, where this man says, I want the whole thing expunged, not that, yes, I was insolent, but I wasn't engaged in threatening behavior. The initial complaint said, this officer retaliated against me, the whole thing is no good, court, expunge the discipline. And it was only in the amended complaint that they came up with this theory, oh, insolence was all right, and the only thing that we're attacking is the threatening behavior."

The magistrate of the district court denied that motion, saying he is not challenging his misconduct. They agreed with his theory that this was a stand-alone retaliation case. So nobody - neither party nor the district court nor the Sixth Circuit got into the fine points of the argument about whether this was a duration case or a conditions case."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "- on which we granted certiorari. That's the question we - whether a plaintiff who wishes to bring a 1983 suit challenging only the conditions rather than the fact or duration of his confinement must satisfy Heck v. Humphrey. Now, that question is not in the case, if indeed the duration of his confinement is what is affected. And did you respond in the brief in opposition by saying, actually, this question is not even in the case?"

    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Yes. We -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But even if you did, it's not in the case, none of it's in the case on the assumption your colleague there was making, or your opponent. Imagine that Mr. Muhammad wins his claim in the 1983 action, which the fact that they thought didn't have enough evidence suggests he wouldn't, but suppose he did. Then he says, what I've showed was illegal under the Constitution or whatever, was, by being put in confinement for six days before my hearing, and my being charged with threatening behavior, that's it, that's all. The rest of it is all beside the point. I don't complain about my insolence. I don't complain about the seven days. I don't complain about the loss of good time. I don't complain about anything except the six pre-hearing days and the later dropped charge of threatening. So, if he's right about that, if you can do that, if in fact his winning on that in no way calls into question the conviction or the loss of good time or the seven later days for insolence, then under Heck, of course he can bring it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Yes, that - that's correct. Heck - the favorable termination requirement of Heck only applies when the nature of the challenge necessarily implies -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Fine. So now I've got to the point that either she's obviously right or you're obviously right, and what it depends upon is a matter of state law, which is whether, as a matter of state law, should he win this claim, it is true that his showing the retaliation in respect to the six previous days and threatening in no way calls into question the validity of the insolence conviction, the seven days, and the loss of good time. So I say, what is the answer to that question of state law? Or a sister concluded - it's fairly obvious under the law that they are separate. Now what do you conclude?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "We argue that they are not separate, that the nature of this challenge does in fact necessarily imply the invalidity of his misconduct determination. What he's challenging in this Federal lawsuit is retaliatory disciplinary action. That - that's the language that he used in his amended complaint. What he's saying is that the guard acted with an improper motive and that these adverse consequences flowed from that. The only adverse consequences that he's alleging are involved in the misconduct hearing. So we don't think that the fact that he was found guilty of insolence and not threatening behavior has any bearing at all on this question. It was one incident, one charge that this particular hearing officer felt should be reduced to a lower charge, but the nature of his challenge, if - if Mr. Muhammad is correct that this guard acted unconstitutionally, there should not have been any misconduct charges, should not have been a hearing, should not have been any pre-hearing detention or post-hearing punishment."

You - you think it, as a matter of constitutional law, you - you could not - you could not say that a prisoner has no right to threaten a guard even if he - even if he claims to have been provoked or has no right to insolent behavior even if he claims to have been provoked? As a matter of constitutional law, the prison cannot have such rules?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm saying it - it does not affect it if he would have been convicted anyway, and the contention of the other side is that he was guilty of the offense, both the major offense, if he had been guilty of that, and the minor offense, regardless of whether there was provocation on the part of the guard."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But I think what you're not - it isn't the issue of whether provocation is a defense to a charge of insolence. I thought what you were saying is that this whole string never would have happened, nothing would have happened. If he - if he establishes the retaliation, then none of this would have happened, and it's just one episode."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Well, if - if he's correct that this retaliation is independent of the hearing process, that's - that's his argument. Our argument is that the only thing he's complaining about is the retaliatory action, and the retaliatory action was charging him with misconduct. He -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is not - not retaliation separate in the hearing process. You're saying, is his point that when the guard looked at him from outside the cafeteria and made faces at him, and then he came in, and then the prisoner stands up and gives him some very dirty looks, according to the guard. Now, if you can separate out there the retaliation, if you can separate out there what the guard did by way of retaliation, making some very bad faces through the window, and insolence under state law, which would exist even if the guard were badly motivated in making the bad faces, then you've got your two separate things."

The only thing that gives rise to a constitutional right is the adverse action of charging him with misconduct. That's why we say that this charge is necessarily implicated in the hearing process. It necessary - necessarily implicates that his misconduct determination is invalid. If he's right that there should have been no charge at all, if he's right on that, then the Heck v. Humphrey analysis doesn't even come into play. We think he's wrong on that. The - the district court felt he was right on that and - and ruled against us on our Heck v. Humphrey motion. The Sixth Circuit in effect said we were right on that, that the nature of this challenge does implicate the hearing process, and under Sixth Circuit precedent, they said, therefore, it falls."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's the difference?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Correct. And the difference was created because the majority in Heck based much of its decision on a rationale of the common law. A concurring opinion in that case, signed by four justices, said, no, we're not going to base it on that rationale because that might mean that there would be no Civil Rights Act remedy in any such case. Subsequently, in the Spencer v. Kemna, one of the judges who - or justices - who had been in the majority changed her mind and is now agreeing with the rationale of the concurring opinion in Heck. So that's why the Sixth Circuit, or that's why the courts of appeals are split on this. On the facts of Edwards and Heck it involved just duration claims, but depending on the rationale for the rule, it may or may not apply to conditions cases. We say it does apply to conditions cases because -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And the condition here - and one thing is the abstract level on which you're speaking, the other is concretely what this case is about. This case is about six days spent in pre-hearing detention. It's the only thing that money is sought for. Now, we're told that insolence is bondable, threatening behavior is not. Does bondable mean it will be bond? What is the incidence? What practically is the effect?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Some - some major misconducts are mandatory non-bondable. Threatening behavior, the original charge, was mandatory -"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "I - I don't have the statistics of - the Department of Corrections probably could compile that, but I don't know.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But was - was this argument raised below that there's no cause of action because there's no assurance that he wouldn't have been kept for six days anyway, even if it was bondable? You - you didn't defend on that ground, did you?"

  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "It was not argued in those terms, no. As I said, the case was argued -"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why do we want to get into that? I - I don't understand."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "No. We did not argue the - the terms of the bond versus non-bondable, because it simply didn't come up."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So suppose now - I think Justice O'Connor may be causing the light to dawn in my head - suppose you're right, suppose that there is just one ball of wax. Suppose the - this is all a waste of time trying to separate those two things. There's just one thing. There's a conviction, all right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Now, we look to see what happens if he wins. If he wins, we set aside the whole conviction, but good time is out of it. And since good time is out of it, of course he can bring a 1983 action, because this wasn't the kind of thing that habeas was designed for. Habeas was about duration of - of staying in prison, and with good time out of it, it doesn't matter whether it's one ball of wax or two. He can go in on 1983 since there's no conflict with the habeas statute. What's your response to that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Our response to that in - in - in response to the question that the Court granted certiorari on is that even if good time was not at issue in the case, if the only punishment he received affected the conditions of confinement, our argument is, it's still appropriate to look to the traditions of the common law and public policy considerations to determine whether a cause of action in those circumstances is cognizable in 1983. We've argued that it is not cognizable. If he is challenging the validity of his misconduct determination, that's analogous to the common law tort of malicious prosecution. The elements of that tort require favorable termination before it can succeed. We believe that - that same element applies in a 1983 case. So if he does not get favorable termination of his prison misconduct, he cannot bring a suit for damages under 1983."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It is essential to your argument, is it not, that provocation would be a defense?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If provocation would - would not be a defense, then even if he establishes provocation, for which he can get damages, he would not be impairing the judgment against him."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "One of the elements of the constitutional cause of action for retaliation is adverse action against the prisoner because of his protected conduct. The adverse action in this case is not the staring down and the nose-to-nose confrontation. The adverse action is charging misconduct, and we say, if he's right in his complaint that there would not have been a misconduct charge but for this action, that necessarily implies that the misconduct proceeding is invalid, and that triggers the analogy to malicious prosecution and its element of favorable termination."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So that you say basically, the importance of Heck and Humphrey here is the way it says you ought to refer to common law analogies in analyzing whether there ought to be a 1983 action, and that has nothing to do in the final analysis with whether there's a collision between habeas corpus and 1983. That is an - that is an independent requirement of the way you go about analyzing 1983 actions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Yes, that's correct."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So that even though there isn't a habeas corpus problem, you still go through the same methodology?"

    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Correct. You say the same methodology applies whether it's just conditions or duration of confinement. If it's a -"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Are you essentially making an exhaustion of - of state remedies then? It seems to me - are you - you're not saying that this person would have no complaint, no Federal complaint, not in habeas, not in 1983? Are you saying that -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Yes."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Where does he get the favorable determination?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "The - if he got favorable termination by review of the misconduct - if he - if he had won at the misconduct or if he had appealed and won on appeal, that would be favorable termination."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So you're saying essentially he hasn't exhausted his internal administrative remedies, and that's why the 1983 is improper?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "We say the - his failure to exhaust is another independent reason why he does not have -"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You're saying he has to both exhaust and prevail?"

  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "That's correct. They're independent requirements."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And that seems somewhat inconsistent with at least the negative implication of the Federal statute, which says all he has to do is exhaust."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Well, the - the Court addressed that question in Heck v. Humphrey, and it said that even if a person exhausts his remedies, if he has not favorably terminated, he cannot bring the lawsuit unless and until he gets favorable termination. They're - they're independent. The exhaustion requirement -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that's the Heck v. Humphrey's gloss, but that's an additional requirement. Usually exhaustion does not require prevailing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "Well, that's correct. That's correct. The - the reason he has to get favorable termination in this case is because of the analogy to -"

    "speaker": "CASEY",
    "speech": "- malicious prosecution."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Right. It - it usually does not require prevailing, but it does require prevailing when - when your cause of action is that - that you have been subjected to the law improperly."

    "speaker": "BECKWITH",
    "speech": "Turning to the actual question presented in this case, there is no justification for the Sixth Circuit's rule extending the Heck favorable termination requirement to prison hearings that don't involve the fact or duration of custody. Congress could have amended 1983 to say that, but we know from the PLRA they looked at the same considerations, they did something different. The Sixth Circuit is an outlier here, as Justice O'Connor said, because there's no - there's no conflict with habeas in a - in a matter like this. As to all of the other questions that have come up during this argument, this case came to this Court in the posture where there were no good-time credits and there was no exhaustion question. Now, we think we can overcome those problems, but I don't think this Court needs to. And the - the government has never cited any law that says the guard's retaliatory conduct violating Mr. Muhammad's First Amendment rights would have been a defense, and we know of none. They argued that it was - it was relevant to credibility. They argued that that was some kind of a but-for relationship, but victory in the 1983 suit does not affect the adjudication for insolence in this claim. All of this only matters if good-time credits are at issue. And putting all of that aside, we just agree with Justice Breyer that then this is an easy case in our favor. If there are no further questions from the Court, we'd ask that you reverse the Sixth Circuit."
