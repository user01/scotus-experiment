    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The pivotal, and in my judgment, incorrect holding of the Eleventh Circuit in the Norfolk Southern case is reproduced in the appendix to this case, because Norfolk Southern is the controlling precedent for our -­ for our particular dispute. And at page 29A of the appendix to the petition, in there, the court of appeals said that there is nothing in the 4-R Act's plain language that indicates an intent to reach exemptions content from generally applicable sales and use taxes. To our way of thinking, all this case is the statute -- the effect of your argument is that the statute gives more protection in the case of non-property taxes than property taxes, and that's an -­ an odd reading of the statute, which is directed primarily to the -- to the property tax."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "No, I think, Justice Kennedy, what we are doing is recognizing that Congress was very specific and very explicit about how to treat property taxes and set up an entire quite carefully articulated scheme in dealing with them in (b)(1) and (b)(3), and then said, in general, when you are dealing with areas that are not approved by (b)(1) and (b)(3), then you have to examine whether or not the overall scheme, in fact, discriminates against rail carriers. So, while it is true that there could be circumstances in which you may end up with somewhat more protection as a consequence of (b)(4), I think that's a function of Congress not having limited the (b)(4) exemption to property, and just saying it's -- it's a discrimination against the rail carrier generally that Congress didn't have the full run mine of possibilities in front of it at that point in time. I mean, it probably had some sense of what other taxes were out there that might pose discrimination, but I do think that Congress is very much concerned that the States, once they saw the roadmap laid out for them in (b)(1) through (b)(3), might seek other ways to recoup what they were going to lose in revenues when the 3-year period lapsed, and to be in a position to protect the railroads in the (b)(4) -- through (b)(4) in a situation when there would be future actions taken by the States."

Every other lower court that -- every lower court that has looked at it has drawn the inference, which seems to me the only fair inference to draw, when not just something that's adopted by the States in lieu of a broader property tax. It is intended, then, to have, I think, the language that you would normally give to a term as broad and sweeping as any other tax that discriminates against rail carriers."

And the two protections that are embedded in there is one that Justice Ginsberg identified, which was to protect them against local interests in a way where they had no political influence, and the other one is to protect them against their direct competitors in the intermodal competition realm. And if it's -- if it's a discrimination that doesn't achieve either of those, then it seems to me you either say they are -- are not similarly situated or you would held -- you would hold that the State has a legitimate reason for doing what it's doing, and that that's just not a discrimination within the meaning of the statute."

    "speaker": "SCALIA",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "But it seems to me quite -- I mean, the flip side of that argument would be to say, if they imposed the tax of 4 percent on the railroads and 2 percent on 85-year-old widows, that would be challengeable under (b)(4), because it's not an exemption, it's a differential, and that the exemption down to zero is -- is attackable under (b)(4). It seems to me the right answer to this is, there is no reason to include your widow as a relative comparison class for purposes of (b)(4) and get out of that problem as opposed to setting this up. To me, the fallacy of this analysis is to try to use exemptions and say that there is something and to other taxes not covered by (b)(1) and (b)(3). Then, it seems to me, you have to -- you just should change the analysis. Look at whether or not similarly situated are being treated differently and if there is any kind of State justification for that, and if not, go through the analysis in the way -- and protect the railroads precisely the way that Congress meant for them to be protected."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Phillips, are you saying that the -- the railroads have to be taxed in the very same way as, say, the -- the trucks? Because one answer to your argument is: Well, they haven't created a non-tax situation for the other interstate carriers; they are just subject to a different tax. The motor carriers have to pay motor fuel tax. So are you saying to the State about that, you have to have the same sales tax, use tax, for everyone; you can't have a motor fuel tax for one and sales tax for the other?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "I think, ultimately, my One is that the State and the trial court conceded that the appropriate comparison class was the motor and water carriers. So the question of who is the -- who is properly in the comparison class has never been adjudicated. And second, it seems to me that the question of what constitutes discrimination is not the issue in this case. The only question in this case is whether there is something special about exemptions that makes them off-limits to the (b)(4) inquiry. So I think, candidly, Justice Ginsburg, while I'm quite certain that Alabama and I would disagree fundamentally about how to approach this, it doesn't seem to me that that's a question that this Court should tarry long over, and instead ought to simply evaluate the very narrow question that was both presented by the holding below and presented in the petition as it came through the Solicitor General's invitation stage, which again, as I say, very narrowly focuses exclusively on exemptions, and of course allow us to have them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Well, why does the course for the court -- taking account of what you said, that the provision about other taxes came out very late in the day -- they had spent a lot of time talking about the property tax. And the property tax, we know, they wanted to preserve the exemptions. So why not take this latecomer of thought or discussion and say: Well, we'll assume that they want to treat that with regard to exemptions the same way that they treated property tax, which was the big-ticket item."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, I think part of the reason, it may well be because the property tax was a big-ticket item, so you were trying to protect certain State interests, and Congress did it very clearly. I think it is quite a remarkable stretch of -- of construction of the statute for the Court to say, we're going to take this very carefully reticulated scheme, which creates the inference that Congress meant to protect these kinds of exemptions for the States, and say we are going to now incorporate that wholesale, when Congress didn't use language that in any way compares. It didn't include -- it didn't limit it to railroad property. It didn't define a class in any unfortunately -- I recognize that is not the most satisfying solution sometimes, but we will leave it to the courts to decide what forms of discrimination we would have intended to preclude, because we are here to protect the railroads. If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the balance of my time."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SHERRY",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The only question that the Court needs to resolve today is whether a non-property tax that's imposed on a rail carrier but from which its competitors are exempt can ever be another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier under subsection (b)(4). The discrimination inquiry under (b)(4), whether we are talking about exemptions or whether we are talking about differential tax rates or whether we are talking about any other type of discrimination claim that can be brought under (b)(4). That is the very nature of (b)(4): It broadly prohibits another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier, and inherent is that is the notion that courts are going to have to decide what it means to discriminate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Do you think we have to decide whether the appropriate comparison class is the rail carriers' competitors or some broader class?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SHERRY",
    "speech": "I don't think the Court has to decide it. As Mr. Phillips pointed out, that was an issue that was conceded below by the State, at least at this stage of the proceedings. And they acknowledged that in note 7 of their brief, so it wasn't something that was addressed by the Eleventh Circuit below. I think, as the Court wants to address it, it should reject the notion that the only comparison talks about another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier. Congress easily could have said another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier, as compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers, and it didn't do that. And Justice Ginsburg, to your question involving whether we should be focusing on interstate versus local businesses and whether that was Congress's focus, of course that was -- that was certainly one of their concerns, but the reason that doesn't work is if you look to even subsections (b)(1) through (3), the comparison that is very clearly spelled out there is not between local businesses and interstate businesses; it's between rail transportation property and other commercial and industrial property. Now, that other commercial and industrial property can be owned by an interstate business like Wal-Mart just as easily as it can be owned by a local coffee shop, and so I think to suggest that the only thing Congress wanted to prohibit was this local asked is why Congress would want to treat property taxes' exemptions differently than non-property tax exemptions, and I think the answer has to come from the text. In ACF, this court concluded that Congress did not want to prohibit property tax exemptions based on the text of the statute and its structure. And when it comes to non-property taxes, the text of the act and the structure of the act simply tell a different story, and that has to be the best indicator of what Congress intended. Again, subsection (b)(4) speaks broadly of another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier. This court has long recognized that taxes can discriminate in a number of different ways, including by granting some taxpayers an exemption and not granting that exemption to other taxpayers. That's the ordinary meaning of \"discriminates,\" and the broad and unqualified language in (b)(4) is easily susceptible to that meaning."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SHERRY",
    "speech": "The government's position, first with respect to subsection (c), is that it is a broad grant of jurisdiction to the district courts to adjudicate all violations of subsection (b), and that seems clear from the first sentence in that provision. I'd also note that the arguments that were made with respect to subsection (c) in this case were brought up by the government in ACF; and in ACF the government explained why the best reading of subsection (c) is a broad grant of jurisdiction over all violations of subsection (b). That's clearly what Congress intended. While Congress intended to provide a substantive right for rail carriers to come into court and claim discrimination on one of the four -- under one of the four subsections, it also intended to provide a Federal forum. And the reason that it did that was because at the time, rail carriers were having a very hard time bringing claims in the State court. The Tax Injunction Act was out there then, as it is now, and it whether there is discrimination, and the Court finds discrimination between the way the railroad is taxed and the way motor carriers are taxed, what -- what then? What is the remedy?"

If the -- the Court were to find discrimination but find that maybe, you know, 50 percent of the tax was compensated by this other tax, it could by reducing the tax, for example, in this case on the railroad or by increasing the tax on the people who are otherwise exempt."

Certainly Congress was concerned with taxes that would single out a rail carrier, but that wasn't their only concern. And an example that I've thought of but I think helps put that into some perspective is: I think Alabama would concede that if instead of imposing a generally applicable sales tax, it had a separate excise tax on diesel fuel for use in locomotives, and it was a 4 percent tax, looks exactly like the one we are looking at, except it is an a separate excise tax, that that would be the type of singled-out tax that could be challenged under (b)(4). And it makes little sense that they -- that a State could basically insert that type of tax into a generally applicable sales tax and that would be immunized from any scrutiny.

That is noticeably absent from (b)(4), and in fact wouldn't really work in (b)(4). And what I mean by that is if you look at (b)(1) and you look at (b)(3), it's a comparison between transportation rail property on the one hand and commercial and industrial property on the other; and as we all know, commercial and industrial property is specifically defined to -- may I finish?"

So another tax that discriminates is a tax that singles out railroads as compared to the general mass of taxpayers. The pivotal question in this case is the one raised by Justice Kagan and Justice Scalia, and that is: Why in the world would Congress, on the one hand, say you can exempt property taxes under this statute, but you can't -- you -- we are prohibiting sales and use tax the universe of non-property taxes is -- so infinitely large that there's a much greater room for -- a much great danger of discrimination.

What -- what conceivable reason would Congress want that differential to exist? difference, a benefit of any kind to an individual business, Congress understood that that is important to the State. Let's say, for example, we had a business who's has had an economic crisis or we want to bring a new business into the State. Congress understood that is important to the State tax policy. The point of the statute was simply to put the railroads on equal footing. Again, if you think back to property taxes, we can treat trucks however we want to. We could exempt them. We can treat them at a different rate. As long as the railroads are paying an equal rate to the general mass, it's not discrimination."

They will argue against the States' different comparison classes.

    "speaker": "MAZE",

The railroads actually said that themselves. If you start reading intent into the statute, the intent was simply to put them on equal footing. So you would have to read (b)(4) to say, just like property taxes, and non-property taxes as long as they are subject to a generally applicable tax there is no discrimination, you are not subject to challenge. So again, I don't think that would -- would be an issue. Now one of the problems I see that the Court has is this fear that the States are going to take a business, our schools don't have any money. We are not going to pick on the railroads by exempting, exempting, exempting, exempting. The railroads, quite honestly, can't fund our schools. We are having a hard enough time funding them as it is, and we are not going to just target railroads by exemption. So I see that the Court might have a problem understanding what's the line with exemptions, but it's just never going to happen."

  {
    "speaker": "MAZE",
    "speech": "Right, because that's the way it works for property taxes. Let me be very clear what we are asking the Court to hold. On page 335 of ACF, this is what the Court held in that case: A State may grant exemptions from a generally applicable ad valorem property tax without subjecting the taxation of railroad property to challenge under (b)(4). All we are asking the Court to do in this case is substitute three words. Ad valorem property is out; sales and use tax is in. There is nothing in the language, the structure or history of the Act that would suggest, much less clearly and manifestly mandate, which is necessary under the clear statement rule, that that rule should be any different. Again, it would be illogical because it would be illogical to think that Congress spent 15 years use taxes. The point was made earlier, the railroads will sue us all of the time to save money. It's very telling that the railroads didn't sue any State, despite we have been taxing this way since the 1930s, until the late 80s or early 90s under this theory, because even they when they read this statute, understood it to mean only if we are singled out or targeted. That's the way they litigated (b)(4) for the first decade. It's only when they couldn't win those cases any more that they changed what they believed it meant. But the fact that this was able -- again sales and use taxes is their most expensive tax. And as they say in the -- in the Norfolk Southern opinion, the third largest expenditure of the railroads is diesel fuel. If the third largest expenditure of the railroads is out there to be taken away -- the taxes, they certainly would have sued us within the first 10 years if this statute clearly said we couldn't do it. But nobody believed that is what the statute said, because Congress never said it in the entire 15-year history. The statute itself when you read it doesn't say it. Just as the Court said in ACF, this statute is at best vague on the point of tax exemptions. And in that case, under the clear statement rule, you have to defer to the State. Congress needs to tell us specifically what we can and can't do."

Therefore exemptions of that amount of tax, 1 percent exemption of that amount of tax is not a whole lot of money. Today the rates are $4 a gallon, and an exemption under those circumstances, particularly when you have a fixed rate for your major competitor, gives you a more than substantial incentive to bring an action under these circumstances. The notion that somehow the -- the State has gone down this path because of Federal law has not been true for at least 15 years.
