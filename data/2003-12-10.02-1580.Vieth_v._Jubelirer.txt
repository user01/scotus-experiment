 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 next in No. 02-1580, Richard Vieth, et al. v. Robert
 5 Jubelirer. 
 6 Mr. Smith.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 9 MR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 10 the Court:
 11 This Court held 17 years ago in Davis v.
 12 Bandemer that a claim of partisan gerrymandering is
 13 actionable under the Federal Constitution. But the lower
 14 courts have since effectively overruled Bandemer by 15 requiring factual showings of plaintiffs in these cases
 16 that are both impossible and, I submit, irrational. As a
 17 result, the state -
 18 QUESTION: Well, do you - do you - do you think
 19 the lower courts then didn't follow Bandemer? I mean,
 20 Bandemer set a very, very high standard.
 21 MR. SMITH: Well, the standard that I think was -
 22 the proper reading of Bandemer does not require that you
 23 show that your members of your party have been completely
 24 disenfranchised, to the extent that African-Americans once
 25 were in the South, or that - that your party has

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 effectively been banned. The standard that was applied
 2 here required that you show that you're being prevented
 3 from registering to vote, from raising money, from
 4 campaigning, from showing up at the polls.
 5 Those kinds of constitutional violations don't
 6 make sense as an element of a partisan gerrymandering
 7 claim, because they're not about gerrymandering, and of
 8 course, they never occur. So if you're going to say the
 9 claim is justiciable, it doesn't make sense simultaneously
 10 to require people to establish those kinds of independent
 11 violations.
 12 QUESTION: Three of us in Bandemer thought the
 13 claim was not justiciable.
 14 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, and I would submit 15 to you that - that - that history suggests that - that it
 16 - the Court should not go that direction, because -
 17 QUESTION: I was thinking history showed that was
 18 the way to go.
 19 MR. SMITH: Well, what - what we've seen, Your
 20 Honor, because of the - the fact that the lower courts
 21 have effectively read - rendered -
 22 QUESTION: They couldn't - they can't reach a
 23 decision under that Bandemer standard. It's impossible. 
 24 So maybe the way to go is to just stay hands off these
 25 things.

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SMITH: Well, we've never had a - an
 2 opportunity for the lower courts to actually apply a
 3 standard that says when does the map become so unfair that
 4 it's anti-democratic? What they have done instead is
 5 apply this shut-out standard, which doesn't allow any real
 6 scrutiny of the map.
 7 QUESTION: Let - let me tell you my concern with
 8 - with fairness. If - if you look at British
 9 parliamentary history, begin with Walpole and go to
 10 Disraeli and Gladstone and Pitt and Churchill, and then if
 11 you come to this country and you think about Dirksen and
 12 Cannon and Webster and Clay, I don't recall any of them
 13 ever talking about this issue from a standpoint of
 14 fairness. 
 I don't know what I'm supposed to look to. 15 Legislate - there's just no sources on which we could -
 16 from - from which we can draw.
 17 I would concede that what happens here is unfair
 18 in some common - common parlance. It - it - it looks
 19 pretty raw. But I don't recall legislators talking about
 20 what neutral standards ought to be. Now, we have in our
 21 own juris - people talk about contiguity, geographical
 22 compactness, but I just don't think we have a - a large
 23 source on which to draw. We know about numbers, one - one
 24 person, one vote. But beyond that, I - it - it seems to
 25 me that we're at sea.

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, what we - what we
 2 try to do is articulate a standard which is tied to the
 3 basic democratic values that are at stake and to the - and
 4 to the article I standard that says the people should
 5 ultimately be deciding who's going to be representing them
 6 in Congress, not the states. The one thing that's clear
 7 from the constitutional -
 8 QUESTION: Well, since we're talking about
 9 article I, it also says that the times, place, and manners
 10 of holding elections for Senators and Representatives
 11 shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature, but
 12 the Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter such
 13 regulations. That suggests to me it's none of our
 14 business.
 15 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, this Court held in
 16 Wesberry v. Sanders, and has since twice done - applied
 17 that again, both in Cook v. Gralike and the - and in the
 18 Term Limits case, that there are judicially enforceable
 19 limits on the extent to which a state, in exercising the
 20 procedural power to establish the times, places, and
 21 manners of congressional elections, can create an uneven
 22 playing field and attempt to try to dictate the outcome of
 23 an election.
 24 QUESTION: All right. But then the problem is
 25 that I think I have and others is, what are these

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 standards? Now, you propose, one, look to the mind of the
 2 legislature. We'll do that. They'll always want party
 3 advantage, always. Look to the extent to which they
 4 depart from historically drawn lines. Well, the
 5 historically drawn lines themselves are random. Third,
 6 history. Why is history the key? Third, look to see
 7 whether or not the minority party might get the majority
 8 of votes, but the minority of seats. Whether they might
 9 in the future, that depends how people vote in the future. 
 10 There's no set of lines where you couldn't
 11 imagine results that could come out that way. So how do
 12 we do it?
 13 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, that's - with - with all
 14 respect, I - I - first of all, we don't suggest that you 15 should somehow look at the departure from historical
 16 lines. That's not part of our -
 17 QUESTION: You said look to see whether the
 18 traditional criteria are predominantly ignored.
 19 MR. SMITH: That's -
 20 QUESTION: That's what I'm referring to.
 21 MR. SMITH: Okay. That's part of the intent -
 22 yes.
 23 QUESTION: I've read it. I understand it.
 24 MR. SMITH: Our - our standard on effects is that
 25 - does not suggest that politics should be taken out of

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 this process. As this Court recognized in Gaffney -
 2 QUESTION: No, no. I - my question is, how do
 3 your standards possibly work?
 4 MR. SMITH: The standard would be, under our -
 5 under our submission, can you demonstrate that it is
 6 absolute - that it is very clear that you could get more
 7 than half the votes and have no chance.
 8 QUESTION: Always can.
 9 MR. SMITH: No.
 10 QUESTION: You can't draw a set of lines such
 11 that I couldn't imagine a voting pattern such that that
 12 wouldn't happen.
 13 MR. SMITH: But, you see, our standard is
 14 precisely the opposite. You have to show that it would -
 15 under any voting pattern, it would happen. There is no
 16 possibility that with more than half the votes you could
 17 get anywhere near half the seats.
 18 QUESTION: You're - you're just pulling this -
 19 you're just pulling this thing out of a hat, so to speak. 
 20 I mean, you've got phrases in the Constitution that
 21 Congress may do it or the states may do it. You've got
 22 the Equal Protection Clause, which was - came into being,
 23 you know, in 1868, not in the original Constitution. And
 24 they - they just don't intimate anything like what you're
 25 talking about.

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, we - we focus on
 2 this 50/50 point, this majoritarian standard for two main
 3 reasons.
 4 QUESTION: What - what -
 5 MR. SMITH: One is a - is a matter of principle,
 6 which is to say, when does consideration of politics go
 7 too far? It goes too far when we're no longer operating a
 8 democracy -
 9 QUESTION: Well - well -
 10 MR. SMITH: - we're having a minority party
 11 control the majority of seats.
 12 QUESTION: Well, when you say, you know, the -
 13 the Constitution doesn't ever use the word democracy.
 14 MR. SMITH: Yes, but we - but we have a - we have 15 a -
 16 QUESTION: Not to mention party.
 17 QUESTION: Yeah.
 18 MR. SMITH: We have a commitment though to the -
 19 to the fact that the House of Representatives is supposed
 20 to mirror the people and is supposed to be -
 21 QUESTION: Well -
 22 MR. SMITH: - representative of the people.
 23 QUESTION: Well, you - but -
 24 MR. SMITH: And we -
 25 QUESTION: The - the - the Constitution

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 originally provided that the - the standard for the state
 2 vote would be the standard for the Representatives in
 3 Congress. And in other - it - it was simply left up to
 4 the states. And there were property qualifications for
 5 many years, so it didn't represent the people in that
 6 sense.
 7 MR. SMITH: The reason we are focusing on the
 8 majority standard, the 50/50 standard, is in part because,
 9 as this Court has recognized in Wesberry and it's
 10 recognized in - in - in Cook and it's recognized in
 11 Thornton, the states are not supposed to be deciding for
 12 themselves who's going to be representing the people. The
 13 people are supposed to decide.
 14 The second reason is that 50/50 you don't have 15 these problems of distortions, which, as an empirical
 16 matter, happen in a winner-take-all, single-member
 17 district system. When you get to 60/40, the party that
 18 has 60 percent of the vote ordinarily would expect to get
 19 more than 60 percent of the districts. That's why you
 20 don't - you don't ever want to have a rule of proportional
 21 representation.
 22 QUESTION: It happens under a system of
 23 presidential electors too, as we recently saw. Is that
 24 unconstitutional also?
 25 MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The electoral

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 college is not a majoritarian standard in the same way
 2 that we - we have here. Because of the Great Compromise,
 3 it includes two Senators are counted, two votes for the
 4 Senators in every state across the board, so there - that
 5 - that is the disparity between the popular vote and the
 6 electoral college. But in the - but the House of
 7 Representatives was supposed to be the mirror of the
 8 people and the - this Court has constantly policed the
 9 efforts by the states to encroach from procedure into
 10 substance, to try to decide in advance, as Pennsylvania
 11 did here. We would rather have two out of three of our
 12 Representatives be Republicans, even though we're a 50/50
 13 state, and regardless of how people vote, we're going to
 14 determine -
 15 QUESTION: Yeah, but it's not - let - let me -
 16 you've got me up to the point of this 50/50 business. Now
 17 I'm thinking. Let's use party names. It helps for
 18 clarity. Suppose the Democrats have, under the
 19 districting, they're - they're the ones who are the
 20 victims. Now, let's suppose that they did get 55 percent
 21 of the state vote for Congress in the next election. Now,
 22 you're saying that if it were true by this map that
 23 they're getting that vote, 55 percent, meant that
 24 nonetheless, they had to get fewer than half the
 25 Congressmen, then it's bad. 

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And my problem with that is, I don't see how
 2 we're going to know in advance, unless this is going to be
 3 done by some experts coming in and measuring prior votes
 4 and getting into an argument. And if that's what's going
 5 to happen, I keep thinking of Ken - John Kenneth
 6 Galbraith, who says, I'd rather be governed by 400 people
 7 chosen at random from the telephone book than the Harvard
 8 faculty. All right, now -
 9 (Laughter.)
 10 QUESTION: That's a joke, but nonetheless, is a
 11 serious point.
 12 QUESTION: William - Will - William F. Buckley,
 13 Jr., not - not - not Galbraith.
 14 QUESTION: Now, do you see my -
 15 (Laughter.)
 16 MR. SMITH: Other side of the aisle. Your Honor
 17 -
 18 QUESTION: Now, I've exposed the entire problem. 
 19 I want you to respond to it.
 20 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, experts will in all
 21 likelihood be involved as we - we have an example of the
 22 kind of expert testimony that can be given here. But this
 23 is not, to use another expression, rocket science. 
 24 Experts testify in voting rights cases about how districts
 25 will behave. They use prior election returns plugged into

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 those districts to make estimates about how they will
 2 behave, and it'll be the burden on the plaintiffs to
 3 establish - they have the burden of proof - that, in fact,
 4 it is true that if you get - that - that the - this
 5 favored party, with more than 50 percent of the vote, will
 6 have essentially no chance of getting half the districts. 
 7 That is -
 8 QUESTION: Were the experts on which you rely,
 9 were they presented as witnesses in the district court?
 10 MR. SMITH: We had a trial on the one person, one
 11 vote claim, Your Honor, after the partisan gerrymandering
 12 claim was defeated, was dismissed. And the - the state
 13 tried to justify the deviation by talking about neutral
 14 principles that governed this map, and so we had the 15 opportunity to put a kind of preview of our partisan
 16 gerrymandering evidence on -
 17 QUESTION: Yes, but Mr. Smith, isn't it true that
 18 what the issue is sufficiency of your complaint?
 19 MR. SMITH: That's - that's correct, Your Honor. 
 20 At this point -
 21 QUESTION: And may I ask you a question that -
 22 that troubles me about the complaint? It seems to me your
 23 complaint was drafted on the theory that you agreed with
 24 Justice Powell's position in Bandemer, but the position
 25 you've come up with in this Court is entirely different

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and not the one that I read into the complaint. Your
 2 majority analysis theory is - is really quite different
 3 from - from that theory. You - you seem to have abandoned
 4 Justice Powell. 
 5 And I - what I wanted to ask you is, under the
 6 theory of the complaint, as opposed to the theory on which
 7 you're arguing in this Court, if you were - you allege
 8 that there were no neutral justifications whatsoever for
 9 any district line. And if you put in proof to that effect
 10 and the - and the other side prove there were neutral
 11 justifications for half the districts, say, but the - that
 12 there were a half that did fit your allegations, would -
 13 would - in your view, would the district court have the
 14 authority to review the districts that were totally 15 unjustified without meeting your majority analysis claim?
 16 MR. SMITH: I think the court does have to look
 17 at the effects of the deviate - departures from
 18 traditional district criteria -
 19 QUESTION: Assume the effects, say you've got two
 20 plaintiffs, one from district 6 and one from 16, I think.
 21 MR. SMITH: Yes.
 22 QUESTION: If, for example, the - the court
 23 thought that district 6 had absolutely no justification,
 24 it's wildly, you know, the shape is so terrible and so
 25 forth, but the rest of the map was okay. Under your

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 complaint, could the judge do anything about that?
 2 MR. SMITH: I - I think it - the - certainly
 3 under our complaint and under the - our conception of the
 4 case, you don't look at one district in isolation and say,
 5 this district is too ugly or too much of a departure -
 6 QUESTION: I know your complaint is drafted as a
 7 all-or-nothing, but I'm just wondering, within the -
 8 within the allegations, would - would it be open to the
 9 judge to say, well, they lose on the total picture, the
 10 majority theory is - is just too - too novel for me, but
 11 what they've said about district 6 pans out 100 percent. 
 12 Is that -
 13 MR. SMITH: That - that's not our case, Your
 14 Honor, and - and the reason for it is, I don't think that 15 this Court is going to come in and start imposing,
 16 particularly districting criteria, when an ugly-looking
 17 district -
 18 QUESTION: In particular districts?
 19 MR. SMITH: - an ugly-looking and odd -
 20 QUESTION: They did that in the racial
 21 gerrymandering context - situation.
 22 MR. SMITH: Only when - only when it's talking
 23 about race on either side of the line, and - and it could
 24 be that the Court would ultimately get to the point of
 25 saying a district that's too ugly and - and divides

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Democrats from Republicans ought to be viewed in the same
 2 way.
 3 But our submission is more like the racial vote
 4 dilution case, that not only are there departures would
 5 show partisan intent, but you have to look, as the Court
 6 said in Bandemer, statewide and see whether, in fact, the
 7 - the - the legislature has created a situation where a
 8 Republican votes counts twice as much as a Democratic vote
 9 in this state because -
 10 QUESTION: Race does not change. You - you are
 11 the race you are, and you're not going to change it next
 12 year. Political party doesn't work that way. How do -
 13 how - how - how do you decide what, you know, what - what
 14 is the Republican vote? 
 Is it just registered Republicans 15 -
 16 MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor -
 17 QUESTION: - and is everybody that's registered a
 18 Republican now have to stay - maybe we should make them
 19 stay registered Republicans so that we can have good
 20 districts, right? I mean, it - it - I just don't
 21 understand how you run this scheme. You cannot really
 22 tell until after the election is done how many Republicans
 23 and how many Democrats there are in each district. 
 24 MR. SMITH: Well -
 25 QUESTION: Are - are you going to -

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SMITH: - the way you identify -
 2 QUESTION: - count on party registration? Is
 3 that the basis for divvying it up?
 4 MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. It's how people have
 5 voted and how -
 6 QUESTION: In the last election.
 7 MR. SMITH: Yes. And it - it would again be the
 8 burden of the plaintiff to show that there are predictable
 9 voting patterns, that there's a large chunk of people who
 10 are consistent Democratic or Republican supporters who are
 11 being injured in their voting rights by means of a - of a
 12 deliberate scheme by the legislature.
 13 Now, the idea that these people are hard to
 14 identify is a little hard to square with a map, in which 15 you have these incredibly complicated peninsulas going out
 16 to find -
 17 QUESTION: Any particular election, they are very
 18 hard to identify in any particular election, which is why
 19 the parties go about selecting their candidates very
 20 carefully. If it didn't make any different, they'd pick
 21 any old body -
 22 MR. SMITH: What the evidence -
 23 QUESTION: - and run them and - and you'd get all
 24 of the same Republican and the same Democrat votes. 
 25 That's not the way the world works.

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SMITH: Well, what the plaintiff would have
 2 to show in such a case is that there's a sufficiently
 3 consistent pattern of voting in the state that a racial -
 4 that a political gerrymander is possible and it has
 5 occurred and it - and that it will - and that, in fact, in
 6 the future there will be an injury to one class of voters
 7 who have been packed into a small number of 90 percent
 8 Democratic districts, while there's a much larger number
 9 of relatively safe Republican districts.
 10 Now, you can say that's not true or we can't
 11 know it, but we all sit here knowing - know that's what
 12 they did.
 13 QUESTION: Mr. Smith -
 14 QUESTION: Well, what is it -
 15 QUESTION: To - to what extent - what - to what
 16 extent, Mr. Smith, does your - does your theory depend on
 17 the registration of the voters?
 18 MR. SMITH: Registration might be an indication
 19 of voting patterns, but our theory is - is you look at
 20 voting patterns and decide in advance of the next
 21 election, will there in fact be a - a situation where it's
 22 impossible for - if the Democrats got half the votes or
 23 the Republicans got half the votes, it would be impossible
 24 for them to get close to half the seats.
 25 QUESTION: Well, what is the -

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: The point is it -
 2 QUESTION: - particular vice of - of
 3 redistricting, just on the basis of politics? Suppose you
 4 did it on the basis of isolating or - or fracturing union
 5 votes, or - or the gay vote or the environmentalist vote
 6 or farm subsidies?
 7 MR. SMITH: Well -
 8 QUESTION: Where - where - where does your - your
 9 - your principle particularly elect political parties? In
 10 - in - in fact, it seems to me that parties might - might
 11 well conclude - include some of these groups that I've
 12 mentioned.
 13 MR. SMITH: This Court has - has made clear in a
 14 number of cases that the Government has no business
 15 discriminating against people based on their partisan
 16 affiliation or their political viewpoint, in contracting,
 17 in jobs. And it seems to us it would - it should be clear
 18 that at some point, a level of discrimination in designing
 19 the machinery of democracy, the electoral process itself,
 20 a - a form of discrimination that's equivalent to saying,
 21 in two-thirds of the district we're going to count all the
 22 Republican votes twice, in one-third of the districts
 23 we're going to count all the Democratic votes twice.
 24 QUESTION: But certainly you allow for some
 25 discrimination? I mean, that - that's the way

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 legislatures go at it.
 2 MR. SMITH: Well, as this - this Court has made
 3 clear, both in the race area and the politics area,
 4 redistricting is a little different from other areas. It
 5 doesn't make any sense to demand purity and a complete
 6 non-consideration of these factors, but there has to be an
 7 outer boundary. If there's no outer boundary, then -
 8 QUESTION: Mr. - Mr. Smith, you're - you're
 9 essentially asking how much is too much. You say you have
 10 this decision that said people have this claim that they
 11 can bring, Bandemer. But that was a case where the bottom
 12 line was, and you have no claim on the merits. Now, if a
 13 judge, a district judge, in - in one of these cases said,
 14 well, here's the Indiana plan and the court said that that 15 was okay, and this one doesn't look any worse to me. Is
 16 there a difference between the Pennsylvania plan and the -
 17 a significant difference between those two? 
 18 MR. SMITH: There's a -
 19 QUESTION: With our precedent, I mean, you have
 20 to take the whole of it, not just half. The half standing
 21 to sue you like, the bottom line, but the Indiana plan,
 22 egregious as it may look, is okay.
 23 MR. SMITH: Well, the facts shown in the Indiana
 24 case, in the Bandemer case, were much less severe than
 25 those we alleged here, in terms of - here we had

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 allegations which were ultimately supported by expert
 2 testimony in the one person, one vote trial, that they
 3 would get a large super-majority of the districts with
 4 only half the - with half the votes or less. 
 5 And in - in Bandemer, the facts as they were
 6 presented, there was no such expert analysis. Instead,
 7 they relied on the results of one election in which one of
 8 the bodies actually came out the right way and one of them
 9 came out slightly the wrong way. They had not supplied
 10 the Court with the same kind of evidence that we would
 11 propose to supply, and - and did not meet, at least as an
 12 evidentiary matter, the standard that we propose here.
 13 It might be that, in fact, if somebody looked at
 14 that Indiana map, it might have met that, but nobody 15 studied it in that way. They were simply saying, look,
 16 it's really ugly, they've got these unfair, multi-member
 17 districts in certain cities, and, in fact, the way the
 18 vote came out in the House, the Democrats got more than
 19 half the votes and got only 43 percent of the seats. That
 20 I - that, I submit, is not a sufficient basis to establish
 21 the outer boundary that we would suggest you have to meet.
 22 QUESTION: But if you're going to say it's not
 23 fair, fairness in what sense? If we say it's not fair to
 24 draw lines that will pack and crack one party or another,
 25 you're going to end up with no geographical boundaries,

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 because all geographical boundaries do that. A random
 2 system in Pennsylvania would give the Democrats no
 3 Representatives -
 4 MR. SMITH: What -
 5 QUESTION: - purely random.
 6 MR. SMITH: Well, that's -
 7 QUESTION: So - so it's, I mean, my point is that
 8 politicians and the public, in fact, in form has one idea
 9 of what's fair and it's very hard for a judge to turn that
 10 idea into judicially administrable rules. 
 11 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, with - with respect, I -
 12 I think that it is perfectly possible for somebody to look
 13 at a map and decide whether or not it does or does not
 14 unfairly discriminate against one of the political 15 parties. Courts draw maps themselves fairly - fairly
 16 frequently. They collect testimony from experts, the map
 17 in Pennsylvania that was -
 18 QUESTION: You - you can tell whether it
 19 discriminates against one political party, I guess on the
 20 basis of - of - of projections that may turn out to be
 21 wrong. You -nobody can say for sure. But what - what you
 22 can say, what you can guess about, is simply that it will
 23 favor one party over another, yes. But - but is it so
 24 easy to tell that it will unfairly favor one party over
 25 another? And that's what you're arguing here.

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 How unfair is unfair? I don't know. What is
 2 it, 60/40?
 3 MR. SMITH: If it gets to the point where one
 4 party's getting two-thirds of the seats with less than
 5 half the votes, in a democracy, I submit that's the place
 6 where it crosses the line.
 7 QUESTION: Okay. Mr. Smith, you - is - is that
 8 the - the - the force of your argument, I take it, is not
 9 that this happens in one electoral year, because there may
 10 be all sorts of reasons. It's something, your argument
 11 is, it happens over time.
 12 MR. SMITH: It -
 13 QUESTION: Let's - let's - let me start with that
 14 assumption. 
 Let's assume that we come up with a rule in 15 which we - we come up with a wait-and-see rule, and we
 16 say, it's not enough for you to prove a - a violation to
 17 predict in advance. You've in fact got to prove a
 18 violation by looking back and establishing through the
 19 course of three or four elections that - that this pattern
 20 is emerging. And let's assume we say, if you can do that,
 21 you win.
 22 My question, which then goes to the substance of
 23 what you're going to win, and ultimately the substance of
 24 what your claim must be is, what is the principle that the
 25 district court must apply in a case like that to reform or

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 - or redraw the districts? Does he - does he come up with
 2 a principle that says anything that follows traditional
 3 redistricting principles, you know, compactness, et
 4 cetera, is okay? That won't necessarily solve your
 5 problem.
 6 Has he got to come up with a scheme that says
 7 there's a presumption that all districts have got to be
 8 competitive? If he does that, there's going to be a clear
 9 break with tradition because there are loads of places
 10 where you can't have competitive districts. What is the
 11 principle on which he's going to reform it?
 12 MR. SMITH: Well, let - let - I will - let me
 13 directly answer that question in a moment, but let me just
 14 comment. 
 I think the idea of a rule that says you have to 15 wait three or four election cycles to - to prove your
 16 case, it would essentially be - mean that the claim is
 17 worthless, because you're going to redraw the districts
 18 every 10 years, and there's an enormous amount of
 19 irreparable harm, as you suggest.
 20 21 QUESTION: Two elections.
 22 MR. SMITH: As you suggest, there's already
 23 irreparable harm. Once you've thrown out all the
 24 incumbents of the disfavored party, they have new
 25 incumbents that have come in now. It doesn't mean that

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you can't have a remedy, and it would seem to me the very
 2 first thing you'd want to do, just as you do in a race
 3 case under section II is - is have a map which does not
 4 inherently pack and crack the disfavored group to the
 5 point where they don't have the opportunity to -
 6 QUESTION: The - the trouble is, in the race
 7 case, you have a relatively simple objective in mind. And
 8 that is, the relatively simple objective is that once you
 9 identify the political party of the racial voter, the
 10 minority voter, that minority voter ought to have, in
 11 effect, the same opportunity as a non-minority voter of
 12 that political party.
 13 Here, we have a different problem. What is the
 14 force or power that a member of a given political party 15 ought to have? It's not as simple as the race case.
 16 MR. SMITH: Well, I think the inquiry would
 17 essentially be the same though. They - the parties would
 18 have to come with the remedial map, the - presuming the
 19 legislature would have an opportunity to draw on in the
 20 usual situation, in which they could show that it is no
 21 longer the case that there is such packing and cracking of
 22 Democrats that - that at 50 percent, they would have no
 23 chance of getting 50 percent of the seats.
 24 QUESTION: What - what if you have more than two
 25 parties? I mean, like Minnesota, where you have besides

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the Republicans and the Democrats a very strong farmer
 2 labor party?
 3 MR. SMITH: I assume that the experts could deal
 4 with that. In - in reality, in this country -
 5 QUESTION: I - well, I - I'm sure they can. What
 6 - what - what test do you want them to apply?
 7 MR. SMITH: Well, the -
 8 QUESTION: Each proportional representation for
 9 each of the parties?
 10 MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The - the - the test
 11 we're talking about here is - is if one of the parties
 12 would get to 50 percent, would they have an opportunity to
 13 - to have a majority of the delegation?
 14 QUESTION: Do you take into account at all in 15 in this picture, this is not something that could have
 16 been adopted by the Republicans in the state legislature
 17 alone. It took quite a number of Democratic votes to put
 18 it through.
 19 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor -
 20 QUESTION: Is that - is that relevant?
 21 MR. SMITH: It - it might be relevant at trial if
 22 we ever get to trial. Our claim was dismissed. What we
 23 would attempt to show at trial, and I think we would show
 24 at trial, is first of all, not a single Democratic Senator
 25 voted for it. There were some Democratic House Members

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 who voted for it, and the reason for that is because there
 2 are five Members of Congress who are Democrats in the
 3 State of Pennsylvania who are real, real happy with the
 4 districts they got.
 5 And the General Assembly, the Republican
 6 leadership said, well, if you guys want these districts,
 7 you know what - you know what the price you have to pay
 8 for, you need to get us some votes. So that - there are
 9 dynamics that take place, and in any partisan gerrymander
 10 there's going to be some really good districts for the
 11 disfavored party, just not enough, not - not a fair - fair
 12 allocation, not one that would allow the party to have a
 13 majority control.
 14 QUESTION: Mr. Smith, over a period of years, can 15 you identify any state where your test of partisan
 16 gerrymandering has persisted over a period of time, five
 17 years or more? Can you give us examples of states where
 18 it's persisted over a period of years?
 19 MR. SMITH: I'm not sure that I - that I have
 20 enough knowledge of political history going back decades
 21 to be able to tell you whether that's the case or not. It
 22 certainly will persist through a decade as long as the
 23 whole leadership of the state doesn't shift over to the
 24 other party, as long as the party that committed the - the
 25 crime, so to speak, maintains either the governorship or

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 one house of the legislature to be able to -
 2 QUESTION: Because in how many states do we have
 3 a situation currently where both houses of the legislature
 4 and the Governor are of one political party?
 5 MR. SMITH: There's quite a number of states,
 6 including, as it happened in - in this round, a number of
 7 very competitive states, the - which caused quite a - had
 8 quite a consequential impact on the Congress, Florida,
 9 Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and now more recently, Texas
 10 has come into play and decided to play this game.
 11 QUESTION: I suppose typically we would expect
 12 that over any period of time that condition wouldn't
 13 remain. You'd - one branch would be in the hands of the
 14 other party in time. 
 Certainly if - if you had something 15 like 50 percent of the voters -
 16 MR. SMITH: Which, in order to fix the problem,
 17 once it already exists, you have to get both houses and
 18 the governorship back to - to pass a second bill. 
 19 Otherwise, it's in place for the 10 years and then what
 20 also happens in most states is the state legislatures, of
 21 course, gerrymander themselves as well as the - the
 22 congressional seats, in order to keep themselves in a
 23 position where 10 - 10 years hence they'll still be around
 24 and in control of the process again.
 25 So there is a - a fundamental - fundamentally

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 anti-democratic part of this, which means in - in the long
 2 run, you are - you do have very competitive states with
 3 extremely skewed congressional delegations. The - the
 4 delegation from Florida is 18 to 7 in a state that has a
 5 robust two-party democracy. Now, that - that ultimately
 6 is not democracy. That's our submission.
 7 I'd like to save the balance of my time, Your
 8 Honor.
 9 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Smith.
 10 Mr. Krill, we'll hear from you.
 11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. KRILL, JR.
 12 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS JUBELIRER AND PERZEL
 13 MR. KRILL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 14 the Court:
 15 Because politics is inherent in redistricting,
 16 any test, including the appellants' proposed test in their
 17 reply brief, requires inherent political choices to be
 18 made, choices that we submit are inappropriate for the
 19 judiciary to make.
 20 Appellants' latest test, for example, has hidden
 21 political choices in it that are outcome determinative. 
 22 For example, they use 10 years of statewide races rather
 23 than using a single base race, as recommended by the
 24 source they cite in footnote 5 of the -
 25 QUESTION: May I ask you kind of a preliminary

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 question? Let's assume that them - that their theory
 2 won't fly, this majority theory is just too impractical
 3 and so forth. But what about the theory advanced in their
 4 complaint that the - some of the districts, and perhaps
 5 all - they allege all - were - were drafted by relying
 6 exclusively on a principle of maximum partisan advantage? 
 7 And supposing the evidence shows that no neutral criteria
 8 at all were used except let's do the best we can to help
 9 our own party get as many seats as we can. Would that
 10 raise a question at all in your mind?
 11 MR. KRILL: No, Your Honor. First, because I
 12 don't think that that's a question that should ever come
 13 to trial. The legislative process is so complex. Every
 14 legislator -
 15 QUESTION: Well, what if - what if they narrowed
 16 the allegation, said just district 6 or district 16 was
 17 clearly drawn for this purpose and no other, no neutral,
 18 no effort to be compact or contiguous or follow boundary
 19 lines or rivers or anything, we just want to get the
 20 maximum vote for one particular party here. Would you say
 21 that was permissible?
 22 MR. KRILL: It - yes, I would, Your Honor. And -
 23 and I would also say that it - it is not only impossible
 24 to prove at trial, but improper to even attempt to prove
 25 at trial, because - and we'll - let's take district 6 in

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Pennsylvania as an example. Because it would require
 2 inquiring into the legislative process in violation of
 3 legislative privilege.
 4 QUESTION: No, it would just -
 5 MR. KRILL: Legislators are pulled in a million
 6 directions.
 7 QUESTION: It would just say to the - when you
 8 have a - a really strangely distorted district, the burden
 9 is on you to point out one neutral justification for it,
 10 and we'll assume that if you - you won't have to go into
 11 the minds of the legislature, just assume there is
 12 something we can point to, such as a boundary line or if
 13 it's fairly compact or it's - but you can't point to
 14 anything. You don't have to go into anybody's mind. You
 15 just say - you give them the opportunity to explain, and
 16 they - they say, well, we have no explanation. We did it
 17 just because we want to get that to be a democratic
 18 district.
 19 MR. KRILL: If - if the entire legislature en
 20 masse came forward and admitted that -
 21 QUESTION: Yes.
 22 MR. KRILL: - every legislator said, that's why I
 23 voted for it, Justice Stevens, I would still say it's a
 24 permissible legislative choice. James Madison, after all,
 25 in the Constitutional Convention, acknowledged that they

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 were giving to state legislators the power under article
 2 I, section 4, quote, to so mold their regulations as to
 3 favor certain candidates, closed quote.
 4 QUESTION: Is there any duty at all to - any duty
 5 at all in drawing districts to try to do it impartially? 
 6 Your answer is no?
 7 MR. KRILL: Not constitutionally, Your Honor, but
 8 there are -
 9 QUESTION: Yeah.
 10 MR. KRILL: - political forces that pull them in
 11 -
 12 QUESTION: I understand that.
 13 MR. KRILL: - in a multitude of directions.
 14 QUESTION: But then on the Constitution, what 15 about if the legislature decided that the salaries of the
 16 majority legislature should be 10 percent higher than the
 17 minority legislators?
 18 MR. KRILL: I -
 19 QUESTION: There'd be a good reason for it,
 20 because they have more work to do. They have to vote and
 21 they - they get statutes adopted and programs enacted, so
 22 would that satisfy the constitutional duty? If there is a
 23 duty to govern impartially, do you think it would?
 24 MR. KRILL: I'm not sure that would prevent a -
 25 present a Federal question, Your Honor, but I'm - I'm

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 certain that our supreme court in Pennsylvania would
 2 address it. Our - my - my individual clients, the
 3 legislative leaders, in fact do have higher salaries,
 4 precisely for that reason.
 5 QUESTION: But that the - all the members of the
 6 majority party?
 7 MR. KRILL: No. I - I don't think so, Your
 8 Honor. I - I can't imagine that even happening.
 9 QUESTION: Suppose I have in my -
 10 QUESTION: Why not?
 11 QUESTION: Oh, sorry. In - in my mind the, which
 12 I don't - I want you to assume for the sake of argument -
 13 that - that one thing the Constitution aims at, one thing
 14 though, it wants to leave all this up to the legislature 15 as much as possible, et cetera. But one thing it aims at
 16 is majority rule. Therefore, if, over a period of time,
 17 we have a districting system where the minority - the
 18 majority who get the - the majority of votes end up with a
 19 minority of seats in a serious way, that undercuts the
 20 democracy that the Constitution foresees. And with
 21 computers, that might happen. 
 22 Now, suppose I start with that assumption, and
 23 I'm looking for a standard. So suppose I combine Justice
 24 Stevens' standard with the requirement to keep judges out
 25 of it, that this has really to have happened. It's not the

33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Harvard faculty. It really happened. And in fact, after
 2 really happening once, then we also have the experts who
 3 tell us it has to happen in the future.
 4 Now, we have three things - three requirements
 5 there that really are designed to police the outer fringe. 
 6 And if I start with that assumption of what the
 7 Constitution wants, why don't I say it imposes those three
 8 requirements?
 9 MR. KRILL: All right. Accepting your
 10 assumption, Justice Breyer, I - first of all, I - I think
 11 that one would have to look at a lot of different things. 
 12 The appellants' test, for example, assumes that Democrats
 13 are evenly disbursed across the state -
 14 QUESTION: Oh, I've rejected their test. 15 MR. KRILL: Right.
 16 QUESTION: I've rejected their test. I've
 17 borrowed from it, but rejected it.
 18 MR. KRILL: But because -
 19 QUESTION: All right. So the test has the three
 20 elements that I said. One, they're experts. Two, it
 21 really happened. And three, Justice Stevens' objective
 22 version of there-is-no-other-explanation requirement.
 23 MR. KRILL: All right. It - it really did happen
 24 in Pennsylvania in 2000. The - and this was under a
 25 judicially-drawn map. All right. The party that had a

34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 majority of the popular vote got a minority of the
 2 congressional seats. The same thing happened again in a -
 3 in another - in a subsequent election, but it was exactly
 4 the reverse. You know, the Democrats and Republicans
 5 flipped.
 6 So it - it can, in fact, happen, Your Honor. 
 7 But if you allow the experts to control over the voters,
 8 then you'll never know the truth of what would really
 9 happen. And let me give you an example in Bandemer
 10 itself. The aftermath of - of the Bandemer case in
 11 Indiana is instructive, because two years after this Court
 12 handed down its decision in Bandemer, the Democrats, who
 13 would have had the Court believe that they were consigned
 14 to an eternity of Republican tyranny, actually won 50 15 percent of the state House seats in Indiana. And only two
 16 years after that, in 1990, they won control, and control
 17 has flipped back and forth ever since in Indiana.
 18 So, I believe that Justice O'Connor's concurring
 19 opinion in Bandemer was - was quite on point. The system
 20 is self-correcting. Now, the appellants test in using 10
 21 years, instead of a base race as their own academic source
 22 recommends, actually gives a lot of weight to the past
 23 preferences of voters, dead voters, voters who have moved. 
 24 Naturally, this is a political choice, because any party
 25 that perceives this influence as waning over time will ask

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you to adopt a test that gives weight to past choices.
 2 They also use high profile offices in choosing
 3 their races instead of low-profile statewide races, non-
 4 charismatic races as their - as their academic source
 5 recommends. And, of course, we have such non-charismatic
 6 races in Pennsylvania. We call them statewide appellate
 7 judicial races. Nothing could be more non-charismatic.
 8 QUESTION: Unkind of you to say it, sir, unkind
 9 of you.
 10 (Laughter.)
 11 MR. KRILL: And, of course, it - they've made a
 12 political choice in not using those races either, because
 13 in 2001, the year that our legislature was considering
 14 this plan, the Republicans took seven out of seven 15 statewide appellate races. They also, as - as - as I
 16 mentioned, in their test assumed dispersion of Democrats
 17 uniformly, when, in fact, Democrats, as we all know, are
 18 compacted, self-compacted, into urban areas. So, the -
 19 the test is very tilted.
 20 A curious thing that they do in their test is
 21 turn real races into hypothetical races by normalizing
 22 them so as to remove the popularity factor from those
 23 races. Well, that's curious, since politics is all about
 24 trying to achieve that popular edge. What they did not
 25 do, and this is another political choice in constructing

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the test, is to a use a very - a - a race that was
 2 practically 50/50 in Pennsylvania in 2000, a race, by the
 3 way, that's cited in their complaint. It's - it's the Al
 4 Gore race for President. Mr. Gore won 50.6 percent of the
 5 popular vote in Pennsylvania.
 6 Now, the statistics show that he also would have
 7 won a majority of the congressional districts under the
 8 plan that's before this Court if he had been packaged as a
 9 congressional candidate. Actually, he would have won a
 10 majority, 10 out of 19 districts. The statistics are in
 11 the joint appendix, page 273. 
 12 QUESTION: May - may I again ask you just one
 13 question about the complaint? Do you think it states a
 14 cause of action under the theory espoused by Justice 15 Powell in his Davis against Bandemer concurrence in the
 16 judgment? And if not, why not? And then the final
 17 question is, and if it does meet that standard, why isn't
 18 that adequate judicially manageable standards?
 19 MR. KRILL: Yeah, I - I confess that I don't
 20 clearly remember Justice Powell's standard for
 21 justiciability in - in his concurrence, Justice Stevens. 
 22 I do disagree, however, with - with his standard for - for
 23 remedial action. He called for a searching and sensitive
 24 inquiry. And I submit there really are no neutral -
 25 QUESTION: Well, but the first question -

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KRILL: - principles.
 2 QUESTION: - before you reach remedy is whether
 3 there's a violation.
 4 MR. KRILL: Yes.
 5 QUESTION: And his theory basically was, there's
 6 a violation if there are certain wildly - wildly-defined
 7 districts that have no neutral justification except to
 8 give partisan advantage to the people who had the power to
 9 draft them and who did not even consult the adversary
 10 party in drafting them. That was his standard.
 11 MR. KRILL: Well, that's impossible to prove and
 12 improper to prove. For example -
 13 QUESTION: It's a matter of burden-shifting, and
 14 if they can't come up with any explanation whatsoever 15 other than partisan advantage, that that's a violation of
 16 the - of the duty to govern impartially. And either there
 17 is no such duty or it is a violation.
 18 MR. KRILL: Justice Powell's standard would
 19 require individual legislators to come in and say, here's
 20 why I voted. Here's - here's the - here's the -
 21 QUESTION: Well, do you think - do you think it's
 22 impossible to prove that race was the predominant motive
 23 in a particular redistricting plan?
 24 MR. KRILL: There are standards this Court has
 25 adopted, the Gingles standards for - for making - making

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that case, Your Honor. However, I - I think -
 2 QUESTION: Well, I mean, do you have to be a
 3 really tricky, astute, very clever fact-finder to figure
 4 out what was going on here?
 5 MR. KRILL: Well, yes you would, in fact. In
 6 fact, I don't think - see how you could. In - in this
 7 case, for example, it's impossible for the appellants'
 8 counsel to even say whether their clients were Santorum
 9 Democrats or Gore Democrats. Both won Pennsylvania in
 10 2000.
 11 QUESTION: But again, under Justice Powell's
 12 standard, they wouldn't have to do that.
 13 MR. KRILL: No.
 14 QUESTION: They would just have to say, this is 15 totally irrational unless you can come up with an
 16 explanation.
 17 MR. KRILL: That - that's correct. Now, voters -
 18 they would have to believe -
 19 QUESTION: Of course, it doesn't - it doesn't
 20 make much sense to find something justiciable that you
 21 can't possibly devise a remedy for, does it? I mean, to
 22 separate the question of - of whether there's a violation
 23 from the question of remedy, as though, you know, we'll -
 24 we'll - we'll cross that bridge when we get to it, doesn't
 25 seem to me very realistic.

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KRILL: Oh, if, in fact, I agree, Justice
 2 Scalia. If the court ignores the remedial phase that
 3 would necessarily follow -
 4 QUESTION: But, of course, the remedy would be
 5 that redraw district using some neutral criteria.
 6 MR. KRILL: There are no -
 7 QUESTION: That's certainly not an impossible
 8 standard.
 9 MR. KRILL: It is, Your Honor. There are no
 10 neutral criteria. Name a criterion and I'll show you why
 11 it represents a political choice.
 12 QUESTION: Historical boundaries, contiguity,
 13 compactness, maintaining incumbents of both parties. 
 14 There are lots of neutral criteria available, and any one 15 of them might justify an other - what seemed on its face
 16 to be a very wild district.
 17 MR. KRILL: Respectfully, Justice Stevens,
 18 patterns of development over the last two generations, if
 19 you - if you put them on a - on a map, they look like
 20 splatters of paint on a canvas. They're not pretty.
 21 QUESTION: Not as much as some -
 22 MR. KRILL: But -
 23 QUESTION: Not as much as the one in Karcher or
 24 the one in this case do.
 25 MR. KRILL: Well, I would point out that -

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Of course, I guess if there are five
 2 different criteria: compactness, past practice, or
 3 whatever, it's very much a political call which of the
 4 five criteria you decide to - to use.
 5 QUESTION: That's a - that's true, and the only
 6 judicial call is you've got to use at least one.
 7 MR. KRILL: Well, but - but by saying that - by
 8 designating them as neutral criteria, the judiciary itself
 9 makes a choice and takes that choice away from the state
 10 legislatures.
 11 Voters are not automatons in a matrix controlled
 12 by supercomputers. Voters continue to matter, and they
 13 continue to prove it in election after election. In fact,
 14 they proved it in Pennsylvania in 2002 under this plan. 15 The 17th congressional district, which the experts
 16 predicted would go Republican did not. Voters and good
 17 candidates and good issues and good party organization
 18 continue to make the difference, just as they did in -
 19 QUESTION: How about the rest of their
 20 predictions? They got the others right, didn't they?
 21 MR. KRILL: Not quite right. 
 22 QUESTION: Nobody has to bat a thousand, do they?
 23 MR. KRILL: Well, but we - if - if the plan had
 24 been enjoined, we'd never know how right or wrong they
 25 were. And - and -

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: But we do - we do now know, which does
 2 tell us something at least about their predictive
 3 criterion -
 4 MR. KRILL: Well -
 5 QUESTION: - and - and it is that it - it gets it
 6 wrong in one time out of 19, was that it?
 7 MR. KRILL: Yes.
 8 QUESTION: One instance out of 19?
 9 MR. KRILL: Yeah.
 10 QUESTION: That's not bad.
 11 MR. KRILL: And in - in - in the 6th district, it
 12 was very close. It was a razor-edge race. But voters
 13 continue to pull the candidates towards themselves. It's
 14 - voters are not disenfranchised. 
 For example, in our 4th 15 district in western Pennsylvania, the incumbent
 16 Congresswoman is - is a fairly conservative Republican -
 17 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Krill.
 18 Ms. DeLone -
 19 MR. KRILL: Thank you.
 20 QUESTION: We'll hear from you. Mr. DeLone.
 21 ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BART DeLONE
 22 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS CORTES AND ACCURTI
 23 MR. DeLONE: That's all right, Mr. Chief Justice.
 24 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
 25 The Court should hold that political

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 gerrymandering, if it is justiciable at all, violates the
 2 Constitution if and only if the disadvantaged group has
 3 been shut out of a political process as a whole. This is
 4 the standard applied by the Court's unconstitutional vote
 5 dilution cases, and it is consistent with our system of
 6 electing Members of Congress from individual districts.
 7 In a district system such as ours, there are no
 8 statewide elections for a slate of candidates. Rather,
 9 individual congressional elections are defined by the
 10 unique characteristics of each race. That is why
 11 statewide election results offer no meaningful standard
 12 for judging congressional outcomes. It is also why a
 13 proportionality, the idea that some statewide level of
 14 support should entitle a political party to capture some 15 specified number of seats, is incompatible with the very
 16 idea of districting, and it is why the Court has
 17 repeatedly -
 18 QUESTION: But Mr. DeLone, I - I think our rules
 19 say we frown on people simply reading their arguments.
 20 MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry. And the
 21 point, Your Honor, is that Mr. Smith and appellants' plan
 22 will lead the Court to proportionality if - if the Court
 23 does not consistently apply the - the vote dilution
 24 standard that has - has applied in the past. And that
 25 standard is that you have to be shut out of the political

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 process -
 2 QUESTION: Well, the - the - tell - answer - I'll
 3 ask you a question and then you will get away from your
 4 prepared argument.
 5 MR. DeLONE: Thank you.
 6 QUESTION: But the - the - the - in - in my own
 7 view, not - not the Court's - in - in my own view in the
 8 positive discrimination race cases, I believed -
 9 MR. DeLONE: The - the Whitcomb v. Chavis -
 10 QUESTION: The positive discrimination cases, the
 11 cases that say you cannot draw a racial district, racial,
 12 minority district -
 13 MR. DeLONE: The Shaw Line - the Shaw Line cases?
 14 QUESTION: Yes, correct.
 15 MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor.
 16 QUESTION: I said you could, I thought that the
 17 legislature could do that, primarily because if they could
 18 do it in political party cases, why couldn't they do it
 19 in race cases where it's meant to help the minority? 
 20 Well, I lost that. So believing what I thought, doesn't
 21 the reverse hold true? If this Court has found manageable
 22 standards to use to control positive discrimination in
 23 favor of racial minorities for drawing boundaries, then my
 24 goodness, why can't it find standards to prevent the
 25 Republicans from doing the same thing to the Democrats or

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the Democrats from doing the same thing to the
 2 Republicans?
 3 MR. DeLONE: Because, Your Honor, in the Shaw
 4 Line of cases, what they were doing is they were trying to
 5 isolate race from all other factors, including politics.
 6 QUESTION: And in here, we're trying to - to
 7 isolate being a Democrat or being a Republican -
 8 MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your -
 9 QUESTION: - from all other factors, because
 10 after all, as Justice Stevens pointed out, they've been
 11 able to come up with no explanation other than we did it
 12 because they're Democrats.
 13 MR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor -
 14 QUESTION: That's what the word predominate means 15 -
 16 MR. DeLONE: Right.
 17 QUESTION: - and you'd insist on that showing -
 18 MR. DeLONE: But, but Your -
 19 QUESTION: - just as you do insist on the
 20 predominant showing in the race case.
 21 MR. DeLONE: But, Your Honor, assuming that to be
 22 correct, there's nothing wrong with them saying, we did it
 23 just because they're Democrats.
 24 QUESTION: Ah, yes, there is, because what's
 25 wrong with it is if you carry it to an extreme with

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 computers, you prevent the majority of voters from
 2 securing the majority of seats. And that simple principle
 3 that the majority should govern is the basic principle of
 4 democracy. So if you find that in the Constitution, it's
 5 just as wrong.
 6 MR. DeLONE: Well, I think you have to - you have
 7 to look at what majority you're talking about, Your Honor. 
 8 If - in a districting system, you're talking about the
 9 majority in a particular district at a particular time.
 10 QUESTION: Correct. What we would do is look at
 11 the state and we would look to see if in the - we could
 12 even give a margin of error. The party that got 53
 13 percent of the votes ended up with 45 percent of the
 14 seats, okay? 
 Objective, contrary to majority rule, and 15 produced simply by intentional gerrymandering for no other
 16 purpose.
 17 MR. DeLONE: But, Your Honor, if you're doing
 18 that, you're - you're - you're going into proportionality. 
 19 You're saying, if you're entitled to a - to a sum state.
 20 QUESTION: No, no proportionality. Forget the
 21 proportionality. I agree with you a perfectly random
 22 system will produce 100 Republican delegation, so I agree
 23 with you about that. I'm only sticking to the majority
 24 rule.
 25 QUESTION: Do - do people always vote for a

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 particular candidate because he's a Republican or - or -
 2 or she's a Democrat?
 3 MR. DeLONE: Absolutely not, Your Honor, and that
 4 -
 5 QUESTION: Of course not. So you can't tell from
 6 the Republican votes how many of those are Republican
 7 votes and how many of them are, you know, Smith votes or -
 8 MR. DeLONE: Exactly right, Your Honor, and
 9 that's why the idea of comparing any sort of statewide
 10 vote with the districting votes that you actually have is
 11 inconsistent with -
 12 QUESTION: Even if that's true, is it not obvious
 13 from the configuration of some of the districts, that
 14 those who drafted the districts thought they could predict 15 what they were going to do?
 16 MR. DeLONE: Again, Your Honor, assuming that
 17 that's correct, there's nothing wrong with it.
 18 QUESTION: Oh, okay.
 19 MR. DeLONE: And as far as the - the - what level
 20 you come to in a - in a majority/minority consignment,
 21 Justice Breyer, I think the way that the Bandemer
 22 plurality did it, again, applying what this Court has
 23 consistently applied in vote - in the vote dilution cases,
 24 by which I mean the Whitcomb v. Chavis line of cases, is
 25 to say, all right, let's look at this and see if it's like

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 a diagnostic test, like a threshold. Have we got a
 2 problem here where, over time, and I'm not sure how much
 3 time, but over a significant amount of time, it looks like
 4 the majority overall is being consigned in some way.
 5 But, once you do that, you must look elsewhere,
 6 which is what Rogers says, Whitcomb says, all of the - the
 7 vote dilution cases say. You can't ever look at electoral
 8 results alone. That's never sufficient. What you must
 9 look to is whether or not there's been something else that
 10 has caused a self-perpetuating breakdown in the democratic
 11 process, because as soon as you - and -
 12 QUESTION: Do you agree with your colleague that
 13 there is no need for any neutral justification when you're
 14 drawing districts? 
 That it can be done solely for the 15 purpose - granted it be an attempt that might not succeed,
 16 nobody knows for sure how people are going to vote, but is
 17 it permissible for a legislative body not even to consult
 18 - I mean, the majority of a legislative body not even to
 19 consult another party, not even to take anything into
 20 consideration except trying to get the maximum results at
 21 the - the election?
 22 MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor. That's
 23 permissible, and we think that was the whole point of what
 24 we call the racial gerrymandering line of cases, that is,
 25 the Shaw Line of cases, where they were saying, okay, we

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 have a special category here that relates to race, and
 2 what we're trying to do is define the difference between
 3 race, which is inherently suspect, and which requires
 4 special scrutiny, and politics, which the Court repeatedly
 5 said -
 6 QUESTION: But if you take that position, then
 7 you must be taking the position, I guess you are, that the
 8 - the holding in Bandemer that this was a just -
 9 justiciable issue is just erroneous?
 10 MR. DeLONE: Your Honor, we think that -
 11 QUESTION: That's your basic position?
 12 MR. DeLONE: We certainly think that the Court
 13 should take this opportunity to find that - that - that
 14 political gerrymandering is non-justiciable. We think
 15 that would be the simplest and the cleanest way to frankly
 16 get out of the political thicket.
 17 But - but even if you don't do that, what - what
 18 the Bandemer plurality was doing was simply applying what
 19 this Court has - has always applied with respect to vote
 20 dilution. And we think it would be kind of strange if the
 21 - excuse me, Your Honor.
 22 QUESTION: May I ask you this? Do you think the
 23 complaint states a cause of action under Justice Powell's
 24 opinion in Bandemer?
 25 MR. DeLONE: I heard you ask that before, Your

49
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Honor.
 2 QUESTION: That's why I thought I'd ask you. You
 3 had fair warning of the question.
 4 (Laughter.)
 5 QUESTION: Don't tell me you didn't read the
 6 opinion.
 7 MR. DeLONE: No, no. Yes, Your Honor, I - I - I
 8 think it would, because Justice Powell thought in terms of
 9 neutral districting criteria and thought there was some
 10 objective reality out there. And frankly, we don't think
 11 there is one, and if you start down the road of electoral
 12 results, we submit that -
 13 QUESTION: No, no. He doesn't start down the
 14 road of electoral results. 
 He - he focuses on intent, 15 that it's an intent to use nothing except a non-neutral
 16 criterion in drafting the regulations. And you're
 17 suggesting that's permissible. That would not require
 18 counting votes after the election.
 19 MR. DeLONE: With respect to intent, Your Honor,
 20 we - we think it - it's - you certainly can assume that
 21 there was political intent in a - in a political
 22 gerrymander -
 23 QUESTION: And nothing else.
 24 MR. DeLONE: It - it certainly could be nothing
 25 else, Your Honor.

50
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: So is this a - an intent of a bare
 2 majority or all of them? What - what - what if -
 3 MR. DeLONE: Well, I think you can presume that
 4 as - as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, 42 of 98 in the
 5 Democratic caucus voted for the plan. I think you can
 6 presume that they were in some way -
 7 QUESTION: You can only - that's a matter of
 8 defense. You can't presume that based on the allegations
 9 at the complaint.
 10 MR. DeLONE: No, I - I was trying to address
 11 Justice Scalia's question about -
 12 QUESTION: I'm trying to get to how you - how you
 13 determine intent.
 14 MR. DeLONE: Well, I - I -
 15 QUESTION: Or whether it's based on the majority
 16 or -
 17 MR. DeLONE: I - I think you can presume that
 18 whatever the voting, there was some political motivation,
 19 and I think you can presume that the political motivation
 20 might be different for different groups, different
 21 parties. And - and frankly, we - we don't - we don't have
 22 a problem with the intent -
 23 QUESTION: Belling the cat. I mean, it's
 24 wonderful to use intent. How do you find intent? That's
 25 - legislative intent is very hard to determine.

51
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DeLONE: And - and - and I think the intent
 2 would be - would different. But it's - you can even
 3 assume that it's political -
 4 QUESTION: Well, how did you find it in the - in
 5 the first racial gerrymandering case? Didn't you find it
 6 partly by looking at the shape of that district in North
 7 Carolina?
 8 MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor.
 9 QUESTION: Didn't that shift the burden?
 10 MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor, you did. But in
 11 the - in the racial gerrymandering cases, you were looking
 12 for something that was race-neutral.
 13 QUESTION: You were also looking for predominant
 14 motive, not what the exclusive motive is, which is the 15 test that Justice Stevens is - is proposing.
 16 MR. DeLONE: That - that's correct, Your Honor.
 17 QUESTION: The - the exclusive motive just is
 18 easier to respond to, because all you got to do is come up
 19 with one neutral justification and you use the neutral
 20 justifications that the Court identified itself in the
 21 racial gerrymandering cases, such as contiguity and
 22 compactness and so forth.
 23 MR. DeLONE: But again, Your Honor, your - your -
 24 the premise of your question is that there's something
 25 wrong with political motivation.

52
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Correct. That's exactly right. No,
 2 no, the premise of the - what the question is that there's
 3 a duty to govern impartially, and that if you have no duty
 4 except partisan advantage, the case is just like saying,
 5 we're going to pay the majority legislatures a higher
 6 salary than the minority legislatures.
 7 MR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor, I - I think that
 8 when you're - when you're dealing with a - a political
 9 question like districting, you're - you're - I think no
 10 political party worth its salt is going to be - not think
 11 it's - it's doing what's in the public interest to give
 12 itself as much advantage as possible.
 13 QUESTION: It can do that as long as it has some
 14 other basis for doing it, and that's history what we did 15 over years and years and years, states have followed an
 16 attempt to get compact districts, your neighbors are in
 17 the same voting area as you are and so forth, not these
 18 fancy designs that are really a recent product of
 19 politics.
 20 MR. DeLONE: But, Your Honor, in - in all of
 21 these traditional districting criteria, they're basically
 22 used as tools by the political parties to seek what kind
 23 of political advantage they can. And again, we submit
 24 that that is - is - there's nothing wrong with that. And
 25 the question is whether or not you've been shut out of the

53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 process, whether something else is happening that suggests
 2 that the - the process itself is broken. And if you -
 3 QUESTION: For example, what would that be?
 4 MR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor, it's - it's
 5 happened in the past. It's - it's - it's happened with
 6 Reynolds and Baker, and it's happened with -
 7 QUESTION: But that isn't gerrymandering.
 8 MR. DeLONE: No, it isn't, but it's the kind of
 9 breakdown -
 10 QUESTION: You're saying there's no
 11 gerrymandering unless there's something else.
 12 MR. DeLONE: Yes.
 13 QUESTION: Which is to say there's no such thing
 14 as cognizable political gerrymandering, period. 15 MR. DeLONE: I - I think what the Bandemer
 16 plurality was trying to do was to leave the door slightly
 17 ajar for something that, frankly, in our political system
 18 is too resilient to - to allow to happen, but it's
 19 conceivable that it could happen. And frankly, we think
 20 that it's strange to try and change the - the standard,
 21 which is well established in this Court's jurisprudence,
 22 just because the political system doesn't allow it to
 23 occur.
 24 And we think that once you go down the road of
 25 electoral results, you go down the road of

54
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 proportionality. And the - the references that - that
 2 appellants' counsel keep making to majorities are
 3 statewide majorities, and that is proportionality. That
 4 is a political judgement, and we believe that the Court
 5 has properly rejected that and the Court should continue
 6 to apply the unconstitutional vote dilution standard and
 7 that that - if - if they find that it's justiciable at
 8 all, and that the easiest and simplest thing for the Court
 9 to do is to find that political gerrymandering is in fact
 10 unconstitutional - excuse me, non-justiciable as a matter
 11 of law.
 12 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. DeLone.
 13 Mr. Smith, you have two minutes remaining.
 14 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH
 15 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 16 MR. SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me
 17 start off by saying I do think that our complaint
 18 satisfies the standards of the Powell opinion in - in
 19 Bandemer that it alleges that partisan maximization was
 20 the sole driving force behind this map. And indeed, we
 21 had the opportunity in the district court, because of the
 22 one person, one vote problem, for the state to come in and
 23 try to come up with some justification for their line-
 24 drawing other than partisan maximization, and the district
 25 court found as a fact in that trial that the map

55
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 jettisoned every criterion that this Court ever identified
 2 in Karcher, other than partisan maximization.
 3 QUESTION: I take it the results you're urging on
 4 us would require us to supervise local entities, city
 5 councils, boards of supervisors -
 6 MR. SMITH: They -
 7 QUESTION: - water districts.
 8 MR. SMITH: They - they - they as well can
 9 violate the constitutional rights of the people who live
 10 in those jurisdictions, Your Honor.
 11 And let me just address the - the question of
 12 whether it makes sense to wait and see how the elections
 13 come out and see whether there is, in fact, this anti
 14 majoritarian effect from the line-drawing. One of the
 15 real practical problems with that is that the lines
 16 themselves in a - in an extreme gerrymander like this, can
 17 - can effect the statewide aggregate vote totals
 18 themselves.
 19 You saw that right here where, in - with the
 20 history of votes very evenly divided in a - in a balanced
 21 map through the '90s, a court-drawn map. Suddenly with
 22 this gerrymander you had five Republicans running
 23 unopposed, you had a number of the Democratic incumbents
 24 defeated in the primaries because they squared off -
 25 QUESTION: I guess if it were the constitutional

1 rule, the party could adjust and try to run strong
 2 candidates, even in overwhelmingly Republican districts.
 3 MR. SMITH: Well, I suppose that that is in fact
 4 the case, but you can't assume that the - the vote totals
 5 under a gerrymander are independent of the effects of
 6 that. First of all, if they pair the incumbents, they're
 7 just not there to run anymore, and there's a substantial
 8 distortion caused by the map.
 9 There was some discussion by Mr. Krill of
 10 judicial races as the - the test of - of partisan balance
 11 in the map because the - the supposition was that judges,
 12 when they run, don't have any great personal magnetism, I
 13 guess. But he didn't mention the - the race that was
 14 cited in our reply brief, which - this was 2003 - where 15 Mr. Bayer ran as a Democrat, got 52 percent of the votes
 16 statewide, and carried six out of the 19 districts. That
 17 is an indication of the basic fundamental packing and
 18 cracking that's in the map, and is in fact a form of
 19 severe discrimination, making some voters' votes count
 20 much more forcefully than others.
 21 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
 22 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Smith 
 23 The case is submitted.
 24 (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the
 25 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
