    "speech": "That's true, Your Honor, but in the circumstances presented here, consideration of the balance of factors leads to a requirement the procedures that would satisfy those factors would also lead to actual notice. For instance, today the Government uses procedures under which, after the mail is received by the prison, there's not just some vague distribution process at the prison, but the mail is signed for. In the mail room, there's a log book kept, and when it leaves the mail room a log book is kept that is ultimately signed for by the inmate. And this chain of receipts helps to ensure that there's extra care and attention paid with the delivery of the notice."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "ZIEVE",
    "speech": "The mailed notice is any form of delivery -- any form of notice is adequate as to that individual if it's received. The mailed notice is adequate when it's received, and in this case, the Government's procedures used certified mail so that you know that the mail was received. If the Government had mailed the certified mail to the proper prison and it had not been received, the certified mail slip never came back, then I don't think the mailed service would have been adequate."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It seems to me one of the difficulties I find with your position, Ms. Zieve, is that this inquiry can come up, you know, months and maybe years after the actual notice took place or didn't take place. And it's one thing to say we have a -- you followed a system and that system affords due process, but to have every case turn on perhaps an argument between the person who's seeking to set aside the service -- I never received it -- and someone else saying, yes, you did receive it, I think is rather unsatisfactory."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ZIEVE",
    "speech": "Well, that's why the procedures should require proof of verification which the Government's procedures do today. If Mr. Dusenbery was served with a forfeiture notice today, he would be required to sign for it and there would be no question thing. There's no such thing. Under the circumstances doesn't add anything I don't think. You say is it reasonably calculated to give actual notice. I haven't figured out your qualification, how that would work.

If notice is sent to an ordinary citizen and the post office looses it, unless you adopt the certified mail rule, that would be adequate notice. But in the case of an incarcerated person, if the post office looses it, it is not adequate notice. Right?"

    "speaker": "ZIEVE",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But I take it your argument would be that even if all the signatures are not required in the in rem case, there is -- there is a fairness in the procedure that would not require actual notice and signatures to every ship owner because the owner of the ship at least has some right to control the ship. So, you say, look, if -- if they don't pay attention to what's happening to their ship, we -- we can tag them with that. But the difference between that case and this, case, even without a rule requiring actual signature, if the Government were required to show, with a greater detail than you say it has here, that there was a regular procedure, at the time involved here, that makes it just as probable that the letter would have gotten from the front door of the prison to the prisoner, as it is probable that the letter mailed in the box gets to the front door of the prison. You'd be satisfied with that kind of a rule, wouldn't you?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ZIEVE",
    "speech": "Yes, but the reason that I emphasize the signature is because, as the Bureau of Prisons has since recognized, the -- the signature does help to improve delivery. It helps to make sure that this letter is treated with some extra attention and care. It ensures that it's not going to get misdelivered to Larry Smith two cells over."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What do we do with prisoners who won't sign?"

    "speaker": "ZIEVE",
    "speech": "Well, actually the Board of Prisons procedures deal with that, and I think effectively, which is on the log book, if the prisoner refuses to sign, then the person delivering the mail signs for it stating that the prisoner won't sign, which I think is comparable to a adequate. Is that an acceptable general statement of the test?"

  {
    "speaker": "ZIEVE",

However, there's still the -- the inmate is still special in that he has no control over his property. There are no proxies looking out for him, for his interests. And the mail, even when it's sent to the military, my assumption is that if you get certified mail, the soldier is going to sign for it. The officer will sign for it and not someone for later delivery to him without any proof or documentation about what happened in the interim. If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Very well, Ms. Zieve. Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.  this case, this forfeiture case, satisfies that test. The method was by the use of certified mail. And petitioner does not dispute that mails generally are satisfactory for purposes of notice. Rather they draw the distinction that only in the case of prisoners is that method unwarranted or unconstitutional. Petitioner is asserting a constitutional violation. It therefore has the burden of proof of establishing the procedures the Government used are unconstitutional. And I'd like to clarify a point with regard to whether notice was received here or not. The Government has not submitted that notice was not received. We simply are unable to prove that it was not received."

That's the point. So, it would apply to everybody, armed forces, everybody. And what's wrong with that? It isn't that hard to do. It protects pretty thoroughly against losing your property without even knowing about it. So, do it."

Now, whether the Court would want to take the step of saying that the mails are always adequate in any proceeding is a step that's not necessary for the Court to take.

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right. And the reason that that's wrong is because? I mean, the harm that it will do it other analogous situations. Give me an example of some serious problem that would be caused by such a rule."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "The rule would, first of all, require, for instance, as the Chief Justice has pointed out, similar service on the armed services. It also would apply to other situations that might not be documented in the record. For instance, it's my understanding that the problem that would cause the Government?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Well, I cannot say that the Government cannot overcome that difficulty, because it does in fact use certified mail. But the problem is should the Court erect that as a constitutional standard, and the difficulties with erecting that as a constitutional standard, as I pointed out before, is it will be very difficult to cabin that to a wide variety of other situations --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "With certified mail, you have to get a signature from the recipient, whereas with ordinary mail, you can put it in the slot in your mailbox. In other words, it's often difficult to obtain the certified mail signature in a way that it wouldn't be to get the ordinary mail slot."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "That's correct. And, for many cases are -- are untrue, that the person did not receive the notice, that, well, a guard signed for me and never actually -- I did not refuse to receive it and a guard simply signed and said that I refused. What we're trying to do from a policy perspective, from the Bureau of Prisons' perspective, is to eliminate the sort of wasteful litigation that takes place over assertions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Minear, the Third Circuit has apparently adopted a test that requires the Government to show a little more than that it dropped a notice in the mail, and that, in fact, the Government must show that procedures at the receiving facility, the prison, were reasonably calculated to deliver notice to the intended recipient."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But your -- your argument, it seems to me, is premised on the fact that forfeiture is like an in rem proceeding and it's just different. Assume with me -- I'm not sure that this is -- assume that there's a constitutional due process requirement for personal service unless there's some showing of unavailability in the routine case for contract and tort. Why should this be any different?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "The reason -- the reason why --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That may be an heroic assumption. I'm not sure that's true. I think -- let me go back. Do you know of any State which in an ordinary civil action allows service by mail as a routine matter?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "I don't know of --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Absent unavailability or the fact that the person is avoiding the process server or question, it seems to me your case is premised on the assumption that this is a forfeiture in rem type, different action than -- than a routine contract or tort action."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Well, we certainly do think it falls on the side of the -- of the line that this other -- the other cases of this Court demarcs, namely probate proceedings, tax sales, condemnation proceedings, notice of forcible entry and detainer proceedings, which are basically ejectment proceedings. All of those types of proceedings have involved situations where this Court indicated that notice by ordinary mail would be sufficient. Now, we go beyond that. We do provide certified mail as -- as a matter of policy. And it serves an important policy -- get the mail. I'm just wondering if the -- there's nothing in the record about that, is there?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "No. There's nothing in the record and it's not clear to me at all that if there was a forfeiture that was directed to a serviceman, it would be treated any differently."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It would toll the statute of puzzles me about this? The -- even before the current regulations, there was this special mail category and several things fell into it, including letters that the prisoner would get from the attorney. Those have to be opened in the presence of the prisoner?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "That's correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And then there was this category called law enforcement. And why wasn't a notice of this character categorized as law enforcement and therefore put within the special mail category?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "I think for a short while the DEA and the FBI did follow the practice of denominating certain mails as special mail. I'm not sure if the special mail category existed in 1988. I don't think the record is clear on that. I would point out, however, that under the a -- to a State prisoner."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "No, they do not, although I think that the -- the Court can -- can safely assume that State prisons do, in fact, provide for mail delivery to their prisoners."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would you just comment on the suggestion that your opponent has made, in effect, that there really ought to be a special rule for people who are in the custody of the Federal Government? And I assume with Justice Scalia that would include military personnel too. Is there -- would it make sense to say that when they know darned well where a person is, there's no reason to have three publications in the local newspaper? You just make sure you get it to -- to where the man is."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Well, there's no reason to depart -- that's certainly -- the fact that we know where the It's simply what's important here is, is this method, is the procedure reasonably certain to provide actual notice?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is there any court action -- if you accepted your -- your points and said, look, they send it to the prison. It's signed for in the prison. So, up to there, it's certified. And then a person regularly picks it up, and this person did, and then delivers it to the cell. Suppose the picker-upper either maliciously, negligently, or deliberately didn't give it to the prisoner. Would the prisoner have any kind of claim under the Tort Claims Act?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "I think not under the Tort Claims Act because it does exclude intentional torts. There might be the -- the opportunity for either seeking redress through the prison administrative remedies or through a Bivens type action. But certainly the problem there -- would satisfy the standard."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let me make sure I understand your position on one point. Is it your view that that even if you had not use certified mail in this case, but just used regular mail and an affidavit by the Secretary that it was mailed and so forth, that that would be constitutionally sufficient?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Yes. It's our view that that would be constitutionally sufficient. The procedures that we use, with regard to certified mail, are something that we do beyond constitutional requirements in order to -- primarily to ensure that we can disprove false claims of nonreceipt."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "I think as a practical matter, Your Honor, there's primarily a question of the burden of proof. Under the Sixth Circuit's standard, we are simply -- if we are challenged, if there's a challenge to whether mail was -- was received or not, it's the obligation of that party who's raising the challenge to prove the lack of reasonableness."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but here the Government is seeking to forfeit property from someone. Maybe it's not unreasonable to think that the Government has the burden of proving that notice was given or reasonably calculated to be given."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Well, the Government met that burden in this case, but again, we don't think that that should be the test. Rather, we think that it's the obligation of the party to show that -- what defects are But the problem with the Third Circuit standard is it requires that we, ex ante, at the very beginning of the process, go through and determine what procedures are in various prisons. And that doesn't seem particularly -- that seems particularly inappropriate with regard to State prisons where we think it's reasonable for us to send -- to mail the receipts to the prisons with the expectation that those State prisons will forward the mail appropriately."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Minear, we have a smattering of courts of appeals cases addressing the issue that we've got today, but beyond that, I don't know how much litigation there is about this. Do we have any indication of how much time in forfeiture cases is spent litigating the question of notice?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "I don't know the answer to that, that the -- that that argument really favors you. There would be certainly some questions of -- of adequacy of signature and so on. But if there were a -- a certified mail kind of signature requirement, I'm guessing that institutionally it might be of some help to the courts because I'm -- I am assuming that in most cases there wouldn't be any contest. If the Government had the signature, it would go forward. If it didn't have the signature, it would wait until it got one. So, I am -- I am assuming that, knowing nothing, if I don't know any facts beyond what I know now, that there might be an institutional advantage in a rule that required the -- the kind of proof that -- that your friend on the other side wants."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you'd have no problem if we -- if we held the way you've asked us to hold. I mean, that -- that institutional problem would disappear if you put it in the mail and there are prison procedures in place, as there are in every prison, everything is okay. Right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "There wouldn't be any litigation about that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "There wouldn't be any litigation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Well -- well, no. No, there isn't, but there are also State prisons that do need to determine what procedures they would follow. And my guess is there are a large number of State prisons that follow the practice that was in place in 1988, namely that certified mail may be signed by the -- by the prison officials, but they may not have recorded signatures with regard to the reasonable -- sending it by mail is a reasonable way to do it, you wouldn't have any more of an institutional problem."
  },

    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Well, no, we wouldn't. At the same --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But if we -- if we said that because there is a gap between mail delivery to a prison and delivery to a prisoner and, for that reason, there must be some indication of the procedure for getting the mail to the prisoner, then you might have a -- a problem and there might be an institutional advantage in a signature rule. Wouldn't there?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Well -- well, that's correct. But again, I think that the baseline, the constitutional baseline, here should be that ordinary mail suffices, and it's left to the -- that's why it doesn't seem obvious to me that merely adopting an ordinary mail rule is appropriate to these circumstances at all. What am I missing?"
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The proceedings below didn't -- as I understand it, did not stop with proof that the letter was mailed. The proceedings below involved an -- an indication of what the prison did with the mail when it got it in order to get that mail to the prisoner. Isn't that correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Well, perhaps the answer to your question, Your Honor, is that this Court can certainly affirm the decision below and say that the procedures the -- by the postman to their -- to their own room?"

    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "I do not know the answer to that, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's a problem for all those people, just as it is for prisoners. They have to rely on whatever institution they're in getting the mail to them."
  },

    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Yes. Although I would draw a distinction between the apartment building where oftentimes the mail is provided -- is sorted by the mail -- by the U.S. Postal Service, put into individual boxes, and the dormitory residential hall. I think the Postal Service does draw a distinction between apartment buildings and dormitories in that regard."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Minear, in the -- in the hospital setting, the Government has a claim against someone, knows that person is hospitalized, sends ordinary mail to the hospital for the contract claim, the tort claim, whatever. Is the Government saying that for an individual it is enough that mail is sent to that person care of an institution, no return receipt requested, that will do to satisfy due process notice requirements?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ZIEVE",
    "speech": "First of all, I'd like to address the -- the suggestion that these cases are about false claims. Mr. Dusenbery actually made claims -- tried to get return of property of eight categories of forfeited property in this case and in the one cited at 201 F.3d 763. As to seven of the eight categories, it was proven that he didn't get the notice either because it wasn't sent at all or it was sent to the wrong place. So, there's no reason to think that he's lying about the eighth. In addition, this is not a mail notice case. We're not talking about the adequacy of mail notice to a mortgage company or a creditor of an estate. This case is more comparable to a situation in which you have a process reduces the risk because it can only be -- the notice can only be delivered, if their signature is required, to the addressee. It will not be sent as in a private residence. It won't be misdelivered to your neighbor's house if you have to sign for it. In a prison, it's not going to be misdelivered to the next cell or bundled with something else. The inmate is going to have to sign for it. And finally, the Third Circuit, which did not require actual notice, did so only because of concern about the evidentiary burden it would place on the Government to have that standard, but the Government's current --"
