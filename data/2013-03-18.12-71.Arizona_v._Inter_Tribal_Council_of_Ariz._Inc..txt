1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 12-71, Arizona v. the Inter 5 Tribal Council of Arizona. 6 General Horne. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. HORNE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 10 and may it please the Court: 11 The NVRA should not be construed to preempt 12 Arizona's Proposition 200 for three reasons. First, 13 prohibiting a State from effectively enforcing the 14 citizenship requirement is so far-reaching that if 15 Congress had intended that, it would have put the 16 prohibition in the statute expressly, which it did not 17 do. Congressional silence should not disable States 18 from taking sensible precautions to exclude noncitizens 19 from voting. 20 Second, when Congress wanted to expressly 21 prohibit something, it knew how to do it. It expressly 22 prohibited notarization and other forms of 23 authentication. This Court has frequently held that 24 statutory language that indicates -- that prohibits one 25 thing indicates there's no other implicit prohibition:

2 Third, Proposition 200 is consistent with

3 the purposes and objectives of the NVRA because the

4 purpose of the NVRA --

5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If I see the purpose of

6 the NVRA to simplify registration --

7 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.

8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- how is Arizona's

9 provisions consistent with that objective and purpose?

10 MR. HORNE: Your Honor --

11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Given that some of the

12 amici explain that many people don't have the documents

13 that Arizona requires?

14 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. First of all,

15 the -- simplifying the procedure is one of two important

16 purposes of the NVRA. The other is the integrity of the

17 system --

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but why does one

19 take precedence over another?

20 MR. HORNE: I would say, Your Honor, that

21 neither takes precedence over the other. They're both

22 equally important. And so --

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if something you do

24 conflicts with one of those purposes, why isn't it

25 preempted by the Federal law?

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 5
1 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, I think the question 2 is, if you take the two purposes together, does -- does 3 the Proposition 200 strongly fulfill one and have a 4 minimal burden on the other? And, Your Honor, I would 5 rely on the findings of the -- of the district court in 6 this case. In fact, this Court instructed the Ninth 7 Circuit to defer to the factual findings of the district 8 court in the Purcell case, which was this case in an 9 earlier stage. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would you think that 11 Congress, in doing the short form registration, didn't 12 consider the issue of fraud, and decide that it had 13 arrived at the balance it wanted? 14 MR. HORNE: Because, Your Honor, the -- the 15 Congress did not specify what the States could or could 16 not do. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it did -- but 18 Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled. 19 And it was to be an attestation, a signed attestation 20 subject to -- to the penalty of perjury. So it's not as 21 though the Federal form didn't relate to citizenship. 22 It did. And it said this is the way we deal with 23 citizenship. Then Arizona adds something else. 24 So I would like, General Horne, for you to 25 respond to a question that's already been raised in --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 6
1 by the -- the panel that decided this case originally, 2 which was, the statute said -- says each State must 3 accept and use the Federal form, period. That's the end 4 of it. 5 And then it says, in addition to that, the 6 State can do other things. The judge who asked that 7 question thought it was perfectly clear, you use the 8 Federal form, and if you want to do something in 9 addition -- but you must use and accept the Federal Form 10 and not add something to it. 11 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. I think it's 12 very clear that this statute does not say the signature 13 is the only thing that the States can use to verify the 14 eligibility of the applicant. Now, in -- in using the 15 term "accept and use," Your Honor, accept and use in 16 ordinary language -- we've given lots of examples in our 17 briefs -- one can accept and use a form for a particular 18 purpose without that form being sufficient to accomplish 19 that purpose. 20 I came here from Arizona on an airplane. If 21 the airline said we accept and use an e-mail ticket, you 22 don't need to bring a paper ticket. And then I got 23 there and they said, we want to see identification to 24 prove that you are who you say you are, that would not 25 contradict the statement that they are accepting and

Page 7
1 using the e-ticket. They are accepting and using the 2 e-ticket for a specific purpose -3 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General Horne, wouldn't 4 it contradict it if instead of saying well, we'd like 5 you to offer identification, saying, well, we'd like you 6 also to have a paper ticket. 7 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. If they -8 JUSTICE KAGAN: That would be inconsistent 9 with the accept and use language, isn't that right? 10 MR. HORNE: That's correct, Your Honor. 11 Yes, Your Honor. And if I take that analogy to our -12 to our facts, if we had changed the Federal form, I 13 think we would have been in violation. But we did not 14 change the Federal form. We used the Federal form 15 exactly as it's printed by the Federal government. And 16 we -17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you added something 18 to the Federal form, and that essentially creates a new 19 set of requirements and a new form. 20 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, we -- we accept and 21 use the Federal form. We ask, in addition to that, for 22 evidence that the person is a citizen, that they're 23 eligible to vote. The form is not exclusive. The form 24 does not bind us to use only the form and nothing else. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you -- do you think that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 8
1 you could have said -- you know, we have our own State 2 form, which we're allowed to have under the statute. 3 Anybody who requires the Federal form has to append the 4 State form as well. 5 Could you have done that? 6 MR. HORNE: I think not, Your Honor, because 7 I think that would have been contrary to the purposes 8 and objectives of the Act. I think what we did is 9 consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act. 10 But if you -11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how do we draw the 12 line? Where does the line get drawn between adding just 13 your own form, and adding a new set of requirements, 14 which -- you know, you could just as easily have called 15 a form? 16 MR. HORNE: Because the statute contemplates 17 that it -- that it is the burden of the States to 18 determine the eligibility of the voters. The -- the EAC 19 was given the duty to develop the form, and we don't 20 argue with the fact that the form belongs to the EAC. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: So that form should have 22 included the eligibility requirements that your State 23 demands. And it seems to me your complaint is that the 24 Federal form does not require proof of citizenship, 25 unless you consider just the statement that I'm a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1 citizen to be proof of citizenship.

Page 9

2 But why didn't you challenge the form? I

3 mean, that's -- that's my problem with this. I frankly

4 think that Federal form doesn't make much sense unless

5 it's -- unless it's to be exclusive for Federal voting.

6 And -- and why didn't you challenge the -- the refusal

7 of the Commission to include on the form, as additional

8 State requirements, the proof of citizenship?

9 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, under Section

10 6(a)(1) of the statute, the burden of determining

11 whether the citizen is eligible rests with the State.

12 That --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. Sure.

14 MR. HORNE: The form belongs to the EAC.

15 The determination of whether the applicant is eligible

16 belongs to us. So whether or not they put what -- what

17 we're asking for on the form doesn't matter. We are

18 fulfilling our duty under Section 6(a)(1) by determining

19 the eligibility of the applicant by asking for

20 additional evidence of citizenship.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're -- you're

22 simply denying then that the Federal government can, so

23 long as it protects the requirements that your State

24 imposes, you're -- you're saying the Federal government

25 cannot prescribe a single form for -- for voter

1 registration.

Page 10

2 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal

3 government can prescribe the form, but the form is not

4 exclusive. The responsibility to determine the

5 eligibility --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why can't it make it

7 exclusive? Let's assume -- I think -- I think that --

8 that accept and -- and employ, whatever the language

9 is --

10 MR. HORNE: Accept and use.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- suppose -- suppose I

12 think that that does mean that it's supposed to be

13 exclusive. What harm is there so long as the Federal

14 Commission requires, as part of the Federal form, all of

15 the necessary proofs of -- of qualification that the

16 State imposes?

17 MR. HORNE: Well, Your Honor, the -- the

18 form is -- cannot be exclusive. I mean, even the ITCA

19 Respondent and the United States Respondent admit that

20 we can look to external evidence to determine whether

21 the voter is eligible. The argument is, they say we can

22 look at external evidence, but we can't ask the

23 applicant himself, who has the most information, to pull

24 out his driver's license and write down a number.

25 There's no --

Page 11
1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Horne, there -2 there are a whole list of State-specific requirements 3 that get appended to the form. And I think Justice 4 Scalia was raising the question, did you ask to have 5 Arizona's requirement -- just as the other 6 State-specific requirements -- did you ask the Federal 7 Commission to include, as a State-specific requirement, 8 this proof of citizenship? 9 MR. HORNE: We did, Your Honor, and the 10 Commission itself took no action. The executive 11 director rejected our request. The executive director 12 has no power to make determinations. Congress 13 explicitly stated that the EAC can act only by a vote of 14 three out of four of its members. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you did nothing more 16 about that? 17 MR. HORNE: Yes, sir. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you didn't go to 19 court to say you have to include this as one of the 20 State-specific requirements. 21 Why didn't you do that? 22 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, that -- that was 23 under a predecessor of mine, so I don't know the reason. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. Okay. 25 Why didn't he do it?

Page 12

2 MR. HORNE: I'm -- I'm not sure I would be

3 competent to answer for him, Your Honor. But I think --

4 but I don't think it makes any difference because the

5 form is -- is one thing that we accept and use to

6 determine the eligibility of the voter, but it's not the

7 only thing.

8 My friends on the other side --

9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a -- I have a

10 hugely great difficulty, which is, the NVRA says that

11 people can mail in this form.

12 MR. HORNE: Yes.

13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know how your

14 rejection of the mail-in, how you're accepting and using

15 it when you're refusing to register someone when they do

16 exactly what the Federal law permits them to do: Mail

17 it in. There -- there's -- I don't -- I have a real big

18 disconnect with how you can be saying you're accepting

19 and using, when you're not registering people, when they

20 use it the way the Federal law permits them to.

21 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. That is the

22 position that the executive director took, that if the

23 form is fully filled out and on its face it shows the

24 person is qualified we must accept the application. We

25 then pointed out in our brief that that would mean that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 13
1 even if we had documentary proof that the person was not 2 a citizen, we'd still have to accept the application. 3 In response to that, the Respondent ITCA and 4 the Federal government said, no, you can look at 5 external evidence, if it shows that the person is not a 6 citizen. So the only question remaining then is there 7 any basis in the statute for drawing a distinction 8 between our looking to external evidence that we have 9 and our asking the applicant to write down a -- a number 10 from his driver's license. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you also ask for an 12 address, for proof of the address, or proof of date of 13 birth? 14 MR. HORNE: If that were consistent with the 15 purposes and objectives of the Act we could, Your Honor. 16 And in determining that, one would have to weigh our 17 interest in the integrity of the system versus what 18 burdens that places on the -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then again, it seems 20 to me the Federal form, as some of my colleagues have 21 indicated, is not worth very much. 22 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal form 23 sets forth certain minimum requirements that -- that 24 have to be met. In fact, the -- the Act says 25 specifically in Section 7(b)(2) that they must ask for
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 14
1 the signature under oath of the applicant. The Federal 2 form also provides under 7(a)(1) that additional things 3 that are necessary to determine the eligibility of the 4 applicant can also be put on the form. 5 The EAC chose not to put anything additional 6 on the form, which was their right. It was permissive. 7 But they did set -- set up a system of State-specific 8 requirements. I think that reflects the fact that the 9 States have the burden of determining whether or not the 10 eligible -- the applicant is eligible. 11 That's -- that's our burden. We must accept 12 and use the Federal form as a tool in doing that, but it 13 is not the exclusive tool, and my friends on the other 14 side have admitted that it's not the exclusive tool 15 because they've admitted that if we have documentary 16 evidence the person is not a citizen, we can reject the 17 application. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: How could you establish 19 citizenship without having something mailed in, in 20 addition to the form? What are the other State-specific 21 requirements? You have to put down your driver's 22 license number or some other numbers? I -- I guess you 23 could -- you could make them check off place of birth 24 and if that place of birth is not the United States, you 25 could require them to write down some number of -- of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 15
1 their admission to citizenship. Are there -- are there 2 numbers that you could demand? 3 MR. HORNE: Well, some States require the 4 Social Security number -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 6 MR. HORNE: -- which is not -- which is not 7 provided for in the statute. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 9 MR. HORNE: But the -- but it's not 10 prohibited. And the States were held in -- in the cases 11 that were brought under that, the States were held that 12 they could add it because it's not prohibited. 13 The State of Louisiana -- inconsistently on 14 the part of the EAC, the State of Louisiana has a 15 requirement that was approved by the EAC and is in the 16 form that says, "If the applicant has neither a 17 Louisiana driver's license, a Louisiana special 18 identification card, or a Social Security number, the 19 applicant shall attach one of the following items to his 20 application: A copy of a current and valid photo 21 identification, a copy of a current utility bill, bank 22 statement, government check, paycheck or other 23 government document." So -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's the kind of 25 thing you should have had and that your predecessor
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 16
1 should have asked for to be included in the Federal 2 form. 3 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal form is 4 not exclusive. 5 JUSTICE KAGAN: But -- but, General, doesn't 6 the -- the statute make the EAC the decision maker with 7 respect to what can be added to the Federal form? The 8 Federal form -- form, you're exactly right, sets a 9 floor. But if you look at Section 7, what Section 7 10 does is to say the EAC gets to decide the minimum 11 necessary, and it consults with the States and the 12 States can come to it and tell it what it needs, and the 13 EAC can take action. But the EAC is driving the bus, 14 according to Section 7 of this statute. 15 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. The EAC is 16 driving the bus as to the form, but the States are 17 driving the bus as to what is necessary to determine the 18 ultimate -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think they're 20 driving the bus as to the form. They can't drive it 21 into a ditch. They're -- they're -- they're subject to 22 arbitrary and capricious limitations, just as any other 23 agency is. And to allow Louisiana -- to include what -24 what they've allowed a Louisiana to include and to say 25 that the only proof of citizenship -- there is a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 17
1 provision in the statute which says consistent with 2 determining, the States being able to determine the 3 qualifications. 4 Isn't there a provision which makes it clear 5 that the Federal form has to make allowance for the 6 States determining the qualifications? 7 MR. HORNE: That's correct, Your Honor. And 8 the -- and the -- but the -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now -10 MR. HORNE: The -- the duty of the States, 11 Your Honor, to determine whether or not a voter is 12 eligible, that is a duty that rests with the State, not 13 with the EAC. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true. 15 MR. HORNE: The EAC can only -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the form has to enable 17 the State to do that. And it seems to me you were quite 18 able to argue that in -- in refusing to allow you to 19 include in the -- in the Federal form in Arizona some 20 indication of proof of citizenship requiring nothing 21 else except oh, I'm a -- check off, I am a citizen, 22 right? So it's under oath. Big deal. If -- if -- if 23 you're willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose 24 you're willing to violate the perjury laws. 25 MR. HORNE: That's exactly right, Your
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1 Honor.

Page 18

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: So I think you should --

3 you should have challenged the commission's refusal

4 to -- to place that evidence in the Federal form.

5 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal form

6 is -- is a tool that we have to use to determine the

7 eligibility of the voter, but the ultimate

8 responsibility under -- under Section 6(a)(1) of -- of

9 this very Act is with the States to determine the

10 eligibility of the voter.

11 My friends on the other side are admitting

12 that the -- that we're not stuck with the four corners

13 of the form because -- because we've pointed out that

14 would result in a ridiculous conclusion that we could

15 have documentary proof that the person is not eligible.

16 So, if we're not bound by the four corners of the form,

17 as in the ordinary use of the term "accept and use," we

18 accept and use the form for a specific purpose, but it

19 does -- it is not sufficient to satisfy that purpose.

20 All parties agree to that.

21 The only question is, is there a

22 distinction, which we do not find in the statute,

23 between using external evidence that we already have and

24 asking someone to write down the -- the number on his

25 driver's license, which he is the one that has the most

Page 19
1 information. It's the logical way to do it. In fact, 2 there is no Federal register of American citizens. 3 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm a little bit confused. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I take it -- I take 5 it that -- that counsel on -- on -- on the other side 6 will disagree with that and they say, well, this is -7 this is the line to be drawn. The -- the postcard is 8 presumptive evidence of registration and -- and of 9 qualification. And if you have evidence to the 10 contrary, then it's different. But otherwise, the whole 11 utility of the single form is missing -- is gone. 12 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, there -- there is 13 nothing in the statute to draw a distinction between our 14 having other extrinsic evidence, which they agree we can 15 use outside of the form and our asking people to say, 16 write down -17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than the statutory 18 words that authorize the use of the form. 19 MR. HORNE: Yes, but -- but they don't make 20 the form exclusive. Congress could have said the form 21 is exclusive and you can't ask for anything else. They 22 didn't do that. And they had shown when they dealt with 23 authentication that they knew how to prohibit something 24 if they wanted to prohibit it. They chose not to 25 prohibit this exclusively and -- and so therefore, it

1 rests with the States --

Page 20

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Some of us have -- do

3 believe in legislative history. Some of my colleagues

4 don't.

5 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.

6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But at least

7 one of --

8 (Laughter.)

9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did he point to himself?

10 One of the concurring judges below said that

11 he found the statute ambiguous, but that with the

12 legislative history there just could be no conclusion,

13 but that Congress rejected your reading. Legislation

14 history is very clear that this issue of what States

15 could add to the form was raised and permission to do so

16 was proposed explicitly and rejected.

17 How do you -- assuming that I believe in

18 legislative history, don't argue to me that I shouldn't,

19 okay?

20 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.

21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you get around

22 that?

23 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, if the -- if the

24 legislative history were consistent, I would -- I would

25 say that was an argument that could be made. But the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 21
1 legislative history here is extremely self-contradictory 2 and one cannot conclude from any part of that 3 legislative history what was the intent of the majority 4 of the Congress. 5 The House committee which dealt with the 6 very act that -- that we have said, "Only the elected 7 officials designated and authorized under State law are 8 charged with responsibility to enroll eligible voters on 9 the list of voters. The NVRA should not be interpreted 10 in any way to supplant that authority. The committee is 11 particularly interested in ensuring that election 12 officials continue to make determinations as to 13 applicants' eligibility, such as citizenship, as they're 14 made under current law and practice." 15 And the FEC, which is a predecessor to the 16 EAC, relying on that House committee report, said that 17 an application received by a local voter registration 18 official is only an application and be subject to 19 whatever verification procedures are currently applied 20 to all applications. 21 In addition, Your Honor -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, if I believed -- if I 23 believed in legislative history, I would find that very 24 persuasive. 25 (Laughter.)

1 MR. HORNE: Thank you, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Could I ask a different -3 can I ask -4 (Laughter.) 5 MR.

HORNE: Yes. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, there are four 17 subsections and only one of those refers to a particular 18 thing, and that is, identifying information. It shall 19 include a statement, including citizenship, saying -20 that contains an attestation the applicant meets that 21 requirement. 22 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: And under perjury. 24 MR. HORNE: Yes. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: It says that. Then I look
Alderson Reporting Company

Page 23
1 at the Arizona law and it says in Arizona, you have to 2 include like in immigration -- you know, a passport, a 3 birth certificate, and then you have a couple of other 4 things that show you're a citizen, correct? 5 MR. HORNE: Yes, those are very unusual. 6 Normally, you just write down the number from your 7 driver's license. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. That's not my 9 question. 10 MR. HORNE: Okay, Your Honor. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying given these five 12 or six specific things -13 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that show you're a 15 citizen -16 MR.

HORNE: Well, there have been -20 actually, there have been prosecutions for perjury, Your 21 Honor. But it's not -- it's not at all a verification 22 of the eligibility of the citizen because -23 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say it wasn't. I 24 just want to know, since you have right in front of you 25 a birth certificate or the equivalent, what use are you

1 making of the Federal provision that's there in the 2 form: I am a citizen. What use are you making of that? 3 MR. HORNE: Well, Your Honor, we are making 4 use of it and I just mentioned -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know -- I'm sure 6 you are and then my question is how? 7 MR. HORNE: By prosecuting -- there have 8 been ten prosecutions in one year alone of people who 9 swore falsely. Out of the hundreds that were caught 10 swearing falsely, ten, in fact, were prosecuted. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: By? 12 MR. HORNE: But that -- but that is not a -13 that is not a sufficient use or that is not a sufficient 14 measure of determining eligibility because literally 15 hundreds have been caught swearing jury -- jury 16 commissioner forms -- swearing they are not citizens 17 after they had already registered to vote. Other people 18 were caught in their applications to citizenship when 19 they checked and found that they had previously 20 registered to vote and voted. 21 So -- so we are making use of it, but it is 22 not a -- it is not a functional way to determine 23 eligibility. And in 7(a)(1), Congress said that -- that 24 both the Federal form and the State form as incorporated 25 under Section 4 may ask for such additional information,
Alderson Reporting Company

Page 25
1 only such additional information as is necessary to 2 determine the eligibility of the voter. That shows that 3 Congress did not intend to prohibit us from getting 4 additional information as is necessary to determine the 5 eligibility of the voter. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: General, could -- could I 7 take you back to this distinction that you're making. 8 You said you can't append an additional form, you can't 9 use an additional form, but you can require additional 10 information. 11 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. 12 JUSTICE KAGAN: So how do -- what's the 13 difference between requiring additional information and 14 requiring an additional form? Isn't -- when you say you 15 need information A, B, C, D, E, that's just a form, 16 isn't it? 17 MR. HORNE: No, Your Honor, it's not a form. 18 It's -- it's an instruction to -- to write down on the 19 Federal form a number. And there is -- item six on the 20 Federal form has a block where you write down the number 21 and if you don't have either number -- you can write 22 down a -- a driver's license number, you can write down 23 a naturalization number, you can write down an Indian 24 tribal identification number. If you don't have any of 25 those numbers, then you can send in one of these

Page 26

2 But that is not an additional form. The

3 reason -- the distinction I draw between the --

4 incorporating another form or the State form and asking

5 for additional information is the purposes and

6 objectives of the Act. The Act indicates that the State

7 form is an alternative to the Federal form, but cannot

8 take its place. So I'm saying it would not be

9 consistent with the purpose and objectives of the Act to

10 attach the form, but it is consistent --

11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what is the -- what

12 would be the purpose of requiring a Federal form if you

13 could just say, and in addition to that, you have to

14 give ten more items of information? I mean, then the

15 Federal form just becomes another hoop to jump through.

16 MR. HORNE: No, Your Honor. I -- I don't

17 think that's correct. First of all -- for two reasons.

18 First of all, the Federal form does provide minimums.

19 You must -- you must answer the questions set forth in

20 the Federal form.

21 But secondly, to the extent we add things to

22 the Federal form, those things must be consistent with

23 the purposes and objectives of the Act. And I -- and

24 I -- and I justify my assertion that Prop 200 is

25 consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act

1 by relying on the findings of the trial court that 2 relate exactly to that question, finding that it was a 3 minimal burden, overcome by a major interest that the 4 State have -- has in protecting the integrity of the 5 system, where the -- where the trial judge found a lot 6 of evidence to show that there was voter fraud going on, 7 although not the fault of the individuals, the fault of 8 the organizations that often fool people into signing 9 the form when they don't intend to -- or they don't 10 intend to break the law; but as -- but as against that, 11 that the -- that the burdens are minimal. 12 And the trial court, the district court, had 13 a lot of findings justifying the statement that the 14 burdens are minimal, including the fact, for example, 15 that if all the rejected forms had been accepted, the 16 increase in Hispanic registration would have only have 17 been .1 percent, which is statistically insignificant, 18 including the fact that out of a population of $6 19 million, the plaintiffs, who have all the resources one 20 can imagine, if you look at the list of plaintiffs, 21 could only find one person out of six million people 22 that could not satisfy -- who was entitled to vote, who 23 could not satisfy the requirements of the Act; and a lot 24 of other findings by the trial court. 25 And this Court instructed the Ninth Circuit

HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the basic 18 qualification. 19 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Both agree that that's 21 essential. 22 MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you fit in the 24 question of what documents you use to prove that with 25 establishing the qualification? Meaning citizenship,

1 you either have it or you don't. That's why the Federal 2 form says are you or aren't you. 3 MR. HORNE: Yes. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there's -- that 5 qualification has been set by Arizona and the Federal 6 system. 7 MR. HORNE: The qualification has, but 8 our -- our objection to the Ninth Circuit decision 9 preempting Proposition 200 is that it leaves us unable 10 to enforce our qualification requirement, which under 11 the Constitution clearly is a State function. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you have proof, 13 there are people that you have rejected, even without 14 these forms? 15 MR. HORNE: It's extremely inadequate, Your 16 Honor. It's essentially an honor system. It does not 17 do the job. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's what the 19 Federal system decided was enough. 20 MR. HORNE: That's what they decided as a 21 minimum in the Federal form, but they did not say that 22 we could not ask for additional information. Congress 23 could have said that, just as they said we can't ask for 24 notarization. They chose not to say that. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you admit that it

HORNE: We have to accept and use the 4 form and we can't change the form, but we can ask for 5 additional evidence to perform our function of 6 determining that citizens -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I go back to Justice 8 Kagan. If you don't have a driver's license to put a 9 number down -10 MR. HORNE: Yes. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- this list of things 12 says you have to append to the form other items: A copy 13 of your birth certificate, a copy of your naturalization 14 certificate. Why isn't that just creating another form? 15 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, incidentally, there 16 have been references to a postcard. The EAC itself says 17 put the form in an envelope. And -- and just as you put 18 the form in an envelope, you can put a copy of your 19 birth certificate in an envelope. But I would point out 20 under Crawford v. Marion County, the holding in this 21 case, if there's a minimal burden on the great majority 22 of the people and a somewhat higher burden on a few 23 people, that does not negate the interests of the State 24 and the integrity of the system. 25 May I reserve time for rebuttal, Your Honor?

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, you may. 2 MR. HORNE: Thank you. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett? 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT 5 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 6 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 7 please the Court: 8 Arizona simply disagrees with the balance 9 that Congress drew. And when it comes to registration, 10 Justice Kennedy and Justice Kagan, you're both correct, 11 the whole point of the Federal form is that Congress had 12 to draw a different balance. It confronted a situation 13 in which 40 percent of eligible voters were not 14 registered because State procedures and burdens were 15 standing as an obstacle, a barrier between -- in the 16 direct line of accountability between individual 17 citizens and their Federal government. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: And enclosing your driver's 19 license number is that immense barrier, right? 20 MS. MILLETT: First -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what's keeping 40 22 percent of eligible voters away? 23 MS. MILLETT: First of all, with -- with 24 respect to the driver's license, it's only driver's 25 licenses issued after 1996, October 1996, and those that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 32
1 were not -- that someone did not obtain when they became 2 naturalized. So you have to be about 33 years of age. 3 Anyone older than that, their driver's license isn't 4 going to work. And, in fact, Mr. Gonzalez in this case 5 used his driver's license number and got bounced. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I still think that's a 7 relatively few number, and -- and if you don't have the 8 driver's license, then you can use your naturalization 9 certificate. 10 MS. MILLETT: You can -- Mr. Gonzalez did 11 that as well and the naturalization certificate got 12 bounced because the naturalization certificate, when put 13 into the computer, does not produce records. It is a 14 mistake in Arizona's Proposition 200. Neither one of 15 these worked. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you can say that 17 about any certification procedure that, now and then 18 there will be a mistake. I mean the fact that there is 19 one person where -- where the computer spit out the 20 wrong number or something, that is the basis for 21 rejecting the entire system that Arizona proposes? 22 MS. MILLETT: Joint appendix page 263, the 23 district court found that 31,550 people were rejected 24 from voting because of Proposition 200. Even on that 25 same page he finds that 11,000 of them subsequently

Page 33
1 registered, but they had to do the double gauntlet that 2 Congress was trying to eliminate. The other 20,000 3 swore under oath that they were citizens and Mr. Horne, 4 before the Ninth Circuit, conceded he had no evidence 5 that they were not citizens -6 JUSTICE ALITO: The statute -7 MS. MILLETT: -- of the United States. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: The statute says that 9 Arizona must accept and use the Federal form. What does 10 that mean? Let me give you two possible definitions: 11 One, the person must be registered if the Federal form 12 is properly completed and submitted; two, the State may 13 not make any further inquiry of the person who submits 14 the form. 15 Maybe you have other definitions, but what 16 is the -- what do you interpret "accept and use" to 17 mean? 18 MS. MILLETT: We interpret "accept and use," 19 it's mainly the latter, your second one, and that is 20 that it is a limitation on what can be asked of the 21 individual and that's not just from the Section 4 22 language where accept and use comes from. But what's 23 critical here is Section gg-7 which is on 26H of the 24 petition appendix here. And that's where they say on 25 this form.

Page 34
1 The form may require only, may require 2 only -- from the applicant, I'm adding that in -- such 3 identifying information essentially as the Commission 4 determines is necessary to allow the State to make its 5 decision. 6 Now this is not just a ticket into the 7 State's own registration process so they can go thank 8 you very much for throwing it in the garbage can, now do 9 what we would like you to do. It is a registration 10 form, and when filled out completely and submitted under 11 oath, it has the same legal -12 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you this 13 example -14 MS. MILLETT: -- as the registration form. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: A person rides up to a place 16 to register on a bicycle and gets out and hands in the 17 Federal form. This -- this boy looks like he is 13 18 years old and he is carrying school books, he is wearing 19 a middle school t-shirt, but he has filled out the form 20 properly. 21 Are they required to register him or can 22 they ask him, could you show me some proof of age, like 23 he would have to if he tried to buy alcohol or 24 cigarettes? 25 MS. MILLETT: They may not require anything
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 35
1 else from the applicant, but they can certainly apply 2 their own evidence that they obtain, whether it's from 3 their own eyeballs or whether it is through records or 4 databases that they run these through, which is the more 5 common one, and make a decision. 6 Now a decision, the decision isn't simply we 7 would like more from you. That's not an appropriate 8 decision. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: His point is, he keeps 10 making the point, your colleague, and he says, no, that 11 isn't what it says. What the statute says is it may 12 require only such identifying information as is 13 necessary to assess eligibility. In other words, it's 14 telling the people who write the form what they can put 15 on it. And they can't put other things on it. But it 16 nowhere says that the State can't do other things. 17 Now that's his point. And when I asked him, 18 well, how are you -- how are you using -- you have to be 19 able to use, oh, he says, we use it. We use the citizen 20 part and these things on the form to prosecute people 21 for perjury. So we're doing what it says, we're using 22 it and it doesn't say we can't add a few other things. 23 Okay. Now, that's his argument. Now, your 24 answer, which would be very helpful to me, is? 25 MS. MILLETT: My answer is when you look at
Alderson Reporting Company

Page 36
1 26H it's talking about the form. And first, we know 2 that the commission is the one that decides what is 3 necessary on this form, a decision that wasn't 4 challenged -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that conclusive or can 6 that be challenged? 7 MS. MILLETT: It can certainly be challenged 8 under the Administrative Procedure Act but was not in 9 this case. 10 But it says what is necessary on the form. 11 Now, when you give a -- now when you say what's 12 necessary on a form you're talking about from the 13 applicant. So this defines what is necessary from the 14 applicant, what can be requested or demanded from the 15 applicant -16 JUSTICE BREYER: On the form. 17 MS. MILLETT: -- on the form, exactly. On 18 the form. And that is the necessary information to let 19 them apply their own tools and make the decisions that 20 the States make -21 JUSTICE BREYER: But his problem is how do 22 you get to that conclusion? He says you can't get there 23 from the language because the language doesn't say that. 24 It says what the Commission can put on the form. It 25 doesn't say anything about whether some other agency,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 37
1 such as a State or -- you know, a sovereign, can add 2 something. 3 Now, that's his problem. And I would like 4 to hear very succinctly, the reason he is wrong about 5 that is? 6 MS. MILLETT: The Commission, let me just -7 if we turn to 26H at the very top line -8 JUSTICE BREYER: 26H. 9 MS. MILLETT: 26H, where it has a number 1, 10 let's insert the Commission before I get to the word 11 "may." And that's all you need to do. We know from the 12 prior page the Commission is the one doing this. The 13 Commission may require only from the applicant. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 15 MS. MILLETT: That's all the Commission is 16 allowed to require from the applicant. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. 18 MS. MILLETT: Exactly. And then the burden 19 shifts to the State to do it. If, Justice Breyer, if the 20 question is they may require that, and then the State can 21 require anything else it wants, it is an utterly pointless 22 form. And what we know from six -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, they may require 24 it. It doesn't say they must require it. So it leaves 25 it open to the Commission, does it not, to decline to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 38
1 require some materials that is necessary to enable the 2 appropriate State election official to assess 3 eligibility? Isn't that -- isn't that what the language 4 means? 5 MS. MILLETT: I don't think that's a fair 6 reading of what Congress would have assigned to them. 7 But even if it were, Justice Scalia -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: May means may. 9 MS. MILLETT: -- that's something to be 10 challenged through the Administrative Procedure Act -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, we're talking 12 about -- right now we are talking about the consequences 13 of that language, not -- and the consequence of the may 14 is may. It does not even require the Commission to 15 include within the form everything that's necessary for 16 the State to determine eligibility. 17 Now, why would Congress ever create such a 18 system where the Commission need not require what's 19 necessary for eligibility, and nonetheless, the State 20 cannot, cannot require anything further than what the 21 Commission says? 22 MS. MILLETT: The relevant phraseology is 23 may require only, and that is not your normal permissive 24 language. It's actually Congress -- it is language of 25 limitation when used that way. "You may require only"
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 39
1 does not mean that you may -- that you may run freely 2 and do what you want, and they have further down -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: It says what you only may 4 require. It doesn't say what you only shall require. 5 MS. MILLETT: But you may require that is 6 necessary to enable. So the language here, I think any 7 fair reading -- and we don't strain the language in this 8 context -- the natural reading is that they may require 9 only the information from the applicant that's necessary 10 essentially to shift the burden. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. Where you're going 12 is this, as I heard you before: It is true that there is 13 no specific language saying the State can't do this, can't 14 add things. But it does make a huge point approving 15 citizenship in a particular way on the form. What would 16 the point of that be if the State could add things? 17 So we must look back to the purpose, not 18 necessarily exclusively the language, of deciding what 19 that particular provision be, in particularly one as you 20 quote adding to, what could it have been? And there the 21 legislative history in my view is helpful because it 22 makes clear, for example, in at least one place that 23 Congress did think they shouldn't add a provision that 24 allows the State to do just what it's doing here because 25 that wouldn't be consistent with the purpose of the Act.

1 So I'm putting words in your mouth, but 2 don't accept them because I put them there. 3 (Laughter.) 4 MS. MILLETT: I would just like to add to 5 them, Justice Breyer, two points, and that is with 6 respect to citizenship in particular, not only does the 7 statute, the NVRA flag it, but the Help America Vote Act 8 in 2002. 9 So even if you don't want to go just with 10 the legislative history, Justice Scalia, in 2002 11 Congress revisited the citizenship requirement for the 12 Federal form and it added a box that you have to check 13 that you are a citizen -- that you are a citizen. So 14 Congress revisited this issue after the statute had been 15 in effect for nine years. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Millett, I want to 17 give up -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett, is 19 there -- I take it under your theory what the EAC 20 allowed Louisiana to do was wrong. 21 MS. MILLETT: It's unclear. It's a little 22 different in that context, in two ways. First of all, 23 the Commission made the decision so they have that. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I know. I'm 25 assuming that, and I'm saying they were wrong.
Alderson Reporting Company

Page 41
1 MS. MILLETT: Oh, I'm sorry. And then the 2 second thing is the information that's required there is 3 information, for the most part, that is -- that the Help 4 America Vote Act allows States to require of 5 individuals. Now, in the Help America to Vote Act, it's 6 an either do it at the polls or do it in the 7 registration. 8 Maybe the Commission thought it could 9 forward it, but at least there you have two profound 10 differences and that is it's at least information that a 11 separate statute has said States can require from 12 individuals. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And those are what? 14 MS. MILLETT: But I think it's -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are they? 16 MS. MILLETT: That is the -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the 18 additional -- the question here is, is proof of 19 citizenship an additional thing the State can ask. Now 20 you're telling us that there are some additional things. 21 MS. MILLETT: No, it's not proof of 22 citizenship. What it is, is an identification 23 requirement that can be applied at the polls or the Help 24 America Vote Act says at the time of registration. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you -- can you

1 explain -- it's puzzling. You have all these

Page 42

2 State-specific and pages of State-specific requirements.

3 What State-specific requirements are permitted and what

4 State-specific requirements are not permitted? You're

5 putting the citizenship on the not permitted side of the

6 line. What is permitted and what is not permitted and

7 what's the difference in the two categories?

8 MS. MILLETT: Okay. First of all, the State

9 requirement of citizenship, it's permitted in the sense

10 that Congress requires in three different ways that

11 citizenship be affirmed. It's simply disagreeing about

12 proof. So it's not as though citizenship is left off

13 this form, it's simply a question of how it's proved.

14 But the Help America -- just to get right to your

15 question -- there's two aspects to the Help America Vote

16 Act that change this form a little bit.

17 When you go through those instructions, what

18 you will see -- here's what those State-specific

19 instructions are: They are the requirement that you put

20 in an ID number that is required by the Help America

21 Vote Act required. Required. So clearly, that is to be

22 on the form because another statute requires it. And

23 then you put on -- it says to put on party

24 identification for the States that have it. Some States

25 have race identified, and then the instructions tell you

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the rest is -- is what?

10 MS. MILLETT: Well, there's two -- those are

11 things that are in the State -- when you look at those

12 State-specific instructions, they are not add-ons. They

13 are not adding attachments.

14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Millett, I mean, suppose

15 it were true that the EAC has been inconsistent in this

21 deal of reliance on what the EAC has done, and I'm

22 saying if it's not doing a very good job, I'd be -- I'd

23 question whether or not the fact that the EAC is going

24 to implement it is sufficient assurance that the Act

25 reads the way you say it does.

Page 44
1 MS. MILLETT: But the Act, I think, by  by 2 its own plain language and by its normal -- it can't 3 have no -- there is only two ways to look at this 4 statute. It either created a form that is simply to be 5 the servant of every State and they can pile on to it 6 anything else they want, and that is utterly 7 irreconcilable to Congress's findings and the entire 8 purpose of this statute, or this is Congress's 9 registration mechanism that it chose exercising its 10 power. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not anything else that they 12 want. Not anything else that they want. But what is, 13 in the words of the statute, necessary to enable the 14 appropriate State election official to assess the 15 eligibility of the applicant? It's clear that the 16 statute intends the States to be able to do that. And 17 you say, well, the -- you know, the Commission has -18 has required its -- its own proof and the State wants a 19 different kind of proof. The proof the Commission 20 requires is simply the statement, I'm a citizen. This 21 is proof? 22 MS. MILLETT: This is -- statements -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is not proof at all. 24 MS. MILLETT: Statements under oath, 25 statements under oath in a criminal case --

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Under oath is not proof at 2 all. It's just a statement. 3 MS. MILLETT: Statements under oath in a 4 criminal case are proof beyond a reasonable doubt by 5 which we execute them. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: What do you make of the fact 7 that -8 MS. MILLETT: It's a very serious oath -9 I'm sorry. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: I didn't mean to interrupt 11 your sentence. What -- what do you make of the fact 12 that States can create their own forms? Arizona has its 13 own form, right? And I don't believe you argue that its 14 form is illegal. Maybe you think it is and you'll 15 explain that. 16 But what -- how -- and Arizona could put on 17 its own form a demand for the information that it -- it 18 wants to apply to people who submit the Federal form. 19 It seems like a very strange system. So, if somebody 20 happens to fill out the Arizona form, their application 21 may be rejected; whereas if they had filled out the 22 Federal form, it would be accepted. How can that be? 23 MS. MILLETT: Well, there is two responses. 24 One, it's an open question whether what -- whether the 25 State form, for purposes of Federal elections, can add
Alderson Reporting Company

Page 46
1 new requirements, but we haven't challenged it, we 2 haven't challenged here and I think it's -3 JUSTICE ALITO: What statutory provision 4 would you challenge that under? There's -- there's a 5 provision under the statute, the numbers are complicated 6 and I don't have it on the tip of my tongue, it says 7 what the State form must do and I didn't see anything in 8 that that would -- that would preclude their requiring 9 this additional proof. 10 MS. MILLETT: I think -- I think it's 11 actually a very complicated question. And so to be 12 clear, there is statutory language, I think, going both 13 ways on this question. There is in 4(a)(2), which says 14 the State form has to meet the criteria of 7(b), but 15 then -- and then there is in 5(a)(6), which says, if 16 you're going to be handing it out as your public office, 17 it's the public agencies that have to provide the form, 18 it has to be equivalent. 19 But then in Section 2 -- I'm sorry to throw 20 all these numbers, but I'm just trying to show you how 21 it's complicated. In Section 2, the very background for 22 the Federal form is that it's in -- it's in addition to 23 whatever the States are already doing -24 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I've read all those 25 provisions and -- all right.

1 of argument that Arizona could do this on its own form. 2 You haven't argued that their form is illegal. 3 MS. MILLETT: Correct. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: This seems to me like a 5 crazy system. This is like the -- you know, the IRS 6 creating two different tax returns with different -7 with different tax rates and different tax tables and 8 how much you pay would depend on which particular form 9 you happened to pick up and submit. 10 MS. MILLETT: No, not -- not in this sense. 11 First of all, it would be very respectful of the States 12 and Congress to arrive at a balance here, if it did 13 that. But Congress has made clear that there is this 14 essentially safe harbor role for the Federal form and 15 that -- and they can't hide it away. It has to be 16 available for the -- the driver's license and motor 17 voter process. 18 It has to be handed out at the relevant 19 public agencies, and the mail form is available to be 20 handed out or online for people to find. And so yes, 21 could it be different -- it's an open question whether 22 that's what Congress wanted for Federal elections or not 23 or whether -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not just 25 different forms. You'd have different voter rolls then,

2 MS. MILLETT: No.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No?

4 MS. MILLETT: Oh, I'm sorry.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought

6 since you allow -- contemplate a State form that has

7 different requirements than the Federal form, you would

8 then end up with two different voter rolls.

9 MS. MILLETT: No --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some people that

11 registered under the State form, some people that

12 registered under the Federal form.

13 MS. MILLETT: As -- as of now, Arizona is

14 doing it as a unitary system. Because anyone who fills

15 out the State form necessarily satisfies the requirement

16 of the Federal form.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but it doesn't

18 work the other way.

19 MS. MILLETT: It doesn't work the other way.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can satisfy the

21 Federal form, so you're on the Federal list, but not

22 satisfy the State form, so you're not on the State list.

23 MS. MILLETT: It doesn't work the other way

24 at least for State elections. For Federal -- for

25 Federal elections, it has to be the same. And so for

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 49
1 Federal elections, there's a single roll. It's up to 2 States to decide how they want to deal with the State 3 form. At the time the Congress enacted this statute, 4 about half of the States in 1993, including Arizona, had 5 a postcard form where you just attested to citizenship 6 under oath. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Court of Appeals said 8 that there's a different preemption test under -- for 9 this law under this Constitutional provision than there 10 is under the Supremacy Clause. It seems to me that that 11 ignores the proposition that the State has a very strong 12 and vital interest in the integrity of its elections, 13 even when those, and perhaps especially when those are 14 elections of Federal officials. And it seems to me the 15 Ninth Circuit's new test did not give sufficient weight 16 to that interest. 17 MS. MILLETT: Well, first of all, the Ninth 18 Circuit's test came out of this Court's language in 19 Siebold. It had both conflict language and 20 harmonization, both of which appear in this Court's 21 decision in Siebold. But to get directly to your 22 question of whether there should be a different test, I 23 don't think it matters on the outcome in this case 24 because the preemption is in those 31,550 people who 25 couldn't register.

1 But, I think the Election Clause is going to 2 be very different in this sense -- in two critical 3 senses. And that is that the Elections Clause involves 4 an authority in the States that is conferred by the 5 Constitution itself. 6 May I finish? 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please. 8 MS. MILLETT: It -- it has no reserve power 9 that's being protected there, and by the very nature of 10 the Election Clause is that Congress only acts when it 11 means to displace or change what the States are doing. 12 And so the necessity of having a presumption makes no 13 sense in this context, particularly when you're talking 14 again about a Federal form for Federal elections of 15 Federal officials by Federal voters who need a direct 16 line of accountability. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 18 MS. MILLETT: Thank you. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Srinivasan? 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN, 21 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 22 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 23 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 24 Justice, and may it Please the Court: 25 The National Voter Registration Act aims to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 51
1 streamline the process of registration for applicants, 2 and the provisions that provide for the establishment of 3 a Federal form embody that objective. 4 And I'd like to point to three features of 5 the relevant statutory language that I think support our 6 reading. And the particular critical provision is at 7 page 22A of the appendix to the government's brief. And 8 I'm sorry, I know that the provisions are located in a 9 number of areas, but the gray brief at page 22A has the 10 critical provision in our view, which is one that 11 Ms. Millett was pointing to. And that's gg-7(b)(1). 12 Now, what this provision embodies is this 13 understanding: That the EAC is the one who determines 14 what the content of the Federal form is. Not the 15 States, but the EAC. The States do have a role in this 16 scheme, and I think it's important to understand what 17 that role is. 18 The States have a consultative role at the 19 front end. And this is back at page 21A -- I'm sorry 20 for skipping back. But at page 21A at the bottom of the 21 page, the EAC is to develop a form in consultation with 22 the chief election officers of the States. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Srinivasan, the problem 24 that I have with that is that the provision you're 25 alluding to says that -- not that the State shall  not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 52
1 that the commission "shall" require the information 2 necessary to enable the appropriate State election 3 official to assess eligibility, but it simply says that 4 it "may" require only that information. Now, is it 5 conceivable that Congress intended that the Commission 6 may not require some information that is necessary to 7 enable the appropriate State election official to assess 8 eligibility, but that the State may not require it 9 either? 10 Is that a conceivable disposition of 11 Congress? 12 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think it is, 13 Justice Scalia, but I think the problem with that is in 14 the premise. I grant you that the statute says "may 15 require," but it says "may require only," and I think 16 the only fair way to read this provision is that the 17 commission is to require the information that's 18 necessary, but -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think "may require 20 only" means shall require only? Is that -- is that your 21 submission? "May require only" means shall require 22 only? 23 MR. SRINIVASAN: It "may require only," in 24 effect, means shall require information that's 25 necessary, but may only require that information. I
Alderson Reporting Company

Page 53
1 think the statute would make very little sense if the 2 EAC discharged its statutory responsibility by having a 3 Federal form that required nothing other than the name. 4 That wouldn't be within anybody's conceivable conception 5 of a rational objective of Congress that would enable 6 the EAC to satisfy -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: It would not be a problem 8 if the State could require it. It would not be a 9 problem. When -- when the commission fails to do 10 what -- what enables the State to assess qualifications, 11 the State will do it. No problem. 12 MR. SRINIVASAN: But I think the whole point 13 of this, Justice Scalia -- and this is where I started, 14 with all due respect -- is to come forward with a 15 Federal form that streamlines the process of 16 registration for applicants. And if the regime that 17 resulted were one in which the Federal form served very 18 little purpose other than to set a floor, but then each 19 of the 50 States could superimpose whatever additional 20 requirements they wanted to, I think that would largely 21 defeat the entire purpose of the Federal form. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's the grand 23 purpose -- to go back to your -- I see that as your 24 grand purpose. That's the grand purpose argument. And 25 then there is the subsidiary purpose argument, which you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 54
1 started to make, which I wanted to hear, which has to do 2 with (b). It says may require only such identifying 3 information. So I thought, well, they could require 4 less, less than what's necessary. They could. It says 5 you can't require more. They could require less. 6 But suppose they put a statement in and they 7 say, in respect to this qualification, nothing to do 8 with citizenship: This is what is necessary. No more. 9 But we've done everything that is necessary. Then could 10 a State come along and say, we think more is necessary? 11 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Justice 12 Breyer. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's the word 14 "necessary" that you thought -- that that would be 15 dependent upon? 16 MR. SRINIVASAN: Coupled with the statutory 17 objective because what this provision says is that the 18 EAC, in consultation with the States, is supposed to 19 create a form that imposes the following burden on 20 individuals, on individuals. That's the key. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know I'm not -- I'm 22 just not quite -- the last step of what I wanted you to 23 think up was this -24 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: It does say "may require
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1 only" 

Page 55

2 MR. SRINIVASAN: Correct.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: -- "that which is

4 necessary." So if they said -- and this what is

5 necessary. Fine. Pretty tough for the State to say I'm

6 going to add some things. But the very next subsection

7 does use the words "shall include." So I wonder -- and

8 that has to do with citizenship. So I wonder if that is

9 a statement by Congress that in respect to citizenship,

10 that is what is necessary.

11 MR. SRINIVASAN: I do think that that's what

12 Congress contemplated was necessary, but it's not to the

13 exclusion of this, which is that if a State comes

14 forward to the EAC, which is a body that's charged with

15 responsibility for defining the contents of the Federal

16 form, and says we think something more is necessary.

17 Take a look at what we want to submit to you, and you

18 should amend the Federal form, or you should at least

19 amend our State-specific portion of the Federal form to

20 include this requirement in it, the EAC could make that

21 determination.

22 Congress made that responsibility --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Srinivasan, I think

24 General Horne told us that -- that the State did ask the

25 Commission, but the Commission had only two members; the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 56
1 Commission didn't act on it. Only the legal director. 2 So how could they get court review of an agency decision 3 that was never made? 4 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, Justice -- Justice 5 Ginsburg, to be clear, I don't -- I don't think General 6 Horne will disagree with this, the executive director 7 initially responded to the request by rejecting it, but 8 it did go to the full Commission, and at that point, 9 there was a fully-constituted Commission. The 10 Commission divided by a vote of 2-2. 11 And so in that instance, the Commission took 12 no action. But a 2-2 vote is a -- qualifies as a 13 rejection. And that is something that could -14 potentially could have been the subject of judicial 15 review. Now, I'm obviously not going to give away any 16 Federal defenses, but -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. And since you believe 18 that "may require only" means "shall require only," in 19 judicial review, the determination before the -- the Court 20 would be whether indeed this information is necessary to 21 enable the State to assess the qualifications, right? 22 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the district court here 24 certainly thought that was necessary. So you're going 25 to be in -- in bad shape -- the government is going to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1 be -- the next time somebody does challenge the

Page 57

2 Commission determination in court under the

3 Administrative Procedure Act.

4 MR. SRINIVASAN: I mean, obviously, I'd

5 respectfully disagree with that. I think we'll be in

6 perfectly good shape. And I think part of the reason is

7 that this -- requiring a statement under penalty of

8 perjury is the traditional way in which States enforce

9 their qualifications.

10 The legislative history shows that Congress

11 understood that that was the traditional way. What the

12 State seeks to do here is do something over and above

13 the traditional way to enforce qualifications.

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As -- as Louisiana

15 has done.

16 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, Louisiana is not --

17 is not citizenship-specific, Your Honor, as Ms. Millett

18 was pointing out --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's certainly

20 things that were not required on the Federal form.

21 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct. And that

22 was submitted to the EAC, and the EAC approved of it.

23 And I think that's the critical distinction here.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that

25 consistent with the statutory purpose to streamline

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1 registration?

Page 58

2 MR. SRINIVASAN: Because the statute -- the

3 statute seeks to streamline registration, but it's not

4 an objective to the exclusion of all other objectives.

5 And the EAC is charged with balancing the various

6 competing statutory objectives. And it concluded in 

7 with respect to the Louisiana submission -- that that one

8 was okay. I do think that's different. A, because the

9 EAC approved of it; and B, because the specific forms of

10 identification that are outlined in Louisiana addition

11 were exactly those forms of identification that Congress

12 already said was okay at either the registration stage

13 or the voting stage.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You got to stop saying the

15 Commission approved of it. 2-2 is not approving. You

16 could say the Commission was unable to disapprove of it.

17 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think we are

18 talking about two different things, Justice Scalia. I'm

19 talking about Louisiana.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21 MR. SRINIVASAN: I was trying to answer the

22 Chief Justice's question.

23 In Arizona, it was 2-2.

24 Now, I want to point out one other critical

25 feature of the statute, and General Horne alluded to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 59
1 this and said that there's no way to look in the statute 2 and see a distinction between on one hand what the 3 individuals can be required to provide, and on the other 4 hand what the State can then do with the individual 5 information to crosscheck it. 6 And the statute presupposes that the State 7 can conduct its own investigation to crosscheck the 8 information that the individual supplies. And maybe the 9 critical provision to see that is at page 19A of the 10 appendix to the government's brief. And that's a 11 provision that deals with a different qualification, 12 felony history. But it operates on this assumption that 13 States can conduct their own investigation, which makes 14 all the sense in the world. 15 This one -- this provision that's in 16 subsection (g) at the top of the page, which is 1973 17 gg-6(g), what this does is it tells the United States 18 Attorney's Offices that when there is a Federal 19 conviction of a felony, the U.S. Attorney's Offices are 20 supposed to give written notice of that conviction to 21 the chief State election official. 22 And what's the State -- chief State election 23 official going to do with that? Well of course, what 24 they're going to do is they're going to take a look at 25 the Federal form, they're going to see what the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 60
1 individual said about their felony history, and they're 2 going to crosscheck it  against the information that 3 they got from the United States Attorney -- to make sure 4 that the information on the form is accurate. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you a question 6 that I asked Ms. Millett? Does the United States think 7 that the Arizona form is illegal? And if it is not, 8 what sense does it make to have a system in which 9 whether or not someone will successfully register 10 depends on the happenstance of the particular form that 11 the person fills out. 12 MR. SRINIVASAN: Here is the sense it would 13 make -- even if -- if Arizona had the authority to add 14 to the Federal requirements on its own State form, the 15 sense it would make is this: That the Federal form 16 always operates as a floor. 17 It's always there for somebody to use to 18 register, regardless of what the State form might do in 19 addition. And that has -- I take Your Honor's 20 assumption -- if I can just briefly finish -- I 21 understand Your Honor's point that there is a practical 22 question about whether that would ever be practical or 23 useful, given that an individual will want to use the 24 State form for State, local and Federal elections, but 25 there is also the -- the well-understood practice of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 61
1 organizations that go out to register individuals to 2 vote. 3 And they can use the Federal form, and the 4 Federal form would suffice. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 6 General Horne, two minutes. 7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. HORNE: Thank you, Your Honor, and I'll 10 apologize in advance for talking really quickly. The -11 my friend says in discussing Section 7(b)(1) that it 12 would not be rational to require only the signature. 13 But that's exactly what they did. All they required was 14 the signature, and 7(b)(1) has nothing to do with that; 15 7(b)(2) requires a signature. So what the EAC chose to 16 do under 7(b)(1) was exactly nothing, zero, which -17 which emphasizes the point that this is the 18 responsibility of the States, and that's how they 19 understood it. 20 With respect to the license having -- we 21 cited ARS Section 28-3173, an Arizona statute in our 22 reply brief that provides that you -- you must renew 23 every 12 years. So by 2004, the problem that my friend 24 spoke about was completely erased. Everybody had a new 25 license which would be sufficient for this purpose, 100

1 percent.

Page 62

2 They admit that we can reject applications

3 by reference to other -- by reference to other

4 documentation, but they try to draw a distinction

5 between that and asking the person to write down the

6 driver's license number. But there is nothing in the

7 statute that justifies that distinction. A reference to

8 criminal history has nothing to do with -- with whether

9 or not there is a distinction with respect to

10 citizenship between looking at other documents and

11 asking the person for their driver's license numbers.

12 In both cases, it's something outside of the form and

13 they have admitted we can go outside the form.

14 With respect to legislative history, Your

15 Honor, I think the key thing -- Mr. Justice Breyer, in

16 your question was, it's only in one place. There are a

17 lot of other places that go the other way. So we cannot

18 conclude from that one place what the majority of

19 Congress expected.

20 With respect to HAVA, in HAVA, the Congress

21 had another opportunity to expressly state that the

22 State could not look to external evidence and ask for

23 additional evidence, and they chose not to do that. And

24 so I would say that HAVA is further evidence that

25 Congress was not choosing to prohibit us from asking for

1 additional information to fulfill our function, if it's 2 necessary, of being sure that the applicant is eligible 3 to vote. 4 With respect to the Siebold case, the court 5 in Siebold specifically said there will be no preemption 6 unless there is a direct conflict and only to the extent 7 of that conflict, and in that connection -- one last 8 sentence, Your Honor -- if there are two plausible 9 interpretations, ordinary principles of Federalism say 10 one should not choose the interpretation that results in 11 preemption, and the same thing applies with respect to 12 the canon of constitutional accordance. 13 Thank you, Your Honor. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 15 The case is submitted. 16 (Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in the 17 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
