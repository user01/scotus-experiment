The South Carolina procedure is that the -- a jury is instructed to determine first whether any statutory aggravating circumstance is shown.  This is a Georgia-type nonweighing statute in which the finding of an aggravator is a threshold finding.  The jury is instructed, pursuant to the statute, and this jury was instructed that if the jury does not unanimously find the existence of a statutory aggravating factor, it goes no further. It does not sentence.  It simply reports its failure to find the aggravator to the judge, and the judge were simply told --"

Prior to that time, they don't need to know about parole.  They don't need to know about aggravation, mitigation.  They don't need to know anything."

Kelly, in which the court finally explained its rationale -- this is the State supreme court -- for this holding. It said in Kelly that where another sentence other than life without parole was available to the defendant as an alternative to the death penalty -- this is at page 11 of the slip opinion -- then a Simmons charge would actually mislead the jury by representing that the defendant would never be released from prison, when, in fact, a 30-year sentence is a potential sentence for the defendant. Now, it's clear what has happened.  This explanation doesn't appear in the Shafer case or in the accompanying Starnes case, but now apparently the South Carolina supreme court is laboring under the misconception The -- it's quite clear, I think, that Justice Kennedy's plurality opinion in Ramdass, which we quoted in our brief and, indeed, in the question presented in the cert petition, three times stated the holding of Simmons in a way that precisely encompasses this case. He said, the parole eligibility instruction is -- of Simmons is required only when, assuming the jury fixes the sentence at life, the defendant is ineligible for parole under State law.  Simmons applies elsewhere in the opinion only to instances where, as a legal matter, there is no possibility of parole if the jury decides the appropriate sentence is life imprisonment, and I can go on. That is the holding of Simmons.  That is the holding which was clearly violated in this case and which, according to the South Carolina supreme court, no longer this case, they would not have gone to such a constitutionally tenuous attempt to reconsider the first --"

By our count there are 37 States that have a policy, statute, arguable distinction in Pennsylvania that does not apply in South Carolina, a way of distinguishing the two States, which is that in Pennsylvania aggravation is limited. This Court knows the statute from Blystone v. Pennsylvania.  Only designated statutory aggravating factors may be considered as reasons to impose the death penalty, and future dangerousness is not one of them, so in theory there is nowhere for the jury to give aggravating weight to the likely dangerous behavior of the defendant.  Nevertheless, when the argument is made, the State supreme court has required that a Simmons instruction be given. That is the entire roster of States that don't just tell the jury what's going to happen if they spare this man's life, so as I say, this is an issue, a debate which is really to all intents and purposes virtually going to get out or not because he was dangerous.  Parole is relevant because of future dangerousness, and that is probably what was happening. The prosecutor's evidence, his case of dangerousness, did resonate with this jury, which is entirely to be expected.

It was a victims' impact statement in a phrase as to what exact had -- exactly had occurred at the time.  They testified about what occurred with them, and we think that that was fair comment.  It was not comment representation that those, in fact, suggested that he would be a future threat.

They look, in the same way we submit the South Carolina supreme court has been looking, as to whether in fact future dangerousness is there. In fact, I believe the Pennsylvania supreme court says future dangerousness has to be specifically pointed out to the jury for that argument to in fact come in, so Pennsylvania would be also directly affected by whether that future dangerousness --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Your opponent tells us that South Carolina and Pennsylvania are the only two States who are sort of the rear guard against giving the Simmons instruction.  Just so you have a fair opportunity, would you tell what is the State's interest that's really served which may not in fact ever occur, that in fact the life in prison that they would get with the jury sentence, whether it's parole-eligible or not, may, in fact, under the unique characteristics of this defendant, be as much as a life sentence whether there's parole eligibility or not, that he would serve the entire time in prison. Again, addressing one of the questions about the existence of pardon, pardon exists in South Carolina. It's not in the hands of the Governor.  It's in the hands of the South Carolina Department of Probation and Parole. They make that determination, so that also does exist as soon as a conviction is entered on any inmate in South Carolina."

    "speaker": "ZELENKA",
    "speech": "I suppose that a State could game the system, couldn't it, by providing for parole eligibility even when there is a life imprisonment happens, because the parole board may be such that it would never parole.  There may be a parole board that always paroles, but again there's -- they're elected every 4 years, essentially, in South Carolina and that may change every 4 years, so we can't predict how that situation would arise any more than pardon, any more than a change of law. We submit that the instructions that were given in this case adequately complied with South Carolina law. Further, if -- we also submit that in fact what occurred in this case should be seen to satisfy Simmons because, as I said, the jury was instructed on three occasions that life imprisonment in fact means until death of the offender, that life imprisonment in fact means incarceration until the death of the offender.  That is not the -- of the statute, which would have made it plain what that meant."

    "speaker": "ZELENKA",
    "speech": "Well, consistent with South Carolina law they said that parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration, but that followed the language that life imprisonment means until the death of the offender.  We think a juror should have way that answer was made, and the judge was complying with the South Carolina law mandate on that, but also the jury did not appear to be confused because, consistent with this Court's opinion in Weeks v. Angelone, they're presumed to follow their oath and instructions, and they did not come back and ask a further question after they received that information. The defense counsel was not prevented from making his argument that the defendant, in fact, would serve life in prison, in jail.  In fact, it's clear that with the information the defense counsel made, they stated, and it's set forth at page 39 and 40 of our brief, that the question is, will the State execute him, or will he just die in prison?  We ask that he be able to spend his natural life there.  Life in prison until death. Wesley Shafer is going to prison and staying there."

In the record of this case that you have here, issue of it and the instruction was very often given. But now, the South Carolina supreme court has made quite clear that except in very rare cases involving a recidivist statute that's almost never invoked, the life-without-parole section of the statute will never be given unless this Court rules otherwise under the Simmons case. The last thing I want to say is that the near-unanimity of the States on this issue really does demonstrate, I think, a paradigmatic example of a due process violation, where the considered judgments of the American people on this claim, as expressed through their courts and legislatures, is already quite, quite clear. Now, I had thought that Simmons was also clear as to what the Due Process Clause required, but clearly in South Carolina it is not clear enough, so I would hope"

I recall Mr. Banks, defense counsel, saying that he wanted to read that to the jury, but I can't put my finger on it right now.  If I may, I will file a letter with the Clerk giving the citation if, in fact, my recollection is correct. And for those reasons we hope that the Court will take up all of the issues presented by this case and will reverse the death sentence imposed."
