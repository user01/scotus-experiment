1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in 06-84, Safeco Insurance Company 5 versus Burr, and 06-100, GEICO General Insurance Company 6 versus Edo. 7 Ms. Mahoney. 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 10 MS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 11 please the Court: 12 I'd like to turn first to the Ninth 13 Circuit's interpretation of the term "willfully" and its 14 determination that the case had to be remanded for 15 further proceedings to permit an opportunity to explore 16 Petitioners' communications with their counsel. We ask 17 this Court to find that there is no necessity for any 18 such inquiry for waivers of attorney-client privilege 19 because summary judgment should have been affirmed in 20 this case. 21 Petitioners and their counsel, if you think 22 about what communications you might find, they could not 23 have known anything more about these statutory issues of 24 first impression than the district court did. It's 25 questions of law. And if the district court's opinion
4

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 does not reflect reckless disregard for the law, for the 2 reading of the statute, then it would be inappropriate 3 to characterize Petitioners' adoption of the very same 4 views as either a knowing or reckless violation of the, 5 of the FCRA. 6 The first -- the Ninth Circuit nevertheless 7 reached a contrary conclusion, and said it was time to 8 go ahead and look at privileged communications if the 9 Petitioners wanted to defend the case, because they made 10 self-interpretive errors about the meaning of willfully. 11 And the first is that they read willfully in 12 this setting to mean recklessly, and relied on several 13 cases where this Court has read the term willfully in 14 civil statutes to mean recklessly. 15 But this Court has said repeatedly that the 16 word willfully is contextual, that you have to look at 17 all of the sections of the statute to see how it's used 18 to determine whether it means with knowledge that your 19 conduct violates the law, or whether reckless violations 20 are sufficient. And in this particular statute, unlike 21 the other three that were at issue, Congress has used 22 the term willfully in other sections of the law to mean, 23 as Plaintiffs concede, that the Defendant knows that 24 their conduct violates the Act. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's also used in the
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 phrase "knowing and willfully." That appears in several 2 other parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any 3 sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing. 4 MS. MAHONEY: Well, it actually says 5 "willfully and knowingly --" 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: In one formulation or 7 another, but it combines the two words, knowing and 8 willful. 9 MS. MAHONEY: Well, this Court, though, has 10 held that willfully and knowingly, when that phrase is 11 used together, it's been discussed in a number of cases 12 including Dixon recently, that it means -- willfully 13 means knowledge that the conduct violates the law, and 14 knowingly means knowledge of the relevant facts. And 15 that would make perfect sense in this setting, and so 16 the term willfully when, again, used -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean willfully alone? 18 MS. MAHONEY: It -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where it -- where 20 it means what you think it means, which is knowingly, 21 that does not mean knowing the facts? If you mistake 22 the facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the 23 facts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law? 24 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, in Ratzlaf, the 25 phrase was willfully, not willfully and knowingly, and
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the Court held that it meant that you knew that your 2 conduct violated the law. And that seems to be the most 3 reasonable reading here because if you look, there are 4 also sections of Section 1681n that refer to knowing 5 conduct, and that would require the conclusion that 6 Congress used willfully in this section to mean a -- a 7 less -- a more -- a less culpable mens rea than 8 knowingly. And that's -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you're 10 the CEO of your company, and a lawyer -- Federal counsel 11 comes in and says we've got a real issue under the Fair 12 Credit Reporting Act, I need to brief you on that, we 13 need to make an important decision about whether we are 14 complying, you say I don't want to hear about it, I 15 don't want to know about it. That would not be 16 willfully violating the statute? 17 MS. MAHONEY: Well, under -- some cases have 18 suggested that there could be a willful blindness 19 instruction that would govern whether you define that as 20 knowing or not. Certainly -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't have 22 to be actual knowledge? 23 MS. MAHONEY: I think that the best reading 24 of knowingly is actual knowledge or something that is, 25 that is everything but, you know, that really is --

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: How about reckless 2 disregard? 3 MS. MAHONEY: Well, conscious disregard is a 4 recklessness standard, and even if the Ninth Circuit 5 correctly determined that this should be interpreted as 6 a recklessness standard, this Court has defined 7 recklessness to mean that it has to be conscious 8 disregard, actual knowledge of a high risk of, of -- of 9 harm or in this case illegality. And in these 10 circumstances, you can't say that there was a high risk 11 of illegality because what the district court found is 12 that the Petitioners' interpretations of the statute 13 were actually not only reasonable, but correct, and 14 having -15 JUSTICE ALITO: Since the term knowingly or 16 knowing appears in two places in 1681n, can't we infer 17 from that that willfully in that provision also means 18 something different? 19 MS. MAHONEY: I think the way it's used, it 20 says knowing, knowingly that they did not have a 21 permissible purpose. Permissible purpose, that may not 22 be knowledge of the law, it just may be knowledge that 23 your purpose wasn't permissible. And even if they were 24 using it -25 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought the statute says
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 what the permissible purposes are. 2 MS. MAHONEY: It does, but it doesn't 3 necessarily mean that the individual knew precisely what 4 the statute said. Because for instance, users are told 5 what the permissible purposes are when they get a credit 6 report from, from a credit agency. But more 7 importantly, Your Honor, I think that the use of the 8 term knowingly there can also be explained. 9 If you look at Section 1681h, it actually 10 provides that certain tort actions cannot proceed unless 11 there is a willful intent to injure, except as provided 12 in Section 1681n, and they are the same kinds of actions 13 that are carved out in 1681n. 14 And so I think it was to make clear, I think 15 it was to make clear that you didn't have to have a 16 willful intent to injure. So even if they meant it to 17 be interchangeable with a knowing violation of the law 18 there, I think there was a reason for it, it wasn't just 19 surplusage. It was to clarify that they didn't have to 20 have a willful intent to violate. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Would you say it's all 22 right to use the model penal code definition of 23 reckless, which is basically what you -- taking it here, 24 you would have to consciously disregard a substantial 25 and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MS. MAHONEY: That's correct, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: If you come across anything 3 that would use that, I mean "reckless" itself is 4 unclear. The model penal code tried to clarify it based 5 on this Court's opinions primarily. 6 MS. MAHONEY: But I think you can look to 7 the way this Court described recklessness in Farmer vs. 8 Brennan as well, though, as well as -9 JUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference? 10 MS. MAHONEY: The difference is just, there 11 is two forms of recklessness. One which says that if 12 the risk is sufficiently high, if a person should have 13 known, you could be -- you could be liable. But that 14 the form of recklessness that Congress presumably used 15 here in this setting, where there is the potential for 16 very punitive sanctions, was what is referred to -17 Farmer versus Brennan calls it "criminal," the criminal 18 recklessness standard. 19 And that means that not only do you have to 20 have an objectively high risk of illegality, but you 21 must be actually conscious of that risk. But in this 22 case, you don't even need to get to the issue of 23 consciousness. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you said there is no 25 way they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 I mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers. 2 They know there's risk that this is unlawful. 3 MS. MAHONEY: The question is -4 JUSTICE BREYER: But consciousness, I mean, 5 maybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't 6 know that that would help you. 7 MS. MAHONEY: I think the issue of conscious 8 -- the risk, though, it has to be a high risk. And if 9 it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, or 10 even if it is an interpretation of the statute that is 11 fairly debatable, that you have a fair chance of 12 success, then how can you say that is a high risk of 13 illegality, so high that we should say that Congress 14 wanted to sanction you for taking that position? 15 And for saying that, you know, you shouldn't 16 be permitted to adopt a compliance program if there was 17 a fair ground for believing that it was lawful. And 18 here what the Ninth Circuit did -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose there is a fair 20 ground for believing it was lawful. Lawyers are in 21 disagreement, but in fact, I believe the lawyers who say 22 it is unlawful, and I nonetheless go ahead and do it. 23 Is that a willful violation? 24 MS. MAHONEY: I don't, I don't think so, 25 Your Honor, if, in fact, it was a fair ground for -- -
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: But I think I'm violating. 2 MS. MAHONEY: I don't -- yes. But you 3 couldn't know you were violating it, and because if it 4 really is a fair ground for litigation -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm a better lawyer than my 6 advisors. 7 (Laughter.) 8 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think if it's an 9 area where the law is truly unsettled. And here an 10 issue of first impression, a lawyer's assessment that 11 you may lose is inherently predictive. These are not 12 true or false answers when there is almost nothing to go 13 on. 14 And so in that area, it's much like what 15 this Court did in Screws, where it said that this was a 16 case involving a willful violation of, or interference 17 with rights secured by -- by Federal law. And what the 18 Court says, well, it's not just any bad purpose that 19 Congress had in mind, it is a bad purpose to defy 20 announced rules of law. They have to be, there has to 21 be sufficient clarity in the law to say that there was a 22 high risk of illegality that you could disregard. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you look to the 24 subjective intent of the actor at all? 25 MS. MAHONEY: Only --
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or would you just look to 2 the outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close 3 question, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in 4 violation, it was a close question; it's okay? 5 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think you would look 6 at the intent until you found that there -- there was no 7 reasonable ground or at least no, no -- no fair ground 8 for debate about the question. And at that point, Your 9 Honor, if there was an objectively high risk of 10 illegality, then you do have to ask, what were they 11 consciously aware of; what did they do? 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I must say that -- that is 13 not the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating 14 the law. 15 MS. MAHONEY: Well, I think in Screws -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're changing it to mean 17 willfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law. 18 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if I know that what 20 I'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a 21 close question, it seems to me I am willfully violating 22 the law. 23 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, Screws says you 24 can't know the unknowable. And if the law, if it's 25 really, truly an issue of first impression, you may
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 think you're violating the law, but you -- you can't 2 know the unknowable. And that's why this setting is so 3 important, because you can't, you know, put -- impose 4 sanctions. Here we're talking about the potential for 5 an industry facing billions of dollars without any 6 actual harm to -- to individuals. And that -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it really billions? 8 How many of these have been certified as class actions? 9 MS. MAHONEY: I believe that there are two 10 certified class actions. But many -- there are many 11 cases pending and it could be billions of dollars, Your 12 Honor. Certainly if the classes are certified, and -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you, would you, as 14 representative of the insurers, would you have a sound 15 objection to class action certification in these cases? 16 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I'm sure there 17 would be some bases to resist. But classes have been 18 certified, so I -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And gone to, gone to 20 judgment? 21 MS. MAHONEY: I do not believe any have gone 22 to judgment, but I don't, I don't -- I think that the 23 point is that if you allow a thousand dollar penalty or 24 the potential for a thousand dollar penalty for every 25 consumer who didn't get a notice, simply because they
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 may have gotten a better price if they had even better 2 credit, across the country, if you interpret the statute 3 that way, and then you can say you can get this thousand 4 dollar, what is in essence a penalty, and you multiply 5 that by the number of consumers, then you certainly have 6 the potential for very, very substantial liability. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a question how many 8 will sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation 9 costs. 10 MS. MAHONEY: Well, given that these are 11 proceeding as class actions, the answer is there is 12 plenty on the line to incentivize plaintiffs' attorneys 13 to bring these class actions, and they have been 14 brought, and this is a class action. There are two 15 class actions. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They haven't -- neither 17 has been certified, has it? 18 MS. MAHONEY: No, it has not. They are 19 putative class actions, Your Honor. But I, but I think 20 that whether it's a class action or not, we have to look 21 at what did, what did Congress presumably have in mind 22 when it authorized these kinds of penalties and punitive 23 damages based on a willful violation in a technical area 24 where there is no potential for harm? And certainly -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have just two, two
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 questions on, on willful and then -- because you may 2 want to talk about the other issue in the case. First, 3 you began by saying that here a district judge has come 4 to the contrary conclusion; by definition, it can't be 5 reckless. Do you have any authority, where we -- for 6 that proposition, where we have said that? 7 MS. MAHONEY: Well -8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We find all the time that 9 a right is not clearly established under AEDPA, and so 10 forth -- and disregard what I just said. That's my 11 first question. 12 And the second is willfully, as Screws 13 itself makes very clear, it is interpreted differently 14 in the criminal context than it is in the civil context. 15 MS. MAHONEY: Except Screws, Your Honor, 16 actually says that it was adopting a criminal 17 recklessness standard, not a knowing standard, but a 18 reckless standard. And that is the same standard that 19 has been applied in the civil cases that use willfully 20 in the punitive damages context. 21 So I think it's exactly the same standard in 22 that Screws does say that the, you can't have, it can't 23 just be a bad purpose, that it has to have been a bad 24 purpose to violate clearly defined rules. And this 25 Court has said in various contexts in the, in the
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 qualified immunity area that picking the losing side 2 does not mean that your conduct was objectively, you 3 know, wrongful. 4 And that's really -- I think that there is 5 great significance to the district court's ruling. I'm 6 not saying that in every case, it would absolutely be 7 dispositive. I think you have to look at what was the, 8 you know, the clarity of the law, what was the reasoning 9 of the district court. But what the Ninth Circuit did 10 is that it, in essence, said that you can't rely on 11 creative but unlikely answers to issues of first 12 impression. 13 Well, if an administration official goes to 14 a lawyer in the administration and asks about a course 15 of conduct, and is told, well, it's completely an issue 16 of first impression, there is probably a 40 percent 17 chance of success, do you say it's reckless to proceed 18 on that basis? 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just because 20 an issue is one of first impression doesn't mean there's 21 a high degree of uncertainty. The statute may be 22 clearly addressed to that issue. It hasn't come up 23 before. 24 MS. MAHONEY: Absolutely, Your Honor. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: First impression.
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MS. MAHONEY: It certainly -- this Court has 2 made clear that if the language of the statute is very 3 plain, then, of course, that can be noticed, that can be 4 adequate warning. But certainly this statute doesn't 5 satisfy that standard. Congress didn't provide the 6 benchmarks that you have to use for comparison to 7 determine whether there has been an increase in a charge 8 or whether there has been an adverse action based on the 9 consumer report. You need benchmarks to answer those 10 questions, and there aren't any regulations and there 11 were no cases. 12 If I could save the balance of my time for 13 rebuttal. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 15 Ms. Millett. 16 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT, 17 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 18 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 19 please the Court: 20 The Court of Appeals correctly concluded 21 that willfulness in the civil context, as is used here, 22 includes a reckless disregard component or a 23 recklessness component. That is what this Court has 24 held in a number of cases that have similar uses of 25 willfulness focused on a departure from the law, have
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 held. Thurston, Richland Shoe and Hazen Paper are the 2 three that have been most discussed in the case, in the 3 papers here. 4 But where the Ninth Circuit misstepped here 5 was in the application of that standard. And in 6 particular, we agreed with Petitioners that when it 7 concluded that a creative but unlikely position 8 constitutes recklessness, it erred. Recklessness speaks 9 an extreme deviation from an ordinary standard of care. 10 It requires that the defendant act in the face of or 11 fail to act -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: It is a subjective 13 standard or an objective standard? 14 MS. MILLETT: It has both in this context. 15 It is, I think, first and foremost, an objective 16 component, because there is -- this is a civil case. 17 It's not purely subjective. And that objective 18 component is very important because that is what makes 19 the act or inaction reckless, and that is the risk. 20 There has to be an objectively high and obvious risk. 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: So if the potential 22 liability, as in these cases, is huge, then you have to 23 be even more careful because there is liability so 24 great. So is it the greater the liability -- the 25 greater chance of recklessness, the greater the
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 potential liability? 2 MS. MILLETT: No, to the extent you're 3 talking about dollar liability, I don't think that's 4 true. I do think it's fair to say that in recklessness 5 generally in the tort law, the more serious an injury 6 that could result, can -- we'll tolerate less risk. If 7 the risk is causing serious bodily injury or death to 8 somebody, we'll -- the law will tolerate a lesser degree 9 of risk than it will if, if it's simply causing, you 10 know, a delay in something or a sort of paper injury or 11 maybe even a dollar injury. 12 And it's not set. It's a variable 13 calculation. So in that sense, it is. I don't think 14 that when we talk about a high and objective risk in 15 this context, we are talking about the dollars that a, 16 that a company would have to pay, although I'm sure they 17 are interested in hearing about that from their lawyers. 18 What we are talking about here -- and this 19 is a very unusual statute the way it's written -- the 20 liability itself, not just the damages, but the 21 liability itself turns upon the extent of departure from 22 law. You have to -- there is no recovery here like 23 there is in almost -- or commonly in Federal statutes 24 for just a violation. That isn't it. 25 You have to show either a willful violation
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 or a negligent violation, and that requires a 2 determination not only that the defendants violated the 3 law, but a determination as to how much, how far, how 4 many standard deviations from correct their position was 5 and that is an objective determination. 6 Once an objectively high risk has been found 7 by a court, then -- then the case can shift to looking 8 into subjective things. I think a plaintiff would be 9 entitled, once an objectively high and obvious risk has 10 been found by the court, to rely on that, and allow a 11 jury to, or a judge, whoever is deciding the case, to 12 infer the existence of willfulness from that. And 13 that's often when defendants -- I'm sorry. 14 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I also ask, do you 15 agree with the Petitioner on the meaning of adverse 16 action? 17 MS. MILLETT: No, we agree with Respondents 18 on the meaning of adverse action. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Correct me if I'm 20 wrong. You think if I have an insurance policy, I'm 21 paying a certain rate, they look at my credit report and 22 they say, you know, good news, we're going to lower your 23 rates, that's an adverse action because they might have 24 lowered the rates even further if they had notified me 25 about the credit report and there were some errors in
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it? 2 MS. MILLETT: Right. It's a complicated 3 answer, in part because that assumes that you have an 4 existing account and you're not an initial account here. 5 And when you have an existing account, there's a 6 definition of adverse action for insurance provisions, 7 but in iv there is a separate, there's another 8 definition, and this is on, on page -- sorry. Excuse 9 me. On page 3A of the appendix to our brief, iv under 10 big I -- I'm sorry, there's a lot of provisions -- talks 11 about reviewing an existing account, and it 12 cross-referenced another provision which talks about 13 reviewing an account for purposes of termination. And 14 that would include, in our view, not only completely 15 canceling it, but terminating the existing and charging 16 you more for allowing you now to pay a new rate. So 17 which would govern in that particular context is a 18 little bit harder. 19 But it could, and here's logically why, 20 because I think the understanding of "increase" that's 21 at issue here is one that's very basic to the operation 22 of this statute, and that is, did the content of your 23 information in your credit report, if it had been 24 better, could you have had a better rate or a better 25 deal.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 2 MS. MILLETT: So have you been hit in the 3 pocketbook. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they lower, if 5 they lower the rates, you still say that that fits the 6 meaning of adverse action because they might have 7 lowered them further if the information hadn't been 8 erroneous? 9 MS. MILLETT: It could have, and here -- in 10 this sense, it could be: In the same way that I, sort 11 of the flip side, but in my office, if everybody in the 12 hallway gets a 5 percent salary increase and I only get 13 a 1 percent salary increase, I am certainly better off, 14 but if the reason I got a lesser increase is because of 15 my gender or because of my credit report, it's an 16 adverse action. So the fact that you're doing somewhat 17 better doesn't mean -18 JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't how the statute 19 defines it. 20 MS. MILLETT: Excuse me? 21 JUSTICE BREYER: The statute says an adverse 22 action is an increase in a charge for -- in connection 23 with underwriting. 24 MS. MILLETT: But it also -25 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what it says. And
23
Alderson Reporting Company

1 then it says an increase is -- and if you take an 2 adverse action, i.e., if you increase it, and your 3 increase is based in whole or in part on information 4 contained in a consumer report, you have to send the 5 thing. How did you get -- in your example, there was no 6 increase. I mean, in a charge. In your salary, it's a 7 decrease in the salary. Same thing. 8 MS. MILLETT: The definition again on 3A 9 includes not just increase, but includes an unfavorable 10 change in the terms. And so it's not settled whether -11 JUSTICE BREYER: You mean unfavorable change 12 in terms, unfavorable change in terms. 13 MS. MILLETT: Exactly. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose you don't 15 have, you don't have any terms because you never did it 16 before. There's no change in terms. 17 MS. MILLETT: If you're a new customer -18 and again, I want to reiterate that, how this applies to 19 existing accounts is complicated -20 JUSTICE BREYER: You mean those words 21 "change in terms" refer to rates, in other words? 22 That's a rather odd way to refer to it. In one place, 23 you refer to an "increase"; in the other place, you'd 24 refer to it as a "change in terms." That's sort of an 25 odd way to write a statute.

It could be 3 you will no longer be entitled to a free rental car when 4 your car is in for repair for some reason. That's not 5 an increase. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I understand that. 7 But what we're after is this. Everybody has a credit 8 report, just about. You put it in and you give people 9 the best possible rate conceivable, and now, how do you 10 know that maybe there could have still been a better 11 rate? And it can't be that the statute intends you to 12 send out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to 13 send notices whenever you read a credit report. Now, I 14 think that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's 15 basically the argument. So what's your response? 16 MS. MILLETT: And Justice Breyer, my 17 response is that if the content of the information in 18 your credit report would have made you -- had it been 19 better information you'd have gotten a better rate, a 20 better result, your pocketbook wouldn't have been hit as 21 hard, you have a dollars and cents injury because of the 22 content of the information, then you had an adverse 23 action. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so your response is 25 just to repeat my question and say that's right?

1 MS. MILLETT: No. If I could continue on 2 that, if I could add on, if I could add on, the way 3 insurance companies work is they don't have 3 million 4 customers and 3 million rates. They have ranges and 5 most of them will have a top tier. They may have 6 specialized things for employees, but putting aside a 7 specialized category, there's a top range and they will 8 tell you, as they say in the briefs, that 10 to 15 9 percent of people fit in there. So they know what the 10 best rate is. They know what the next, above average 11 rate, the standard rate. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you fit, how do you 13 fit that within the language of the statute? Is it, I 14 fail -- you're a first- time customer and I fail to give 15 you a, you know, a break that maybe you could have had. 16 Is it a denial or cancellation of insurance? No. Is it 17 an increase in, an increase in any charge for insurance? 18 Is it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change 19 in the terms of coverage or in the amount of any 20 insurance? I find it hard to shoehorn your case into 21 that language. 22 MS. MILLETT: Well, to begin with, that may 23 be why Petitioners' position here certainly was not 24 reckless and the Ninth Circuit erred. But we do think 25 that the statutory language read as a whole supports
26

1 this. It could be a denial of a particular term in an 2 insurance contract. But you have to look at -- it's 3 important to understand you look -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I read the term as, as one 5 of the Justices here does, not referring to the rate. 6 The earlier part refers to the rate. An increase in any 7 charge for, that's the rate. And then it speaks of 8 change in the terms of coverage. I mean, that is, you 9 know, whether it covers hurricanes, or in the amount of 10 the insurance, whether you're insured for -11 MS. MILLETT: Or it could be a reduction in 12 the terms. I mean, these things are statutory 13 construction issues to be litigated, and the important 14 issue here -- and they are presented in this case. 15 They're to be litigated and the important issue is that 16 when there is fair debate about these issues insurance 17 companies will not be held to be willfully violating the 18 statute if they got the answer wrong. 19 But I think on the, on the substantive 20 question, it's important to read "adverse action" in 21 light of, if I could just finish the sentence, in light 22 of the definition of when a notice is required to be 23 issued, which turns upon the content of the information 24 in the report. 25 Thank you.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is where? 2 MS. MILLETT: And that's on page 6a on our 3 appendix. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 6 Mr. Shorr. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. SHORR 8 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 9 MR. SHORR: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 10 please the Court: 11 When Congress intended to require a knowing 12 violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it expressly 13 said so. It did not do so in connection with the claims 14 here under Section 1681n(a)(1)(A). In each instance 15 where Congress wanted to allow -- to require a higher 16 mens rea, it said so and did so in connection with 17 liability that was greater. They required knowing mens 18 rea for the criminal provision. They required knowing 19 mens rea to obtain the even higher statutory damages 20 that are available under the act. 21 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say to the 22 argument from drafting history that looks at the history 23 both of little n and little o and it points out that as 24 originally, in the original bill, little o providing for 25 the actual damages required a finding of gross
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 negligence? Little n used the word "willful" just as it 2 does now, suggesting that willful would not include 3 gross negligence or something close to gross negligence 4 like recklessness. Then in, then in o, they changed the 5 standard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but 6 they made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed 7 whatever it always was, and if the argument from 8 contrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than 9 reckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was 10 changed to negligence in o. What do you say to that 11 argument? 12 MR. SHORR: Justice Souther, I think the 13 only thing we can say about that is Congress reduced the 14 culpability for the actual damages from gross negligence 15 to negligence. I don't think that tells us much about 16 willful means, what willful means as a separate matter. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the fact that they had 18 originally drafted n as it is, in contrast to the 19 original o, does tell us, doesn't it, something about 20 what they had in mind in n. And they must have had 21 something in mind, probably had in mind, something in n 22 which was a standard higher than gross negligence. 23 MR. SHORR: No, Justice Souter, I suggest 24 that what you can infer from that is that, if anything, 25 is perhaps Congress wanted to move, make clear that
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 under o the actual damages aren't close to willful or 2 reckless, so they reduced gross negligence to negligence 3 in that circumstance. But that still doesn't tell us 4 separately what "willful" meant, and of course "willful" 5 had been interpreted by this Court in similar cases 6 involving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless 7 disregard. And I respectfully disagree with -8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, there's no 9 question it has been and that is sort of the usual 10 reading in the civil context. But we also keep 11 repeating, you know, "willful" is a word of many 12 meanings and you always look to the context. And here 13 the argument is that if you look to the context of the, 14 of the two statutory sections right up next to each 15 other, you can draw a, an inference about what "willful" 16 means. 17 MR. SHORR: I think if anything, Justice 18 Souter, here the context should be the actual statutory 19 terms used, and in Section 1681n(b) they expressly 20 required the knowing standard and that's a knowing 21 violation of the law, as Justice Alito's question seemed 22 to draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose. And the 23 statute directly defines what a permissible purpose is 24 under this law. 25 So that reference to knowing could not refer
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to a knowing, knowing the facts. And of course, willful 2 in some sense always includes some knowledge of the 3 factual circumstances. 4 In addition, the logical structure of the 5 act -- as I mentioned, we had negligence and actual 6 damages. We have a reckless standard, a knowing or 7 reckless standard for certain statutory damages, but 8 then an even higher level for the criminal and higher 9 statutory penalty provisions. And as I started to say, 10 a willful, knowing, reckless standard is entirely 11 consistent with how this Court has interpreted the term 12 in similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about 13 the same time the Hazen Paper case and Thurston and 14 McLaughlin cases interpreting the ADA and the FLSA and 15 other similar cases. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, even if 17 you're right about the standard, how can you suggest 18 that it's willful here when you have no judicial 19 construction, you have no administrative construction, 20 you have the statutory language that at least the 21 questions this morning have suggested is not perfectly 22 clear? How can you suggest that the action of the 23 companies on this case even under your standard was 24 willful? 25 MR. SHORR: Mr. Chief Justice, of course we
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 believe and the statute is in fact clear, you do not 2 need further interpretation by the Court. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we don't agree 4 with you on that, you would lose on the application of 5 the willfulness standard? 6 MR. SHORR: If you don't agree with us -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, 8 your, your, your conclusion that this was a willful 9 violation depends upon your assertion that the statute 10 is perfectly clear? 11 MR. SHORR: I think that there is a level of 12 objective component that the statute at least has to be 13 understood by a reasonable person at some level using 14 standard statutory construction. But that isn't to 15 suggest that the statute needs to be interpreted by a 16 higher court or even a district court for counsel to get 17 guidance. And of course, in this case, there was no 18 guidance supporting Respondents -- excuse me -- no 19 guidance supporting Petitioners', defendants', position. 20 In fact, the only guidance supported our position, 21 including guidance from the FTC. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about 23 the Ball letter? 24 MR. SHORR: I am talking about the Ball 25 letter.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That wasn't even 2 binding on the commission, so why would that be regarded 3 as authoritative? 4 MR. SHORR: It was not, and we are not 5 suggesting it is, although it's entitled to Chevron 6 deference. But if you get past the minimal level of 7 objective standard, the question becomes what indicia 8 and markers were out there that would have guided this 9 company as to whether there was a high risk that they 10 were violating the act. And certainly the Ball letter, 11 which was sent by the staff specifically to address this 12 exact question and to guide insurance companies, gave 13 notice and it said charging anyone a higher amount than 14 the best available rate based on their credit score was 15 an adverse action. And in addition, there was -16 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how could that be? I 17 mean I agree that the statute is clear, but I think it's 18 clear the other way. That is, if you look at the 19 language, as you've just heard, if you look at the 20 purpose it's very hard to reconcile with the purpose an 21 instance where a person has continuous accidents. He's 22 a reckless driver. His insurance company puts him in 23 just a category below the bottom and they read his 24 credit report and they discover, despite his faults, he 25 always pays his bills on time. So they increase it, not
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to the top category, but they give him a much better 2 deal. And you're saying this statute means that what I 3 just described is an adverse action based on a credit 4 report? 5 MR. SHORR: Yes. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay. And then if 7 you're going to say yes, I want to hear why yes, and 8 then in light of the following: The little boy who says 9 wolf. You're probably puzzled what I mean by that. I 10 mean that if you're right in that interpretation, there 11 will be tens of millions of notices going out and 12 they'll have the same effect on the public that these 13 privacy notices have today. We get them every day, 14 dozens of them, and they go right in the wastebasket, 15 because they will become meaningless because to an 16 average person that notice will not mean that he better 17 look at his credit report. It will mean throw it in the 18 wastebasket. 19 All right, now I've got the purpose, I've 20 got the language, and I have what I think of as common 21 sense. Now, you explain why it's obvious the opposite. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a different 23 question. We've been talking about willful up to now. 24 MR. SHORR: Yes, and this is the adverse 25 action question.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You haven't addressed 2 adverse action at all. 3 MR. SHORR: And I'm happy to do so now. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But, was there 5 anything further on willful? You said that the statute 6 was clear enough and you had the FTC informal advice, 7 but now we know that courts have divided on this 8 question, right? On -9 MR. SHORR: Divided in the sense -- well, 10 the Ninth Circuit of course overturned the district 11 court's ruling so there's no current division, but if 12 that's what you mean, yes, Your Honor. 13 In a -- I guess I'll address quickly your 14 question. There's additional guidance provided by the 15 FTC that was subject to formal rulemaking and that was 16 16 CFR, I believe it's Part 601 Appendix C, and in that 17 instance the FTC, again subject to formal notice and 18 comment of rulemaking, said that the statute is defined 19 very broadly and it includes any action that can even be 20 considered to have a negative impact. And that plays in 21 the subjective aspect as well, but addressing your 22 question, Justice Breyer, first on the statutory 23 language -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty sloppy 25 lawyering, don't you think, any action that even be
35

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 considered to have -- wow. This is a standard? 2 MR. SHORR: That was -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any action that can even be 4 considered to have a negative impact. 5 MR. SHORR: That was guidance, Your Honor. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is guidance? 7 MR. SHORR: That was guidance. That was 8 guidance to provide in the context of reading this 9 statute, it should be read broadly. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you know, I would tell 11 my CEO ignore that, that it's meaningless. 12 MR. SHORR: In addition, the CEO would have 13 the guidance provided by the Ball letter. 14 But again addressing your question, Justice 15 Breyer, an increase based on credit, if we had let's say 16 an increase based on race, someone goes in and has a 17 product to buy and there's the best rate, and they 18 charge someone else based on their race a higher rate, 19 certainly that's an increase based on credit. There's 20 only one best rate. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this is not an 22 antidiscrimination provision. It doesn't say anyone who 23 discriminates in the setting of race has to send out 24 letters. It requires an adverse action. It requires an 25 increase in the charge.

1 MR. SHORR: And Your Honor, I was only using 2 that example to try and explain the statutory language. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't explain it 4 because if you have an increase in the charge based on 5 race, of course that's an increase based on race. 6 MR. SHORR: Well, here we have -7 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you refuse to give a 8 person the best rate, and lower his rate but not the 9 best rate, based on race, that is not an increase based 10 on race. That is discrimination based on race. 11 MR. SHORR: You're charging someone more 12 based on credit. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true, and it's a 14 discrimination, but you didn't increase the rate. You 15 decreased it. 16 MR. SHORR: I think -17 JUSTICE BREYER: It's still a 18 discrimination, it's still unlawful. 19 MR. SHORR: Applying it to credit, a natural 20 definition that is charging someone more than you charge 21 others is an increase. 22 JUSTICE ALITO: When you say more, in order 23 for there to be an adverse action there has to be an 24 increase or an unfavorable change. And when you have an 25 initial application you have to figure out what is the
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 baseline in order to determine whether there has been an 2 increase or an adverse action. And you and the 3 Solicitor General just assert that the baseline in that 4 situation is the best possible rate that you can get, 5 but I don't understand where that comes from. 6 MR. SHORR: Because charging someone more 7 than someone else who qualifies for that better rate 8 based on their credit, is increasing them, charging them 9 more, but it's also evident from the statutory purpose, 10 which I think was a question you asked -11 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me look at the 12 language. Go back to give me -- because in ordinary 13 English, which I hope I speak, it is not an increase, 14 but maybe there is a technical term in the technical 15 language of commercial law or in FTC law where the word 16 increase means decrease. And if you -- is there 17 anything you want -- no. It's a serious question, at 18 least if you want to cite me to some authority that uses 19 this word increase in the way you just suggested. 20 MR. SHORR: We believe that it's a standard 21 dictionary definition, to charge someone more for 22 insurance than they would otherwise qualify for is 23 increasing their charge. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Which dictionary shall I 25 look at?
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. SHORR: I think we can look at any 2 dictionary. I don't have a cite, Your Honor, but -3 JUSTICE SOUTER: They're making this 4 argument, and I think you got close to it a minute ago 5 when you alluded to statutory purpose. I think this is 6 what's behind, and you tell me if I'm wrong. One 7 purpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the 8 consumer's credit report may contain errors which are 9 doing the consumer some kind of damage. 10 MR. SHORR: Yes, Your Honor. 11 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you want this consumer 12 alerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and 13 correct it if possible. 14 MR. SHORR: That's exactly right. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Reading the adverse action 16 the way you read it, it would give the consumer or 17 consumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases. In 18 every case in which the consumer might have done better 19 if the credit report had assumed different facts, on 20 your reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say 21 I want to look at that report and correct it if it's 22 wrong. But isn't the fallacy of that argument the 23 fallacy of saying because that is one object of the 24 statute, every term within the statute has got to be 25 read in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 object? And the trouble that we're having on the bench 2 is that discrimination and increase are different terms. 3 Increase says the rate actually goes up from a baseline 4 that the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination 5 does not. And your reading in effect, increase to mean 6 discrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that 7 the consumer will look at the report, isn't that the 8 basis of your argument? 9 MR. SHORR: I think it has to be an increase 10 based on some aspect, but the only way to give effect to 11 that statutory purpose is an increase above what you 12 would otherwise qualify for had you had better credit 13 and of course -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's a way to give 15 every conceivable effect to that policy. But the 16 statute in drafting adverse, or drafting the terms of 17 adverse action, may very well have said we don't want to 18 give every conceivable effect to this purpose because if 19 we do, we'll get into the situation that Justice Breyer 20 described. Everybody will be getting notices and the 21 notices will be meaningless. 22 MR. SHORR: I don't think the notice is 23 problematic because you're alerting the consumer to 24 check that the information that the insurance company 25 expressly relied on to increase your charge --
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SOUTER: To set the charge. I mean, 2 that's circular. To set the charge that it gives you. 3 MR. SHORR: I don't think you need a prior 4 charge to suffer an increase. If I walk into a candy 5 store and I've never purchased that candy before but the 6 best price that day is 5 cents but they say we're going 7 to charge you 10 cents, I've certainly suffered an 8 increase. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: By that you're talking 10 linguistically, but I am interested in the purpose. So 11 I looked up on the Internet approximately what percent 12 of the people have the best credit score and that's 13 about 1 percent. So 99 percent of the public doesn't 14 have the best possible credit score. Now I take it that 15 means that you could in fact, if it's even roughly 16 right, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps 17 a little more when they look at that report that, since 18 it's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite 19 possible that they won't get the best conceivable rate 20 which might be reserved for just perfect people. And if 21 that's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out 22 notices. And that's why I asked my question about the 23 boy who calls wolf. What will happen if 99 percent of 24 the people who apply for insurance or any other thing 25 get notices? I suspect that this is only intuitive,
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that the notices are more likely to go into the 2 wastebasket than they are if there was really a 3 decrease. Now, do you have any light you can shed on 4 that? 5 MR. SHORR: Sure. The -- as an initial 6 matter, it's not the perfect credit that is the 7 standard, it's whatever would qualify you for GEICO's 8 best rate. And that's a much broader standard. We 9 don't know the exact amounts but if you look at GEICO JA 10 6768, they have fairly broad tiers, maybe five or six. 11 And of course not everyone is going to get the notice. 12 If your driving record totally eliminates -- if you have 13 great credit but your driving record eliminates the 14 possibility that you qualify for the better rate, you 15 wouldn't get notice in that circumstance either. But 16 the key to the notice is, if I have very good credit but 17 the information that the insurance company looks at is 18 incorrect, I will be charged more based on incorrect 19 information without ever having the opportunity to tell 20 the insurance company or whoever is collecting that 21 information for them, you've charged me the wrong amount 22 and I in fact qualify for that better rate. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you have that 24 right independently, though, every year to look at a 25 copy of your credit report?
42
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. SHORR: Well, what's significant here, 2 that has been added to the statute in the last two 3 years. But since 1970, Congress's concern is giving 4 notice at a critical time, when the insurance company 5 tells you we are relying on it and we may have taken an 6 adverse action. 7 I wanted to also mention, here it's not just 8 an increase. There's also been a denial, and that 9 Mr. Edo applied for insurance from GEICO, and was denied 10 insurance with the stand-alone company GEICO General, so 11 that is also an adverse action under the act. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say you 13 look at the increase with respect to the best credit 14 rate, why is that? Why wouldn't you look at it relative 15 to say the average insured who walks in the door? 16 MR. SHORR: Because that -- GEICO's 17 argument, and I think that's what they want, presumes 18 they're looking at accurate credit information. And the 19 problem is, Congress has always told that there is 20 significant inadequacy in the credit information. I 21 think it's cited in the National Consumer Law Center 22 brief. In 1996, Congress was told that the error rate 23 in consumer information was 50 percent and there was a 24 20 percent serious error in the rates. Under GEICO's 25 interpretation --
43

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 2 what pertinence that has to my question which is, why do 3 you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline 4 from which you would measure your hypothetical increase? 5 MR. SHORR: Because under GEICO's theory of 6 the statute you may never get notice, even though you're 7 being charged more for insurance based on inaccurate 8 information, as long as you're not charge -- your charge 9 doesn't move below average. So a lot of people who are 10 in fact intended to be protected under this act will not 11 be protected until their charge goes below average, even 12 though the insurance company is continuing to charge 13 them more based on inaccurate information. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do we -- how do we know 15 that they were intended to be protected in this way by 16 getting this notice? That's the issue in the case. 17 MR. SHORR: Because going through the 18 statute and the increase based on credit, and then the 19 notice will give them the opportunity to check. Since 20 the consumer here is the -- it's a system of checks and 21 balances, and unless you give this consumer the 22 opportunity to check that they are in fact using the 23 correct information, it wasn't mistaken, it wasn't 24 driven down by identity theft, you can continue to 25 charge people more --

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So that's -2 MR. SHORR: -- based on inaccurate 3 information. 4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Your basic argument is the 5 statute, the definitions of adverse action have got to 6 be read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which 7 a consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer 8 to ask to see his credit report. That's your basic 9 premise? 10 MR. SHORR: Both based on the premise and 11 purpose of statute, yes. 12 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. 13 MR. SHORR: Briefly addressing the 14 application of the standard to the facts in this case, 15 we do think it's appropriate to remand for further 16 consideration in light of some new developments.

SHORR: I want to be careful, because I 9 had presented -- I asked to lodge them with the Court 10 and I can quote them if necessary, but within those 11 documents there is direct evidence that GEICO 12 interpreted the statute exactly how we do, that not 13 putting someone in the best tier based on credit -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who's GEICO? I 15 mean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a 16 particular level, an ongoing debate about what this law 17 means. If you get one lawyer who says, you know, I 18 think you could read it this way, does that mean that 19 GEICO reads it that way? 20 MR. SHORR: No, Your Honor. In this 21 instance, this document involves top level GEICO 22 executives. And with respect to the advice of counsel 23 issue, frankly it's a red herring. We have never asked 24 to compel the Defendants in either of these cases or any 25 of the cases we're involved in, to waive their
46

1 privilege. They've got the right, of course, to offer 2 advice of counsel as an affirmative -- as a defense in 3 this case, but we don't believe it's necessary to prove 4 our case to even reach what the counsel said. We 5 believe we can prove our case based on the documents and 6 subjective intent alone. 7 JUSTICE STEVENS: I still don't really 8 understand this part of the case very much. Assume that 9 a lawyer writes a letter saying you read it two or three 10 different ways, read the statute, it's very ambiguous, 11 and we think the government's reading is the better 12 reading. And the executives think about it and they say 13 no, we don't think that's right. Has that proved 14 reckless disregard? 15 MR. SHORR: If the statute was clear and the 16 guidance -17 JUSTICE STEVENS: If the statute's clear. 18 And of course, Miss Mahoney said the district judge 19 thought it was clear, but the other way. 20 MR. SHORR: And with respect to the district 21 court, we believe the district court here clearly erred, 22 as the Ninth Circuit found. And the guidance -- that 23 opinion certainly didn't precede the conduct that's at 24 issue here. The only guidance, again, available at the 25 time supported our reading of the statute. There was no

1 guidance from and court or from the FTC, or from 2 anywhere that would have supported Defendants' 3 interpretation at that time. So that's another aspect 4 of inquiry, the subjective intent of the Defendants. 5 If there are no other questions? 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 7 Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining. 8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 10 MS. MAHONEY: If I could start by just 11 responding to the issue of the new document, I just want 12 to emphasize that this document was created by people 13 who weren't lawyers. It was done before GEICO even 14 started using credit to price insurance. They were -15 said they were brainstorming about what the statute 16 might mean. And I would point the Court to the 17 supplemental excerpt of records at 504 where when GEICO 18 implemented the policy that we're talking about here, 19 the -- they said that the intent was that we would send 20 to the people who were supposed to get the adverse 21 action notice. With the early systems development we 22 didn't have the ability to identify whether they were 23 supposed to receive the notice or not; that was because 24 they had not yet developed the way to do with what they 25 call the neutral, where they compare how the applicant

1 would have done if they hadn't taken credit, hadn't 2 taken credit into account at all. And this is a 3 procedure that's required actually in most States in 4 order to ensure that those who don't want to allow 5 access to credit reports or who don't have a sufficient 6 credit history are not treated adversely in the meaning 7 of those State laws, and that means worse than the 8 average loss ratio. So there's nothing in this record, 9 even if you take into account the documents they're 10 talking about, to suggest that there was somehow a 11 knowing or deliberate intent to try to violate the law. 12 With respect to a few of the factual or -13 issues that came up, Safeco estimates that approximately 14 80 percent of all consumers that they are selling new 15 insurance to now have to get notice under the standards 16 established by the Ninth Circuit. 17 With respect to who can qualify for the top 18 tier of credit, it's only, at least at GEICO, 19 approximately 10 percent. So 90 percent of the 20 consumers would not qualify for that. 21 And the statute very plainly does not 22 prohibit differential treatment based on persons with 23 better credit, nor do State laws. And so the analogy as 24 to race discrimination simply don't hold water, because 25 there Congress has told you what the baseline is, you
49

1 can't treat any person of a different race in a 2 different way, and that's not true under this statute. 3 And instead, it's quite reasonable, as GEICO has 4 concluded, to simply say look, if we wouldn't -- if 5 we're treating you worse than we would have treated you 6 if we ever looked at your credit report, worse than if 7 you had an average loss ratio for this criteria, we'll 8 send you the notice. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why did they use credit 10 reports? Is it just a hedge against late premiums and 11 the cost of late premiums, or does it bear on risk 12 factors generally? 13 MS. MAHONEY: Well, generally there are 14 about 15 factors that they look at to try to come up 15 with a prediction of loss ratio, and someone who has a 16 good credit history is generally regarded as 17 responsible, and responsible people tend to make less 18 claims. And so, again, it's just one factor of 15 19 though. 20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah. May I ask this 21 question? The reading of the statute in subsection i 22 about, in the charges for insurance advice, seems to 23 favor your view. But subsection ii about denial of 24 employment really seems to read in favor of the 25 government's reading.
50

1 MS. MAHONEY: Well actually, I think that 2 when you factor in employment, it has -- it has the 3 opposite effect. Because what happens here is if you're 4 using employment verification reports, consumer reports 5 about employment, there are all kinds of consumer 6 reports. How do you tell who had the optimal employment 7 history? How could the baseline be the best employment 8 history possible? 9 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. But my point is, it 10 seems to me that getting a lesser salary, it just seems 11 like the first applicant would be an adverse employment 12 action under subparagraph ii, just -- do you see what 13 I'm trying to say? 14 MS. MAHONEY: That if you -- that in other 15 words, if you gave someone a lower salary -16 JUSTICE STEVENS: It adversely affects any 17 current or prospective employee. Now the language in i 18 isn't, it doesn't read that way. But the thing that's 19 troubling me is whether you should interpret i in the 20 light of what ii seems to say. 21 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think that if 22 GEICO in this example, if you actually pay them less 23 because you looked at their credit report, then GEICO 24 would concede that that is in fact an adverse action. 25 So I don't think it's inconsistent at all.
