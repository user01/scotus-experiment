 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 now in Number 01-1229, Pierce County v. Ignacio Guillen.
 5 Mr. Hamilton.
 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. HAMILTON
 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 8 MR. HAMILTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
 9 may it please the Court:
 10 From the enactment of the 1966 Highway Safety
 11 Act, a congressional report, specifically number 17 to the
 12 89th Congress, which is quoted on page 2 of the blue
 13 brief, congressional reports noted that, quote, no other
 14 part of the State program is as basic to ultimate success,
 15 nor as demanding of complete cooperation, end quote, as 16 State collection of accident reports, because they are the
 17 basis for hazard identification and correction.
 18 However, soon after the 1973 Highway Safety Act
 19 made accident data collection a condition to Federal
 20 hazard elimination funds the Secretary of Transportation
 21 reported to Congress that States strongly objected,
 22 because they feared that their collection of accident data
 23 would be used against them in damage actions. Because of
 24 this, unintended liability exposure threatened the
 25 integrity and proper operation of a cooperative Federal-

3

1 State program that has saved thousands of lives --
 2 QUESTION: Would you help us figure out how to
 3 interpret this statute?
 4 MR. HAMILTON: Yes, Your Honor.
 5 QUESTION: It says data, highway safety data
 6 compiled or collected by a State. Now, I suppose that in
 7 a crossing like we have here, where there might have been
 8 accidents from time to time, that there would be police
 9 reports or highway officer reports of motor vehicle
 10 accidents at that site, right?
 11 MR. HAMILTON: Yes, Your Honor.
 12 QUESTION: And those presumably are not either
 13 compiled or collected for the purpose of getting highway
 14 funding from the Federal Government. They're compiled, I
 15 gather, to serve the normal functions of law enforcement. 16 MR. HAMILTON: Your Honor, no, that's not
 17 completely correct.
 18 QUESTION: No?
 19 MR. HAMILTON: They are collected and compiled
 20 for purposes of highway hazard identification --
 21 QUESTION: Isn't --
 22 MR. HAMILTON: -- from the very beginning.
 23 QUESTION: Well, don't you suppose that at least
 24 in some jurisdictions, maybe not Tacoma, but in some
 25 jurisdictions you will find just ordinary police

4

1 reports --
 2 MR. HAMILTON: Well, it's my --
 3 QUESTION: -- of accidents, and sometime later,
 4 perhaps the State might decide, or the county, I'd like to
 5 have some Federal money to make some changes at that
 6 crossing, and maybe we can use some of the data to
 7 assemble it to try to apply for Federal money. Now, how
 8 should we interpret that statute?
 9 MR. HAMILTON: Well, in the -- if I understand
 10 the hypothetical, the -- Your Honor is postulating a
 11 situation where there is an accident report purely State
 12 in origin. Just to help the Court, I don't know that such
 13 a thing exists after the crash data forms. It's to be
 14 understood that the Department of Transportation has been,
 15 since 1966, working with the States to develop a uniform 16 crash data form, and that -- I think it's becoming more
 17 and more successful as that goes on, so I'm --
 18 QUESTION: So your point is that the police
 19 officers are using a kind of a unified Federal traffic
 20 report --
 21 MR. HAMILTON: Essentially --
 22 QUESTION: -- when there's an accident?
 23 MR. HAMILTON: The forms are not all the same,
 24 because each State has the right to choose how to put it
 25 together, but the elements of the forms are dramatically

5

1 Federal in their nature, and they're Federal totally
 2 directed toward the issue of highway design. That's
 3 why -- Nation-wide there was a report cited by the
 4 Washington State amici and multi-State amicus, amici
 5 briefs that pointed out that Nation-wide before 1966 there
 6 was no standard at all.
 7 QUESTION: Well, let me ask you this. At page
 8 20 of the respondent's brief we have four different
 9 interpretations, possible interpretations of the acts set
 10 forth. Do we have to choose among those in order, as a
 11 predicate before reaching the constitutional issue, and
 12 I'll just -- and this is in line with Justice O'Connor's
 13 question. If we took the most expansive view of the
 14 alternatives that she presents, then the opinion that we
 15 would write, it seems to me, would be different than if we 16 took the more narrow, the most narrow view, and that leads
 17 me to the question, do we have to have a statutory
 18 construction at the beginning point of our holding?
 19 MR. HAMILTON: I don't believe so, Your Honor,
 20 and the county's position, and we believe it's well-
 21 founded, is that the constitutional issue is not an excuse
 22 for artificially narrowly interpreting --
 23 QUESTION: Well, but I think that our Court has
 24 always preferred, along the lines suggested by Justice
 25 O'Connor and Justice Kennedy, to construe a statute to

6

1 avoid constitutional problems if we can, and certainly the
 2 respondents here at least suggest there are several
 3 different constructions. Are you not prepared to say
 4 which of those you favor?
 5 MR. HAMILTON: Well, I've -- I'm happy -- in
 6 fact, I had intended to, if given the opportunity, to
 7 provide the Court the way the county believes the statute
 8 should be interpreted.
 9 QUESTION: Well, I'll give you that opportunity
 10 right now.
 11 MR. HAMILTON: Okay.
 12 (Laughter.)
 13 QUESTION: Yes, that's our question, and you
 14 might bear in mind if you wish that I think we generally
 15 construe evidentiary privileges narrowly.
 16 MR. HAMILTON: Yes. However, as the Court
 17 pointed out on that issue of narrow construction that --
 18 in the Shapiro case, I believe, which was also a raw data
 19 case whose purpose was to encourage participation, that
 20 even after quoting the standard, the test of a narrow
 21 construction -- the test was first put to Congress'
 22 intent, and that the issue of, you know, that particular
 23 rule of construction is not to be used in a way to
 24 artificially narrowly interpret what Congress meant, and
 25 if Congress meant something, then that's the test.

7

1 To answer Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist's
 2 question, how does the county say the statute should be
 3 interpreted, pretty much we agree with the logic of the
 4 United States Solicitor General, but just would suggest
 5 that the, their logic be extended to what we believe is
 6 the logical conclusion. In other words, we disagree with
 7 plaintiffs that it only covers generated documents,
 8 because under 409 that's interpretation conflicts with
 9 what this Court has said the plain meaning of compiled
 10 means, as this Court has discussed in the John Doe case
 11 cited to the Court.
 12 Also, this reads out of 409 the express
 13 protection also of data collected, not just generated. It
 14 ignores the legislative history of why 409 was amended,
 15 and why it used the language compiled --
 16 QUESTION: You're telling us what's wrong with
 17 the other reading. Which is your reading?
 18 MR. HAMILTON: Our reading, Your Honor, is that
 19 there should be -- this Court should establish a bright
 20 line rule that documents collect -- as the language says,
 21 for -- we would ask the Court to enforce the language of
 22 the statute, which reads, documents and data, quote,
 23 compiled or collected for the purpose, end quote, of
 24 specified highway safety programs, and here's the
 25 operative language, quote, shall not be subject to

8

1 discovery or admitted into evidence in a Federal or State
 2 proceeding or considered for any other purposes in any
 3 action for damages arising from any occurrence at a
 4 location mentioned or addressed in those documents or
 5 data. In other words --
 6 QUESTION: It doesn't say documents. I mean,
 7 you quoted it, you began the quote after --
 8 MR. HAMILTON: Yes --
 9 QUESTION: -- after the noun.
 10 MR. HAMILTON: Yes. I --
 11 QUESTION: The noun you inserted was documents.
 12 MR. HAMILTON: Yes. There are specific --
 13 QUESTION: It says --
 14 MR. HAMILTON: -- references to specific types.
 15 QUESTION: 
 It says data, doesn't it? 16 MR. HAMILTON: It says data, and also lists
 17 reports, lists -- and that sort of thing, and I was trying
 18 to condense it down, but yes.
 19 QUESTION: To be plain, do you mean that
 20 everything that goes to the Public Works Department,
 21 everything that eventually gets to the Public Works
 22 Department and is relevant to the safety of highway
 23 crossings is exempt from discovery?
 24 MR. HAMILTON: Yes, Your Honor, that is what
 25 we're saying.

9

1 QUESTION: Every fact, so that if the Department
 2 of Environmental Protection has prepared a report saying
 3 the accidents are wrecking the grass and the flowers at an
 4 intersection, and that report is then given to whatever
 5 the data collection agency here is for this purpose, that
 6 all of that data, including the data in the Department of
 7 Environmental Protection, is then covered by the
 8 privilege? Is that your position?
 9 MR. HAMILTON: To the extent that that
 10 characterization goes to the data that's in the reports. 
 11 It's not to say that -- all we're saying --
 12 QUESTION: That's my question.
 13 MR. HAMILTON: Yes.
 14 QUESTION: The same data is in the environmental
 15 report. 
 That data is then given to the collection agency. 16 Does the data, even in the hands of the Environmental
 17 Department, become subject to the privilege at that point,
 18 on your reading?
 19 MR. HAMILTON: We believe the -- again, if it
 20 meets the test of dealing with an occurrence at a --
 21 again, following the language of the statute, an
 22 occurrence at the location mentioned or addressed in such
 23 reports in the damage action, then that report that it's
 24 collected and compiled by --
 25 QUESTION: I'm not talking about the report. 

10

1 I'm talking about the fact which is reported.
 2 MR. HAMILTON: Yes.
 3 QUESTION: The data in the report.
 4 MR. HAMILTON: Well --
 5 QUESTION: Does that -- does that data --
 6 QUESTION: You can answer that yes or no.
 7 QUESTION: -- become subject to the privilege?
 8 MR. HAMILTON: Yes, if Your Honor means, when
 9 you say data, going to the report to get the data, to --
 10 if you were to -- if that person wanted to raise that
 11 issue were to go to the person who, or the entity that
 12 created that information, and were to depose that, those
 13 people, they could get the information that way. All
 14 we're talking about --
 15 QUESTION: 
 Then your -- then the answer to my 16 question, I guess, is no, the data does not become, as
 17 such, subject to the privilege. It's only the data as
 18 held by the collection agency. You can still go to the
 19 Environmental Department, depose them, get your
 20 information?
 21 MR. HAMILTON: Yes, you can.
 22 QUESTION: Okay.
 23 MR. HAMILTON: Yes, and I'm sorry I
 24 misunderstood you.
 25 QUESTION: Well, could you --

11

1 QUESTION: What if you don't have to depose
 2 them?
 3 QUESTION: -- go to the Police Department under
 4 this uniform Federal form you were telling us about it?
 5 MR. HAMILTON: I'm sorry, I missed the question.
 6 QUESTION: You said at the outset that there's a
 7 uniform document for collisions or crashes or something.
 8 MR. HAMILTON: Yes.
 9 QUESTION: And the Police Department fills it
 10 out. Can you go to the Police Department and get that
 11 information?
 12 MR. HAMILTON: Under our interpretation, you
 13 could find the officer, you could depose the officer, but
 14 you cannot get the report if it's collected and filed for
 15 hazard identification.
 16 QUESTION: Well, so then Justice Souter's
 17 hypothetical is different from this. You said in Justice
 18 Souter's hypothetical that you could go to that Department
 19 and get the document, but if you go to the Police
 20 Department you can't get the document.
 21 MR. HAMILTON: No --
 22 QUESTION: You didn't say he could get the
 23 document.
 24 MR. HAMILTON: No.
 25 QUESTION: You said you could depose him --

12

1 MR. HAMILTON: Yes.
 2 QUESTION: -- and that was what my question was
 3 going to be. Are you drawing a distinction between
 4 getting the document that was generated in the
 5 Environmental Agency and deposing the person who made the
 6 document?
 7 MR. HAMILTON: Yes, Your Honor. That's a
 8 distinction that the cases make --
 9 QUESTION: Why? It says data. I don't care
 10 about the cases. I care about the text of the statute. 
 11 It says data. It's data whether it's in a document or
 12 whether it's in some deponent's head. Data is data.
 13 MR. HAMILTON: I think that certainly is a fair
 14 interpretation of the statute. What we're trying to do is
 15 synthesize how the courts have looked at this, and they 16 have drawn the distinction saying that really what the
 17 purpose of this was to put plaintiffs back in the position
 18 they were before. All this mechanism of creating accident
 19 data existed beforehand. That's what they had to do. 
 20 They didn't have this silver platter.
 21 QUESTION: They could get a police report of an
 22 accident. Isn't that standard routine in negligence
 23 cases?
 24 MR. HAMILTON: Your Honor, before the 1966
 25 Highway Safety Act they could not get an accident, a

13

1 collection of accident reports, at least in Washington
 2 State, and it's my understanding Nation-wide, just by
 3 asking for them --
 4 QUESTION: But you could certainly get a
 5 police -- at least judging from my own practice in Arizona
 6 you could certainly get an individual police report of an
 7 accident.
 8 MR. HAMILTON: Yes. If you knew the -- and
 9 that's the point. You essentially have to know what
 10 plaintiffs are trying to find out to get the document,
 11 because you couldn't ask for all the accidents at this
 12 intersection. You could ask for a date and people
 13 involved, but you couldn't ask for, give me all the
 14 accidents at a particular intersection.
 15 QUESTION: 
 No, but you could ask for the police 16 report of the particular accident that you were concerned
 17 with.
 18 MR. HAMILTON: Prior to 1966, yes, Your Honor,
 19 that's correct. That's --
 20 QUESTION: I'm still slightly mixed up.
 21 MR. HAMILTON: Okay.
 22 QUESTION: Imagine the forest service in the
 23 State collects, because they have tree lovers, a piece of
 24 paper that says the elm trees at the intersection of such-
 25 and-such were diseased, all right. Now, that's done for

14

1 purposes of tree health, and there's a piece of paper in
 2 the environmental tree section which has that written
 3 right on it, and one day the Transportation Department for
 4 safety reasons says, send us a Xerox of that, okay.
 5 The question I think Justice Souter was asking
 6 and Justice Scalia, and I would certainly ask, is, in your
 7 view, when they send a subpoena or discovery to the tree
 8 department to get that piece of paper, can they get it?
 9 MR. HAMILTON: No.
 10 QUESTION: No?
 11 MR. HAMILTON: No.
 12 QUESTION: Very well. Suppose that the
 13 Transportation Department one day wrote a witness' name
 14 down, an address which they got from the internal State
 15 government telephone book. 
 In your opinion, could a 16 plaintiff go and ask for a telephone book? The answer, I
 17 guess, is no.
 18 MR. HAMILTON: Let me think about that for a
 19 minute.
 20 QUESTION: Well, I don't see what the difference
 21 would be. They didn't collect the telephone book for
 22 purposes of -- they didn't make the telephone book for the
 23 purposes of accidents, but one day somebody went to the
 24 telephone book and copied some information out of it for
 25 the purpose of accidents --

15

1 MR. HAMILTON: I think what they copied --
 2 QUESTION: -- and that's why, you see, exactly
 3 why I find your interpretation of the statute rather
 4 strained, so what is the answer to what my hypothetical
 5 suggests?
 6 MR. HAMILTON: Well, since my answer would be
 7 strained if I said the photo, the telephone book, what I'm
 8 referring to would be what was written down for the
 9 purposes, and collected for the purposes --
 10 QUESTION: But you said that they could not get
 11 the piece of paper --
 12 MR. HAMILTON: Yes.
 13 QUESTION: -- in the Tree Division --
 14 MR. HAMILTON: The --
 15 QUESTION: 
 -- and all I'm having trouble is 16 distinguishing between the piece of paper written for tree
 17 health and the address in the telephone book written so
 18 people can know where people should be phoned.
 19 MR. HAMILTON: The piece of paper written for
 20 tree help -- and I'm sorry I misunderstood the question. 
 21 I thought the Court was asking about the telephone book. 
 22 The telephone book, no. The piece of paper that was
 23 written down from that, yes, because that's collected and
 24 compiled, and that's really what the SHOTS case said, that
 25 if there's a question about this of whether this was

16

1 really fairly included for the purposes of 152, then for
 2 that purpose you have an in camera inspection.
 3 QUESTION: But what is there that suggests that
 4 Congress wanted to change the game to that extent? One
 5 can understand what you've suggested before, wanting to
 6 keep personal injury plaintiffs in the same place they
 7 were before this legislation, but your interpretation
 8 takes away from plaintiffs things that they would have had
 9 access to before.
 10 MR. HAMILTON: Your Honor, we -- respectfully,
 11 we disagree with that characterization of our position.
 12 QUESTION: Well, you just, in response to the
 13 Chief's question, said that at least the police report of
 14 this accident was routine.
 15 MR. HAMILTON: 
 The police report of this 16 accident, when you go and ask for -- and the reason why is
 17 because -- because of the Highway Safety Act, 1966 Highway
 18 Safety Act, the accident reports were indexed by location. 
 19 You could go and get a specific report if you knew the
 20 facts enough of the accident, but only that accident
 21 report, not all of them, and that is how 409 --
 22 QUESTION: But that's not because of a
 23 privilege, is it?
 24 MR. HAMILTON: Yes. It is because of a
 25 privilege.

17

1 QUESTION: I thought the reason for that is the
 2 police said, look, we don't have to do your homework for
 3 you. If you know what you want, we'll give it to you. If
 4 you don't know what you want, we don't have to search for
 5 it. Isn't that the reason?
 6 MR. HAMILTON: Yes, because the police don't do
 7 that. The police don't care about highway design factors
 8 other than because the form asks them to.
 9 QUESTION: Okay, so in the past, then, and in
 10 accordance with Justice Ginsburg's question, you could
 11 have asked for the police report, and in Justice Breyer's
 12 example, I presume you could have gone to the Tree
 13 Division and said, let's have the slip of paper that says
 14 the elm trees are diseased. Now, you can't do that.
 15 MR. HAMILTON: 
 Well, Your Honor, I believe 16 that --
 17 QUESTION: And Justice Ginsburg's question is, I
 18 thought it was supposed to leave things, as it were,
 19 level, the way they were, that a disadvantage was not
 20 being created, it was simply, the intent was simply to
 21 avoid creating a new advantage which would deter the
 22 State. Isn't that the way we should read the statute?
 23 MR. HAMILTON: I think the purpose, yes, Your
 24 Honor, is to avoid discouraging States from participating,
 25 and allowing them to get accident reports from the hands

18

1 of third parties does discourage States from
 2 participating.
 3 QUESTION: Would you like to reserve your time?
 4 MR. HAMILTON: Yes, I would, Your Honor. Thank
 5 you very much.
 6 QUESTION: Mr. Clement.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS INTERVENOR
 9 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
 10 may it please the Court:
 11 The 1995 amendment to section 409 is, contrary
 12 to the determination of the Washington State Supreme
 13 Court, constitutional. The provision protects data that
 14 is compiled and collected for purposes of applying for
 15 Federal highway funds from being used in State and Federal 16 court litigation. The documents at issue are inherently
 17 Federal in character, and so Congress has the power to
 18 prohibit the use of those documents in both Federal and
 19 State court litigation.
 20 QUESTION: Well, what about documents created
 21 not for the purpose of getting Federal funds, not for
 22 section 152, but for some other purpose, some of which are
 23 later incorporated in a Federal funding application --
 24 MR. CLEMENT: I think those documents --
 25 QUESTION: -- by a different agency?

19

1 MR. CLEMENT: I think those documents, Justice
 2 O'Connor, would be discoverable and admissible if the
 3 documents were sought from the party that collected them
 4 for a purpose different than the Federal highway funding
 5 purposes, but what the statute, I think, does prohibit is
 6 somebody going to the State Highway Traffic Department and
 7 essentially engaging in a one-stop shopping enterprise
 8 where they can get all sorts of documents that have been
 9 collected --
 10 QUESTION: But you differ from petitioner in
 11 your reading of the statute. Yours is much narrower, I
 12 take it.
 13 MR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice
 14 O'Connor, and so as a result of our interpretation of the
 15 statute, the typical police accident report can be 16 obtained from the Police Department and, I think with
 17 respect to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, the report about
 18 the tree can be obtained from the State Tree Department or
 19 the State Environmental Department.
 20 QUESTION: Let me ask a somewhat different
 21 question, although I'm not sure we've resolved the point
 22 that we've been inquiring about. Would a State have the
 23 right to waive this privilege?
 24 MR. CLEMENT: I think that's a difficult
 25 question, Justice Kennedy. I think that as you know, as a

20

1 general matter evidentiary privileges are waivable, and
 2 so -- and that's the proposition this Court has
 3 established in cases like Menzonato and Hill, but there is
 4 a sense in which this privilege exists, in our view,
 5 primarily for the benefit of the Federal Government, so
 6 that we can obtain accurate, complete, and candid
 7 assessments of highway traffic safety requirements, and
 8 so, there's a suggestion, for example, in the Hill
 9 decision at footnote 3 that, when a third party's
 10 interests are at stake, that the court may not find waiver
 11 under those circumstances as readily as it would
 12 otherwise, so our view I think would be that although the
 13 Court need not definitively resolve it in this case,
 14 there's a strong argument that the privilege would not be
 15 waivable.
 16 QUESTION: Let me just interrupt you, if I may. 
 17 Are you saying that the lawyer defending the county, if
 18 the plaintiff called him up and said, I'd like to see
 19 these reports, and the lawyer said, well, they're
 20 privileged, but I think I'll give them to you because I
 21 think it's in everybody's interests to know the facts,
 22 that would violate the Federal statute?
 23 MR. CLEMENT: I think the admissibility of those
 24 materials --
 25 QUESTION: I'm just asking you about showing

21

1 them to the plaintiff.
 2 MR. CLEMENT: I think there's a sense in which
 3 it would violate the Federal statute, but I'm not
 4 suggesting that the Department of Transportation is going
 5 to be able to leap to the defense of the statute in that
 6 hypothetical and assert the interests of the statute. I
 7 think, however, if a State wanted to take a systematic
 8 policy of disregarding section 409, I think that would
 9 implicate the Federal interests, and I'm not sure that a
 10 State would be able to do it.
 11 QUESTION: Well, supposing this simply comes up
 12 during a trial. A witness is put on the stand, asked
 13 about the preparation of a report, and the State doesn't
 14 object, and it would be objectionable under the statute. 
 15 Now, is that something that could be challenged on appeal, 16 say?
 17 MR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, Chief Justice. 
 18 I think it is something that could be procedurally
 19 defaulted, but I do think if in a case like that the State
 20 went to the trial judge and said, look, there is this
 21 provision of Federal law, section 409, that says this
 22 material can't come in, but we're happy to just disregard
 23 that provision, I think the trial court might well be
 24 within its rights to say that no, we're not going to
 25 disregard that provision of Federal law, we're going to

22

1 keep the material out, but I do think it could be --
 2 QUESTION: With these rights, is it a matter of
 3 discretion for the trial court? I mean, it would be one
 4 thing to say it's mandatory, it's a Federal requirement,
 5 and now you're suggesting that the lawyer can overlook it,
 6 and the court could or must act on its own?
 7 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I'm suggesting that the
 8 language of the statute is mandatory. It says that it
 9 shall not be admitted, so I think if the language is
 10 brought to the attention of the trial court judge, he or
 11 she would be in a position where they ought to exclude the
 12 evidence.
 13 QUESTION: How would this be enforced by the
 14 Federal Government? I understand, and correct me if I'm
 15 wrong, that the Federal funding is not tied to the 409 16 privilege, but is tied to the 152 reporting obligations,
 17 so what Federal enforcement would there be for a county
 18 that says, we think it's fair for the plaintiff to have
 19 accident reports, so we'll give them.
 20 What Federal -- how would that mandatory
 21 requirement that you just stated be enforced by Federal
 22 authorities?
 23 MR. CLEMENT: I think under the circumstances
 24 that you're envisioning, Justice Ginsburg, the Federal
 25 Government would not provide funds under 152 or 130 or 144

23

1 to that particular locality.
 2 QUESTION: So you're saying that the 409
 3 privilege is not simply a right of the State agency, but
 4 is -- that the funding depends on the State's asserting
 5 that privilege?
 6 MR. CLEMENT: It certainly depends on the States
 7 or the localities abiding by that privilege as a general
 8 matter. I don't think a State or a locality can take a
 9 cavalier position of saying, we're just not going to be
 10 bound by the provisions of this Federal statute, but yet
 11 we'd still like to take the money under those three
 12 statutes. I don't think that's permissible, and the
 13 reason is, is that section 409, although it may benefit
 14 the State in a particular litigation, does serve an
 15 important Federal interest, and that is the interest in 16 getting complete and candid information to assess and to
 17 award Federal highway funds.
 18 By analogy, I would suggest this Court look to
 19 its decision in the Buckman Company v. Plaintiff's
 20 Committee case, because in that case this Court recognized
 21 that the FDA approval process, and the process for
 22 applying for FDA approval, is inherently Federal in
 23 character, and so this Court preempted State tort law that
 24 might distort the effect of applying for FDA approval.
 25 In the same way, the process of applying for

24

1 Federal highway funds and the documents that are used for
 2 that purpose have an inherently Federal character, and so
 3 the Federal Government has an interest in making sure that
 4 the information provided to the Federal Government is
 5 accurate and complete, and it has an ability, Congress has
 6 the power to take those essentially Federal documents and
 7 protect them both in State and Federal court litigation.
 8 Now, I would suggest that the answer to the
 9 waiver question, unlike the answer to the statutory
 10 construction question, is not a necessary component of
 11 this Court's decision. We think the better view is that
 12 it could be -- is that it could not be waived, at least in
 13 gross. Of course, if it could be waived, I think that is
 14 an additional answer to any accountability questions that
 15 may arise, but again, we think the better view is that it 16 can't be waived.
 17 QUESTION: Mr. Clement, one of the arguments
 18 made by respondent Guillen is that -- is a Tenth Amendment
 19 argument. Do you think he has standing to make that
 20 argument?
 21 MR. CLEMENT: I think the better view is that he
 22 doesn't have standing to raise that argument, and I'll
 23 also suggest that if they wanted to make a Tenth Amendment
 24 argument, and wanted this Court to decide the difficult
 25 question of whether or not an individual had standing to

25

1 raise a Tenth Amendment argument, that they probably
 2 should have raised the Tenth Amendment argument before the
 3 conclusion section of their brief, and I think this Court
 4 would be well-advised not to definitively decide whether
 5 or not an individual had standing to raise a Tenth
 6 Amendment issue. I --
 7 QUESTION: Why -- what's special about the --
 8 this is just an assertion that the Federal Government has
 9 no authority to do what it has done, and you say an
 10 individual who has been harmed by the Federal Government's
 11 exceeding its authority does not have standing to
 12 challenge? It seems to me we do it all the time.
 13 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I don't
 14 think all Tenth Amendment challenges are created equal,
 15 and I think therein lies the difference. 
 If all the Tenth 16 Amendment challenge is, is a mirrored reflection of
 17 Congress not having the enumerated power to enact a
 18 statute --
 19 QUESTION: But that's all it --
 20 QUESTION: How about a Commerce Clause
 21 challenge?
 22 QUESTION: Yes.
 23 MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely. In those kind of
 24 cases, the individual does have standing, but this Court
 25 on various occasions has suggested that there's an

26

1 additional component to the Tenth Amendment, that it's not
 2 just a reflection of the enumerated powers of Congress,
 3 but, rather, there are certain special areas of State
 4 prerogatives that the Federal Government can't intrude
 5 through congressional acts.
 6 QUESTION: Well, we allow those challenges all
 7 the time in separation of powers cases.
 8 MR. CLEMENT: I think that's right, but Justice
 9 Kennedy, I think there's something that certainly seems
 10 different. If the gravamen of the complaint is that
 11 there's some element of State sovereignty that Congress
 12 cannot intrude upon, and the State doesn't object to that
 13 intrusion, it seems odd that the individual would have
 14 third party standing to raise that objection.
 15 QUESTION: 
 Why couldn't you say the same thing 16 for the Executive and the legislature in a case like
 17 Chadha?
 18 MR. CLEMENT: Again, I think you could, and I
 19 think that's why with respect to a more typical Tenth
 20 Amendment challenge that's based on an enumerated power,
 21 or the lack of an enumerated power, there would be
 22 standing. I think what this Court suggested --
 23 QUESTION: I don't -- whenever the Government
 24 goes beyond its enumerated power, it is infringing upon
 25 the powers of the States, isn't it?

27

1 MR. CLEMENT: Well --
 2 QUESTION: All the Tenth Amendment says is, you
 3 know, other than the enumerated powers, the other powers
 4 continue where they used to be, with the States. In other
 5 words, I don't see anything special about a Tenth
 6 Amendment claim.
 7 QUESTION: In Buckley v. Valeo we held that the
 8 Appointment Clause, where the President had signed the
 9 legislation, could be raised by private individuals.
 10 MR. CLEMENT: No, I understand that, and that
 11 was also true in Chadha. I think if there is a
 12 difference, and this Court suggested there might be a
 13 difference in the TVA case, if there is a difference it's
 14 because there are certain Tenth Amendment challenges that
 15 have the nature of just an intrusion on State sovereignty 16 that's particularized. The hypothetical that the cases
 17 have often talked about is moving a State capital, and if
 18 the State doesn't object to moving the State capital, it's
 19 hard to see why an individual ought to be able to raise
 20 that question.
 21 I think the more important point, though, for
 22 this case is that there was a suggestion to this effect in
 23 this Court's TVA decision. If this Court wants to revisit
 24 that decision, it probably doesn't want to do it in a case
 25 where the Tenth Amendment challenge is not properly raised

28

1 and isn't even raised at all in the briefing before this
 2 Court until the conclusionary section of the brief.
 3 With respect to the enumerated powers questions,
 4 which I think are the gravamen of respondent's case and
 5 the Washington Supreme Court's decision, there's no
 6 question the individual has standing. That was true in
 7 this case, in this Court's decision in United States v.
 8 Lopez and would be equally true here.
 9 And I think this Court can take comfort in
 10 knowing that this is, at bottom, an enumerated powers
 11 case, not a Tenth Amendment case in any specialized sense,
 12 because the Washington State Supreme Court found it
 13 unobjectionable that section 409 would apply in its pre-
 14 1995 amendment version, and what that indicates is that
 15 there's nothing sacrosanct about State courts' procedures, 16 or State evidentiary rules.
 17 QUESTION: Don't you think that our opinion in
 18 the Commerce Clause case, in order to have persuasive
 19 force, should begin with an interpretation of the statute,
 20 recognize that a privilege can be waived or not waived? I
 21 find it very difficult to see how this opinion can be
 22 written when we're not sure of the reach of the statute.
 23 MR. CLEMENT: I agree with you entirely, Justice
 24 Kennedy, that this Court should define the scope of the
 25 statute before deciding whether or not it's

29

1 constitutional, and we would urge the United States'
 2 construction of the statute.
 3 I would say that the waiver question is somewhat
 4 different. I don't think the constitutionality of the
 5 statute turns on the waiver question. If the Court
 6 disagrees, we would urge the Court first to find that this
 7 privilege is not waivable at least in gross and, second,
 8 that even if it is waivable, the statute remains
 9 constitutional.
 10 QUESTION: Do we have a final State decision
 11 here, Mr. Clement?
 12 MR. CLEMENT: I think you do have a final State
 13 decision, and I think that's most clear with respect to
 14 the PDA action -- that's the State Public Disclosure Act
 15 that was brought -- because in that case the Washington 16 Supreme Court held that the four documents were
 17 disclosable and said that attorney's fees would be
 18 appropriate. In this --
 19 QUESTION: There was a fifth document, though,
 20 and they didn't -- there was no appeal on that one, right?
 21 MR. CLEMENT: Well, but there was no cross-
 22 appeal on that document either, Justice Scalia, so I think
 23 that document is no longer part of the case. When the
 24 Washington Court of Appeals held that four of the five
 25 documents needed to be disclosed, Pierce County took an

30

1 appeal to the Washington State Supreme Court, but I don't
 2 think that the Guillens filed a cross-appeal suggesting
 3 that the fifth document ought to be disclosed, and so I
 4 really think the fifth document is no longer in the case,
 5 and since the Washington Supreme Court found that
 6 attorney's fees were appropriate, that means that there
 7 was a final judgment. That's true both at the --
 8 QUESTION: Mr. Clement, there was -- you said
 9 that the PDA suit, the four documents were required to be
 10 turned over under that, but I thought the Washington
 11 Supreme Court said that accident reports from nonofficers,
 12 from witnesses, would not be disclosable under the PDA,
 13 though they would be subject to discovery under rule
 14 26(b), so the notion that the PDA suit was the one that
 15 determined that these four documents were required to be 16 turned over, I don't understand that, because I thought
 17 there was one part at least, the reports from nonofficers,
 18 that the county prevailed on before the Washington Supreme
 19 Court, but that it was a Pyrrhic victory because they lost
 20 on that point under 26(b).
 21 MR. CLEMENT: That's not how I read the
 22 decision, Justice Ginsburg. I thought -- I read the
 23 decision as the four documents were clearly going to be
 24 disclosed as part of the PDA action.
 25 QUESTION: Did you read the decision to say that

31

1 these documents are not disclosable under our Freedom of
 2 Information Act, nevertheless they can be discovered in a
 3 civil litigation?
 4 MR. CLEMENT: That's not, with respect, how I
 5 read the opinion. I read the opinion that those four
 6 documents are disclosable under the PDA. The only
 7 objection to disclosure under the PDA that was raised by
 8 the county was section 409, and with that issue resolved
 9 against the county, I took the import of the decision that
 10 those documents would be disclosed.
 11 At that point, I think it's clearly a final
 12 decision, because this Court has held in the Beckton
 13 Dickinson case in the context of section 1291 that the
 14 fact that attorney's fees need to be resolved on remand
 15 doesn't deprive a decision of finality, and in that 16 decision this Court relied on 1257 decisions, and so I
 17 would think that the same rule would apply in both
 18 contexts, so I think that the PDA action clearly is final.
 19 I think the tort action is a more difficult
 20 question as to whether that's final. I think this Court
 21 might have to change its -- to modify its precedents a
 22 bit, but I think it might be a wise course in light of
 23 what Congress has done here. I think this case is quite
 24 analogous to a case that this case found final called
 25 National Mercantile Bank v. Langdow, and in that case

32

1 there was a State venue provision that a Federal statute
 2 trumped, and the State supreme court found that the --
 3 this Court found that the State's decision saying that
 4 State law trumped the Federal statute was final, and I
 5 think the cases are quite parallel.
 6 They both involved congressional efforts to
 7 modify State procedure in order to serve a Federal
 8 interest, and in both cases when the State court
 9 disregarded the Federal interest and either through
 10 constitutional means or statutory means found the Federal
 11 statute inapplicable, this Court found that there was a
 12 final judgment in the Langdow case, and I think by
 13 extension of that decision, they could find a final
 14 judgment here.
 15 I think the main difference between this case 16 and Langdow is that in Langdow this Court took the
 17 position that upon remand there would be no further
 18 litigation available in the State court where the lawsuit
 19 was filed.
 20 Here, there might be some litigation that would
 21 go on in the tort action, for example, but I think the
 22 important thing is that the Federal interest has been
 23 extinguished, and I think if there's any play in the
 24 joints in this Court's finality decisions, I think that
 25 this would be a particularly important case to find a

33

1 final decision, because an act of Congress has been held
 2 unconstitutional.
 3 QUESTION: Do we need to find finality with
 4 respect to both?
 5 MR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, Your Honor. I
 6 think that these actions are severable. They were
 7 consolidated for purposes of appeal before the Washington
 8 Supreme Court, and I think that --
 9 QUESTION: So if I don't want to wrestle with
 10 the complexities of the tort action, what would we do,
 11 just dismiss that case as improvidently granted and decide
 12 the other one?
 13 MR. CLEMENT: I think that would be fair, or
 14 this Court could just sort of ignore the tort case and say
 15 that it's going to take jurisdiction over the PDA action 16 and decide this Federal statutory issue in the context of
 17 the State PDA action, and --
 18 QUESTION: Well, we can't ignore it. I mean,
 19 we've taken the case. We've granted certiorari. We've
 20 got to do something with it.
 21 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I --
 22 QUESTION: Just hide it under --
 23 QUESTION: There's only one case --
 24 MR. CLEMENT: I mean, I think that this Court
 25 could say that to the extent that the tort action is

34

1 before it, that that action is not final, and that -- or
 2 they're not going to -- the Court's not going to
 3 definitively resolve that, and that the PDA action is
 4 final.
 5 I would -- this Court in a different context
 6 actually managed to bifurcate a single case and say that
 7 one part of the case was final and the accounting action
 8 that was subject to remand was not final. That's the
 9 W. W. --
 10 QUESTION: We wouldn't want to do that too
 11 often, I think.
 12 (Laughter.)
 13 MR. CLEMENT: No, no, but I think if you can do
 14 that in a single case, I think you can certainly do it in
 15 a case like this, where they started as separate actions, 16 were consolidated only for purposes of appeal, and really
 17 have separate life.
 18 If, for example, this Court hadn't exercised
 19 jurisdiction, what would have happened is that the two
 20 cases would have gone back down. The PDA action would
 21 have been essentially over, because as the county
 22 suggested, there's nothing left in the PDA action on
 23 remand. The tort action would go on, and once the PDA
 24 action went back to the trial court, then it would have
 25 been appropriate to appeal that on a separate track from

35

1 the tort action, and there would have been really no point
 2 to making the county go through that exercise, and so I
 3 think the PDA action is final.
 4 If there are no further questions, I think the
 5 important submission from the Government is that the 1995
 6 amendments can be given force in a way that renders them
 7 still quite well within the Congress' power under the
 8 Commerce, Spending, and Necessary and Proper Clauses.
 9 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clement.
 10 Mr. Mungia, we'll hear from you.
 11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SALVADOR A. MUNGIA
 12 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 13 MR. MUNGIA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 14 please the Court:
 15 The statute does have to be construed, but 16 regardless of how the statute's construed, it clearly does
 17 not meet this Court's requirements under South Dakota v.
 18 Dole because 409 is not conditional. You read the plain
 19 language of 409, and it's not conditional in nature. It's
 20 a mandate, and if somehow it could be construed as being
 21 conditional, it's certainly ambiguous, as we've seen many
 22 interpretations and many questions as to the operation of
 23 409.
 24 409 cannot be justified under the Commerce
 25 Clause. It does not regulate commercial or economic

36

1 activity. Instead, it regulates State courts, and that is
 2 the peculiar nature of this dispute, because what is at
 3 issue is, is what does a State -- this is completely an
 4 intrastate concern.
 5 QUESTION: Why is it intrastate? If you simply
 6 have a -- if you interpret the statute to say, a document
 7 that is prepared primarily for this -- for getting money,
 8 primarily for getting money out of the Federal Government
 9 can't be discoverable in a tort action? What part of the
 10 Constitution would that violate, if that's how you
 11 interpret it?
 12 You'd get all your documents, I guess, and so
 13 would anyone like you, but that seems to be basically what
 14 the Government's arguing --
 15 MR. MUNGIA: Justice --
 16 QUESTION: I -- yes.
 17 MR. MUNGIA: Justice Breyer, I agree with the
 18 Solicitor General's interpretation of the statute, we
 19 still get our documents, and I do want to make it clear
 20 for the record, and I think it's clear in the briefs,
 21 Pierce County took a different tack on this and had a very
 22 wide scope of interpretation. However, despite that fact,
 23 there still has to be authority under the Commerce or
 24 Spending Clause, and I may not get it in this issue if we
 25 get our documents, that's correct, but I'm saying that no

37

1 matter what, the act has to have authority under some
 2 article I, section (a) basis.
 3 QUESTION: Well, that's certainly right, and so
 4 Congress says, we have a Federal interest in trying to
 5 minimize accidents, and in order to do that, we want to
 6 get information from the States when they want our money,
 7 and to be sure the information is accurate, we want to be
 8 sure that at least the information they give us, they're
 9 collecting with an eye towards being accurate rather than
 10 with an eye towards protecting themselves from tort
 11 litigation.
 12 MR. MUNGIA: Justice --
 13 QUESTION: It sounds reasonable to me. What's
 14 unreasonable about that?
 15 MR. MUNGIA: 
 Justice Breyer, because the 16 analysis starts, is this commercial or interstate activity
 17 that in fact the Federal Government is regulating, and
 18 they're not, they're regulating State courts. And
 19 again --
 20 QUESTION: But they're regulating in the
 21 interest of a commerce-type thing that's preventing
 22 automobile accidents.
 23 MR. MUNGIA: That is the disputable part, as to
 24 whether or not there's any evidence in, within -- not only
 25 in the record, or anywhere that can be found, whether this

38

1 action, indeed, would prevent any further accidents. All
 2 the statute does --
 3 QUESTION: When Congress makes that judgment,
 4 don't we owe it substantial deference? That is, we're not
 5 going to sit as a committee of Congress to determine
 6 whether there's a link between the condition of these
 7 intersections and vehicles going in and out of States. If
 8 Congress made that judgment, it's not for us to question
 9 it, is it?
 10 MR. MUNGIA: Justice Ginsburg, that is the
 11 historic and that is the correct analysis. This Court has
 12 been very deferential to Congress', even if there's
 13 something within the information source that could support
 14 that reasoning, and again I'll go to U.S. v. Lopez and
 15 U.S. v. Morrison for that proposition, where in U.S. v. 16 Lopez, there were no congressional findings at least this
 17 Court alluded to.
 18 They do not have to make congressional findings,
 19 as long as there's something out there, some information,
 20 and the same thing with U.S. v. Morrison. Even when
 21 Congress did make a congressional finding, this Court said
 22 we're not going to necessarily find that in fact they had
 23 a substantial effect on interstate commerce.
 24 QUESTION: May I ask you just to back up for a
 25 moment to address the question that Mr. Clement did about

39

1 the separateness of these two? Is there anything in the
 2 tort action that you are seeking that's different from the
 3 PDA action, or are these essentially two actions seeking
 4 the same material?
 5 MR. MUNGIA: Justice Ginsburg, no. They are
 6 seeking different materials, and the materials we sought
 7 in the tort action were much broader than what we sought
 8 in the Public Disclosure Act, and the materials -- I do
 9 want to say this as far as that, there is no judgment in
 10 the tort action. I mean, that should be clear. There is
 11 no final judgment. This is a discovery order that was
 12 taken up on interlocutory appeal.
 13 Now, whether or not there is a final judgment in
 14 the PDA action is a closer question, but I would point out
 15 to the Court, page 114 of the Washington State Supreme 16 Court's opinion that you'll find at Appendix A-114 directs
 17 the lower courts to make their rulings in accord with the
 18 court's opinion, and did not simply say these documents
 19 either are or are not discoverable, and thus it is
 20 debatable whether or not there is a final judgment even in
 21 the Public Disclosure Act case.
 22 QUESTION: But the way you interpreted it,
 23 although you say it's debatable, is that everything that
 24 falls under the PDA, everything that -- those four
 25 documents, those are not available to you. That's what

40

1 Mr. Clement said, I think, that that's what rendered the
 2 PDA action final.
 3 MR. MUNGIA: Correct, and I read the opinion
 4 differently, where in fact we do get those documents, and
 5 I -- we may have a fight back at the trial court as to the
 6 language of the Washington State Supreme Court, because I
 7 realize in its opinion it said that those would normally
 8 not be discoverable under the PDA, but then you have to
 9 look at the purpose of the documents.
 10 QUESTION: You set forth four alternative
 11 interpretations at page 20 of your brief. Do any of the
 12 documents involved in either of the tort action or the PDA
 13 action comprise just those set forth in your category 1,
 14 which is reports and data that the State agency actually
 15 prepares itself?
 16 MR. MUNGIA: Justice Kennedy, the documents that
 17 we sought under the PDA, even under the narrowest
 18 construction, under the narrowest construction, we get the
 19 documents, just on a statutory construction under the PDA
 20 request.
 21 QUESTION: But some of the documents you
 22 requested fit naturally within your category 1?
 23 MR. MUNGIA: Correct.
 24 QUESTION: All right.
 25 MR. MUNGIA: And so at least in this case, this

41

1 Court need not address the constitutional issues, finding
 2 no final judgment in the tort action and, in fact, a
 3 narrow construction for the PDA action.
 4 QUESTION: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understood. 
 5 You say the documents that you requested fell within
 6 category 1?
 7 MR. MUNGIA: Of our interpretation, which is a
 8 very narrow construction of the statute. That's correct,
 9 Justice Stevens.
 10 QUESTION: In other words, they were documents
 11 that were actually prepared to get highway funds?
 12 MR. MUNGIA: No, I'm sorry, if I --
 13 QUESTION: That's what I understood you to say.
 14 MR. MUNGIA: Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm saying we
 15 would get those documents under our construction. In
 16 other words, they do not fall within the parameters of
 17 that narrow construction, because these are documents that
 18 in fact were prepared by another agency.
 19 QUESTION: So in your view, none of the
 20 documents that you're -- that are in dispute fall within
 21 category 1.
 22 MR. MUNGIA: Correct, under the PDA action, that
 23 is correct, not the tort action but the PDA action.
 24 QUESTION: Do they fall in category 2? Can you
 25 tell us?

42

1 MR. MUNGIA: No. If they don't fall within
 2 category 1 -- I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy. If they fall
 3 within category 2, yes, they would. Under the PDA action,
 4 those documents would fall within --
 5 QUESTION: Documents the agency has in its
 6 possession?
 7 MR. MUNGIA: Correct, they fall within category
 8 2. And I do want to point out to this Court that, in
 9 fact, Pierce County's position, and it's shown in the
 10 record, was that we could not even discover the names of
 11 witnesses or the names of the people involved in the
 12 accidents, and that's surely not part of the Federal
 13 highway funding data, because why is the Federal
 14 Government concerned with the names of the people involved
 15 in the accidents, and I think this is a concern about 16 putting documents, if you will, in a black hole and
 17 allowing certain information which our supreme court has
 18 held is essential to the proper determination of these
 19 claims, based upon State and local law.
 20 They are essential to those determinations going
 21 in, and now no longer being discoverable. I think that is
 22 a very basic concern with this statute, and why at least
 23 one reason it should take a narrow construction, or at the
 24 very widest, the construction put forward by the Solicitor
 25 General.

43

1 QUESTION: But the construction put forward by
 2 the Solicitor General, as I understand it, is you can get
 3 it from the agency, like a law enforcement agency, but not
 4 from the Public Works Department if the purpose is to
 5 implement the Federal program. That's the Government's
 6 position?
 7 MR. MUNGIA: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.
 8 QUESTION: But under that position, I suppose,
 9 in the day when we have this great data base and all
 10 reports are there initially, then under the Government's
 11 approach, everything would be exempt from discovery. Do
 12 you read their position to say that?
 13 MR. MUNGIA: Correct, Justice Ginsburg, I do,
 14 and that is the day, if it's not today, that this court --
 15 QUESTION: No, I didn't read it that way. I
 16 thought what they were saying was consistent with if it --
 17 and maybe it's in this case. I don't think it is, but I
 18 mean, if you ever have the great single data base, you'd
 19 look to see whether the document was primarily created for
 20 the one purpose or the other. Where it's primarily
 21 created for accident reports, you get it. Where it's
 22 primarily created to get money from the Government, you
 23 don't. I mean, does that work as an interpretation? I'm
 24 not sure we have to reach it, but if we did?
 25 MR. MUNGIA: Justice Breyer, as far as

44

1 interpreting the electronic portion, it probably is a
 2 reasonable interpretation, and you're right, I mean, it's
 3 not part of this case, but it probably will have to be
 4 faced sooner or later.
 5 Going back to the scope, again, because we are
 6 talking about the interpretation of this, Pierce County
 7 took the position they were -- and this is in the
 8 companion Witmer case, which is the one -- there was a
 9 companion case at the State level, where private highway
 10 surveys done by, I believe it was the McDonald's and a
 11 Chevron Company, which the county then took within its
 12 possession, it was unwilling to disclose because under
 13 409, so again I think the county's position was a very
 14 broad one, that anything that goes in within their
 15 possession then becomes nondiscoverable and you cannot use 16 it, which I think is a completely unreasonable
 17 interpretation.
 18 I do want to take a few minutes and talk about
 19 the Spending Clause, because this is not a condition. If
 20 you read section 409, the plain language of 409, it's
 21 mandatory, and surely when Congress has intended to use
 22 its Spending Clause powers, I think especially in the
 23 Federal highway setting, it's been very clear.
 24 QUESTION: I don't see how you can characterize
 25 section 409 as a condition. It's an incentive provided

45

1 to -- for the State to participate in this Federal funding
 2 program. The Federal Government hopes to get information
 3 from the State, and thinks that they'll be more apt to get
 4 it by providing the protections of section 409. I don't
 5 see it as a condition at all.
 6 MR. MUNGIA: Justice O'Connor, I agree. I don't
 7 think it's a condition either. Whether you want to term
 8 it as an incentive or something else -- they term it as a
 9 mandate. I think regardless of how you term it, then it
 10 cannot be authorized under the Spending Clause.
 11 QUESTION: But --
 12 QUESTION: Well, why not? It's a necessary and
 13 proper means of ensuring that the Federal money is spent
 14 wisely and efficiently. Now, I don't see the big issue
 15 there, frankly.
 16 MR. MUNGIA: Under the Spending Clause analysis,
 17 this Court has long gone through through Pennhurst,
 18 through South Dakota v. Dole, and just recently in Durham
 19 v. Gorham, it's clear that the conditions have to be
 20 spelled out.
 21 Now, this is clearly some sort of imposition,
 22 and if it's not Spending Clause, then they'd have to have
 23 it under the Commerce Clause authority, which goes under
 24 another analysis.
 25 QUESTION: You'd have another --

46

1 QUESTION: No State has to participate in this
 2 program if it doesn't want to. If a State wants to turn
 3 down Federal money it can, can it not?
 4 MR. MUNGIA: It can turn down Federal money, and
 5 that's the interesting, Mr. Chief Justice, about 409. 
 6 Again, just reading the plain language of 409, it is
 7 mandatory, and there's no provision -- even if you cross-
 8 reference to 152, there's nothing which puts anybody on
 9 notice about how this -- how a State can avoid the
 10 mandates of 409.
 11 QUESTION: Well, it can avoid --
 12 QUESTION: But you can agree, nonetheless, that
 13 a State can refuse to participate? You say you can't, by
 14 reading 409, tell that it isn't just a legislative command
 15 based on something other than the Spending Clause, but 16 don't -- you do agree, don't you, that if a State didn't
 17 take the Federal money, it would not be bound by 409?
 18 MR. MUNGIA: Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's
 19 an open question, and I don't necessarily agree with that.
 20 I think you have to read the plain language, and it seems
 21 like Congress is saying you will do this.
 22 QUESTION: You think it's just categorical,
 23 then?
 24 MR. MUNGIA: Correct.
 25 QUESTION: But how could that be if -- how could

47

1 any document be collected for the purpose of participating
 2 in the Federal program if the State doesn't participate in
 3 the Federal program?
 4 MR. MUNGIA: Because if you read section 152,
 5 what it mandates States to do is come up with a list and a
 6 survey of hazardous sites. That's all it says, in 52(a),
 7 that's the mandatory part.
 8 So Congress, if it has the authority, can tell
 9 the States, do this list. Now, the question, that begs
 10 the question whether or not Congress has that authority. 
 11 I think then that's when you have to turn to the
 12 Commerce --
 13 QUESTION: Do the list whether or not you have
 14 any Federal money, is that what you're saying? This is
 15 not tied to Federal spending. 
 That's what you seem to be 16 saying. That it's independent Federal obligation on the
 17 States whether or not they receive any Federal money. Is
 18 that how you read 152?
 19 MR. MUNGIA: Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. 
 20 I think if you read the plain language, 152, unlike 23
 21 U.S.C. 131, 141, 159, 161, where it's clear that Congress
 22 says you must control highway billboard signs or you lose
 23 10 percent of your funding, you must control size and
 24 weights of vehicles that go on interstate highways or you
 25 lose 10 percent of your funding. Those are all clear.

48

1 In fact, in the Dole case, under 23 U.S.C. 158,
 2 I think that the title of the act was withdrawal of
 3 Federal funds.
 4 QUESTION: Aren't we losing sight of the fact,
 5 the rather plain fact that the States and the counties
 6 wanted this? They weren't satisfied with the program
 7 originally because they feared these documents would be
 8 discoverable, and make the county liable. Do you have
 9 another Spending Clause case where the States and the
 10 counties came to Congress and said, please give us a
 11 privilege, and then say, well, now it's mandatory and it's
 12 some kind of a club rather than a carrot?
 13 MR. MUNGIA: Justice Ginsburg, I have two
 14 responses. One, I think actually this Court addressed
 15 that same sort of analysis in New York v. U.S., where the 16 Solicitor General argued that because New York officials
 17 wanted the benefits of the Low-Level Hazardous Waste Act,
 18 therefore it cannot later challenge certain provisions of
 19 that act, and this Court rejected that argument.
 20 QUESTION: But this very provision they wanted,
 21 not the thing in general.
 22 MR. MUNGIA: And that goes -- then to my second
 23 part of my response is, and I think it's a fundamental
 24 part of the constitutional analysis, because here, if the
 25 States wanted this protection they had the means to do it

49

1 themselves, and this Court has explained, again citing
 2 from New York v. U.S., State sovereignty isn't for the
 3 benefit of the States, it's for the benefit of the
 4 citizens to derive the benefits of liberty from the
 5 division of separate powers, so it really, just because
 6 State officials want it, it's clearly that the people of
 7 the State of Washington did not want this, because it
 8 infringed upon a State cause of action. In fact, so much
 9 so that the State supreme court was willing to hold it was
 10 unconstitutional.
 11 QUESTION: Well, that goes to the waiver point. 
 12 I assume the State can waive it if its citizens instruct
 13 it to do so, or maybe not. The Government says no.
 14 MR. MUNGIA: I -- Justice Kennedy, you look at
 15 the language, and in fact you look at the early responses 16 by Pierce County, where Pierce County clearly said, we
 17 cannot -- I mean, we must -- we don't have that choice. 
 18 We cannot --
 19 QUESTION: The hypothetical is that the State
 20 could waive it if it wanted to. That's the --
 21 MR. MUNGIA: And Justice Kennedy --
 22 QUESTION: -- hypothetical question.
 23 MR. MUNGIA: Yes, and I -- Justice Kennedy, my
 24 response is, I don't see how the State could, because I
 25 think just for the very reasons, as was pointed out by the

50

1 Solicitor General, where do you cross that line between, I
 2 guess, a single waiver, and then it becoming endemic. I
 3 think that's the whole problem here.
 4 Under the recent cases under the Commerce
 5 Clause, and again I just want to spend a couple of minutes
 6 on the U.S. v. Lopez and Morrison cases, it seems clear
 7 that again this type of activity, what's being regulated
 8 is, in fact, State courts, in fact, the admissibility, the
 9 discovery of evidence, and that is certainly intrastate,
 10 and there's no contention here that somehow justice, or
 11 the discovery of documents is somehow commercial in
 12 nature, and you cannot make that argument, so I think
 13 there is no basis under either the Spending or the
 14 Commerce Clause to support this legislation.
 15 QUESTION: 
 Well, is it irrelevant under your 16 argument that the object of the Federal legislation is
 17 safety in an artery of commerce? Is that beside the
 18 point?
 19 MR. MUNGIA: Justice Souter, the object at least
 20 for the Federal Highway Act is safety. I don't think the
 21 same thing can be said about 409, because then you're
 22 becoming -- as this Court said in U.S. v. Lopez, you're
 23 building inference upon inference, because you have to go
 24 and say, if these documents are no longer, in fact,
 25 discoverable, would it result in safer interstate travel,

51

1 and there's just too many intermediate steps.
 2 QUESTION: So you that think the Federal
 3 interest in this case is comparable to the Federal
 4 interest in Lopez, the ultimate interest?
 5 MR. MUNGIA: I think that the -- Justice Souter,
 6 the Federal interest in section 409 --
 7 QUESTION: No, I'm talking about the ultimate
 8 Federal interest that gives rise to all of this
 9 regulation, which is the safety of an artery of commerce. 
 10 Are you either disputing that that is the object, or are
 11 you saying that that object is on par for constitutional
 12 purposes with the significance of the Government's object
 13 in Lopez?
 14 MR. MUNGIA: Justice Souter, I think it's more
 15 the latter. 
 I'm saying that the Federal Government 16 certainly has an interest in the safe passage of
 17 interstate --
 18 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Mungia.
 19 Mr. Hamilton, you have 3 minutes remaining.
 20 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. HAMILTON
 21 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 22 MR. HAMILTON: Thank you, Your Honor.
 23 Very quickly -- 3 minutes, quickly -- I would
 24 like to correct I think what was a misstatement by
 25 respondent's counsel, or at least one of them, dealing

52

1 with what the Court should do if it adopts the United
 2 States' position. Plaintiffs say that if you adopt that
 3 position, then they get the documents.
 4 I'll point out that on page 24 of their own
 5 respondents' brief they say their -- interpretation
 6 number 2, which they say the U.S. reflects, they say on
 7 page 24, if the Court construes the statute in this
 8 fashion, then a remand would be necessary to determine
 9 which specific discovery requests would be precluded and
 10 which would be, still be allowed. They're not entitled,
 11 even under their own admission, under the U.S. position,
 12 and in fact I would point out on page 20 of our reply,
 13 yellow brief, where we point out that in fact, if that
 14 were the case, even if the U.S. position were adopted,
 15 these particular documents would have to be protected. 16 Furthermore, obviously there is some confusion
 17 as to where we differ with the United States, and it's a
 18 very narrow difference. We both agree that generated
 19 documents are protected. We both agree that collected and
 20 compiled documents in the hands of Public Works are
 21 protected, and we both agree that in some situations
 22 they're protected in the hands of third parties.
 23 They, though, very narrowly define that in
 24 situations where the third party gets it, is a transferee
 25 agency, where you can only get it by indexing, or where

53

1 it's part of a computer base.
 2 I would ask the Court to consider its own
 3 St. Regis Paper Company case, where it addressed a statute
 4 that only made a protection when it was in the hands of
 5 third parties or officials, and it contrasted the language
 6 of that statute with other statutes, 45 U.S.C. section 41,
 7 and 49-320, whose wording is almost identical to 409. If
 8 you would compare those, you would see that the case
 9 distinguished those types of statutes from a statute only
 10 protecting in the hands of third parties.
 11 So whatever 409 does, it certainly protects more
 12 than just in the hands of third parties, and I would also
 13 like to point out, the reason why we differ from the U.S.,
 14 we believe their logic is correct with protecting in the
 15 transferee hands and in a computer data base and where 16 it's indexed, but if you carry that logic through, we
 17 believe a bright line rule should be established by this
 18 Court, because obviously the State courts have been
 19 very -- some State courts, a minority of State courts have
 20 been very resistant.
 21 Other State courts have been trying to do their
 22 best to comply with the language of the statute, but some
 23 States, of course, have found every opportunity to try to
 24 misinterpret the statute, and it required Congress at
 25 least twice to amend the statute to get back to what they

54

1 intended.
 2 When you look at the situation of why they
 3 wanted, the Solicitor General believed that documents in
 4 the hands of the transferee agency are protected, they
 5 said that the reason for that was that they would not
 6 exist but for the planning agency's collection of that
 7 information. Well, so, too, accident reports would not
 8 exist in their totally different form, they would not be
 9 indexed and therefore accessible, and they would not be in
 10 the county's possession but for the Highway Safety Act, so
 11 you extend that logic through, then you come to a bright
 12 line rule which we believe the Court should adopt.
 13 Thank you, Your Honor.
 14 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
 15 Hamilton. The case is submitted.

 17 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
