3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 14857, CampbellEwald

5 Company v. Gomez.

6             Mr. Garre.

7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10 and may it please the Court:

11             To affirm the Ninth Circuit on the first two

12 questions presented, this Court must accept the

13 following two propositions:

14             First, a plaintiff can force a court to

15 adjudicate the merits of his claim simply by refusing

16 the defendant's offer of capitulation and complete

17 relief.

18             And, second, that a plaintiff has what

19 amounts to a substantive right to class litigation that

20 applies as soon as the complaint is filed and that

21 entitles the case to proceed even if his individual

22 claim drops out before 

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there any controversy

24 over whether the  the  the offer is complete relief?

25             MR. GARRE:  I don't think so, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
4 1 The district court found that it was at page 40 of the 2 Petition Appendix.  The Ninth Circuit decided this case 3 based on that premise.  That's at page 5a of the 4 Petition Appendix. 5             So I think as the case comes  6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we take it on that 7 assumption, too? 8             MR. GARRE:  I think you should, Your Honor. 9             Now  now, they have argued below that the 10 only reason that it wasn't for complete relief was that 11  because it didn't provide for attorneys' fees.  But 12 the TCPA, the underlying statute here, does not provide 13 for attorneys' fees. 14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's a merits question 15 as to whether they're entitled to attorneys' fees.  If 16 the question is complete  you know, "complete relief" 17 means what the plaintiff has asked for.  The plaintiff 18 has asked for attorneys' fees here. 19             MR. GARRE:  I don't think that's what 20 "complete relief" means, Your Honor.  I think it means 21 that the plaintiff has received everything that he 22 could  that he could if he received a judgment in this 23  in his favor  24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, he would  he 25 would receive a finding of liability, which you didn't
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 admit in your offer.

5

2             MR. GARRE:  He  I 

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He would  he would be

4 entitled to an injunction against that activity, the

5 activity that caused this particular situation, and if

6 others were shown, to an injunction in other ways.

7             So I don't see how this could be  putting

8 aside the class action, putting aside the attorneys'

9 fees, those appear to me to be fairly critical liability

10 determinations that were not made by the court below.

11             MR. GARRE:  Okay.  First, as the case comes

12 to the Court, I think it is accepted that the offer was

13 for complete relief.

14             Now let me try to answer the points that you

15 raise.

16             First, he's not entitled to a finding of

17 liability.  If a litigant was always entitled to a

18 finding of liability, then essentially no case could

19 become moot.  If you take the voluntary cessation

20 context, a litigant could always insist that he's still

21 entitled to the finding of liability.

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It  it seems that you

23 want us to write an  an opinion saying that a

24 settlement offer is equivalent to a judgment.  And we've

25 had cases, like the Kokkonen case, in which there was a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 settlement approved by the court, case dismissed, then 2 the settlement was not performed.  They went to court 3 seeking an injunction.  The court said, no, no.  You 4 have a contract.  You have to file again.  You have to 5 go into a different court.  You have to start all over 6 again. 7             A settlement offer and a settlement contract 8 and a settlement agreement are different from a 9 judgment, and you do not have a judgment. 10             MR. GARRE:  Well, Your Honor, I think that 11 the accepted principle is that a settlement moots the 12 case and requires the court to dispose of the case.  I 13 mean, I think that's the accepted principle.  And  14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you didn't pursue 15 that.  You didn't apply under the rules for a judgment. 16             MR. GARRE:  Well  17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And  and  and if you 18 want us to write an opinion and say, oh, well, a 19 settlement offer is the same as a judgment, that just 20 doesn't accord with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 21 or with our cases like the Kokkonen case. 22             MR. GARRE:  Well, Your Honor, I think  I 23 think this case is consistent with the Kokkonen case. 24 What the Kokkonen case recognized is that, once a case 25 has come to an end, the Court has ancillary jurisdiction
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to dispose of it.  In that case it dealt with the

7

2 enforcement of a consent decree.

3             Here our fundamental 

4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the Federal rule in

5 point, Mr. Garre  and it says  Rule 68 says an offer

6 of judgment expires automatically after 14 days if it's

7 not accepted.  It is deemed withdrawn, and it cannot be

8 used for any purpose other than to saddle the plaintiff

9 with costs if she doesn't get more than the offer.

10             So we have a Federal rule directly in point,

11 and that instructs litigants what an offer of judgment

12 means.  Why do we look any further than that?

13             MR. GARRE:  Well, first, Your Honor, this

14 case, there was not only the Rule 68 offer of judgment,

15 but a freestanding settlement offer.  So we think that

16 the mechanics of Rule 68 don't apply here.  It's 

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, isn't that rather

18 an end run around the offer of judgment?

19             MR. GARRE:  Well, I don't  I don't think

20 so.  I mean, it still presents the question of whether

21 the controversy still exists given that the defendant

22 has offered the plaintiff everything that he  he could

23 secure through a Federal judgment.

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The plaintiff  the

25 plaintiff asks for class action, didn't get that because

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1 they weren't far  far along enough for the plaintiff 2 even to move for certification. 3             MR. GARRE:  And the plaintiff in Genesis 4 Healthcare asked for a collective action.  The Court 5 found that that allegation did not  6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the collective action 7 is simply a device for permissive joinder.  It's quite 8 different, as Genesis recognized. 9             Class action  I don't remember Justice 10 Thomas' exact words, but it's a whole different kettle 11 of fish. 12             MR. GARRE:  Well, I mean, here's how I think 13 it's different, Your Honor. 14             You're right.  It is different.  But it's 15 different in that this Court has repeatedly said that 16 the class has no independent legal status until it's 17 certified.  And it's different in that, in Genesis 18 Healthcare, you had a statutory right to a collective 19 action, but the Court said that that didn't trump 20 Article III. 21             And here you just  22             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  All it  all it is  23 it's an invitation to people to join you.  That's all  24 all that  it's a permissive joinder. 25             MR. GARRE:  Well, it was still pretty
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 important to the plaintiff in that case, and it was a

9

2 statutory right.

3             And here the question is:  When the

4 individual claim drops out, is there any basis for the

5 action to proceed simply so that, on the  on the

6 potential that a class could be certified?

7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One  one is  is that

8 potential.

9             The other is, it's not that I would be

10 entitled to attorneys' fees from the loser, but if

11 there's a class, then there are a lot of other people

12 who will share in the attorneys' fees and I'll have to

13 pay less.

14             MR. GARRE:  And that  that's the

15 costsharing argument that was made in Roper.

16             And if I could say a couple things about

17 that.

18             First, the plaintiff in this case, unlike

19 the plaintiff in Roper, never made that argument below.

20 He never argued in favor of cost sharing.  In fact, the

21 complaint, if you look on page 21 of the Joint Appendix,

22 touts that he has all the financial resources necessary

23 to bring this action.

24             Second of all, in Roper the Court relied on

25 that interest solely for the purpose of allowing the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 appeal from the denial of certification when the mooting 2 event occurred after the denial of certification. 3             So there you had a real relation back issue. 4 If the Court had been wrong in denying certification, 5 then the case never would have become moot in the first 6 place. 7             Here, the mooting event takes place before 8 certification.  There's nothing to relate back to. 9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if I could go back a 10 little bit, Mr. Garre.  And this is, I think, the 11 question that Justice Scalia started with. 12             There are a number of things that you've 13 said, well, he asked for it, but he's not entitled to 14 it.  He asked for attorneys' fees, but he's not entitled 15 to attorneys' fees.  And he asked for an injunction or 16 declaratory relief, and he's not entitled to that.  And 17 he asked for class certification, but he's not entitled 18 to that, and so the case is moot. 19             And the "so the case is moot" seems to me to 20 be a non sequitur.  In other words, he's asked for these 21 things, you haven't offered these things, and there's a 22 dispute about whether he's entitled to these things. 23             Now, you might be completely right as to 24 that, "He's not entitled to attorneys' fees."  But that 25 has to be adjudicated.  You can't  a court can't just
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 say, oh, you've offered complete relief, because in his 2 view you haven't offered complete relief, and that's 3 what the litigation is all about. 4             MR. GARRE:  And a court can make that 5 determination, just like a court can determine whether 6 or not a defendant who says he's going to stop his 7 action has truly voluntarily ceased his action. 8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  A court can absolutely make 9 that determination.  But the question is:  Does the 10 court make that determination in the guise of a mootness 11 motion? 12             MR. GARRE:  Well, I think it absolutely 13 does, just like it would in the voluntary cessation 14 context. 15             I  I want to be clear because I think we 16 have a little bit of a  17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why can't it  why 18 can't it do that in the context of a summary judgment 19 motion?  I mean, why does it have to moot the case? 20 Wouldn't the appropriate vehicle be a summary judgment 21 motion in which you admit the facts that make you 22 liable, or you concede the facts that make you liable, 23 and then you fight about the legal questions? 24             MR. GARRE:  The  the reason is, when  25 when one party throws in the towel, the match is over.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             Here, the question is whether there's an

12

2 Article III case or controversy when the defendant is no

3 longer fighting over the result as to the thing at

4 issue.  That's  those are the words that the Court

5 used in the San Pablo case.  That's an Article III

6 determination.

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I  but what's an

8 Article III determination is whether he or it or she is

9 entitled to the relief that they asked for.  May well be

10 they're not.

11             MR. GARRE:  And functionally 

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they're entitled to

13 have the court say it, not you.

14             MR. GARRE:  A  a court can certainly make

15 the determination of whether or not they have provided

16 complete relief.  In a case like this where you're

17 dealing with liquidated damages, that's easy.

18             It's just 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  By the way, you called

20 this a "freestanding offer," but I have it right here,

21 and the  offer says, "Offer of judgment pursuant to

22 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68."

23             This was your client's submission.

24             MR. GARRE:  No  well, you're right, Your

25 Honor.  That's the Rule 68 offer.  If you go on page 57a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of the Petition Appendix, there's the freestanding

13

2 settlement offer, which isn't a Rule 68 offer.

3             The other thing about Rule 68 is it's really

4 not designed for the situation of complete relief.  It's

5 designed for the situation where the defendant and

6 plaintiff have to gamble, essentially, over whether or

7 not an offer for less than complete relief is a

8 sufficient  they  they want to settle on that basis.

9             In this case you had a freestanding

10 settlement offer.  It provided for complete relief, and

11 so the question is whether or not the  the plaintiff

12 had a personal stake in the case sufficient  in the

13 outcome of the case sufficient to keep this case alive.

14             Justice Kennedy, to get back to your point

15 about settlement  and I think what's important to

16 recognize here is  here's our position:  When the

17 offer of complete relief is made and when a court has

18 determined that it is, indeed, for complete relief, then

19 the case has to come to an end.  Now, whether you say

20 it's  it's moot at that precise moment or whether you

21 say it starts the ball rolling down the hill towards a

22 dismissal or entry of judgment for the plaintiff based

23 on the terms of the offer, the point is  is that when

24 the defendant has offered everything, the courts can't

25 go ahead and expound on the law.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1             Now, this Court has repeatedly said, when 2 it's not necessary to decide, it's necessary not to 3 decide.  And that's the fundamental principle at stake 4 here.  Defendant has offered everything, and the 5 plaintiff  6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose one day after the 7 offer the defendant defaulted.  Would a case that's now 8  was once moot now become nonmoot? 9             MR. GARRE:  Well, and that would be an 10 unusual situation if it did, Your Honor.  I think  11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It happened in Kokkonen. 12 We had a case on it here in the Court. 13             MR. GARRE:  And  and  you know, Roper's 14 another case where there was an offer that the Court 15 never  it didn't really question in that case whether 16 the offer mooted the claim on the merits.  The only 17 question was whether they could appeal the denial of 18 certification.  Here the plaintiff's position is asking 19 this Court to go far beyond what the Court recognized in 20 Roper and really to recognize a substantive right to 21 class adjudication.  At the end of the day, that's what 22 they're insisting on.  As soon as they filed their class 23 complaint  24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  A substantive  how 25 about a procedural right to litigate entitlement to
Alderson Reporting Company

1 class status?

Official

15

2             MR. GARRE:  I  I don't think you can

3 describe it as a procedural right.  This Court has said

4 that Rule 23 is a procedural mechanism.  When the

5 requirements are met, it said that there's no separate

6 legal status for the class until the class is certified.

7 In the Jacobs 

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why is it that we

9 permit relation back at all 

10             MR. GARRE:  Well.

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   if  if we have

12 cases that say when a case has become moot in the middle

13 of the litigation, it can relate back to the beginning?

14             MR. GARRE:  Okay.  Well, first of all 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If mootness is mootness,

16 mootness is mootness, right?

17             MR. GARRE:  Yes.  First of all, the Court

18 has recognized two narrow exceptions, Your Honor.  First

19 is an appeal from the denial of class certification when

20 the mooting event happens while a case is on appeal.

21 That's the Roper case.  And the second is the inherently

22 transitory exception.

23             Now, it's not even clear that the

24 Respondents are asking for either exception, because I

25 don't see "relation back" or "inherently transitory" in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 their red brief.  But it's clear that the first

16

2 exception doesn't apply because this case doesn't

3 involve an appeal from the denial of class

4 certification, and it's clear that the second case

5 exception doesn't apply, "inherently transitory,"

6 because in Genesis, this Court made clear that the

7 concern of the socalled picking off wasn't a sufficient

8 basis to say that a claim was inherently transitory.

9 That exception doesn't deal with the defendant's

10 litigation conduct; it deals with whether the claimant's

11 conduct is going to recur, like a pretrial temporary

12 detention situation.  This case doesn't fit into this 

13 that exception at all.  What 

14             JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the  what if the

15 defendant  I  did you finish your answer?

16             MR. GARRE:  Yes, Your Honor.

17             JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the defendant has

18 very shaky finances, maybe on the verge of bankruptcy,

19 or has a history of reneging on promises, and  but

20 the  the offer to provide full relief moots the case,

21 even in that situation?

22             MR. GARRE:  So a  a couple answers to

23 that, Your Honor.  First, that's not an issue in this

24 case.  They've never disputed CampbellEwald's ability

25 to pay.  Second of all, I think a court can determine

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1 that the plaintiff  the defendant is ready and able to 2 pay.  And third of all, in the situation where the case 3 is dismissed for mootness based on the terms of the 4 offer and then it turns out that they can't execute the 5 offer  I mean, that's a situation where the court  6 the plaintiff can go back to the court and say, you 7 based  you  you dismissed the case on an erroneous 8 factual premise.  That's like the Judge Friendly 9 decision that we cite in our reply brief.  So that 10 situation is not going to happen. 11             And all of these practical concerns are 12 going to go away if this Court recognizes in this case 13 that a defendant's offer of complete relief ends any 14 case or controversy over the individual claim.  The case 15 goes away.  The plaintiffs are going to accept the 16 offer. 17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can the offer of complete 18 relief from a solvent defendant where it looks like the 19 relief will be forthcoming, if  if you lose this case 20 and so the case is not moot, could still be considered 21 as a factor in the court's decision whether or not to 22 certify the class? 23             MR. GARRE:  I don't think  it certainly 24 wouldn't be a classic certification decision factor, 25 Your Honor.  And I think  I mean, one of the reasons
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 why the court insists on an Article III case or

18

2 controversy is that it wants to insist that it doesn't

3 expound on the law, but 

4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In other words, the class

5 certification goes along without reference to whether

6 the lead plaintiff has any injury any longer?

7             MR. GARRE:  Well, it's a  it's certainly a

8 very unusual situation where the personal representative

9 has been made whole.  Now  now, there's some claims 

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's why I asked if the

11 trial judge could, in his discretion, consider that as a

12 factor in certifying or not certifying 

13             MR. GARRE:  Well, I suppose that he could in

14 terms of the person represented, but the real question

15 is:  Why would you want a court to expound on the law

16 difficult questions about certification, as this Court

17 knows as well as anyone, when there's no case or

18 controversy to begin with, when the defendant has

19 offered the plaintiff everything?  And then the question

20 is:  If his individual claim drops out, what

21 interests  to put it in Judge Friendly's terms, what

22 interest does a  does a plaintiff have 

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You keep referring, but

24 you  multiple times in your brief and now twice  but

25 in the case that Judge Friendly dealt with, the class

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 claims had already been done and dispensed with,

19

2 distinguished, extinguished.  So it wasn't a case of a

3 class certification not yet ruled on; it was ruled on.

4 The class action was out of the case.  It was only the

5 individual.

6             MR. GARRE:  Well, you're right, Your Honor,

7 about that distinction, but I think what Judge Friendly

8 said applies equally here, which is that when a

9 plaintiff loses his individual interests in the case, he

10 has no  no right to  to litigate on a class action

11 because it might benefit others.

12             He also pointed out that the offer of

13 complete relief in this case, in this kind of situation,

14 puts the plaintiff in a better position than a default

15 judgment.  The plaintiff has everything that he asks

16 for.  He's walking away with the money.

17             And to your point earlier, Justice

18 Sotomayor, just to be clear, the offer in this case

19 included a stipulation to an injunction as well.  So

20 that 

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's for future

22 conduct, not  not directed to the conduct  the

23 direct conduct at issue here.  But I 

24             MR. GARRE:  Well if  you can't undo past

25 conduct.

20 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  I  you know, I 2 looked at the three railroad cases that you cited as 3 proof that this has always been the case, but do you 4 have anything besides those things?  In the common law, 5 I can't find any situation in which a court accepted a 6 offer that wasn't accepted by the party.  In the 7 railroad cases, what they found was that an offer was 8 made and the other side, by taking money, accepted the 9 offer. 10             MR. GARRE:  No, but  11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Have you found any case 12 in the common law that  where there was an offer that 13 was unaccepted, was entered by the court? 14             MR. GARRE:  Well, three responses to that. 15 First, in the San Pablo case, for example, the court's 16 decision specifically makes clear that the plaintiff 17 refused that offer. 18             Second of all  19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you've had to  you 20 had to deposit the money in an account in the name of 21 the plaintiff.  And San Pablo turned on a provision of 22 the California Civil Code that said an obligation for 23 payment is extinguished, is extinguished by an offer of 24 payment, if the money is immediately deposited in a 25 reputable bank in the name of a creditor.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. GARRE:  That's  that's, of course,

21

2 right, Your Honor.  But, of course, if acceptance was

3 the rule, then it's a little bit odd that the court

4 didn't mention the fact that he didn't accept it at all.

5             The other point I wanted to make in response

6 to Justice Sotomayor's question is:  We cited a long

7 footnote in our opening brief that has many cases

8 recognizing this principle, and in our reply brief, we

9 cite the holding case out of the English courts.  It's

10 an 1840 case, and that case is exactly on point.  It

11 involved a situation where a claim was brought for a

12 debt, the defendant came in and said, here's your money,

13 and the court in that case  the plaintiff refused to

14 accept it.  And the court in that case said it had a

15 beholden duty to end the case, given that the  the

16 defendant had offered everything that the 

17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Mr. Garre 

18             MR. GARRE:   plaintiff was seeking.

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:   and this is very much

20 along the same lines  you know, you  you have an old

21 English case.  You have these three cases in the '90s,

22 1890s, which were really about liabilities had  that

23 had already been satisfied, and the court said, it's

24 already been satisfied, payment has already been made.

25 But there's really no history at all  and tender

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 offers have existed for a long, long time.

22

2             There's no history at all of  of saying

3 that a tender offer moots a case, as opposed to the

4 classic understanding, the common law understanding, of

5 tender offers was that it created an incentive for

6 parties, and that that was their purpose and that was

7 their effect, was to incentivize parties to do

8 something, but not to  for  not to provide a

9 mechanism for a court just to throw out a case when a

10 party decided that, for whatever reason, he thought that

11 the tender offer was not good enough.

12             MR. GARRE:  So I think first  just a

13 quibble  I do think there's a longstanding practice of

14 recognizing that when the defendant has been offered

15 everything he could secure, the case goes away.

16             Second of all, and I think, you know, maybe

17 more important:  I mean, I would say that your dissent

18 in Genesis Healthcare itself  itself recognizes that

19 acceptance can't be the rule in all cases.  I mean, you

20 recognize in the situation where the plaintiff doesn't

21 accept for obstinacy or madness, but once you're there,

22 you recognize that acceptance can't be the rule.  And

23 that's got to be right, because in the voluntary

24 cessation context, we don't require the plaintiff to

25 accept that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but I  I said that 2 mootness is not the appropriate remedy in that case. 3             The appropriate remedy in a case where it's 4 absolutely clear that  that the  that the defendant 5 has given  has offered the plaintiff everything the 6 plaintiff has asked for, which it's not in this case, 7 but where it's absolutely clear, where the defendant has 8 offered everything that the plaintiff himself has asked 9 for, the appropriate thing to do, in order to prevent 10 wasteful litigation, is not to dismiss the case for 11 mootness, but to grant judgment in favor of the 12 plaintiff. 13             MR. GARRE:  And  and I think here  I 14 mean, once we're at the point where we realize this case 15 can't  can't go on any further because he's been 16 offered everything as the case comes to this Court, then 17 the  then the question for the Court is, well, how do 18 we dispose of it?  Do we tell the lower court to dismiss 19 it as moot, or do we tell the lower court to enter 20 judgment for plaintiff based on the terms of the offer, 21 at which point it clearly becomes moot? 22             I mean, this Court  23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it doesn't become 24 moot.  It's just been decided.  It's  there's been an 25 adjudication at that point.
Alderson Reporting Company

1             MR. GARRE:  No, there hasn't been 

24

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's nothing to dismiss.

3             MR. GARRE:  There hasn't been an

4 adjudication, Your Honor.  It's judgment entered based

5 on the terms of the offer.  It's not a judgment

6 adjudicating the claim on the merits.  It's not a

7 judgment where the Court is picking a winner or loser.

8 The Court is simply recognizing the fact that the

9 defendant has offered everything and a judgment is

10 entered 

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Garre, the only way

12 that I see a court entering judgment in the Federal

13 Rules of Civil Procedure is a Rule 56 judgment.

14             Someone moves and says, you got everything

15 you're entitled to.  The other side comes back and says,

16 no, I'm entitled to attorneys' fees, I'm entitled to

17 whatever.  And the court says, no, you're not; this is a

18 full satisfaction; I enter judgment.

19             I don't know why we have to make a merits

20 determination based solely on an unaccepted offer of

21 judgment.

22             MR. GARRE:  Well, first of all, a judgment

23 is just technically an order disposing of the case.  I

24 mean, we went back and looked, and you yourself as a

25 district court judge issued judgments in cases where you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1 dismissed it as moot.  It just reflects that the case 2 has come to an end. 3             Second of all, what we've recognized as an 4 alternative position is the Sixth Circuit position here, 5 which is that  that in this situation you can dispose 6 of the case by entering judgment for plaintiff based on 7 the terms of the offer.  That's not a judgment on the 8 merits because it's not adjudicating the claim on the 9 merits. 10             It's not picking a winner, not involving the 11 court picking a winner  a loser or winner, and it 12 resolves all of the hypothetical concerns that they've 13 raised about eliminating the case before they actually 14 have the check in hand.  And that's  that's an 15 appropriate way of disposing of this case.  And no one 16 can argue that there's an Article III interest in  in 17 proceeding with the litigation once they have a judgment 18 disposing of the case. 19             And we're back to  20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you do with the 21 pleading rules that say payment and accord and 22 satisfaction are affirmative defenses? 23             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, those are  those 24 are  accord and satisfaction, for example, is a 25 contractbased doctrine.  It happens where  where
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 payment is made before the case gets to litigation.

26

2 There's  there's no principle.

3             Once the  once the litigation begins, the

4 principle that controls is Article III.  Article III's

5 case and controversy requirement requires that the

6 plaintiff had a  have a personal stake, a live

7 personal stake in the outcome of the case at all stages

8 of the proceeding.

9             And on the first question, our point is that

10 once you've been offered everything you could receive 

11 and again, that's how the case comes here, and he has

12 been offered everything that he could get through a

13 favorable judgment on his individual claim  there's no

14 longer a personal stake in litigating that case to the

15 outcome 

16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the personal

17 stake that a wouldbe class representative has in

18 getting a bonus or an 

19             MR. GARRE:  Just as was true in Genesis

20 Healthcare, the wouldbe class representative is in the

21 same exact position he was before this case goes away,

22 because he can still file his own claim.  He can settle

23 that claim.  He can provide  he can file his own class

24 action.

25             And you know, here, what we're arguing about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 is policy arguments about whether or not the Court ought 2 to find some basis to keep the class action alive. 3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's  4             MR. GARRE:  That's not an appropriate 5 determination of Article III. 6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How could he file a class 7 action on your theory?  That's what he wanted to do, and 8 he was stopped very early on by this offer of judgment. 9             MR. GARRE:  Well, this  this gets to the 10 concern of, these sorts of class actions are going to go 11 away. 12             First of all, it's  it's hard to feel too 13 sorry about the plaintiffs who have everything that they 14 could possibly ask for when we're talking about absent 15 people.  As a practical matter in these sorts of class 16 actions, what they get is pennies on the dollars of 17 their claim.  The big money goes to the class action 18 lawyers here. 19             All of this can be addressed if Congress 20 wants to address it by addressing these policy concerns. 21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Garre, both sides have 22 these class action policy arguments, but it's important 23 not to let those drive this pretty technical mootness 24 question.  So if we could just take the class action 25 arguments out of it.

28 1             Just let's say that there's a plaintiff, and 2 he claims 10,000  he wants $10,000 plus attorneys' 3 fees, okay?  And the defendant says, I'll give you 4 $10,000. 5             And the plaintiff says, no, I really want 6 attorneys' fees, too.  And the defendant says, no, 7 you're not entitled to attorneys' fees.  Plaintiff says, 8 no, I think I am.  I'll  I think I  I'm going to 9 reject your settlement offer. 10             So you say at that point the court can come 11 in and say, oh, the case is moot. 12             Now, how is that possible? 13             MR. GARRE:  Well, in the same  14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's a  there's a 15 contested question as to what one person owes another. 16 The  the defendant has said he doesn't want to accept 17 this offer because he doesn't think it gives him 18 everything that's entitled  he's entitled to.  And the 19 measure of complete relief has to be, at this stage, 20 about what his complaint asks for. 21             MR. GARRE:  It's just like the voluntary 22 cessation context, Your Honor. 23             In that case  24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I suppose he could 25 ask for the key to Fort Knox, right?

12 think the court 

13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's a very  there's a

14 very easy response to this, which is:  If it's

15 frivolous, if it's trivial, you dismiss the case on the

16 merits.

17             MR. GARRE:  The court can make that

18 determination.  And you'd want it to make that

19 determination before it went ahead and adjuted the claim

20 on the merits, whether it's  it's deciding difficult

21 questions on certification, whether it's going ahead and

14           ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. MITCHELL

15                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16             MR. MITCHELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

17 please the Court:

18             CampbellEwald's mootness argument fails

19 because an offer of complete relief cannot render a case

20 moot.  At most, the offer might justify a forced entry

21 of judgment, but not a jurisdictional dismissal.

22             Even though 

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If there's no  if

24 you're getting everything you want, what is the case or

25 controversy?  What is the live dispute in which you have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 a personal stake toward the terms we use under

31

2 Article III?

3             MR. MITCHELL:  The live dispute is in

4 obtaining a court judgment that incorporates that relief

5 that's been offered.

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So  well, what is

7 it you're worried about, that they won't make good on

8 the offer, or 

9             MR. MITCHELL:  The mere offer of complete

10 relief does not have anything to do with mootness.  Even

11 if the plaintiff and the defendant agree on what the

12 proper judicial relief should be, the only question in

13 that situation is whether the court should enter

14 judgment for the plaintiff, not dismiss the case for

15 lack of jurisdiction.

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose Mr. Garre right now

17 were to take a big stack of cash out of his briefcase,

18 or a certified check, and present that to you.  Would

19 there be any case left then?

20             MR. MITCHELL:  There might be a defense on

21 the merits if Mr. Garre's client can say, we've paid the

22 debt.  But that's not something that goes to whether

23 the 

24             JUSTICE ALITO:  That would be  there would

25 be a case or controversy?  If this were an individual

32 1 action and the plaintiff had received from  and  and 2 the damages are  the  the amount of potential 3 damages are undisputed, and the  the plaintiff has 4 received that amount from the defendant, no dispute 5 about it, there wouldn't be a live case or controversy. 6             MR. MITCHELL:  The defendant would have a 7 defense on the merits.  He could plead accord and 8 satisfaction.  He could plead res judicata.  He  9             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why is there a live 10 case or controvery?  What is the controversy? 11             MR. MITCHELL:  Because there's  there's a 12 past injury that's been alleged caused by the defendant 13 that could be redressed, in theory, with judicial 14 relief.  That  15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Which would give the  the 16 defendant  which would give the plaintiff what in 17 addition to the money, under my hypothetical? 18             MR. MITCHELL:  He shouldn't get anything in 19 addition to what he's already received, but that goes to 20 the merits, not to whether an Article III case or 21 controversy exists. 22             When a court  23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're saying the 24 defendant has  has an interest  pardon me  that 25 the plaintiff has an interest in the judgment

5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Again  again, why 

6 well, let  let's assume the case in which they asked

7 for $10,000 and $10,000 is deposited in a bank with

8 irrevocable instructions to pay it.

9             MR. MITCHELL:  Right.

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What  what  what is 

11 is the concrete injury, as the Chief Justice said, that

12 results in adversity?

13             MR. MITCHELL:  The concrete injury is the

14 past injury that he's already suffered.  That the injury

15 has already been remedied is a defense that goes to the

16 merits.  It doesn't go to Article III.  Everyone

17 agrees 

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

19             MR. MITCHELL:  Everyone agrees, Justice

20 Kennedy, that under your hypothetical, the case should

21 be thrown out of court.  The only dispute is whether

22 it's thrown out of court on jurisdictional grounds under

23 Article III or whether it's bounced on the merits

24 because the defendant has an affirmative defense.

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Voluntary cessation

34 1 can moot a case whether the plaintiff likes it or not, 2 right? 3             MR. MITCHELL:  If  if it's certain that 4 the conduct won't reoccur. 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if it's 6 certain that they're going to give you the money that 7 you asked for, why isn't the same result applied? 8             In other words, why is it not simply what 9 the plaintiff wants?  He doesn't want the money he's 10 asking for; he wants a judgment that will give him the 11 money.  As far as I can tell, that's your argument. 12             MR. MITCHELL:  When you're dealing with past 13 injury, Mr. Chief Justice, there's always a past injury 14 that remains  15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But there has to  16             MR.

35 1             MR. MITCHELL:  If the plaintiff comes into 2 court demanding more and the defendant says, no, you're 3 not entitled to that, there is adversity, Justice 4 Kennedy. 5             Now, the plaintiff is not legally entitled 6 to additional damages on the merits if he's already been 7 paid.  But, again, that goes to the merits.  That's not 8 part of the Article III inquiry. 9             Redressability under Article III does not 10 ask whether the plaintiff is legally entitled to the 11 relief he demands.  He could be making an utterly 12 meritless claim for relief. 13             But that's not the Article III question. 14 Article III assumes the plaintiff would have a legal 15 entitlement to the relief demanded and asks whether that 16 relief, if granted by the court, would redress the 17 injury that he  18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You put a lot of 19 weight on what the plaintiffs  but there's another 20 interest here, which is the  the court's interest. 21             You're being given everything you want.  You 22 say, well, we've had a past injury.  Well, you asked for 23 relief on that, and that is what you're being given. 24 And yet you say, nonetheless, we're entitled to enlist 25 the court and the court's time.  And not only that,

MITCHELL:  That's a different question. 13 Right. 14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The district court 15 said you were  16             MR. MITCHELL:  No, no.  I'm sorry.  The 17 district court did not say that.  There's no finding  18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Page 40a? 19             MR. MITCHELL:  Page 40a in the Petition 20 Appendix.  The district court does not say, as a matter 21 of law or as a finding of fact, that we were offered 22 complete relief. 23             What the district court said on page 40a is 24 that it assumes, for the sake of argument, that the 25 offer constituted complete relief only  only

37 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  Sorry.  Sorry, 2 counselor.  That's not what it says.  It's not "we 3 assume for the sake of argument." 4             MR. MITCHELL:  Right.  Not   we say  5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  "The parties do not 6 dispute that defendant's Rule 68 offer would have fully 7 satisfied the individual claims asserted"  8             MR. MITCHELL:  The end  9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   "or that could 10 have been asserted by plaintiff in this action." 11             MR. MITCHELL:  Only the individual claims. 12 And the district court was wrong to say that we did not 13 dispute that. 14             If you look at docket entry  15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, did the Ninth 16 Circuit proceed to decide the case on the basis of that 17 factual finding? 18             MR. MITCHELL:  No, it didn't  we disputed 19 in the Ninth.  We said in the Ninth Circuit that the 20 district court was wrong to say that on page 40a of the 21 Petition Appendix.  It's in Docket Entry 13 in the Ninth 22 Circuit record on  23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Did the Ninth 24 Circuit proceed to decide the case on the basis of the 25 assumption that the district court factual determination

38

2             MR. MITCHELL:  No.  The Ninth Circuit

3 assumed, for the sake of argument 

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think that is the

5 same as proceed to decide for 

6             MR. MITCHELL:  No.  I don't  I don't  I

7 don't agree, Mr. Chief Justice.

8             There was binding precedent in the Ninth

9 Circuit already before we got there, in Diaz and Pitts,

10 that said even an offer of complete relief from the

11 defendant does not moot the case.

12             So if the defendant throws up his hands and

13 unconditionally surrenders, whether it's a class action

14 or not, that has nothing to do with mootness.  It may

15 justify a forced entry of judgment, but it does not moot

16 the case.

17             And that's the problem that Mr. Garre cannot

18 get around, because CampbellEwald insists in this case

19 that the district court 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you're  you're 

21 you're contrasting a forced entry of judgment on the one

22 hand with mootness on the other.  But a forced entry of

23 judgment is one of the remedies for mootness.

24             MR. MITCHELL:  No.  Those are mutually

25 exclusive.  If the case is moot, a court cannot enter a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 judgment ever, under any circumstance.

39

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.

3             MR. MITCHELL:  The only proper response in

4 that situation is to dismiss for lack of subject matter

5 jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't 

7             MR. MITCHELL:  There can never be a

8 judgment.

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think  I think when

10 there has been a settlement and the parties have agreed

11 to a settlement, the court can enter a judgment.

12             MR. MITCHELL:  It can.  And that's exactly

13 why settlement 

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even though the case is

15 moot 

16             MR. MITCHELL:  No, the case is not 

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:   because of the

18 settlement.

19             MR. MITCHELL:  The case is not moot.  If the

20 court is entering a judgment, by definition the case is

21 not moot.  Mootness requires a jurisdictional dismissal.

22 Mootness forbids the entry of any type of judgment.

23             So for CampbellEwald to come into this

24 Court and say that the district court retained the

25 prerogative to enter a judgment on the merits after the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 offer of complete relief has been tendered is a

40

2 confession that the offer of complete relief on this

3 case 

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It isn't a judgment on the

5 merits.  It's  it's  it's a judgment affirming the

6 settlement, affirming what the parties themselves have

7 agreed to.

8             MR. MITCHELL:  That's still a judgment.

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't go to the merits

10 of the claim.

11             MR. MITCHELL:  It  oh, it may not  it

12 may not resolve the merits for purposes of issue

13 preclusion.  That's correct, Justice Scalia, but it's

14 still a judgment under Rule 58.  It is courtordered

15 relief.  And a court cannot do that in a case when it

16 lacks subjectmatter jurisdiction.

17             Mootness and forced entry of judgment are

18 mutually exclusive.

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   so just to be

20 clear on the facts without getting into a dispute, let's

21 say that the offer is for the  all relief that you

22 have asked for.

23             MR. MITCHELL:  Yes.

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not a question of

25 what you think they're entitled to or what they think;

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 everything you've asked for, including all attorneys' 2 fees, so there's no question of costshifting or 3 anything like that.  All injunctive relief. 4             They come to you and say, you write the 5 injunction.  You say there is still a case or 6 controversy that could proceed to litigation. 7             MR. MITCHELL:  There is a case or 8 controversy that might lead to a forced entry of 9 judgment if the plaintiff, for obstinacy or other types 10 of reasons, wants to decline this offer. 11             It's hard to imagine  12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's  what is 13 the controversy?  In the case I've hypothesized  14             MR. MITCHELL:  The controversy is  15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   what is the 16 controversy? 17             MR. MITCHELL:  The controversy is the 18 plaintiff wants a judgment of the court that 19 incorporates that relief. 20             A mere offer from the defendant is a legal 21 nullity.  He's not getting the money. 22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought you 23 said if the plaintiff is being obstreperous or whatever, 24 you know, the  just refusing to take it for spite or 25 some reason.  In that case?
Alderson Reporting Company

42 1             MR. MITCHELL:  Enter a judgment, not  not 2 dismiss for mootness. 3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And what would the 4 judgment say? 5             MR. MITCHELL:  The judgment would say:  You 6 asked for X.  The defendant offered X.  This case is 7 over.  Both sides agree on what the proper legal relief 8 should be.  And I think  9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I thought that's 10 what  11             MR. MITCHELL:   and enter a judgment. 12             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   Mr. Garre was arguing. 13 He said he'd need a judgment. 14             MR. MITCHELL:  No.  He's saying it's moot. 15             Now, he's trying to say that mootness allows 16 the court also to enter a judgment, but that's a 17 contradiction in terms if it's moot. 18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And I take it that this 19 judgment that you're talking about would be:  He offered 20 this.  It's everything that you asked for.  We are 21 ordering that he pay it.  And  22             MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. 23             JUSTICE KAGAN:   and  and now the thing 24 is dismissed. 25             MR. MITCHELL:  Right.  And now it's backed
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1 up with the force of the court.  It can be enforced with 2 contempt citations, which a mere offer of complete 3 relief can't. 4             In fact, an unaccepted offer has no legal 5 effect at all on the judgment. 6             JUSTICE ALITO:  If the case is dead when 7 there's  when the judgment is entered, it seems to me 8 it's even more dead when you've actually got the case in 9 hand.  If you have the judgment, you're going to  you 10 may have to enforce the judgment.  You don't actually 11 have anything of value.  You have a piece of paper. 12             MR. MITCHELL:  You still have  you  you 13 may still have to enforce the judgment, but that's much 14 easier than enforcing an  an offer. 15             JUSTICE ALITO:  That's better  it's better 16 to be  if somebody gave you the choice between a 17 judgment that says you're entitled to a certain amount 18 of money and the money itself in your hand, you would 19 rather have the judgment? 20             MR. MITCHELL:  We don't have the money in 21 our hand.  It's been offered  22             JUSTICE ALITO:  But if you did.  That was my 23 first hypothetical.  If you did, if you actually had the 24 money in hand. 25             MR. MITCHELL:  If we actually had the money
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 in hand, we're not entitled to an additional judgment, 2 because the defendant in that case would have a defense 3 on the merits.  It still doesn't justify throwing us out 4 of court on mootness. 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  But it wouldn't be 6 moot  7             MR. MITCHELL:  It's not jurisdictional  8 I'm sorry.  Go ahead. 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  My goodness. 10             So every case has to be tried even when 11 you've  12             MR. MITCHELL:  No. 13             JUSTICE SCALIA:   been paid. 14             MR. MITCHELL:  Not tried. 15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  He's  I want a judgment. 16             MR. MITCHELL:  No. 17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you say it's not moot. 18             MR. MITCHELL:  The court can say, we're 19 terminating the litigation and entering judgment for 20 you, Mr. Plaintiff, because you're not accepting an 21 unconditional surrender from the defendant. 22             You don't go to trial in that situation. 23 You enter judgment for the plaintiff.  It's not to be 24 thrown out for lack of jurisdiction. 25             A jurisdictional dismissal sends the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 plaintiff home emptyhanded, with nothing.  No judicial 2 relief at all.  This unaccepted offer is just out there. 3 It hasn't been accepted.  It can't be enforced in any 4 way. 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if  6             MR. MITCHELL:  Not by contract; not by any 7 remedy. 8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If, Mr. Garre, as 9 you're leaving the courtroom today says, here, we will 10 accept an entry of judgment; one, we'll make sure you 11 get whatever attorneys' fees you want, and we will 12 accept an entry of judgment, then the  then the case 13 would be over? 14             MR. MITCHELL:  Well, it certainly would not 15 be moot. 16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would it be over? 17             MR. MITCHELL:  If he wants to accept an 18 entry of judgment on everything that we've asked for, 19 which includes:  The attorneys' fees; a real injunction, 20 not a vague, "obey the law" injunction that's in his 21 offer; and class certification and class relief  22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, well, that's the 23 whole thing; right? 24             MR. MITCHELL:  Right.  Right. 25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is all about

1 class certification.

2             MR. MITCHELL:  But we  one does not get to

3 class certification until the court first concludes that

4 the individual claims have become moot.  And there's no

5 way the claims can be mooted out simply by an offer 

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the case comes

7 down to, once we put away  hypothesize that you're

8 getting everything you, as the plaintiff in this case,

9 has asked for, it all comes down to whether or not you

10 can get the class certified.

11             MR. MITCHELL:  But it comes  the question

12 presented asked whether the offer of complete relief

13 moots the case.

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you're saying 

15             MR. MITCHELL:  And the answer to that 

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you're saying 

17             MR. MITCHELL:   question is no.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Excuse me.

19             MR. MITCHELL:  I'm sorry.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you're saying

21 that it's not because of the possibility that you could

22 get a class certified.

23             MR. MITCHELL:  Well, that's one 

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  My hypothesis is you

25 get everything else.  Okay?

1             MR. MITCHELL:  Yes.

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The only thing they

3 don't say  they enter a judgment.  You want a

4 judgment?  Here's your judgment.  You want all the

5 attorneys' fees?  Here's all your attorneys' fees.  You

6 want an injunction?  You know, go ahead and write your

7 injunction.

8             But you say still not, because you might be

9 able to be the representative plaintiff in a class

10 action?

11             MR. MITCHELL:  That's  that's one of the

12 many reasons why it's not 

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see why that one 

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course not.

15             JUSTICE BREYER:   would be a good  the

16 thing I thought was interesting here, and I wanted to

17 know your position, is the AFLCIO brief

48

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  But why not?  What

3 they say is that the right way to go about this is 

4 and they cite cases and so forth in the nineteenth

5 century  is that the defendant should not  you're

6 right.  It's not an offer of relief.  What they say is

7 the defendant is supposed to tender the money.

8             And when he tenders the money, if the

9 plaintiff won't accept it, he goes to the court and he

10 deposits the money in the court.  And the court then

11 issues a judgment saying, this case is over.

12             That's what I read here in pages 9 to 11,

13 and they have lots of authority, and that gets rid of

14 the problem.  And there's no  it seems to me, well, if

15 it isn't right, why isn't it?

16             MR. MITCHELL:  It may be over, but it's not

17 moot.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why 

19             MR. MITCHELL:  This has nothing to do with

20 what moot is.

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Who  what the judge does

22 is say, they want $10,000.  What the defendant does is

23 he says, they won't take my check, which should be

24 certified.  So he deposits it in court.

25             MR. MITCHELL:  Right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE BREYER:  The judge at that point

49

2 should say, the defendant has all he wants.  The case is

3 over.  Goodbye.  And, of course, if that person now has

4 all he wants, he can't certify this is a class because

5 he isn't harmed.

6             MR. MITCHELL:  He gets judgment on the

7 merits in that situation.

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  Give him judgment on

9 the merits.  Who cares?

10             MR. MITCHELL:  It's actually a very

11 important distinction.

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?

13             MR. MITCHELL:  Because many reasons.

14             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, give me one.

15             (Laughter.)

16             MR. MITCHELL:  All right.  I'll start with

17 one.  The question presented  the question presented

18 asks whether an offer of complete relief renders the

19 case 

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not interested at the

21 moment in the question asked.  I am interested in the

22 question I am asking.

23             (Laughter.)

24             MR. MITCHELL:  All right.  It may very well

25 be that if the defendant in that case comes into court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1 and says the case is over, the district court would have 2 the prerogative to enter a judgment on the merits for 3 the defendant because the plaintiff has already been 4 paid, and the plaintiff can't doubledip.  That goes to 5 the merits. 6             But CampbellEwald never asked the district 7 court for judgment on the merits. 8             JUSTICE BREYER:  And that isn't what I said. 9 You now sound as if you are agreeing with the AFLCIO. 10             MR. MITCHELL:  I don't agree with it because 11 they are implying that that would moot the case. 12             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, they don't say what the 13 effect of it would be. 14             MR. MITCHELL:  Fine. 15             JUSTICE BREYER:  What I want  I'm being 16 practical. 17             MR. MITCHELL:  Okay. 18             JUSTICE BREYER:  And the practical thing is 19 that the defendant wants to pay off the plaintiff by 20 giving him everything he wants. 21             MR. MITCHELL:  Yes.  We agree  22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there a way to do it? 23 What they say is, yes, the way to do it is you tender 24 the money in a certified check, and if he won't take it, 25 pay the money into court.  And the  the judge then

1 enters a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, who has

51

2 gotten everything he asked for.

3             MR. MITCHELL:  If he's gotten everything

4 he's asked for, that goes 

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  Not the class

6 certification.  There's nothing in there that says 

7             MR. MITCHELL:  Yes, apart from class action,

8 which is a more complicated question.  But 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it's not a more

10 complicated question.

11             MR. MITCHELL:  Well, it is 

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  In my hypothetical, I'm

13 saying, in those circumstances, do you agree  do you

14 or do you not agree, and if not, why not?  The only

15 thing that's left is, you'd like, says the plaintiff,

16 class certification, or at least the lawyer would.

17             MR. MITCHELL:  The case is not over if

18 you're talking about class certification, because Roper

19 holds specifically that the representative plaintiff can

20 continue litigating the class certification if

21 there's  even after 

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Even though there's been a

23 certified check tendered to the plaintiff and a judgment

24 has been entered giving  saying the case is over

25 because he's got everything he wants.

Alderson Reporting Company

1             MR. MITCHELL:  That was the situation in

52

2 Roper.  There was a forced entry of judgment imposed on

3 the representative plaintiffs.  And this Court allowed

4 the representative to continue litigating the class

5 certification issue because he had a financial stake in

6 the class certification decision.

7             And Mr. Gomez, likewise, has a financial

8 stake.  That's undisputed 

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is  what is

10 the financial stake here?

11             MR. MITCHELL:  There are two of them.  One

12 is the cost sharing of the lawyers.

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well, the

14 cost  so then that's fully satisfied if the offer

15 covers attorneys' fees?

16             MR. MITCHELL:  Yes.  Of course, this  this

17 offer does not.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Now, if

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What was the other

23 one?

24             MR. MITCHELL:  The other one would be the

25 incentive award that he would recover if the class is

MITCHELL:  The incentive award. 5             Normally, a representative plaintiff after a 6 class gets certified and the settlement gets  7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You  is there any 8 concern that a plaintiff who has received or has been 9 offered all relief that he could receive is an 10 appropriate representative plaintiff of parties who have 11 not gotten all the relief? 12             MR. MITCHELL:  That  that might be 13 something for a court to consider under Rule 23, whether 14 this person is an adequate representative.  But we don't 15 think there is much of a difference there because the 16 incentive award still gives him incentives to press for 17 the fellow class members. 18             And this Court's upheld qui tam litigation, 19 where  20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the argument is 21 that an individual plaintiff who has gotten everything 22 that he has asked for  and I realize you argue that 23 isn't the case here. 24             MR. MITCHELL:  Yes, not even close, yes. 25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   is  is entitled

54 1 to proceed with the litigation because he might get a 2 bonus from a class action that he would like to lead? 3             MR. MITCHELL:  That's correct. 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 5             MR. MITCHELL:  But, again, that's only one 6 of many reasons why we win on the mootness question. 7 And, you know, there's still the problem of the mutual 8 exclusivity between a mootness finding and a forced 9 entry of judgment. 10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you just a 11 practical question?  Is Mr. Garre right that this is a 12 case, if he were to proceed, if it were  the class 13 were certified and you get a judgment, this is a case 14 where the class action attorneys are going to get a lot 15 and the members of the class are going to get virtually 16 nothing? 17             MR. MITCHELL:  No. 18             JUSTICE ALITO:  You would have to  you 19 would have to prove that at the  to establish damages, 20 would you not, that the members of the class did not 21 consent to receive these messages, right? 22             MR. MITCHELL:  That  that's correct.  And 23 it went beyond  24             JUSTICE ALITO:  How would you do that?  How 25 would you be able to  how can you prove that

55 1 somebody  some member of the class at some point when 2 they were agreeing to something on the internet didn't 3 click a box that said, I agree to receive messages from 4 all of, you know, a big class of senders? 5             MR. MITCHELL:  There are optin lists that 6 are maintained by companies like MindMatics and 7 CampbellEwald that can be discovered, and that's how we 8 would go about proving it. 9             JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you think the class 10 members would get? 11             MR.

MITCHELL:  If it settles. 19             JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it's not? 20             MR. MITCHELL:  They're entitled to $500 21 apiece in statutory damages that could be trebled to 22 $1,500 if we can show there was a  violation. 23             JUSTICE ALITO:  And you're going to be able 24 to determine who did not  prove that certain people 25 did not consent?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
56 1             MR. MITCHELL:  It would be based on whether 2 they appeared on the optin list, whether they had 3 appeared on some type of optin list from which  4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you  what do 5 you do to get on that optin list? 6             MR. MITCHELL:  You have to check a box or 7 submit a form that says you're interested in receiving 8 emails or text messages about certain topics.  And in 9 this case, the Navy instructed CampbellEwald to send 10 text messages only to people who had opted in to receive 11 information about money for college, travel and 12 adventure, something related to the Navy.  And this list 13 was not assembled properly. 14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We  we haven't talked 15 about the second issue that you raise, and one curiosity 16 is the  the actor that did something wrong was  what 17 is it?  MindMatics? 18             MR. MITCHELL:  Yes, MindMatics. 19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you didn't sue.  What 20 is the reason that you went after the contractor only? 21             MR. MITCHELL:  CampbellEwald is vicariously 22 liable, and they were the ones that were sued.  But... 23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you're relying on 24 vicarious liability? 25             MR.

4             The Ninth Circuit found that the TCPA

5 incorporates vicarious liability and that CampbellEwald

6 is vicariously liable for MindMatics' actions.  And they

7 did not appeal that.  That is the law of the case.

11             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

12     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13                  SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS

14             MR. YANG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15 please the Court:

16             I'd like to take the opportunity to clarify

17 the Article III question by addressing the elements of

18 an Article III case or controversy, an established

19 Federal practice that I believe shows that an offer 

20 an unaccepted offer, in particular, cannot moot a case.

21 And if there's time, I'd like to address the derivative

22 sovereign immunity argument.

23             First, there is a distinction that this

24 Court has established between prospective relief and

25 retrospective relief.  When you seek prospective relief,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you need to show an ongoing or imminent injury.

58

2             In that context, a defendant can actually

3 halt the injury that's necessary by stopping, so long as

4 you meet the voluntary cessation doctrine or  so long

5 as you show that it's not capable of repetition you're

6 going to be in review.  So the injury with respect to

7 prospective relief, that is, the injury that's occurring

8 now or in the future, can end.

9             When we're talking about retrospective

10 relief, damages, the injury is in the past.  It's not

11 undone.  An offer of money may be compensation for that

12 injury, but the injury continues to exist.

13             For purposes of Article III, the question

14 is, there has to be an injury.  It has to be fairly

15 traceable.  That's established by the past injury

16 that  caused by the defendant.  And the requested

17 judicial relief would likely redress the injury.  Now,

18 the requested relief, even when there's been an offer,

19 is:  I want money.

20             Second 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sorry.  Those are 

22 those are the three requirements for Article III

23 standing, but there's an additional requirement of

24 adverseness.  None of those three requirements that

25 are  that are set forth in our  in our opinions deal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
59 1 with adverseness.  That's a separate  separate issue. 2             MR. YANG:  Well  3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's what's being 4 challenged here. 5             MR. YANG:  I don't believe so.  It's 6 embedded in the request for relief.  The plaintiff comes 7 to the court and says, I want relief from the court. 8 The defendant says, no, no, don't grant the relief. 9 I've either  the case is moot. 10             I think that's what's going on here.  There 11 is a distinction between  12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  There has to be injury, in 13 fact, okay?  It has to be attributable to the  to the 14 defendant, okay.  And the court must be able to remedy 15 it.  None of those three requirements, which are the 16 classic requirements, deals with the quite separate 17 point of adverseness. 18             MR. YANG:  I believe it's embedded in  19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  If somebody comes in and 20 says, yes, you've been injured, the court could provide 21 relief, but I  I agree with all of that, and here is 22 the money. 23             MR. YANG:  Well, then the case is not moot. 24 The court can grant relief.  The court enters a judgment 25 ordering relief, which is enforceable with all the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
60 1 court's powers, which is quite distinct from a judgment 2 of dismissal for one of jurisdiction. 3             That  that's a  you need to have  a 4 court needs Article III power to direct a remedy against 5 the defendant.  It's quite unlike a dismissal for one of 6 jurisdiction.  It's also quite unlike the remedy of 7 vacatur, which undoes a court judgment. 8             So Mr. Garre's, you know, attempt to kind of 9 frame this either as, you know, a  a prospective 10 relief case or a case where you're getting a judgment, a 11 judgment of dismissal for one of jurisdiction is not an 12 enforceable judgment in the way that is relevant for 13 purposes of Article III jurisdiction. 14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Yang, I  I  I do 15 understand what you and Petitioner  Respondent's 16 counsel are arguing, which is someone, a judge, has to 17 say, at some point, this is in fact complete relief and 18 enter a judgment for that complete relief. 19             That's your argument. 20             MR. YANG:  In part, I believe that's right. 21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right. 22             Parties could stipulate.  If they  if they 23 accept an offer of settlement, that's like a stipulation 24 saying, this is complete relief for us.  There's no 25 adversity.

Official
61 1             MR. YANG:  The  and the parties when they 2 agree. 3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right. 4             MR. YANG:  When they say, we've agreed and 5 we  we give up, the case will normally be thought of 6 as moot. 7             But there is  there are several 8 longstanding Federal practices, both in Federal courts, 9 actually, as well as in State courts, that I think 10 reflects this point. 11             A party  parties can agree to settle a 12 case, but a court retains jurisdiction to enter a 13 consent decree.  This is an enforceable judgment. 14             Justice Kennedy, you talked about Kokkonen. 15 This is the great distinction between a settlement offer 16 and a judgment. 17             The court has authority to enter a consent 18 decree even after the parties have settled.  That's more 19 than an offer.  It's actual  a settlement. 20             Two, courts can  21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me. 22             It  it has authority to enter that even 23 though the case is moot; right. 24             MR. YANG:  No.  It  25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But when there's a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
62 1 settlement offer which has been accepted, the court can 2 nonetheless issue a judgment enforcing that settlement, 3 no? 4             MR. YANG:  The case is not moot because the 5 parties are  are saying, we are agreeing on the entry 6 of a judgment, not we're agreeing in the abstract to 7 just  8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh  9             MR. YANG:   to settle the case. 10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So  so even though the 11 parties have no adverseness at all and they all agree on 12 what the outcome should be, but we want a court to go 13 into this matter which we've all agreed on because we 14 want a judgment?  Is  is  is that  15             MR. YANG:  What  16             JUSTICE SCALIA:   the Article III 17 adverseness requirement? 18             MR. YANG:  This is not a remarkable 19 proposition.  Courts all the time  20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it's remarkable. 21             MR. YANG:   all the time enter consent 22 decrees. These are enforceable with the power of the 23 court. 24             Two, they also dismiss with prejudice.  That 25 is not a dismissal for one of jurisdiction.  It's a

2             Three, they enter judgment in a Rule 68

3 offer.

4             Also, you look at the affirmative defenses,

5 which are all waivable, in Rule 8(c), accord and

6 satisfaction, payment, res judicata.

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What happens on

8 other grounds of lack of jurisdiction?  What if the

9 plaintiff has no injury?

10             There is no injury.  The court  in other

11 words, the  the requirements for Article III

12 jurisdiction that you rehearsed.  What happens in that

13 case? No jurisdiction for another reason besides

14 mootness?

15             MR. YANG:  Right.

16             The court would dismiss the case for one of

17 jurisdiction, saying that there is no injury.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what if the 

19 the plaintiff comes in and says, well, I want  I want

20 a judgment?  Or because what other 

21             MR. YANG:  But 

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   bases, or I

23 want  I want  whatever reason.  I mean, they're 

24 we're insisting on a judgment even though, arguably,

25 depending upon the scope of the offered relief, the case

Alderson Reporting Company

1 is moot.

Official

64

2             MR. YANG:  Our point is that 

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Other cases, you say

4 they dismiss it as  why  why doesn't that go to

5 trial?  Or  or you get the benefit of the court

6 determination?

7             MR. YANG:  The standing inquiry has to, of

8 course, be addressed at the relevant stage of the case.

9 So, for instance, at the pleading stage, if you failed

10 to allege an injury sufficient 

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you're wrong.  I

12 think if there's no standing, I don't think you get

13 dismissed as moot.  I think you get a judgment for the

14 defendant because the plaintiff has no standing.

15             MR. YANG:  It's not a  it's a judgment

16 that there is lack of standing, that you have no injury.

17 It's not a resolution of the claim itself.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Indeed.  So  so the fact

19 that the court issues judgment has nothing to do with

20 whether there's Article III standing, whether there's

21 mootness or not.  You can enter the judgment even though

22 there's no Article III standing.

23             MR. YANG:  There is a  there is a

24 difference between a judgment for want of jurisdiction

25 that the court is just  I don't have the power to

Alderson Reporting Company

1 address this.

Official

65

2             In a judgment where the court says, I have

3 power to  to enter relief that is enforceable through

4 collateral proceedings through all the  the  the

5 great power of a Federal court, that is a big

6 difference.

7             A court requires Article III jurisdiction to

8 exercise that power over the litigants.  And that's what

9 normally happens with consent decrees, with dismissals

10 with prejudice, with a judgment under Rule 68 offer.

11 And it also, conversely, even when a party's been fully

12 paid.

13             The fact that the defense of payment 

14 accord and satisfaction can all be waived.  So at the

15 end of the case, if the defendant hasn't actually raised

16 these and then belatedly says, I forgot.  I paid the

17 guy, and the claim was for a thousand dollars, the court

18 says, sorry.  Forfeited.  Judgment for another $1,000.

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So even if a  even

20 if the plaintiff is given all the relief to which he is

21 entitled, you say the plaintiff still has a right to

22 involve the Federal court in that 

23             MR. YANG:  The 

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I was  I  I

25 can't say "that controversy," because you still have to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
66 1 right to call  go into Federal court and say, I know, 2 Federal court, you're busy with a lot of things, but I 3 still want you to hear my case even though I've gotten 4 everything I could get. 5             MR. YANG:  And I don't want to mislead the 6 Court into thinking that we're advocating protracted 7 litigation on claims where there is a powerful defense 8 like payment.  That is a merits defense:  We've paid the 9 claim.  You don't  you can't get any more money from 10 me. 11             But for  the question of the court's power 12 to entertain that merits defense is what we're saying 13 is  like the fact that we have affirmative defenses 14 that may be waived.  Even a res judicata, the court has 15 already adjudicated the very claim, and yet if the 16 defendant does not raise it, this Court has held it 17 doesn't go to the court's jurisdiction. 18             And so the  you could get relief twice. 19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is a  is a 20 plaintiff who has been given all the relief that he's 21 requested, in the view of the United States, an adequate 22 class representative? 23             MR. YANG:  This is, again, not an Article 24 III question but a Rule 23 question. 25             I think that could be considered by the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Court in exercising its discretion under Rule 23.

67

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, of course it

3 can.  I want to know what the position is.

4             MR. YANG:  I think if the  I  I think

5 that's hard, and let me tell you why.  To be an adequate

6 represented  representative of the class, you can't

7 simply be looking out for your own interests.  You have

8 to be looking out for the interests of the class.  And

9 that's part of the requirement.

10             A defendant who says, I'll just accept my

11 money and drop the interests of the class, you know,

12 it's not  you wonder whether that defendant is  or

13 plaintiff is actually a good adequate representative.

14             Rule 23  and, again, now we're stepping

15 away from the Article III question.  We're getting into

16 questions of discretion.

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

22             First, the Article III principle that should

23 control the resolution of this case was stated in the

24 San Pablo case on page 314.

25             The court said the court is not empowered to

4             And that's exactly what's at issue before

5 the case  the Court today.

7 the California Civil Code, which was quite different

8 from Rule 68.

9             MR. GARRE:  I'm  I'm not talking about the

10 technical distinction of the cases.  I'm talking about

11 the Article III principle that controls here.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Garre, I am so

13 confused by your argument.  You get to say, on your own,

14 unilaterally, I offered you complete relief, even

15 though, right or wrong, the plaintiff is asking for a

16 particular injunction and a particular attorney's fee.

17             You, without any judicial interpretation,

18 intervention, get to moot the case on your terms.

19             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What happens if you

21 hadn't done that?  Let's assume that he was entitled to

22 attorneys' fees.  Who's  when does that decision get

23 made and by whom?

24             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, a court 

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That a complete offer

Alderson Reporting Company

1 has been made?

Official

69

2             MR. GARRE:  A court makes the determination

3 that the offer is complete, just as it would make a

4 determination that the defendant had in fact

5 voluntarily ceased his conduct.

6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That  that is 

7 that's all I needed for you to say.

8             MR. GARRE:  Okay.  Thank you.

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay?  Let's stop there.

10             MR. GARRE:  And  and the Court did it in

11 this case.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So a court gets

13 involved  a court gets involved no matter what.

14 Right?

15             MR. GARRE:  As it always would for a

16 mootness determination.  Of course.

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So you

18 offered and they wanted an injunction.  The court can

19 enter that injunction.

20             I'm putting aside the class action.  I'm 

21             MR. GARRE:  Yes.

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The court can't  all

23 right.

70 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it can't just say 2 the case is moot and not enter the injunction.  The 3 terms of the settlement, the terms of the lawsuit, were 4 that an injunction would be issued and you'd pay $1,500; 5 correct? 6             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, I think 7 Justice Scalia had exactly the right answer on this, 8 which is that there's  there's decades, if not 9 centuries, of practice dealing with this situation, and 10 it's a settlement context. 11             Everyone agrees this Court has repeatedly 12 said that the settlement moots the case.  That doesn't 13 mean that courts don't have authority ancillary 14 jurisdiction  15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's just  16             MR. GARRE:   to dispose of the case. 17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   poor usage of words, 18 counselor.  It can't enter a judgment  19             MR. GARRE:  Well, I don't think  20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   unless there is 21 jurisdiction. 22             MR. GARRE:  I  I think we're in a  a 23 little bit of a chickenandtheegg situation here, Your 24 Honor.  This Court has repeatedly said settlements moot 25 cases, and yet courts have authority to enter relief to

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Accepted.  Accept 

3 accepted settlements.

4             MR. GARRE:  Well, we're back to whether or

5 not the plaintiff can force the court to proceed ahead

6 and expound on the law.  And on that, I think my

7 friend's presentation 

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Not settlement of the

9 law.  Justice 

10             MR. GARRE:  No.

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   Sotomayor suggested,

12 move this affirmative defense of payment to summary

13 judgment.

14             MR. GARRE:  The case can go forward, in

15 their view, and the courts will have to expound on the

16 law.  There's no independent interest in receiving a

17 judgment.  If that's the rule, then mootness is off the

18 table.  In almost any case can the defendant  can

19 always  the plaintiff can always say, I want a

20 judgment.

21             We're  we're down to the question, really,

22 of:  How do we get rid of this case?  Because I think

23 that even they recognize that the  if the offer is for

24 complete relief, then, the courts below held, the case

25 has to come to an end.

72 1             There's two options for this Court.  One, 2 you hold that the case should be dismissed as moot, and 3 two  if you don't agree with that, then two, you hold 4 that the case should be disposed of by entering judgment 5 for the plaintiff based on the terms of the  of the 6 offer of complete relief. 7             That's the Sixth Circuit rule.  You can go 8 and look, as we did.  There are plenty of judgments 9 where the courts have implemented that rule.  There's no 10 evidence of any difficulty in applying that, and what 11 that does is it disposes of cases in a commonsense 12 fashion.  It prevents court from  courts from going 13 ahead and expounding on the law in cases in which they 14 have no business doing so. 15             If I could make one point on the immunity 16 issue:  Justice Ginsburg, you're exactly right.  They 17 sued the wrong party.  MindMatics did everything in this 18 case, and we're at least entitled to immunity from 19 vicarious liability. 20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 21 The case is submitted. 22             (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 23 aboveentitled matter was submitted.) 24 25
