1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument first this morning in Nijhawan v. Holder. 5 Mr. Moseley. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. MOSELEY 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. MOSELEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 At issue in this case is an aggravated 11 felony definition, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), one that 12 serves both as a ground of deportation and as an 13 integral part of a Federal criminal statute. 14 For the Court's convenient reference, 15 because I suspect we will return to this and the other 16 definitions, I would refer the Court to the statutory 17 appendix in the government's brief: 3a gives (M)(i); 6a 18 gives the conviction requirement; and 7a to 8a gives the 19 underlying criminal statute in which this aggravated 20 felony definition forms an integral part. 21 Now, Congress has required -- for 22 deportation, Congress has required conviction of this 23 defined offense, in a definition that says absolutely 24 nothing about the word "tether" utilized by the Third 25 Circuit below, and the definition begins with a
3

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 restrictive clause, "that," to require conviction of 2 both the fraud and deceit element and also the loss 3 amount as an integral part of this definition. 4 Since Congress required conviction, the 5 time-honored categorical approach really should be the 6 governing standard, and I submit that there's nothing in 7 the plain language of the statute, the underlying 8 statute enacted by Congress, to oust that time-honored 9 approach, which I submit is perhaps on a par as being 10 presumptively applicable, similarly to the -- to the 11 stay standards that this Court discussed very recently 12 in the Nken case. 13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Another -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the time-honored -15 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, please. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the time-honored 17 approach, if the jury verdict necessarily -- or not 18 necessarily, but did in fact refer to the amount 19 involved and it was over $10,000, would that be part of 20 the time-honored approach and then the statute would be 21 fulfilled? 22 MR. MOSELEY: I -- under those 23 circumstances, Justice Kennedy, yes. But here the jury 24 was specifically instructed that they did not have to 25 make any finding with respect to loss in this case.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in that connection, 2 at some point in the argument -- and you may be a little 3 early because you're talking about the statute -- I'd 4 like to know either anecdotally from your experience or 5 -- or because it's written somewhere, how often do 6 juries give special verdicts? It actually applies in 7 the second case we're to hear as well. And has that 8 changed in the light of -- of Apprendi? In -- in my 9 experience, we just didn't know many of the features of 10 the crime from -- from the jury verdict, and I just 11 would like to know if that's changed in this day and 12 age. 13 MR. MOSELEY: Well, I -- I -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you may reach that 15 after you've talked about the statute. 16 MR. MOSELEY: Yes, but let me -- certainly 17 among the State statutes that we cite, the State 18 statutes where it's clear that a loss amount is an 19 element, the jury is going to be instructed they have to 20 return that, and they do. The -- the special verdict 21 opportunity here is in effect, I would submit, a kind of 22 lifeline, if you will, that we're giving to the 23 government in these -- in these more general fraud 24 statutes, where the government has that -- certainly has 25 that opportunity or that option to do. But there
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 certainly have been -- and I know we cite them in our 2 brief -- cases -3 JUSTICE ALITO: And if you -- if you do 4 extend that lifeline to the government, aren't you 5 conceding that the amount of the loss is not an element 6 of the offense, and aren't you conceding that it is not 7 necessary for the loss amount to be an element of the 8 offense? 9 MR. MOSELEY: No, Justice Alito. What I am 10 saying is that this statute -- and again, (M)(i) was 11 enacted as part of a number of criminal statutes -12 excuse me -- as a number of provisions that were 13 addressed to white collar offenses, of which this is 14 just one, and it also encompasses the State -- it also 15 encompasses the State statutes where this clearly is -16 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you a 17 concrete example. Let's say it's a Federal mail fraud 18 case. Let's say there are two Federal mail fraud cases, 19 and you don't have to prove the amount of loss in order 20 to convict under the mail fraud statute. In the first 21 case, after the jury returns a guilty verdict they also 22 return -- or together with that they answer a special 23 interrogatory and they say the loss exceeded $10,000. 24 In the second case, the defendant pleads guilty and 25 admits during the plea colloquy that the amount is more
6

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 than $10,000. Would there be a problem in those cases? 2 MR. MOSELEY: In those cases, no. In those 3 cases, that would have satisfied the traditional 4 categorical approach. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In this -6 JUSTICE ALITO: And then -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In this case, how many of 8 the defendants were alien? You're -- the jury is given 9 a charge that covers all of the defendants. They're all 10 charged with the same crime. How many of them were 11 aliens? 12 MR. MOSELEY: I believe two in addition to 13 Mr. Nijhawan, Justice Ginsburg. I believe two or three 14 more were. This case -- this case involved roughly 15 15 defendants. There are only five who went to trial. The 16 number who -- the number who are aliens, in addition to 17 Mr. Nijhawan, I believe were two. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then the judge wouldn't 19 distinguish -- it would not be relevant for the -- for 20 the defendants who were not aliens because it would have 21 no consequences for them. So why should the judge -22 even if the question could be asked, why should the 23 judge -- the judge takes a position: It's not an 24 element of the crime. Therefore, I'm not going to 25 charge it, and I'm not going to confuse the jury by
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 saying as to the defendants who are aliens, you have to 2 find the amount. 3 MR. MOSELEY: Well, under -- under those -4 under those circumstances, Justice Ginsburg, Mr. 5 Nijhawan actually himself had asked for a charge with -6 with respect to loss. I don't think -- I don't think 7 there's an issue of jury confusion here, and indeed 8 under -- under -- ironically under this Court's -- well, 9 this would have been a situation in which a request was 10 -- could have been made. I don't think there would have 11 been -- there certainly wouldn't have been jury 12 confusion to have requested it here. 13 But I think you have to put this in -- in 14 the larger picture of a statute of a set of aggravated 15 felony definitions that were enacted. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But before you go on to 17 that, we're talking about (M)(i). It's coupled with 18 another provision that's an offense that is described in 19 section 21 -- 7201 of Title 26 -- that's tax evasion -20 in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds 21 10,000. So it's the same "in which" construction, and 22 there's no requirement -- to convict someone of tax 23 evasion, the jury does not have to find the deficiency. 24 MR. MOSELEY: Well, actually, Justice 25 Ginsburg, under this Court's decision in Boulware, a
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 deficiency is indeed a necessary element of that -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: A deficiency, but not the 3 amount of the deficiency. 4 MR. MOSELEY: But -- no. A -- a deficiency 5 is a necessary element of that offense. That's -6 that's where, for example, the Babaisakov decision got 7 that point flatly wrong. And this is, I think, the 8 classic -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is the amount -10 there's a deficiency. The jury has to find in order to 11 find tax evasion there is a deficiency. Does it have to 12 find that the revenue loss to the government exceeds 13 $10,000? 14 MR. MOSELEY: No, it doesn't have to find 15 that, but it may. And this is a classic example of the 16 application of the modified categorical approach, where 17 this statute sweeps broadly to include both loss amounts 18 or, in this case, revenue loss amounts that would exceed 19 $10,000 and those that would be less than $10,000. Most 20 of these cases, most of the tax cases, as the 21 government's own materials that we cite indicate, are 22 resolved by guilty pleas with respect to where those 23 amounts are designated. And I think it's important here 24 to realize that by pairing these two statutes, by 25 pairing these two provisions, (M)(i) and (M)(ii),
9

1 Congress in effect I submit sent the signal with that 2 language in (M)(ii) that we're talking about the kind -3 we're talking about the application of the modified 4 categorical -5 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- What is the 6 difference between a defendant's saying during a guilty 7 plea colloquy, the loss was -- I admit the loss was more 8 than $10,000; and the defendant's agreeing for 9 sentencing purposes that the loss was more than $10,000? 10 MR. MOSELEY: Because, Justice Alito, in the 11 sentencing context we're truly dealing with a 12 post-verdict situation where the government in terms of 13 having to prove loss is up against a far lesser amount 14 -- a far more liberal standard, a preponderance of the 15 evidence standard. And the defendant under those 16 circumstances -17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if he's admitting it, 18 what does the standard of the evidence matter? 19 MR. MOSELEY: He's admitting it here, 20 Justice Souter, under these circumstances. He's 21 admitting it here only in the context of a resolution of 22 the sentencing issue. If you go back to the -23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he's not saying, I 24 admit to a degree of preponderance of the evidence that 25 it was over 10,000. He's saying, period, over 10,000.

MOSELEY: No, but he's -- but he's doing 4 this in the context of resolving, of resolving a 5 disputed issue with respect to -6 JUSTICE SOUTER: And he definitively 7 resolves it by admission. 8 MR. MOSELEY: But he does so certainly in 9 the context of reserving, of reserving his right to 10 contest that and to make the arguments that we're making 11 here. 12 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I understand the facts 13 of this case. I was commenting on your answer to 14 Justice Alito's question, and it would seem to me that 15 the answer to the question is there is no difference. 16 MR. MOSELEY: No, I submit -- I submit that 17 there -- there really is a -- a profound difference 18 under the circumstances of someone being in a situation 19 before, before conviction, and then someone being in a 20 postconviction situation. And then I think we should 21 come back in terms -- we should come back to the 22 underlying, to the underlying requirement that the 23 person had been -- the person under the statute be 24 convicted of the loss. 25 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right, that really gets
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to the question that I was going to ask, and that is, I 2 don't see how the modified categorical approach is 3 something that you could admit would be sufficient 4 because, as I understand your argument -- and it is in 5 part an argument based on sort of standard grammatical 6 construction -- you're saying that in the definition 7 "The term 'aggravated felony' means an offense that" -8 and you emphasize the "that," the restrictive nature of 9 the "that" clause -- "involves fraud or deceit in which 10 the loss exceeds $10,000." 11 if I understand your restrictive clause argument, 12 the definition of the offense has got to include the 13 element of exceeding $10,000 or it does not satisfy 14 your, the -- it does not satisfy the standard that you 15 were arguing for based on the restrictive clause. So it 16 seems to me that you've got to go the whole hog or you 17 get nothing, and the whole hog is that it's got to be an 18 element of the offense that the loss exceed $10,000. Am 19 I wrong? 20 MR. MOSELEY: I don't think necessarily. 21 Well, under these circumstances, Justice Souter, what I 22 would say is that there may be statutes, there may be 23 statutes in which, there are statutes, there are State 24 statutes, where you have a range of conduct that may 25 include $10,000, may not include $10,000, and the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 modified categorical approach would apply under those. 2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, how about this one. 3 You were arguing based on this statute and you make an 4 argument based on the restrictive nature of a "that" 5 modifying clause, and if you're going to make the 6 restrictive clause argument, it seems to me you've got 7 to go the whole hog and say the element of the offense 8 has got to include the loss in excess of $10,000. 9 MR. MOSELEY: Certainly if it does, then 10 under the statutes involved here we would prevail. 11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yeah, you would 12 prevail, but you would prevail, it seems to me, at the 13 expense of this objection, and the government makes it. 14 There are very, very few fraud and deceit statutes that 15 define the offense by reference to a loss in excess of 16 $10,000. My recollection from the government's brief is 17 that they come up with three. 18 The fact is also that this provision, the 19 $10,000 figure, was placed into the statute at a time 20 when Congress was trying to expand the category of 21 deportable, removable offenses, and it would be passing 22 strange in that context to define the offense by 23 reference to a $10,000 figure as an element of the 24 offense which would cut it down, which would cut the 25 compass of the statute down to three offenses. What is
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 your response to that? 2 MR. MOSELEY: Well, I think the government 3 vastly understates the statutory provisions that were 4 involved here. Even if you look at the State statutes, 5 a majority of the State statutes, as I think we make 6 clear in our reply brief, a majority of States have 7 statutes, generally the theft by deception statutes and 8 others which have loss thresholds that will get you over 9 -10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, once you get into the 11 State statutes you get into the further problem of an 12 utter and I would suppose unjust patchwork of statutory 13 reference to which this would apply. If you -- if you 14 steal the $11,000 in State A, you get booted out of the 15 country. If you steal it across the State line in State 16 B, you stay home. I mean, I can't imagine that Congress 17 would have enacted that kind of scheme. 18 MR. MOSELEY: But what Congress has done 19 here is to provide for a uniform test, in effect. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: A uniform test that 21 produces both unjust results and I would suppose 22 strangely unsatisfying results to a Congress that wanted 23 to expand the concept of deportable offense. 24 MR. MOSELEY: But what -- but what -- if I 25 can just go back for a moment, Justice Souter, to the
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 original premise that it under all circumstances has to 2 be an element. There are certainly statutes, even 3 Federal statutes, for example, the theft from Federal -4 federally funded programs, which give specific loss 5 amounts of 5,000 or more, which would -- which -- excuse 6 me. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the problem is that 8 there's no pattern to it, The point that Justice Souter 9 made. If we take your position that there are a number 10 of statutes that mention amount, some as an element, 11 some by this, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to 12 when the amount is there and when it isn't, and then you 13 have these unequal results within the Federal system and 14 in the States, so when you think -- would it make any 15 sense for Congress to have drawn the line that way if 16 the State happens to make -- to have the "in which" or 17 if it just has fraud and deceit with no amount? 18 MR. MOSELEY: What -- Justice Ginsburg, I 19 think what Congress did here was to create a uniform 20 test, a uniform test in the sense you look to see if -21 if someone has been convicted of both these 22 requirements, fraud or deceit or the loss. That 23 certainly produces far more uniformity than had -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's treating people 25 who do the identical thing differently.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. MOSELEY: But Congress chose under these 2 circumstances, Congress chose under these circumstances 3 to -- swept broadly to, swept broadly to State statutes 4 in addition, in addition, in addition to, in addition to 5 encompassing the Federal statute. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what you're saying is 7 you're not denying that people who commit the identical 8 theft or deceit or fraud will be treated differently 9 depending on whether the statute under which they're 10 convicted has this "in which" clause? 11 MR. MOSELEY: What I believe, what I believe 12 that I am conceding is that it will determine -- as with 13 any of the criminal cases that lead to deportation, it 14 will determine -- it will be determined on the basis of 15 how the prosecution chooses -- excuse me -- chooses to 16 charge. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Moseley -18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Moseley, can I get 19 your help on a question I really have difficulty with. 20 It seems to me as I read the text, it is easy to read it 21 in one of two ways: It involves fraud or deceit in 22 which the loss to the victim in fact exceeded $10,000. 23 In that case you would lose. Or it could be read to say 24 involves fraud or deceit in which an element of the 25 crime is that the victim or victims exceeded a loss of
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 $10,000. You would lose under that also because it is 2 not an element of the crime. 3 So you are relying on a modified approach, 4 and under your modified approach what does the statute 5 say? 6 MR. MOSELEY: The -- the statute -- the 7 statute says that someone has to be convicted of -- of 8 both these aspects, both of -9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the statute doesn't 10 say anything about conviction. 11 MR. MOSELEY: If, Justice Stevens, if you 12 read it in conjunction with the conviction 13 requirement -- in other words, to -- to be deportable, 14 to be deportable, that's in -- in 6a. Someone who has 15 been convicted of an aggravated felony is deportable; 16 and also someone who has been convicted of an aggravated 17 felony is subject to, under -- under -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't 19 understand how you squeeze your -- your modified 20 categorical approach, which seems to be a deus ex 21 machina which is intended to blunt the government's 22 argument that very few statutes would be covered by 23 this. I don't see how you get that out of the word 24 "convicted." 25 Are you convicted of an offense involving
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 more than $10,000 if in a separate interrogatory the 2 jury, though it has no obligation in order to find you 3 guilty to say how much you stole, in an interrogatory 4 the jury says, oh, yes, the amount was more than 5 $10,000? Does that cause you to have been convicted of 6 that? You are convicted of what you are charged with. 7 You are convicted of the elements of the offense, not -8 not of whatever, whatever the judge chooses to allow the 9 jury to be questioned about. 10 MR. MOSELEY: I think under those 11 circumstances, though, particularly if you look at the 12 statutes which make gradations of sentencing on the 13 basis of loss amounts, you clearly would be convicted of 14 that. It is -- because that's a necessary element 15 that's going to -- that's a necessary fact that's going 16 to have to be found to put you in a particular 17 sentencing range. So you -- so you definitely would be 18 -- you would be under those circumstances convicted of 19 that amount. 20 But I think it's important to -- to 21 recognize what -- that Congress -- that Congress in 22 enacting the statute and in predicating removal upon 23 conviction used language that sharply distinguishes -24 that is sharply distinguished from the position that the 25 government advocates here that loss should be something
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to be determined in separate -- in -- in separate 2 removal proceedings. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to my 4 question, which I don't think you've fully answered? 5 And that's the tax evasion situation. For any tax -- a 6 person who is charged with tax evasion who goes to trial 7 and is convicted, that person would not be deportable, 8 as I understand it under your reading, because the jury 9 is not asked to determine the amount of the deficiency. 10 MR. MOSELEY: Well, the jury -- under those 11 circumstances, it will depend upon how the government 12 chooses, Justice Ginsburg, to prosecute the case. And 13 if the government chooses to prosecute the case by 14 seeking a determination of the deficiency amount in a 15 jury charge, then -- then, yes -- then, yes, indeed, 16 they would. But again, the vast majority of these cases 17 are resolved. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know. You told me that 19 most of them admit it at the plea stage. But going to 20 trial, these are parallel provisions, and it seems to me 21 they are meant to operate the same way. 22 MR. MOSELEY: Well, they -- they are -- they 23 are meant to operate the same way. But I think that 24 what we have here is a situation where the fact that 25 deficiency is a requirement and that deficiency in most
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 cases will be established by a plea, and that this is a 2 statute that sweeps broadly; that this is a statute that 3 sweeps -- excuse me -- sweeps broadly to encompass both 4 a loss in excess of 10,000 -- a deficiency in excess of 5 $10,000 or a deficiency under $10,000. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: Did you have any authority 7 for the -- the idea that a trial judge in a criminal 8 case should ask the jury to answer a special 9 interrogatory regarding a question that has no bearing 10 on the conviction, but may have a bearing on the future 11 immigration status of the defendant, which is what 12 you're suggesting should be done in these tax cases? 13 MR. MOSELEY: What -- what I am suggesting 14 in the tax case is that it would be perfectly 15 appropriate for the government to seek such a special 16 interrogatory if they wish to establish the tax loss, 17 which is an element of the -- which is a necessary 18 component of the offense, if they wanted to establish it 19 -- if they wanted to establish it for -- for purposes -20 for whatever purpose they wanted to establish it. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I can see that if 22 there are multiple defendants in the case, some of the 23 defendants might say that this is unnecessary, it's 24 inflammatory. 25 MR. MOSELEY: That's -- that's -- that --
20

1 again, that is going to depend on -- that's going to 2 depend upon how the government chooses to -- to 3 prosecute under these particular -4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But all that just 5 underscores the fact that -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- your earlier -- your 7 earlier assertion that it was necessary to -- that -8 that it would be necessary to get that -- that amount 9 specified for sentencing purposes is simply not true. I 10 mean, we didn't -- we didn't hold that the guidelines 11 are mandatory, and you -- that you need a -- a jury 12 determination. We've said they are discretionary. 13 MR. MOSELEY: No, I -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: So if you don't have a jury 15 determination, you can still sentence on the basis of 16 the amount taken, even though that was not found by the 17 jury. 18 MR. MOSELEY: I -- I understand. But my -19 my point, Justice Scalia, on this one is that -- on 20 (M)(ii) is that it is -- it is a statute in which -- in 21 which loss can or is required to be shown, some 22 deficiency is required to be shown, and this may -- and 23 this may well be done by the modified -- the modified 24 categorical approach, particularly in -- in -25 particularly in situations in which, as in most cases,
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it's resolved by a plea. 2 Now, if -- if -- but -- and also, this 3 statute was enacted against the backdrop of -- of the 4 categorical approach, and the act was amended -- has 5 been amended roughly four times during this period with 6 no indication that Congress certainly intended to 7 jettison this. And I think it's also important here to 8 note the structure of the act in terms of how Congress 9 sharply distinguished between what would happen with 10 conviction and -- and what would happen with sentence. 11 They did enact specific provisions, 12 101(a)(43), subpart (F) at 2a of the statutory appendix 13 and (G) at 2a of the statutory appendix, which talk 14 about -- which -- which talk about sentencing and make 15 that sharp distinction. 16 But I think we should not also lose sight of 17 the overarching fact here that this provision is an 18 integral part of a Federal criminal statute, 1326(b), so 19 that any ambiguity in the -- so that an ambiguity in the 20 construction and application of this statute should as 21 -- similarly to -- to what this Court held in Leocal, 22 should be resolved in favor of the -- in favor of the 23 alien, because it's the classic multiple or dual use 24 statute that has both civil and criminal applications, 25 and very severe criminal applications as well.

But we think that 5 that doesn't work for both practical reasons and for the 6 types of reasons that -- that several of the questions 7 raised in the first half of the argument -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: And also interrogatories to 9 the jury. 10 MR. GANNON: He does seem to contemplate 11 that interrogatories for the jury might also achieve the 12 same purpose. But as Justice Alito was pointing out, 13 there -- there is little reason to believe that a judge 14 is going to permit such extraneous questions to be put 15 to a jury that are -- that are not necessary for the 16 criminal proceeding that is actually being held at that 17 point. It's unlikely that the government wants to make 18 the entire -- wants to imply that the conviction needs 19 to turn on that. 20 And obviously, both with the -- the special 21 interrogatories and the guilty pleas, there are 22 practical problems, because this could only apply 23 prospectively, even though Congress's definition of 24 aggravated felonies is intended to apply to convictions 25 that predated the enactment of IIRIRA.

GANNON: Well, he did not ask the judge 10 for a finding of loss. He -- he asked for an 11 instruction -- for a special interrogatory as to "the 12 amount of money my client is responsible for." That's 13 on page 14a of his opening brief. And that's not the 14 relevant question for purposes of the loss threshold in 15 subparagraph (M)(i), which is actually about the -- the 16 loss to the victims from the offense involving fraud or 17 deceit, not how much any individual defendant might have 18 been responsible for. And even now -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but then you 20 just -- you, the government, says -- you know, you'll 21 have a little debate about what the special 22 interrogatory, how it is phrased, and your objection 23 there could be dealt with on -- during that negotiation. 24 MR. GANNON: Well, and at that point he -25 he -- we -- we presumably wouldn't want to have to prove

1 up a loss at that point that's irrelevant for purposes 2 of the criminal guilt proceeding, although it may well 3 become relevant for the sentencing proceeding, as it did 4 become relevant here, and there was a sentencing 5 stipulation. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and why would you 7 be reluctant to do that? Would you just spell that out 8 a little bit? 9 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that it 10 could confuse the jury. Even if it were clear that it 11 had nothing to do with a determination of guilt, that 12 would be a particularly odd sort of bifurcation to 13 thrust upon the original criminal proceeding, to require 14 the jury to make findings about facts that are truly 15 extraneous to the purposes of the criminal proceeding 16 that is being held there, and for -- at least for guilt 17 purposes, there is no reason for the jury to have to 18 find that. 19 And as -- as the questions before were 20 making clear, the reason this Court has applied the 21 modified categorical approach is to determine what is 22 necessary for the underlying conviction. That's why 23 it's tied to an investigation into what really were the 24 elements of the underlying offense. And interrogatories 25 about facts that were not, in fact, necessary for the
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 conviction or -- or extraneous facts that are introduced 2 into guilty pleas do not change the fact that that 3 particular attribute was not necessary for the 4 conviction. 5 And so, we think that it makes sense, in 6 context of the other definitions in paragraph 43 of the 7 definition of aggravated felonies, where it is 8 indisputable that there are multiple provisions that 9 include both an element that needs to be evaluated as an 10 element of the offense and some other limiting factor 11 that need not be an element of the offense; that it 12 makes sense to construe the loss threshold in 13 subparagraph (M)(i) as something that need not be an 14 element, because the consequences of Petitioner's 15 approach would be to read out virtually all Federal 16 fraud prosecutions, including such mainstays as mail 17 fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the government, 18 bank fraud, the offenses that were at issue here. 19 And he does offer a patchwork of some State 20 offenses that could be satisfied. But even there, 21 there -- there's not any particular consistency to it. 22 He invokes the Model Penal Code, which has a gradation 23 scheme for theft by deception offenses. And although 24 the BIA has -- has acknowledged that theft by deception 25 offenses may in certain circumstances constitute fraud
27

1 offenses, the Model Penal Code does not in the next 2 chapter dealing with forgery and fraudulent practices 3 have a consistent gradation scheme. 4 So even in the States that Petitioner cites 5 in his reply brief, Delaware doesn't have monetary 6 thresholds for insurance fraud, even though it does for 7 health care fraud; and New Jersey doesn't have monetary 8 thresholds for credit card fraud or payment card fraud, 9 and so a million-dollar fraud would not be -- would not 10 be treated consistently, depending upon which State it 11 was committed in and even which type of fraud it was in 12 an individual State, if the State -13 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this, does 14 this -- which is not exactly on point to the issue here, 15 but does the government have a theory about how the loss 16 is measured for purposes of this statute? Under the 17 sentencing guidelines, the loss was a very complicated 18 calculation, lots of rules about relevant conduct and 19 lots of cases and different ways of proving loss, and 20 here we just have the statute. 21 MR. GANNON: Yes, we think that it is not 22 necessarily the same as the loss determination that 23 would be made for sentencing. And so, the board has 24 made it very clear that even though a restitution order, 25 for example, can be sufficient evidence of loss to the
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 victim, that it needs to be assessed with an eye to 2 exactly what losses were determined in the underlying 3 restitution order and with regard to the burden of proof 4 there. And so -5 JUSTICE ALITO: What if you have somebody 6 who participates in a -- in a scheme involving 7 $100 million, the total loss is $100 million, but this 8 person had no way of reasonably anticipating that this 9 would be the -- the total amount of the loss, this was a 10 minor participant, and -- where would the -- how would 11 that come out? 12 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that the text of 13 the statute here in subparagraph (M)(i) talks about an 14 offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss 15 to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000. And so, we 16 think that the loss threshold is tied to the offense 17 that involves fraud or deceit, not to the individual 18 defendant's role. 19 If he's convicted of a $100 million fraud or 20 in this case what may well have been a $683 million 21 fraud, he is -- that -- that is the offense of which he 22 was convicted, and it is an offense in which the loss to 23 the victims exceeded $10,000. And so we think -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the judge, when he 25 arrives at the restitution amount, have discretion to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 say, as to this particular defendant, he was just an 2 accountant with the company that was committing the 3 fraud, he didn't put anything into his own pocket except 4 the salary they paid him, so I'm going to exclude him 5 from the restitution order? 6 MR. GANNON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in 7 general the -- the judge does have discretion to -- to 8 adjust aspects of the restitution order on the basis of 9 the facts of the underlying offense. And that's -10 that's one of the reasons why I think the board has been 11 sensitive to the idea that the restitution order does 12 not necessarily determine what the amount of loss is 13 going to be for purposes of -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you wouldn't allow 15 that exclusion to have any effect on deportation, would 16 you? 17 MR. GANNON: It would depend upon the facts 18 of the underlying case. If the underlying fraud was one 19 in which the victims lost nor than $10,000 and we could 20 prove that by clear and convincing evidence in the 21 removal proceeding, then -- then we think that we would 22 not be bound by the judge's discretionary refusal to 23 impose a restitution requirement on the particular 24 defendant. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So in -- in my very
30

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 hypothetical -2 MR. GANNON: Depending upon the facts of the 3 case, yes, Justice Ginsburg, in your hypothetical if we 4 can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the 5 amount of loss associated with a fraud offense was more 6 than $10,000, we think that would satisfy. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- even though this 8 defendant did not pocket any gain? 9 MR. GANNON: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 10 It's not a pecuniary gain threshold. It's a loss to the 11 victim threshold. And -- and although the judge may 12 well take that into account for purposes of restitution, 13 it doesn't change the metric that Congress chose to 14 determine which types of frauds are serious enough to be 15 considered aggravated felonies. 16 In 1994, they -- they picked a threshold of 17 $200,000. In 1996, they dropped that to 5 percent of 18 that value, to $10,000. I think Congress's judgment 19 here is that if the fraud is so severe that it -20 that -- that somebody -- that the victims lost $10,000, 21 then -- then that is a qualifying offense for purposes 22 of subparagraph (M)(i), even if the original criminal 23 sentencing judge, on the basis of all sorts of factors 24 associated with the case and under the restitution 25 standards, decided that the defendant was not
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 necessarily liable to pay restitution in that amount. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 3 defendant's argument that at least as far as his 4 admission for sentencing purposes, he did that only 5 because otherwise the government wouldn't ask for a 6 downward departure? 7 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that we are 8 not taking the position that the -- the stipulation for 9 sentencing purposes, which was pursuant to (6)(B)of the 10 guidelines and was for stipulation purposes -- we're not 11 arguing that that is -- is dispositive in the -- in the 12 civil removal proceeding. We're arguing that it's 13 persuasive evidence of the amount of loss here. 14 And so, he's -- he is certainly able to say 15 before the board or before the immigration judge that -16 that for some reason the amount that he admitted to 17 isn't really the -- the actual amount of loss associated 18 with the case. That's not what he has done here. He 19 has -- he has consistently tried to establish that -20 that this -- these -- this gargantuan loss amount was -21 was not one that was found by the jury, not that it was 22 not in fact the loss that actually accrued in 23 association with the -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But your position -- I 25 want to be sure I understand it -- is that if the record

GANNON: Not necessarily, Justice 9 Stevens. If the conviction was for the entire scheme, 10 then we could bring in the amounts that were relevant to 11 the scheme. But if -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the scheme -- the 13 evidence of the scheme consisted of just two mailings, 14 say. They allege a scheme and say it's a broad -- a 15 broad scheme, but they don't describe the amount. They 16 merely prove two mailings that involved $25 apiece. But 17 the scheme itself, because you proved it in other cases, 18 you have the facts, actually was a big scheme like we 19 have here. Could they rely on that for -- for 20 immigration purposes in a proceeding like this? 21 MR. GANNON: It's possible.

As far as the record shows, 19 it only affected -- it was one scheme that was as large 20 as this one, but the evidence to prove the scheme only 21 required you to prove two or three mailings involving 22 small amounts of money.

GANNON: Well, I -- if it were like 7 this, we had the evidence contemporaneous with 8 sentencing, with $100 million stipulations and things 9 like that, and that makes it obviously much easier for 10 us to prove the extent of the underlying fraud. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know it's easy; I'm 12 wondering if it's necessary. I -- I think under your 13 theory, it would not be necessary. As long as the 14 evidence is out there, you can use it in a de novo 15 proceeding before the immigration judge. 16 MR. GANNON: If -- if that were, in fact, 17 the scope of the conviction, because it was for -- for 18 the entire fraudulent scheme, then that may well be so. 19 Obviously, that -- the cases that have applied the -20 the tethered approach, to use the word that Petitioners 21 invoked here, are cases in which the -- the courts and 22 the BIA have recognized that sometimes it is necessary 23 to recognize that there's a distinction between what the 24 defendant actually pleaded guilty to.

GANNON: As long as the offense were in 7 fact the scheme rather than an individual instance of a 8 mailing, that's correct; and so I think that that -9 that that is consistent with Justice Stevens' 10 hypothetical and that we would in those circumstances be 11 able to -- attempts to prove by clear and convincing 12 evidence in the civil removal proceedings that the loss 13 associated with the offense, which was the scheme rather 14 than just an individual mailing, then -- then we would 15 be able to prove that.

This is just like the domestic 5 relationship prong of the misdemeanor crime of domestic 6 violence that the Court decided in its recent decision 7 in United States v Hayes, that -- that there is a prior 8 conviction, some aspects of which were elements of the 9 underlying offense, and in order to establish whether 10 the prior conviction needs the statutory definition in 11 the subsequent proceeding, the government will need to 12 bear the appropriate burden of proof for that 13 proceeding.

GANNON: We think that if this 6 definition were -- were to be applied in the criminal 7 context, then we would need to prove this aspect, the 8 loss threshold. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what you're 10 talking about, the alien who is convicted of a 11 qualifying crime, an aggravating felony, then tries -12 then comes back illegally. The difference between two 13 years and 20 years, you admit there you would have to 14 prove beyond a reasonable doubt? 15 MR. GANNON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, just to 16 be clear it's -- there's already a 10-year statutory 17 maximum that applies under 1326(b)(1) for the prior 18 conviction for a felony. I think that's something that 19 can easily be established through the categorical 20 approach and we would not need to have a "beyond a 21 reasonable doubt" determination in the illegal reentry 22 proceeding under 1326 to determine it's a felony. 23 But in order to determine that it is an 24 aggravated felony, as long as we could not satisfy 25 through a categorical approach to demonstrate that it
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 was an element of the offense in the original 2 proceeding, then, yes, I agree; we would need to meet 3 the relevant burden of proof in the 1326(b)(2) 4 proceeding. 5 Now, as it happens, this -- the extra 6 10-year statutory maximum at issue in 1326(b)(2) 7 effectively never gets litigated because the sentencing 8 guidelines arrange for aggravated felony enhancements in 9 that context for crimes like subparagraph (M)(1), ranges 10 from 21 months on the low end with no criminal history 11 to 5 months on the high end with criminal history of 6. 12 And so this effectively -- the extra 10 years of 13 statutory range is never employed by -- by judges for 14 these types of crimes. 15 In the last three years, according to 16 sentencing commission data, there isn't a single 17 defendant in the 1326 proceeding who received a sentence 18 of more than 10 years and had an increase on the basis 19 of an aggravated felony that would include the category 20 that we're dealing with here in subparagraph (M)(1). 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gannon, we're 22 dealing with the definition of a particular term, 23 aggravated felony. And yet you say the only thing that 24 you have to prove under the protections of criminal law 25 to prove that this is an aggravated felony is that it
40

1 involved fraud or deceit. Now, the other elements -2 the other provisions here talk about firearms offenses, 3 child pornography offenses, national security offenses, 4 but here it's fraud or deceit. I mean, it's a felony, 5 but there's nothing that strikes -- strikes me that it's 6 particularly an aggravated felony. 7 MR. GANNON: Well -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And yet that's all 9 you have to prove with the protections of the criminal 10 law as opposed to the civil. 11 MR. GANNON: Well, I think we have to prove 12 for purposes of the relevant proceeding in which we're 13 trying to establish that it is an aggravated felony that 14 it also exceeded the $10,000 threshold. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not subject to 16 the protections of criminal law that you have to show. 17 MR. GANNON: No more -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Beyond the 19 reasonable doubt, with the jury protections. 20 MR.

And so we -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I guess what 25 I'm saying, the only thing that makes this aggravated,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the $10,000, in contrast to the other things, which are 2 aggravated by virtue of elements that you have to 3 approve -- you have to prove beyond a reasonable 4 doubt -- is that it's fraud ir deceit. And as I said, 5 there's nothing about that that -- it's bad, but it 6 doesn't strike me as particularly aggravated. 7 MR. GANNON: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there 8 are several other statutes here that have extra limiting 9 factors that are necessary to make the crime an 10 aggravated one for purposes of the aggravated felony, 11 but don't have to be proved as an element of the 12 original offense. Congress has established -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's just -14 I think that's kind of begging the question. You assume 15 that those elements, those provisions also don't have to 16 be proved as elements. And what I'm suggesting, I 17 guess, is that if the only thing that makes it 18 aggravated is -- is something you don't have to prove 19 beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems that we ought to 20 look, well, is that really aggravated? 21 MR. GANNON: Well -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And when you're 23 talking about firearm offenses, or child pornography, 24 yes, that's aggravated; but fraud and deceit is kind of 25 a run of the mine felony.

1 MR. GANNON: Well, but for many of the 2 offenses it's things that as Petitioner acknowledges, 3 would never be proved as elements of the offense. It's 4 the notion that a crime of violence is one in which the 5 term of imprisonment is at least one year. There are 6 other ones that depend on the actual sentence that was 7 imposed. 8 There is a second or subsequent offense 9 that's referred to in subparagraph (J); there is an 10 exception for purely political offenses from the 11 definition of -- of crime of violence. There are 12 affirmative defenses -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess I 14 don't understand how that's responsive. It's -- it's -15 MR. GANNON: Well -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- part of violence. 17 In other words it seems to me you're already in the 18 aggravated area, so it makes sense to say that's what 19 you have to prove. 20 MR. GANNON: But not according to Congress. 21 It is only in the area, if it is not a purely political 22 offense, and if the term of imprisonment is at least one 23 year. And so by definition, it already can't be an 24 aggravated felony according to Congress if it doesn't 25 meet other factors that we would not have expected the

And here we know if that reading is imposed 2 on this statute, that it reads out all the mainstays of 3 Federal fraud prosecutions and brings in a haphazard 4 patchwork of -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on how you read 6 the language. I guess -- I guess grammatically it could 7 be read either way. You can read it: an offense that 8 involves fraud or deceit in which -- in which the loss 9 to the victim exceeds $10,000. Or you could read it: 10 convicted of an offense that involves fraud or deceit, 11 in which the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000. 12 I mean, "convicted" doesn't necessarily 13 apply to the last -- to the last phrase. 14 MR. GANNON: And we -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that's basically 16 what we're arguing about. 17 MR. GANNON: And we think -18 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the word 19 "convicted" -- the question is whether the word 20 "convicted" applies to the word "aggravated." That's 21 the point, as I understand the Chief Justice's 22 questioning, which goes to the burden of proof. So you 23 would win even under that approach if you said you had a 24 proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the other factors. 25 But the thing that creates the -- the
47

1 missing link is that to convert it from ordinary fraud 2 to aggravated fraud, you have to prove X under one view 3 by a reasonable -- beyond a reasonable doubt, but, under 4 your view, by only clear and convincing evidence. 5 MR. GANNON: Well, for purposes of a civil 6 removal proceeding, that's true, and that's no different 7 from the limiting factors in several of the other 8 provisions, like the sentence that was imposed -- the 9 potential sentence -- whether there was an exception for 10 a first offense that involved family members, for the 11 alien smuggling and document fraud, crimes in (N) and 12 (P). 13 And the -- this also is a reading that we 14 can't impose on subparagraph (M)(ii), where we know that 15 there is no loss requirement there, that the government 16 have a revenue loss of more than $10,000 for a crime in 17 which the loss to the government is $10,000. The "in 18 whiches" here are parallel to the "for whiches" 19 elsewhere in --in the statute. 20 And although Petitioner invokes the guilty 21 plea practice in the context of tax evasion offenses for 22 purposes of section 7201, this -- this doesn't help his 23 argument for the same reason that he cannot use 24 extraneous elements and guilty pleas generally to 25 establish that something was necessary for a conviction.

1 But if you look at the criminal tax manual that he 2 invokes, it makes clear by referring to relevant conduct 3 and the need for the loss amount there to include all of 4 the losses for all of the years in the indictment, even 5 if the defendant has pleaded guilty to an individual 6 count for a single year of tax evasion, that the loss 7 amounts that is typically included in guilty pleas in 8 7201 cases is not the loss amount that is relevant here. 9 It is in fact directly parallel to the sentencing 10 stipulation that -- that the Petitioner entered into 11 here. 12 If the Court has no further questions -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 14 Gannon. 15 MR. GANNON: The court of appeals should be 16 affirmed. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Moseley, you 18 have 4 minutes remaining. 19 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. MOSELEY 20 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 21 MR. MOSELEY: With respect to the issue of 22 deference, the fact that this is part of a Federal 23 criminal statute I believe doesn't get us -- cuts off 24 the inquiry, and we don't get to Chevron deference here. 25 We deal with a dual use statute which has both civil and
49

1 criminal applications, so that under these 2 circumstances, certainly as this Court held in Leocal 3 and in Lopez-Gonzalez, Chevron deference with respect to 4 Babaisakov would not -- for example -- would not be 5 triggered. 6 I think, moreover, it's important to note 7 that the Babaisakov got (M)(ii) wrong -- got the -- the 8 requirement of a deficiency wrong, and also got wrong 9 the fact that there were no statutes involved where 10 fraud -- where a loss amount in excess of $10,000 would 11 be an element. 12 Finally, I think the government's reading of 13 this statute might make sense if Congress had said that 14 -- convicted of a crime in -- a crime in which fraud or 15 deceit is an element, with loss to be found at removal 16 proceedings in excess of $10,000. But that's not the 17 language that Congress employed here, and under these 18 circumstances, even if the statute is perceived to be 19 ambiguous, that ambiguity should be resolved in the 20 Petitioner's favor. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: To come back to the 22 deference point, you say -- is this relevant to the 23 criminal conviction? He's convicted criminally 24 regardless of how you read that. You acknowledge it 25 doesn't -- it isn't an element of the crime, and so to

MOSELEY: But what the government has 6 said, if they're going to do a prosecution under 8 7 U.S.C. 1326(b), that they would seek to prove this 8 amount de novo in the underlying criminal proceeding. 9 So it will form -- it would form part of a -- it would 10 form part of a criminal prosecution -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in that later 12 criminal proceeding, they would have to prove it 13 undoubtedly -14 MR. MOSELEY: Right, and that -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: But this is not a later 16 criminal proceeding; this is an administrative 17 proceeding. And why shouldn't it be up to the BIA 18 initially to determine how to interpret this language 19 for purposes of the deportation laws? 20 MR. MOSELEY: It shouldn't, Justice Scalia, 21 because we deal with a dual use statute, as this Court 22 Leocal, which indeed was also a civil removal 23 proceeding, or Lopez-Gonzalez, which was a civil removal 24 proceedings. Leocal involved 18 U.S.C. 16 -- 16(b), and 25 --

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: But there -- was it not 2 true that there the interpretation placed upon the 3 statute by BIA would also be the interpretation 4 necessary to secure the criminal conviction? And that's 5 not the case here. 6 MR. MOSELEY: But it was -- but in 7 Lopez-Gonzalez, there was a -- there was a Board of 8 Immigration Appeals decision, Matter of Yanez, which was 9 directly opposite to what this Court held and ultimately 10 rejected in that decision. There -- this clearly is a 11 statute, I submit, that implicates -- that implicates a 12 Federal criminal prosecution later. And indeed if the 13 government, as the government's brief, says that they're 14 going to prove this amount in some subsequent illegal 15 reentry prosecution, that I submit raises more far more 16 concerns with respect to practicality. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I frankly couldn't 18 understand the government's concession on that point. I 19 thought the -- the offense on illegal entry was to enter 20 illegally after you've been deported. It's a -- there's 21 a defense if the original deportation was flawed? 22 MR. MOSELEY: No -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand that. 24 MR. MOSELEY: Well, that may be a separate 25 issue, Justice Kennedy. There is the sentencing
