1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:06 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 06-1249, Wyeth v. Levine. 5 Mr. Waxman. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 This case concerns conflict pre-emption 11 under the Supremacy Clause, and the conflict presented 12 here is stark. Repeatedly over the years, the FDA 13 approved Phenergan injection as safe and effective under 14 all the conditions and methods of use described in the 15 labeling, including what is referred to as "IV push" 16 injection. Yet a State jury, evaluating the same risk 17 that the FDA had considered, determined that the precise 18 labeling that FDA had required Wyeth to use in fact 19 rendered Phenergan "unreasonably dangerous." That -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just at the outset, I'll 21 just make one comment. You argue that it's impossible 22 for Wyeth to comply with the State law and at the same 23 time the Federal label. As a textual matter, as a 24 logical matter, I just -- I don't understand that. I 25 think I could design a label that's completely

1 consistent and that meets the requirements that the 2 Respondents wish to urge. 3 Now, if you want to say that any alteration 4 of the label violates Federal law, that's something 5 else. But as a textual matter, as a logical matter, as 6 a semantic matter, I don't agree with it. 7 MR. WAXMAN: Well, let me make sure, because 8 I do think we do agree, and I want to make sure that I'm 9 understood, Justice Kennedy. I think what you've 10 articulated is the test which is, is it possible for a 11 regulated party to comply at the same time with both 12 Federal law and State law? In other words, could they 13 use, as they were required by Federal law to do, to use 14 the precise label that in approving the application in 15 1998 the FDA required Wyeth to use, and also use the 16 label that the Vermont jury determined should be used, 17 and that was stated in the complaint and in the opening 18 and the closing a statement that you may not, should not 19 use IV administration or IV push, in other words that 20 you should contra -- the label should contra-indicate 21 something -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman -23 MR. WAXMAN: -- that -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It didn't say -- it 25 didn't say IV across the board. It said IV push is the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 claim, and that was -- as I understand this, the FDA was 2 aware of the IV use and a certain risk. But did it 3 ever, ever discreetly consider IV push versus IV 4 administered the usual way by a drip bag? 5 MR. WAXMAN: Yes it did, Justice Ginsburg, 6 and I want to cite you to the portions of the record 7 that demonstrate that it did. But before I do so, I 8 just want to underscore a point that I think is clear 9 from both our brief and the Solicitor General's brief, 10 which is that isn't the test of preemption in any event. 11 The question is what did the labeling say and upon what 12 information was the labeling decision made. 13 But as to your particular question, there 14 are -- first of all, there was testimony in the record 15 from multiple parties, including experts from both 16 sides, that the FDA was aware of all of the forms of 17 administration and the risk, including IV push. Their 18 experts simply disagreed with the judgment that the 19 labeling requires. But most saliently, the labeling in 20 this case, which is reproduced, in sort of microscopic 21 size unfortunately, on the last two pages of the 22 petitioner appendix and the last two pages of the joint 23 appendix, have four separate reference that, as we 24 explained in footnote 11 of our reply brief, only apply 25 to IV push.

1 There is a reference to the use of the Tubex 2 system. That is a direct IV push system. There is a 3 reference to rigid plungers and small-bore needles. 4 Again nothing to do with drip. There is a reference to 5 a maximum rate of administration. Drip is gravity. The 6 testimony in the case was that an instruction that a 7 particular rate of administration not be exceeded only 8 referred to IV push. And finally, there are cautions on 9 the label about how the ordinary aspiration of blood to 10 see if its bright or dark, which is only done in the 11 context of a needle that is being used to push something 12 into a vein, is not reliable in the context of this case 13 because Phenergan discolors arterial blood immediately. 14 So the labeling plainly comprehended and 15 warned about the specific risks of IV push 16 administration, and that's not all. There is an 17 advisory -- an advisory committee in 1976 was asked to 18 look at precisely the risk of arterial exposure to 19 Phenergan injection or any other irritant drug that is 20 administered intravenously and it made specific 21 recommendations, including recommendations that go 22 directly to IV push. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: How could the -- how could 24 the FDA concluded that IV push was safe and effective 25 when on the benefit side of this you don't have a

1 life-saving drug, you have a drug that relieves nausea, 2 and on the risk side you have the risk of gangrene? 3 MR. WAXMAN: I mean, there was testimony -4 Justice Alito, I can go over the testimony, but there 5 is -- there was testimony in this very case about those 6 very circumstances in which direct IV injection is 7 indicated. And there is also test -- there is also 8 evidence in the FDA record, including if you look at the 9 1987 correspondence that the FDA sent to Wyeth in the 10 context of talking about what warnings had to be 11 provided. The FDA provided Wyeth 20 citations to 20 12 medical journals that addressed this problem, and in 13 footnote 13 of our reply brief we've cited the ones that 14 specifically address the circumstances in which IV push 15 administration is an important tool. The point here is, 16 I think, that -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that doesn't answer 18 the question of was it -- the risk of gangrene and 19 amputation is there. No matter what benefit there was, 20 how could the benefit outweigh that substantial risk? 21 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, this is 22 labeling that is directed at medical professionals. It 23 is labeling that is directed at physicians, who have to 24 be able to determine what method, what pharmaceutical 25 and what method of administration to use, given the
7

1 constellation of risks and benefits that a particular 2 patient -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The FDA was never 4 concerned with risks versus benefit? 5 MR. WAXMAN: The FDA -- well, the FDA 6 certainly is. And the issue, Justice Kennedy, here is 7 the FDA has to decide what information to provide to 8 clinicians so that they can make judgments about what to 9 use. And it -- what it did here is it provided ample, 10 lavish warnings about the risk of intra-arterial 11 injection and exposure of an irritant drug like 12 Phenergan to arterial blood. It provided in the 13 labeling to the physicians a cascading hierarchy of 14 methods of administration. It said intramuscular 15 injection is the preferred method. It then said with 16 respect to intravenous injection that it is, as with any 17 irritant drug, it is usually preferable to inject it 18 into an IV infusion set that is known to be running 19 properly, in other words where a line has already been 20 established into the vein and the IV push occurs into 21 the line that's already established. 22 All that information was available to 23 physicians and the FDA has to understand and does 24 understand that in labeling to allow medical 25 professionals to make their judgments, taking options

1 away from physicians is not always better. It may 2 not -- it may not even often be better. What the FDA 3 has to decide in terms of telling physicians what's on 4 the table and what's off the table and in terms of 5 what's on the table what the relevant risks are is, is 6 this ever -- would this ever be medically warranted? 7 The testimony in this case and in the administrative 8 record was yes, there are circumstances -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'd like you to 10 address the distinction between the medical device area 11 and the drug area because in the medical device area, of 12 course, you have an express pre-emption clause, while 13 here in contrast you don't. 14 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. I mean, I think, 15 Mr. Chief Justice, you've identified the respect in 16 which this is difference than the medical device area. 17 But for the salient purposes, I think the Riegel case 18 directly points the Court to the nature of the 19 determination that the FDA makes with respect to class 3 20 drugs. It goes through the same preclearance process. 21 As we pointed out in our brief and as I think Justice 22 Scalia's opinion in Riegel points out, the balancing 23 time-intensive, data- intensive inquiry for medical 24 devices was patterned after what is done for drugs, and 25 it reflects a balancing of risks and benefits of the
9

1 particular drug in light of the conditions and methods 2 of administration prescribed in the labeling. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If that's true you 4 would have expected the Federal Drug Act to have a 5 similar express pre-emption provision. And one reason 6 perhaps that it didn't is that when the Drug Act was 7 passed you had an established background of State 8 actions; when the Medical Device Act was passed you 9 didn't. 10 MR. WAXMAN: Well, let me address both the 11 established background of State actions and then the 12 pre-emption clause difference, if I may. The Respondent 13 and her amici have identified 97 cases going back 150 14 years in which tort actions have been brought with 15 respect to pharmaceuticals. Very few of those cases -16 and they are recent -- are implicated by the rule that 17 the Vermont Supreme Court applied in this case, which is 18 where a fully informed FDA, informed of all the 19 information that Wyeth had, approved a labeling 20 standard, but a court looking at the same evidence can 21 reach a different conclusion about what is on the label. 22 The most -- those cases I believe all post-date 23 Cipollone. Many of them postdate Geier. And by my 24 count, there are fewer than 20 such cases out of all of 25 the cases that have been decided and those issues --
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that issue had never come up and never could have come 2 up when Congress enacted the 1938 Act, because it was 3 only the 1938 Act that established a drug-specific, 4 preclearance regime, and really in 1962, in which the 5 FDA was required not just to evaluate safety in terms of 6 licensing the distribution of the drug, but to balance 7 safety against effectiveness. 8 And so the -- the constellation of common 9 law cases -- I mean, let me just say we are -- we are 10 not seeking here a rule of field preemption. We are not 11 seeking to preclude tort remedies for conduct that 12 violates Federal law. 13 What we are saying here is -- and this goes, 14 I think, finally to your point about the express 15 pre-emption clause -- the presence of expressed 16 pre-emption clauses or the absence, the presence of a 17 savings clause or the absence, does not and cannot 18 affect the operation of conflict pre-emption under the 19 Federal Constitution. 20 Now, members of this Court are concerned 21 about applying a broad, vague, or free-wheeling analysis 22 of implied conflict pre-emption, but this case is 23 heartland. A jury was asked to look at the same 24 information and conclude that the precise language that 25 the FDA just didn't allow, the FDA required Wyeth to
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 use, rendered that drug unreasonably unsafe. 2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it required it 3 because that is what the FDA had approved as a label. 4 But as -- excuse me -- as I understand it, the -- the 5 company, Wyeth, could have gone back to the FDA at any 6 time and said, either based on experience or just our 7 rethinking of the data that we have, we think the label 8 ought to be changed to say "Don't use IV push." Wyeth 9 could have done that at any time, and it simply didn't 10 do it. 11 And the -- the reason I raise this is 12 because it could have done it at any time, where, going 13 back to Justice Kennedy's first question, where is the 14 conflict? 15 MR. WAXMAN: The liability in this case was 16 not predicated on the fact that Wyeth didn't go to the 17 -- remember, the FDA had approved this label two years 18 before Miss Levine was injured. In approving the label, 19 it rejected stronger proposed language that Wyeth had 20 presented. There was nothing that was -- Wyeth was -21 JUSTICE SOUTER: But as I understand it, 22 Wyeth's argument is not this argument. Wyeth is not 23 saying the reason there is a conflict here is that we 24 tried to give the kind of warning that the Vermont jury, 25 in effect, says we should have given and the FDA didn't
12

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 allow us to do it, so that, in fact, there is a conflict 2 between a specific rejection by the FDA of the Vermont 3 rule and the rule that the Vermont jury applied. 4 MR. WAXMAN: Right. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: As I understand it, Wyeth's 6 argument is: Whatever is on the label, in fact, is the 7 standard of conflict. It doesn't matter whether we 8 tried or could have tried or didn't try. You simply 9 look at the label and you look at what the Vermont jury 10 did; and if there is a -- if there is a difference 11 between them, there is a conflict. Am I right about 12 your argument? 13 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, you are right. We -- we 14 have both an impossibility form of conflict because, in 15 the absence of any new information or new analyses of 16 old information, we could not make the change in advance 17 of getting approval. And we also have an -- an 18 objects-and-purposes form of conflict pre-emption 19 because the Vermont jury decided on the same information 20 that the labeling that the FDA had approved and required 21 was unreasonably unsafe. 22 And we cannot have a world in which the very 23 day after an intensive process -- the FDA says you may 24 distribute this drug, but you must use this specific 25 language -- either, A, manufacturers can just run in and

That just is 7 inconsistent with -8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is it -- is it strict 9 liability or negligence? In other words, are they 10 saying you must have done so, or are they saying because 11 you could have done so and didn't you did not conform to 12 the standard of care? 13 MR. WAXMAN: Either a negligence theory or a 14 strict-liability theory would be pre-empted. 15 May I reserve the balance of my time. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 17 Mr. Kneedler. 18 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 19 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 20 AS AMICUS CURIAE, 21 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 22 MR.

14

1 conflict with the FDA's determination that Phenergan 2 injection is safe and effective under the conditions of 3 use recommended or suggested in the labeling. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, at the 5 outset, would you clarify something that is central, I 6 think, to this case? Some of the briefs tell us that 7 this represents a change of policy on the part of the 8 FDA, that in fact the FDA once approved and said torts 9 were -- tort suits were a helpful adjunct to the FDA's 10 own efforts to protect consumers. They helped because 11 they prodded manufacturers to -- to disclose risks that 12 were either unknown or under- evaluated. Was that once 13 the FDA's policy; and, if so, when did it change? 14 MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the FDA, to my 15 knowledge, has never taken the position that -- that, as 16 a general matter, a manufacturer may change a label 17 without -- without the existence of new information that 18 justifies a revision. The Respondents and the amici 19 relied primarily on some snippets of rule-making 20 proceedings and things like that in which FDA has 21 referred to the existence of tort remedies. But we are 22 not arguing for the proposition that tort remedies are 23 -- are pre-empted as a general matter. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: But when -- when would 25 there be a tort remedy? What -- what situation would

And, for 5 example, if -- and not to mention the fact if there was 6 adulteration of -- of the product or if the -- if the 7 product in the box was not the same -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if they found out 9 about new information which would, if properly 10 considered, alter what the labeling ought to be? Would 11 there be a tort remedy for the failure to bring that new 12 information to the attention of -13 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the position we are 14 arguing for here would not cover that situation, but -15 but there could be a further situation of pre-emption, 16 if I could just explain why. I think -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean if you failed to 18 provide the FDA the new information that you think 19 negates the provisions on the -- on the label, you still 20 couldn't be sued? 21 MR. KNEEDLER: No. If you -- if you failed 22 to provide it altogether, there would not be a -- a 23 pre-emption defense if there were -- if your 24 failure-to-warn claim was based on the new information 25 that you didn't furnish.

1 I was -- I was going to identify the

2 situation where -- and this has come up in the anti-

3 depressant drug situation, for example, where there is

4 evolving information. There has been a rule- making

5 petition, in fact several over the years, to the FDA to

6 change the labeling to warn against -- to warn about the

7 possibility of suicidal ideation.

And FDA has

8 rejected that even though it's -- it's new information

9 arising after the drug was approved. If the information

10 is brought to the FDA's attention and FDA rejects the

11 proposed change, then you would you have conflict

12 pre-emption again. But if the information was never

13 brought to the FDA's attention in the first place, then

14 -- then there would -- it would be not inconsistent with

15 Federal law to have a tort suit based on that. If it's

16 -- if it's been proposed and rejected, then you're back

17 with a conflict.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if you

19 brought it to the FDA's attention and the FDA just

20 hasn't acted on it? You would be authorized to change

21 the label on your own.

22 MR. KNEEDLER: You would be authorized, but

23 if FDA then rejects -- rejects the labeling --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand, but in the

25 interim, you could -- could you be subject to a State

17

1 tort suit for not changing the label when -- when you 2 had the power to do so? 3 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- if -- if FDA has taken 4 no action at all, then I think you -- you could be. I 5 this it's very likely that FDA would have acted by the 6 -- by the time that -- I mean, I suppose there could be 7 a window in there before it was approved. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why is that -- why is 9 that likely, considering the huge number of drugs? I 10 mean, one figure said that there are 11,000 drugs that 11 have this approval. Is the FDA really monitoring every 12 one of those to see if there is some new information 13 that should change the label? 14 MR. KNEEDLER: If I could make two points 15 about that: The first is, as I said, we are not arguing 16 that there is pre-emption in a situation where there is 17 new information that is not brought to FDA's attention. 18 But the second point is that in the 2007 19 amendments to the Act, Congress recognized the 20 difficulties with this and gave FDA important new 21 enforcement tools and resources to go after the problem 22 of things that arise after a drug is improved -23 approved, that has given FDA the authority to direct a 24 change in the label, which it did not have before. 25 It has given the FDA the authority to order

In four 7 instances it has ordered a revision of labeling. It has 8 hired 430 new employees in the Center for Drug 9 Evaluation and Research to address the post-marketing 10 situation. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't -- why isn't the 12 fact that some certain number of people are getting 13 gangrene, why isn't that new information? 14 MR.

KNEEDLER: As FDA explained in 2008,
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 when it promulgated this regulation, it's been FDA's 2 long-standing interpretation that only new information 3 would justify a change. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't that be new? 5 MR. KNEEDLER: New information means new 6 information about a risk that is greater in severity or 7 frequency. If you have -8 JUSTICE BREYER: If you get a certain number 9 of cases. 10 MR. KNEEDLER: There is no claim -- there is 11 no claim here that either of those -- in the record in 12 this case, that either of those was true. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: That's because nobody 14 brought up this new information point. So if nobody 15 brought up the new information point at the trial and if 16 the burden is on the manufacturer to show that it's 17 pre-empted, isn't that the manufacturer's fault, because 18 if you simply read the regulation, you wouldn't find any 19 of all this complicated stuff about certain kinds of new 20 information. 21 MR. KNEEDLER: That's a legal question not a 22 factual. And it was argued to the Vermont -23 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes it's a legal question. 24 MR. KNEEDLER: It was argued to the Vermont 25 Supreme Court, and I don't think -- I don't think that

We are deciding this case. And this 9 case here you say new information of a certain kind 10 would be okay, nobody argued it. You read the reg, and 11 it doesn't seem to make all these distinctions end of 12 case. Since the manufacturer has the burden of going 13 into this, which apparently it didn't do. So, now we 14 have decided this case, and we go on to the next one. 15 MR. KNEEDLER: Okay. If I could make just 16 one further -17 JUSTICE BREYER: What's your response to 18 that? 19 MR. KNEEDLER: If I could make one further 20 point about that. And that is the -- this act sets up a 21 prior approval situation. In other words, Congress 22 wanted the FDA to look at the drug in advance, 23 balance -- against benefits as this Court said in 24 Rutherford, and -- Brown & Williamson, strike a balance 25 and approve it.

1 Riegle, where the preemption turns on that device, in 2 that case, and the labeling that was presented. Here 3 the preemption turns on the labeling and the drug that 4 was presented. And FDA regulations prohibit the change 5 unless there is new information. 6 If I could make one other point about 7 Riegle. Riegle does contain an FDA -- an expressed 8 preemption provision. But the reason why this Court 9 found preemption in Riegle under that provision is very 10 instructive here, because as Mr. Waxman pointed out, the 11 premarket approval process in the two situations are 12 essentially the same. 13 And what you had on the one hand was Federal 14 action having the force of law like under the file rate 15 doctrine or some administrative determination having the 16 force of law approving a license or -- or a drug, a 17 legal prohibition against changing that without new 18 information. And on the state side, you have a rule of 19 law under the common law of torts imposing a different 20 obligation. Those are squarely termed -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're talking about 22 changing but you can supplement without changing the 23 label. 24 MR. KNEEDLER: No -- no, you cannot.

FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 13 Justice. 14 I'd like to start with regulation 201.80, 15 which is set forth in an addendum to our brief at 19-A. 16 The second sentence of which reads: "The labeling shall 17 be revised -- this is after an applicant, a sponsor has 18 obtained approval of the drug label -- "it shall be 19 revised to include a warning as soon as there is 20 reasonable evidence of an association of a serious risk 21 with a drug. A causal relationship need not have been 22 proved." 23 The testimony at trial established that 24 Wyeth knew or should have known from at least the '70s 25 that there was a significance issue concerning IV push

1 risks. 2 And, Justice Alito, in answer to your 3 question -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Those -- those 5 risks were set forth on the labeling approved by the 6 FDA. Surely that sentence means it shall be revised to 7 include a warning as soon, as soon as there is 8 reasonable evidence of an association of a serious 9 hazard that the FDA has not considered. And that is not 10 already addressed on the labeling. I mean to read it 11 as -- as opening up stuff that's already been considered 12 by the FDA would -- would -- would make a -- a mush out 13 of it. 14 MR. FREDERICK: FDA never considered any 15 comparative risks of IV push versus IV drip. The 16 evidence on this was clear. Wyeth had a -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the 18 various portions of the label in the record that 19 Mr. Waxman addressed and Mr. Kneedler, representing the 20 FDA, said they specifically considered IV push risks? 21 MR. FREDERICK: What the evidence showed was 22 that FDA certainly was aware that there are different 23 forms of intravenous administration of drugs, but it 24 never considered that the risk of IV push so greatly 25 increased the risks of a catastrophic injury --

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they have to. 2 When they determine that it's safe to use it under those 3 circumstances that necessarily includes a consideration 4 of the risk. People can say it's safe for you to walk 5 down the sidewalk. That doesn't mean there is no risk 6 that you get hit by lightning or something else. It 7 just means in evaluating them together, they determine 8 that it's worth the candle in particular cases where a 9 physician determines that that's the indicated method. 10 MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, here 11 there was no way FDA could have made this determination 12 because the risks of IV push are so catastrophic 13 compared to the benefit which the testimony at trial 14 showed -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're just 16 contradicting the label. The fact is they could not 17 have approved that label unless they made that 18 determination. 19 Now, if you're telling me the FDA acted 20 irresponsible -- irresponsibly, then sue the FDA. 21 MR. FREDERICK: No. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the labeling made it 23 very clear that the preferred method of administering 24 this medicine was -- was -- was muscular and -- and that 25 there were serious risks involved in -- in the IV push.

1 Moreover, your client didn't follow the 2 labeling or your client's physician didn't follow the 3 labeling prescription for IV push, did he? 4 MR. FREDERICK: The testimony at trial 5 showed that the doctor acted with a standard of care 6 that was not negligent, and that was based on expert 7 testimony. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. No. Wait, wait. He 9 administered a -- a level of the drug that was vastly in 10 excess of -- of -- of what the labeling said could 11 safely be used for IV push. 12 MR. FREDERICK: And the testimony at trial 13 showed that that had no bearing on her injury, 14 because -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Had no bearing. Are you 16 serious? 17 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. It did. The testimony 18 at trial from Dr. Green disputed that point. Both 19 courts below rejected that notion. 20 But the idea that a label is set in stone 21 for all time misunderstands the way the process works. 22 When FDA approves a drug with a drug label, it does so 23 on the basis of small clinical trials with very few, 24 sometimes as few as a thousand or a couple of thousand 25 people. And when the drug is marketed and goes to lots
27

1 and lots of people that are not healthy, that are in 2 different conditions, new problems arise. That's why 3 the general -- the GAO found that over 51 percent of 4 drugs have adverse drug events not known. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: You established that there 6 were new problems? I mean, if there were new problems, 7 then -- then they could have simply supplemented the 8 labeling. But did you establish that there were 9 problems that had not been considered already by the 10 FDA? 11 I mean, the labeling says, you know, that 12 this is dangerous to use -- use IV push. It made it 13 very clear that it's dangerous. 14 MR. FREDERICK: That was not our burden and 15 that was not how the testimony came in at trial. But as 16 the amicus brief by Dr. Budhwani, et al. at pages 54 17 establishes had Wyeth been a reasonably prudent 18 manufacturer over the years, it would have known that 19 the risks of IV push so far outweigh any bearing 20 negligible benefits, that it would have offered a 21 stronger instruction, it would have moved to revise its 22 label either with FDA approval or -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: It proposed a more 24 restrictive label to the FDA, didn't it? And the FDA 25 said, no, you use this label. In other words, it's --

1 what you're saying was not its call. It was the call of 2 the FDA. 3 MR. FREDERICK: Footnote one of the Vermont 4 Supreme Court's opinion disputes that point, because it 5 says the label was different. And if you compare what 6 was submitted to FDA versus what FDA looked at, there 7 was no reference to IV push risks creating the risk of 8 catastrophic harm versus negligible, Justice Scalia. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your -- I 10 thought your theory was that this type of administration 11 of the drug should not be allowed. The label should not 12 say here are the risks, here are the benefits. You -13 your jury theory was you cannot suggest in the labeling 14 that physicians should have this available. 15 MR. FREDERICK: Well, as the jury was 16 instructed, Mr. Chief Justice, and the evidence came in 17 at trial, it was -- it was somewhat larger than that in 18 the sense that a State failure to warn claim doesn't 19 prescribe particular wording. It simply says that the 20 existing wording is inadequate. And if the case comes 21 to this Court -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it simply says 23 that if you go ahead with the label like this, you don't 24 have to pay $10 million whenever it comes wrong. That's 25 having the effect, as our case has established, imposing
29

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 a limitation on the label. 2 MR. FREDERICK: But the label itself is not 3 set in stone, Mr. Chief Justice. Manufacturers change 4 their labels all the time as new drug risks come in. 5 And the regulations provide that the manufacturer is 6 responsible not only for the label, but for monitoring 7 post-market information. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your case depends 9 upon us determining that the risk at issue here that was 10 presented to the jury was a new risk that the FDA did 11 not consider? 12 MR. FREDERICK: No. It's not dependent on 13 that at all, Mr. Chief Justice. It is dependent on a 14 finding that the manufacturer had a duty of due care and 15 it didn't live up to that. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if it referred to new 17 drug risks, then, in your preceding sentence, where you 18 are saying manufacturers change it all the time as new 19 drug risks become apparent? 20 MR. FREDERICK: The testimony -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What you mean is whether or 22 not new drug risks become apparent, they have to change, 23 right? 24 MR. FREDERICK: The question is what does 25 the manufacturer know and when did this manufacturer

1 know it? And here, the testimony at trial showed that 2 an antinausea drug called Vistrol -- this is at page 79 3 of the joint appendix -- caused amputations in two 4 cases. Pfizer voluntarily removed IV push injection for 5 that drug. This was information in Wyeth's files; Wyeth 6 knew this from the 1970s; and yet it did nothing to 7 change the Phenergan label. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose -9 JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to the 10 obligation in this case, may I go back to an earlier 11 question that Justice Scalia asked you? And I -- I -12 if you responded to this particular point, I didn't get 13 it. 14 He said that he understood that Wyeth had in 15 fact asked the FDA to modify the label, at least to 16 strengthen the warning against IV push, and that request 17 was -- was denied, so that in fact that -- that created 18 the conflict. What is your response to -- to the 19 factual basis for that -- for that comment? 20 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the FDA itself said in 21 the Solicitor General's brief at page 25 that it was 22 deemed to be a nonsubstantive change. These were 23 changes that were being made -24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, regardless of what 25 their, their semantic label was, was there a request at
31

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 least to -- to beef up the warning against using IV 2 push? And if so, did the -- did the FDA reject it and 3 say no, you can't do that. 4 MR. FREDERICK: It was a different label and 5 it was a different strength of warning, but it didn't 6 have to do with the relative risks and benefits of IV 7 push versus IV drip. 8 JUSTICE SOUTER: What would it -9 MR. FREDERICK: That was the crucial point. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: What would it have said? 11 MR. FREDERICK: This is set out at footnote 12 1 of the Vermont Supreme Court opinion, which is set out 13 in the joint -- in the petition appendix at pages 4a to 14 5a, and it goes on for two pages. But essentially what 15 the -- what the comparison was was talking about the 16 preferability of injecting it through the tubing of an 17 intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning 18 satisfactorily, which would suggest to most medical 19 practitioners and was it the case in the trial testimony 20 given by Dr. Green below, that that would suggest an IV 21 drip, not IV push. 22 When FDA then rejected it for -- for 23 nonsubstantive reasons, it went back to the prior 24 verbiage which is set out at 5a, which simply says if 25 you put this drug in an artery the concentration can be
32

1 such that it will -- it will cause harm. 2 But our point is that these kinds of risks 3 come to light frequently with drugs that are on the 4 market and the need to revise these labels is the duty 5 of the manufacturer. Section 314. -6 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- you also, to be 7 clear on it, as I understand it, you do not accept the 8 position that the FDA puts forward, that the obligation 9 depends upon the accrual of new information. 10 MR. FREDERICK: Well, how you -11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Any information, new or 12 old, as I understand it, on your argument raises this 13 obligation to -- to act. 14 MR. FREDERICK: I think that the dispute is 15 -- is what constitutes new information, because we don't 16 take issue with the notion that new information can be 17 new analysis of prior submitted data; and what the 18 amicus brief by Dr. Budhwani et al. Points out is that 19 there was a lot of unpublished information about the 20 harms of Phenergan that was known to Wyeth or should 21 have been known to Wyeth in the '80s and '90s that would 22 have justified a change under the CEE regulations. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose the record 24 showed that the FDA clearly considered whether IV push 25 should be contraindicated and concluded it should not be

1 and prescribed the label that now appears on the drug; 2 and then, as some of the other arguments have 3 referenced, the very day after the FDA made that ruling, 4 Ms. Levine was injured. Would you still -- would she 5 still have a claim in your view, a non-pre-empted claim? 6 MR. FREDERICK: That be pre-empted. And the 7 reason it would be pre-empted is because the FDA would 8 have considered and rejected on the basis of the same 9 information or similar information the very duty that 10 underlies the State claim. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: So your argument is -- is 12 predicated on the existence of new information. If 13 there was no new information, then the claim is 14 pre-empted? 15 MR. FREDERICK: No, it's -- well, it is 16 not -- I think there are two things to keep analytically 17 clear. One is can the manufacturer come forward with a 18 label change on the basis of -- of information that is 19 assessing the risk or reassessing the risk, and under 20 the -- under the regulations it's absolutely clear it 21 can do that before FDA has approved it. It is subject 22 to FDA disapproval. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and is entitled to 24 amend the labeling automatically. 25 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I envision a -- a scheme 2 under which manufacturers who are worried about jury 3 liability of -- of the magnitude that occurred in this 4 case saying, gee, why should we take chances? And every 5 time there is a jury verdict on some -- on some other -6 some other ground not -- not prohibited by the label, 7 they just add that to the label; and they submit it 8 to -- to the FDA and the -- and until -- unless and 9 until the FDA conducts an investigation and disapproves 10 that label, that labeling change occurs. 11 How many -- how many -- you mentioned a 12 number of -- of times that -- that label alterations 13 are -- are proposed. I mean, this is going to be a 14 massive operation for the FDA. 15 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, that would 16 promote public safety, because it puts into the hands of 17 doctors the information that enables them to make 18 individualized risk determinations. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: It would not promote public 20 safety if you believe that the name of this game is 21 balancing benefits and costs. 22 MR. FREDERICK: And Congress said -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if you are simply 24 eliminating certain drugs which people who -- who have 25 real desperate need for could -- could be benefited by,

1 you're not benefiting the public. 2 MR. FREDERICK: No, and in fact that's 3 contrary to the policy determination Congress made. In 4 the misbranding provision, which is Section 352(f), it 5 calls -- that the label is misbranded unless its 6 labeling bears adequate directions for use and such 7 adequate warnings against use in those pathological 8 conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous 9 to health or against unsafe dosage or methods or 10 duration of administration or application. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that applies even if 12 it's approved by the FDA? 13 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. It's misbranded. And 14 in the 1979 -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying FDA approval 16 doesn't -- doesn't give you any protection at all? 17 MR. FREDERICK: It -- it provides you a 18 basis for marketing your --- your product. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but -- but the 20 marketing may be a misbranding? 21 MR. FREDERICK: In -- the FDA itself said so 22 in 1979 in 44 Federal Register, which we cite in our 23 brief, that even an original label may be misbranded if 24 the drug manufacturer subsequently learns that it was 25 not adequate for the safe use of the drug.

1 danger, then any liability that is based upon what the 2 -- the kind of information that the FDA knew would be 3 pre-empted. The only time -- you're saying pre-emption 4 does not occur when there is -- forget the word "new" 5 for a moment -- when there is further information, 6 information in addition to what the FDA was told, 7 whether it's 1,000 years old or discovered yesterday; 8 and if there is liability predicated on further 9 information beyond what the FDA was told, then there is 10 not pre-emption. 11 Is that a fair statement of your position? 12 MR. FREDERICK: That's fair, but let me just 13 make clear that our test would require the FDA to 14 consider and reject the specific basis on which the 15 State law -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's a fair statement 17 then you have to retract your -- your earlier assertion 18 that whenever it's not safe it's misbranded.

Whenever 22 it's not safe, it's misbranded, or what you just 23 responded to Justice Souter? 24 MR. FREDERICK: The basis -- the basis of 25 the FDA's approval is on the basis of limited

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, I think 2 you're saying if there -- if there would be pre-emption 3 it may be misbranded, but there cannot be any recovery 4 in a State tort suit. 5 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. The -- the 6 point -7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So misbranding under 8 those circumstances is a purely theoretical concept. 9 MR. FREDERICK: In that very hypothetical, 10 yes. 11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 12 MR. FREDERICK: But the point is that the 13 failure is that the failure-to-warn claim tracks the 14 misbranding provision; and if you look at the jury 15 instructions in this case, the wording is very close to 16 the wording of the misbranding provision in terms of the 17 adequacy of the warning that must be provided. 18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick -19 MR. FREDERICK: All State law is doing is 20 providing a remedy that is absent from Federal law. 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, I'd like to 22 put the misbranding point to one side and just 23 concentrate on pre-emption. And I understood you to 24 agree with Justice Alito that there is a hypothetical 25 case in which there would be pre-emption, and would you
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 tell me what particular fact distinguishes your case 2 from his hypothetical? 3 MR. FREDERICK: The fact is there was no 4 consideration and rejection of a stronger IV push 5 warning. There was no consideration by the FDA of IV 6 push as a means of administration distinct from other 7 intravenous forms that would lead to a different kind of 8 risk-benefit balancing. So with the -- in the case 9 where there would be pre-emption, FDA would be asked, we 10 -- we want to put a stronger warning as against this -11 FDA says: We don't think there is scientific evidence. 12 Do not put that warning on the label. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So now, your friends 14 on the other side said there was specific consideration 15 of IV push as opposed to simply arterial exposure, and 16 that that is laid forth in the labeling. So, as I 17 understood your answer to be, all we have to do is 18 simply look at the record, and if we think the FDA 19 considered specifically IV push risks as opposed to 20 general arterial exposure, then you lose, and if we 21 determine that they did not, then they lose. 22 MR. FREDERICK: And the Vermont Supreme 23 Court was quite emphatic about this, Mr. Chief Justice. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't know 25 if the Vermont Supreme Court was emphatic about it. I
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 mean, the record is either -- addresses the FDA -- I'm 2 more interested in what the FDA was emphatic about, and 3 they either address IV push separately or they don't. 4 MR. FREDERICK: And you search in the joint 5 appendix in vain for communications between Wyeth and 6 FDA communicating about the particular risks of IV push. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- can you turn to 8 the references that Mr. Waxman and Mr. Kneedler made? 9 They said oh, yes, IV push was considered discretely 10 from IV drip bags. 11 MR. FREDERICK: I will acknowledge that the 12 references in some instances suggest IV push. There is 13 no doubt that the FDA knew that IV push was a method of 14 intravenous administration, but our point is a starker 15 one, and that is that the FDA never was put to the test 16 of deciding comparative risks and benefits of IV push 17 versus IV drip. And it's that point that is crucial, 18 because the catastrophic risks of IV push are so 19 dramatic, no reasonable person could have made a safety 20 determination to allow this drug with its risks when 21 there are corresponding benefits that create exactly the 22 same kind of treatment of care for the patient. 23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is your argument that 24 they couldn't have considered these comparative risks, 25 because if they had, they would have come out
42

FREDERICK: There are communications 12 that went back and forth between the company. These are 13 set out in the joint appendix. They make no reference 14 to IV push risks as distinct from -15 JUSTICE SOUTER: And do these -- when you 16 say "communications," do you mean starting with the 17 original application for approval of the label? 18 MR. FREDERICK: The original application 19 actually is not known. It wasn't in Wyeth's files. 20 This drug was approved in 1955. We don't know where the 21 original label was, Justice Souter. 22 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, you are saying all the 23 correspondence that we do know about, that is extant, 24 fails to mention comparative risk. 25 MR.

And Dr. Matthew testified at trial that, 9 based on the label, he would not have been able to make 10 a treatment determination to distinguish between the 11 two, and that had he had that information, he clearly 12 would have given this drug to Diana Levine through the 13 intravenous drip method. The label simply didn't -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we conclude that new 15 information is the criterion for deciding this case, if 16 we reject the argument that misbranding at the outset 17 allows State law to supplement the duty, but that if 18 there's new information, then the label has to be 19 changed -- if it that's the line we draw, can this 20 verdict be sustained? 21 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, I think it can be 22 sustained on the basis of -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the Vermont court's 24 opinion? 25 MR. FREDERICK: I don't think that the
44

1 Vermont Supreme Court's opinion totally, because it does 2 go into the area that you're talking about, Justice 3 Kennedy, but if I could refer the Court to trial record 4 testimony, which is set out in the joint appendix and 5 more elaborately in the trial record itself, which makes 6 clear that Wyeth knew or should have known about these 7 comparative risks. It should have had a basis for 8 changing its label or proposing to FDA a different 9 label, and that would be sufficient to satisfy the 10 Federal standards as well as the State duty of due care. 11 And we think the judgment on that basis could be 12 sustained. 13 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this: When did 14 the duty on the part of Wyeth to have a different label 15 arise, in your view? 16 MR. FREDERICK: I think it probably arose in 17 the early '70s when a -- when there was a published -18 or there was an incident -19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Did it arise before or 20 after submitting the original drug application? 21 MR. FREDERICK: A strong argument can be 22 made that it would have been before the 1970s 23 application when they were reformatting. These are old 24 drugs. We don't have evidence from the 1950s that would 25 have suggested that the original label determination in
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 1955 would have caused a difference but certainly by the 2 1970s when -- when Wyeth was reformatting this as an old 3 drug to comply with new standards, it should have known 4 and it certainly should have known by the 1990s when 5 several amputations had occurred from IV push Phenergan, 6 which were in Wyeth's files. The people who analyzed 7 these records, you know, were emphatic that Wyeth knew 8 or should have known by the 1990s. And that was clear 9 by the testimony of experts that -- that showed the 10 comparison between Vistrol and Phenergan and on the 11 basis of the IV push injuries that had occurred that 12 were nonpublished. They appeared to have been reported 13 to FDA, but Wyeth never took the trouble to do the 14 synthesis, to connect the dots between these very 15 terrible tragedies that had occurred from its drug, to 16 bring about a labeling change or a modification that 17 would have saved lives. And that is a failure on the 18 part of the manufacturer not to comply with its 19 standards of due care and with the regulations which 20 require health risk information to be the basis of 21 modifications to the labeling. 22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that boil down to a 23 claim that there was new information that was available 24 between the original approval and the time of the 25 lawsuit?

I think we would be able to establish 9 that there was a justification on the basis of 10 information before the reformatted labeling took place, 11 and that was testimony by Dr. Green at trial on the 12 basis of Vistrol, the other amputation that had occurred 13 with Phenergan in 1965. 14 And the -- the important point here is that 15 on the basis of new information, if you are going to 16 conclude that there is a standard that has to be met, I 17 would urge you to consider two things: One is that the 18 burden of showing absence of new information is going to 19 fall on the manufacturer because it is asserting a 20 pre-emption defense, but the way pre-emption gets argued 21 in the courts, it is done oftentimes before discovery is 22 permitted. So, if there is information in the drug 23 manufacturer's files that would be relevant to a 24 determination of the breach of duty by the drug 25 manufacturer, if you decide pre-emption has to be done
47

1 before discovery can be done, there would be no way to 2 get that information. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, to put the burden on 4 the manufacturer seems to me inconsistent with what 10 5 States have said, that there is a rebuttable presumption 6 and inconsistent also with the instructions the jury 7 received in this case, that you can consider the FDA 8 label. So, I think, to me, what you say there is not 9 borne out by what happened in this case or by those 10 other States' -11 MR. FREDERICK: Well, let me -- let me 12 address that question because your question goes to the 13 regulatory compliance defense and that is not a 14 pre-emption defense. It is a defense based on State law 15 that the manufacturer in fact was not negligent because 16 it complied with the applicable regulations. In that -17 under that scenario, Justice Kennedy, the plaintiff is 18 going to be able to obtain discovery and make arguments 19 to the trial court about whether or not that compliance 20 negated or did not negate negligence. But pre-emption 21 is a Federal defense that would be asserted typically at 22 the outset of the lawsuit before information is 23 obtained. And notably, before 2000, FDA did not have 24 subpoena power of drug manufacturers. It did not have 25 the power to force labeling changes. It didn't even
48

1 have the power to force drug manufacturers to make 2 post-marketing studies. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: The --the part I'm trying 4 to figure out is this: Suppose it was before trial. I 5 don't care, before or after. The plaintiff comes in 6 with a claim. All right. Manufacturer: That's 7 pre-empted. The claim is that you should have told the 8 FDA and added something to your label. 9 Manufacturer: That's preempted. Plaintiff: Well, you 10 haven't read this reg here. The reg here which has been 11 in existence since 1965 says that we can go and add 12 something. I mean you can go and add something to show 13 a contra indication, and that's the end of it. 14 Now, in fact, 30 years later, I guess, 15 without the horrible things happening that Justice 16 Scalia mentioned, or maybe they did -- I don't know. 17 But 30 years later the FDA makes another mention of new 18 information. I take it that's in 1982. That's the 19 first time that happened. 20 Now, if I'm right about that, what happens 21 when no one says a word about that? Of course, if the 22 manufacturer had said something about that, then maybe 23 the plaintiff would have said: And it was new. It was 24 new, but the manufacturer doesn't say a word. Are you 25 following what I'm saying?

1 MR. FREDERICK: I'm not totally, Justice 2 Breyer, I confess, but let me try to address it this 3 way. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I'm wondering still 5 what happens. I believe what happened here is that in 6 the argument in the lower courts, in the trial court, 7 nobody said anything about the FDA's claim that the 8 information necessary to just go ahead and change the 9 label had to be new. Am I right about that? 10 MR. FREDERICK: You are absolutely right 11 about that. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: So what I'm trying to 13 figure out -- and I don't know if "burden of proof" is 14 the right word -- where nobody says a word about it, who 15 wins? If they had said a word about it, you need new 16 information, maybe the manufacturer -- the plaintiff 17 could have shown that the manufacturer had new 18 information. 19 MR. FREDERICK: I think the duty is always 20 going to be on the manufacturer, Justice Breyer. The 21 regulations at 314.80(b) establish that the -- that the 22 manufacturer has the responsibility to do post23 marketing analysis and post-marketing surveys to 24 determine the continuing safety of its drugs. If the 25 manufacturer doesn't do that, it isn't complying with
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the Federal regulations which have an ongoing duty on 2 them. 3 And so in the case where there is silence, I 4 would respectfully submit the manufacturer is not 5 complying with its regulatory duty to ensure that there 6 is current information about all of the side- effect 7 risks of its drugs. 8 Thank you. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 10 Mr. Waxman, you have three minutes remaining. 11 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 12 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 13 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 14 I want to make -- I do want to go to -- make a 15 preliminary point about all the talk about misbranding 16 here. The statute has two criminal prohibitions. One 17 is misbranding, which is the original 1906 reactive 18 penalty. If the FDA subsequently finds that something 19 is false or misleading, it CAN come after you for 20 misbranding. But this case involves the criminal 21 prohibition against distributing drugs for which there 22 is not an approved, effective application. And that's 23 what's at stake here. 24 Now, the notion that there was any -- any 25 misunderstanding in the trial court about whether there
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 was new information or whether there was -- there were

2 incidents that the FDA didn't know about, or it didn't

3 evaluate the risk, is just flat wrong. The plaintiff

4 tried this -- the plaintiff's experts said the FDA knew

5 about this risk. Wyeth knew about this risk for

6 decades.

7 That is what is so wrong. That is why he

8 stood up and said the FDA doesn't decide this question.

9 You decide this question. And there was never, ever a

10 suggestion in the record in this case, nor could there

11 have been, that Wyeth ever failed to bring every single

12 adverse-event report to the FDA's attention, every

13 analysis that it did to the FDA's attention.

14 And what the record does show is that after

15 -- between the time of the 1955 approval of the new-drug

16 application and the 1998 rejection of the SDNA, the

17 Supplemental New -- SNDA, the Supplemental New Drug

18 Application, that did have more extensive, stronger

19 warnings in this case, Wyeth filed five -- and these are

20 all in the joint appendix -- five supplemental, new-drug

21 applications, each one asking for more language, more

22 warnings, about direct IV injection. It's not called

23 "push." It's IV injection versus drip, which is a

24 gravity method.

And, in fact, Mr. Frederick

25 says: Well, you know, in this case there could have

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 been stronger warnings, and that -- and this case wasn't 2 really about -- the jury wasn't really asked to -- it 3 didn't really say that the label had to contra indicate 4 something that the FDA-labeling required. 5 That is exactly the opposite of what the 6 trial lawyer told the jury at opening and at closing. 7 What he said is this was unreasonably unsafe because it 8 didn't say: Do not use by intravenous administration. 9 With respect to whether or not the warning 10 -- the last SNDA which we submitted, which was in 1987 11 and is reprinted in the joint appendix -- not only is it 12 an original, but there is a typewritten version that 13 actually has the text in the type size that one can 14 actually read. At the summary-judgment stage that the 15 pre-emption issue was decided -- may I finish my answer? 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. 17 MR. WAXMAN: Summary judgment was decided at 18 the -- pre-emption was decided at summary judgment 19 before trial. So there was no evidence about what was 20 new or wasn't new. In Ms. Levine's motion for summary 21 judgment, she uses the word "new" information about 22 labeling change. And, with respect to the proposed 1987 23 language, the '88 change that we asked for, she said -24 and I'm reading from page 24 of her motion for summary 25 judgment -- "In 1988, Wyeth drafted changes to the

1 warning which advised that the use of a free-flowing IV 2 would ensure adequate dilution and reduce the risk of 3 arterial injectia. Although not strong enough, this 4 improved the labeling instruction; if followed, would 5 have prevented the inadvertent administration of 6 Phenergan into an artery for the reasons described." 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 8 The case is submitted. 9 (Whereupon, the case was submitted.) 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
