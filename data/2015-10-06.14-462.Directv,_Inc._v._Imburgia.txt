6             ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

7                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8             MR. LANDAU:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9 and may it please the Court:

10             The court below violated the Federal

11 Arbitration Act by refusing to enforce the parties'

12 arbitration agreement on grounds the Ninth Circuit

13 characterized as "nonsensical."

14             The agreement provides for individual

15 arbitration and expressly precludes class arbitration.

16 And just to underscore that point, it specifies that if

17 State law would force the parties into class

18 arbitration, then the entire arbitration agreement would

19 be unenforceable.

20             The court below interpreted the reference to

21 State law to mean inoperative State law preempted by the

22 FAA.  But neither respondents nor the court below

23 identified a single case in the history of California or

24 American law adopting that interpretation for any

25 contract.  And it would be

4 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  What about the problem that 2 this is California law and a California court said 3 that's what the contract means under California law?  In 4 other words, I can't find a case that we're supposed to 5 say  or we have the power to say that they're wrong, 6 even if they were to say the words "do not turn on the 7 light" mean turn on all the lights. 8             MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor. 9             JUSTICE BREYER:  So  so  and they may 10 have done that in this case. 11             MR. LANDAU:  Here  12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Nonetheless, what do we do 13 about it? 14             MR. LANDAU:  What you do about it is look to 15 the Federal Arbitration Act.  There is not a general 16 Federal contracts act, but there is a Federal 17 Arbitration Act that Congress passed specifically 18 because a particular kind of contract was not getting 19 enforced by the courts, and Congress was concerned about 20 that.  So what Congress  21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The principle of 22 contract interpretation  I  I beg to differ with 23 Justice Scalia, the  I thought that what the court 24 asked itself is what did the parties intend when they 25 used the words "State law"?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

5

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that correct?

3             MR. LANDAU:  That's what the court purported

4 to answer.

5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the interesting

6 part.  You used the word "purported."  What California

7 law did it apply 

8             MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   that disfavors

10 arbitration?  What contract principle did they use?

11             MR. LANDAU:  Well, again, a lot of cases,

12 you have courts that are  are bringing in some

13 principle external to the contract, and those are kind

14 of easy cases.  This Court has now made clear that

15 courts can't rely on principles external to the contract

16 that are hostile to arbitration.

17             But courts also, under the Federal

18 Arbitration Act, have a responsibility to enforce the

19 contract according to its terms with a reference to the

20 Federal substantive law  for more than 50 years, the

21 court has made clear that the Federal Arbitration Act

22 creates Federal substantive law.  What is the content of

23 that Federal substantive law?

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the point of

25 putting State law in at all?  If Federal law applies,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 then it makes no sense to have any reference to State

6

2 law.  If State law means State plus Federal law and

3 Federal law trumps State law, the reference to State law

4 is just inexplicable.

5             MR. LANDAU:  No, Your Honor.  It's to the

6 contrary, Your Honor, with respect.  The reference to

7 State law was a recognition of the concern  the

8 problem that the parties were confronting, which is

9 State laws were being enacted, as in California in their

10 Discover Bank rule, that would force the parties into

11 class arbitration against their will.

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And we had not yet held at

13 the time this contract was made that those laws are

14 invalid.

15             MR. LANDAU:  Precisely, Your Honor.  And so

16 at that point, the problem they were focusing on was

17 State law.  They could have also said, you know, if this

18 is unenforceable or used the passive voice.  But here,

19 they chose to take the bull by the horns and be honest

20 about what was actually the problem, and they said State

21 law.

22             But the use of the term "State law" does not

23 indicate a recognition or a desire to  to have

24 inoperative State law that's been preempted by the

25 Federal Arbitration Act.  As the Ninth Circuit said,

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm still not sure that I

3 understood your answer to Justice Breyer's question.

4 His question was, this Court purported, and did, give an

5 interpretation of the intent the two parties had when

6 they entered into a contract.  And that is a matter of

7 State law.

8             MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I understand the

10 problem of preemption.  I understand the problem that

11 preemption is  that a judicial decision is

12 retroactive.  This was not the State law.  But the 

13 let's assume that the trial court in the California 

14 pardon me  that the California appellate court said

15 the intent of the parties was to interpret the law to

16 mean A.  And  and "A" meant this superseded or

17 preempted State law.  How can we reverse that

18 determination if it's a matter of State laws

19 interpreting a contract made by two people?  I  I 

20 that was the question and I'm  I'm not quite sure what

21 your answer is.

22             MR. LANDAU:  I'm sorry.  I'll try to be as

23 clear as I can.

24             The answer is because  you wouldn't go any

25 further if you didn't have something called the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1 Arbitration Act.  And the Federal Arbitration Act says 2 that this particular kind of contract, an arbitration 3 agreement, is not solely a question of State law.  There 4 is Federal substantive law created under the Act. 5             To be sure as this Court said in Volt  and 6 I'm quoting from Volt:  "The interpretation of private 7 contracts is ordinarily a question of State law which 8 this Court does not sit to review." 9             And we have no quarrel with that 10 proposition.  But the key word there is "ordinarily," 11 and this case shows that ordinarily does not mean 12 exclusively.  Because the Court in Volt went on to 13 say  and I think this is critical, and I think you 14 could quote this passage from Volt and be finished with 15 this case.  It says, "In applying general State 16 principles of contract interpretation to the 17 interpretation of an arbitration agreement within the 18 scope of the Act, due regard must be given to the 19 Federal policy favoring arbitration and ambiguities as 20 to the scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved 21 in favor of arbitration." 22             JUSTICE ALITO:  Does that mean that whenever 23 there is a dispute about the scope of an arbitration 24 clause and a State court says that it includes a certain 25 subject or doesn't  it doesn't include a certain
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 subject, that there is, then, the question of Federal

9

2 law because insufficient weight has been given to the

3 presumption of arbitrability?

4             MR. LANDAU:  Yes, Your Honor.  There is a

5 Federal question.  Again, ordinarily you start out with

6 the proposition that contracts are governed by State

7 law.  And we should be very  let me be very clear.  We

8 are not by any means saying that the Federal Arbitration

9 Act federalizes this entire area.  We are kind of saying

10 the opposite, that it generally is a matter of State

11 law, but there is a Federal toll.  So you always have a

12 Federal question to be a check on the State court's

13 application of law for cases like this when it is

14 perfectly clear what is going on.

15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this may be an extreme

16 case, but where  how do you define the borderline?

17             MR. LANDAU:  Again, Your Honor, I think in

18 the average case, the State court can interpret State

19 law as it sees fit, but then this Court's responsibility

20 in reviewing State law  this Court obviously can

21 decide what cases it wants to take to review State law

22 has  this Court's responsibility is to basically do

23 what Volt said it would do, which is did the State

24 court, in applying State law principles, give due regard

25 to the Federal policy favoring arbitration and construed

1 out in favor of arbitration?

10

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  And I found no case ever

3 that's done that.  And I have exactly the same problem

4 that Justice Alito has.

5             MR. LANDAU:  Well 

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, once we start with

7 this case, even if this is not too difficult under State

8 law, we've got every arbitration contract in the world

9 where one lawyer or another will suddenly be saying, oh,

10 the interpretation of the contract here by the State

11 court judge is not favorable enough to arbitration or

12 hostile to the act.  And suddenly we have Federalized,

13 if not every area, a huge area of State contract law.

14             MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor 

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, there's another way to

16 do it.  We could just ask the California Supreme Court.

17 Now, what about that?

18             MR. LANDAU:  Well 

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  Or  or come up with an

20 answer to what Justice Alito just asked.

21             MR. LANDAU:  No, your Honor.  Again, you

22 wouldn't ask the California Supreme Court because

23 ultimately this is a Federal law question.

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not ask.  No.

25 Ultimately, it's a State law question, what does the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 contract mean.  And the contract, on reading it, seems 2 to mean that it applies to laws that are laws, not laws 3 that have been held unconstitutional.  So what I've 4 looked at, I've looked at civil rights cases, for all 5 kinds of cases.  I can't find any. 6             MR. LANDAU:  Even if this case came from the 7 California Supreme Court, and the California Supreme 8 Court said we  again, it has never done that, and 9 that's one of the odd things about this case.  But even 10 if the California Supreme Court were to say, we as a 11 matter of California law say that this  you know, 12 State  a reference to State law means preempted or 13 repealed or otherwise inoperative State law  again, I 14 think that's hard to imagine, but let's say they said 15 that, you as the Supreme Court of the United States 16 would still have a responsibility to make sure that that 17 comports with the Federal policy of arbitration. 18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe that's so.  But if 19 the California Supreme Court had said this, I would 20 look  they would read the Contract as if it said, if 21 there is a law in the State of California, a State law, 22 or if there ever has been, whether that law is 23 constitutional or not constitutional, whether it 24 violates the Supremacy Clause or not, if they ever wrote 25 those words in the State legislature into a law, there

12 1 is no arbitration contract.  Okay?  I guess parties have 2 the right to do that.  And if the California court said 3 as a matter of California law they did it right here, I 4 don't know that we'd have a ground to stand on. 5             MR. LANDAU:  And that's, Your Honor, where, 6 respectfully, the Federal Arbitration Act, again  7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you  you need a test, 8 Mr. Landau.  You're  you're  I  I sympathize with 9 Justice Breyer's point.  You need some test. 10             MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor  11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where does it stop?  We're 12 going to reinterpret every State interpretation of  of 13 State law that  that ends up invalidating an 14 arbitration agreement?  Certainly not.  So what's the 15 test? 16             MR. LANDAU:  The test is  17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can't you say that at least 18 in this case where  where the State court's 19 interpretation flouts wellaccepted universal contract 20 law principles, the most important of which is you 21 interpret a contract in a manner that makes it valid 22 rather than invalid.  And they went out of their way to 23 interpret this in a manner that causes the whole 24 agreement to be thrown out. 25             MR. LANDAU:  Correct, Your Honor.  That is

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So give us a test.  Say

3 that, you know.

4             MR. LANDAU:  The test 

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't have to go any

6 further than that, where it  where it flouts standard

7 contract interpretation principles.

8             MR. LANDAU:  Well, certainly, Your Honor,

9 that is clearly one way to look at 

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you really think that

11 the parties here  this is something that I don't know

12 whether to quarrel with or not.

13             The California court said, we don't know

14 what the parties even thought about preemption.  And it

15 was three years into litigation that preemption was

16 settled by this Court.  Do you really think they would

17 have said that  one of the parties would have said,

18 your adversary, oh, yes, now I'll go into arbitration

19 after three years of litigation?

20             MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely, Your Honor, because

21 the only reason that they were not arbitrating from the

22 getgo was because 

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was because California

24 law said 

25             MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   you don't.

14

2             MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what they wanted.

4 If California law said no, they wouldn't.

5             MR. LANDAU:  Right.  Right.  And so once it

6 is clear that the thing that would have forced them into

7 class arbitration is gone, either because the California

8 Supreme Court repealed it or because this Court held it

9 to be preempted, then it  again, it's nonsensical to

10 say 

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But when they entered 

12 when they entered the agreement, both parties

13 contemplated that State law meant California law.

14 That's why you did not object to the lawsuit being

15 brought in court.  So if the parties' intent at the time

16 they entered the agreement and at the time the lawsuit

17 in court was started was clear, the parties intended

18 that the arbitration agreement would be out because the

19 no class action was unenforceable in California.  That's

20 what they intended at the time they made the contract;

21 isn't that so?

22             MR. LANDAU:  No, Your Honor.  What they

23 intended was that this would turn by reference to State

24 law.  At that time, State law was as Your Honor

25 describes.  You are absolutely correct.  But they didn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 say, if State law as it exists today requires

15

2 arbitration.  In other words, there's nothing in the

3 contract that freezes this in a particular point in

4 time.  It takes a snapshot 

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we're trying to find

6 out what the parties meant, why wouldn't we look to see

7 what they meant at the time the contract was formed?

8             MR. LANDAU:  Well, because, again, it's 

9 what the contract that they chose used an important

10 verb.  We've been talking a lot about the noun in the

11 sentence, the clause "the law of the State."  But then

12 the verb says if the law of the State would find, not if

13 the law of your State today finds.

14             And imagine, Your Honor, if California had

15 repealed its CLRA, which has the antiwaiver provision

16 that they are relying on.  Well, I don't think anybody

17 would say, well, because the CLRA was in effect at the

18 time this thing was  was enacted, that if a CLRA is

19 later repealed, we still have disclaimed arbitration.

20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Mr. Landau, let's assume

21 you're right, that this is a really bad mistake when it

22 comes to arbitration.  So just to take you back to

23 Justice Alito's point and Justice Scalia's point, you

24 know, usually we don't fix bad mistakes 

25             MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE KAGAN:   when State courts

16

2 interpret State law.  I mean, there are a lot of

3 mistakes when it comes to interpretation of contracts,

4 including arbitration agreements.

5             So, again, what's the standard?  There's

6 nothing on the face of this opinion that indicates

7 hostility to arbitration.  To the extent that you can

8 find reasoning in this opinion, which you have to search

9 to find, but to the extent that you can find reasoning,

10 it's about interpreting form contracts, interpreting 

11 whenever you see an ambiguity in a form contract, you

12 interpret it against the drafter.  And that's a

13 principle of contract interpretation that, as far as I

14 can see, has been used hundreds of times in California.

15 It appears to be a very common principle of contract

16 interpretation in California whenever California courts

17 look at a contract of adhesion.

18             So why isn't that just what they did, and is

19 what they did?

20             MR. LANDAU:  Fair enough.  But even by its

21 terms, the predicate for that is some ambiguity.  You

22 can't just say, well, guess what, contract of adhesion,

23 immediately we go to construing against the drafter.

24 You have to have an ambiguity.  There's no antecedent

25 ambiguity.  And the court really didn't identify

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 anything other than to totally question begging

17

2 assertion that the general  specific governs the

3 general.

4             Again, Your Honor, I want to be very clear

5 here, our rule is very narrow.  And this Court does not

6 have to go any further than it went in Volt to say,

7 generally, contract interpretation, even if it's

8 erroneous, is a matter of State law.  But  and we're

9 not saying that every mistaken contract interpretation

10 gives rise to a Federal question.

11             What we are saying, though, is just that the

12 Federal court's role is to make sure  to look at what

13 the State court did and say, can we see that this court

14 gave effect to the healthy Federal policy regarding

15 arbitration and construed doubts in favor of

16 arbitration?  Here, you see the opposite.  And, you

17 know, with respect, Your Honor, you can't see on the

18 face of it that they say it's hostile, but how 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we draw the line

20 between 

21             MR. LANDAU:  Excuse me, Your Honor.

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we draw the line

23 between wrong and the standards you're arguing?

24             MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, again, I think  I

25 was quoting to you the language from Volt.  That has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 worked for the last 30 years that it's been on the

18

2 books.  I think  this case, again, is not a great case

3 for saying how wrong does wrong have to be.  I mean,

4 clearly, here, it's nonsensical.  Again, I think there

5 may be cases that will have  and I think you have a

6 standard.  If I were to come  I could use other words

7 like unreasonable or manifestly wrong.

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm back to my point.  I

9 looked in civil rights cases.

10             MR. LANDAU:  Right.

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  The south passed statute

12 after statute like the sitin statutes and so forth to

13 try to prevent the Equal Protection Clause from being

14 implemented.  So I looked at a few of those that my law

15 clerk got.  In none could I find the court saying this

16 matter of State law where it isn't itself

17 unconstitutional, you know, what  what is a trespass

18 and so forth.  There  it violates the Federal law,

19 what they'd say is we interpret the State law.

20             MR. LANDAU:  Well 

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  They've gone that far,

22 because we think the State would interpret the State law

23 this way.  But I can't find an analogy to what you're

24 saying.

25             MR. LANDAU:  Well, again, Your Honor 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE BREYER:  We'd have to say an

2 interpretation of a contract where that interpretation

3 is  is what?

4             MR. LANDAU:  Please go back to Volt.

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  What  I'm looking for the

6 standard.

7             MR. LANDAU:  Is not 

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  You read me the words.  It

9 didn't say what to do.

10             MR. LANDAU:  Okay.

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  It said they have to

12 conform with Federal 

13             MR. LANDAU:  Well, no.  It said  it said

14 they must read it with a  with the 

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  That looks like we're the

16 supervisor of all State contract interpretation judges.

17             MR. LANDAU:  No, Your Honor.  Again, what 

18 again, what Volt says, it's  ordinarily, it's a

19 question of State law.  Your  your role as under the

20 Federal  there is substantive Federal law under the

21 Federal Arbitration Act.  That has been clear and

22 established for more than 50 years.  The State  the

23 Federal Arbitration Act applies in State Court.  That

24 has been clear for more than 30 years.  If you say 

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  My other suggestion 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
20 1 we're not going to make too much progress on finding the 2 standard, but California does accept requests from us, 3 or other Federal courts, to explain what California law 4 is.  I've looked at that statute.  And if this is so 5 outrageous as a matter of contract interpretation of 6 State law, why don't we just ask them? 7             MR. LANDAU:  Because, again, Your Honor  8             JUSTICE BREYER:  They have not considered 9 this case. 10             MR. LANDAU:  They  they denied certiorari 11 over the  one of the justices.  And  but, again, 12 what Your Honor's role is is to interpret this as a 13 matter of Federal law.  So the  again, it would go 14 away if  if they were to change the rule as a matter 15 of State law.  But ultimately, the Federal issue is 16 always present here.  The  again, there's always a 17 Federal issue just to make sure that the State court 18 hasn't gone too far. 19             Again, I understand exactly what the Court 20 is grappling with.  Where do you draw the line on where 21 it goes too far.  Again, our point is this case is so 22 far on one side of the line.  And  for instance  23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why  give us all the 24 reasons why this case is on the wrong side of the line. 25             Justice Breyer has  has mentioned the 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1 the rule of contra proferentem, that you interpret a  2 a contract against  against the person who drafted it. 3             Now, that's on the other side.  What are  4 what are the rules of contract law that  that so 5 clearly outweigh that? 6             MR. LANDAU:  I think, Your Honor, you 7 started out by, one, that you want a contract to be 8 valid.  They went out of their way to look to a way to 9 make this unenforceable.  And if you just take a step 10 back and look.  It is  11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Make what unenforceable? 12             MR. LANDAU:  The arbitration agreement. 13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, the arbitration 14 agreement was enforceable in lots of situations. 15             MR. LANDAU:  No, Your Honor  16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There was no agreement 17 to arbitrate class actions. 18             MR. LANDAU:  Right.  But their  19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there was an 20 agreement to arbitrate other disputes. 21             MR. LANDAU:  That's not their  22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And single disputes. 23             MR. LANDAU:  Their position is that the 24 arbitration provision is entirely unenforceable in this 25 case.  This arbitration is entirely unenforceable with
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 respect to California.

22

2             Again, what is going on here?  It's clear

3 the parties say we want to arbitrate our disputes,

4 unless State law forces us into arbitration.  Once State

5 law can no longer force you into arbitration, they don't

6 have any plausible narrative for why the parties would

7 have agreed to blow up and jettison their arbitration

8 rights if nobody is actually forcing them into

9 arbitration.

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  Go back to Justice Scalia,

11 please.  What I understood this to be is one reason this

12 interpretation from your perspective is an unreasonable

13 really weird one is because the statute basically says

14 go to arbitration unless you are in a State where the

15 law would require class arbitration.  And if that's the

16 State you're in, dump the whole arbitration 

17             MR. LANDAU:  Right.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:   business.  Okay.

19             Now, one reason that's a bad interpretation

20 is that probably what they meant is valid State law.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course.

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  That's one.

23             MR. LANDAU:  Right.

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, is there any other?

25             MR. LANDAU:  There's another one, Your Honor

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that in Section 10 here, there's a choice of law

23

2 provision specifically addressing the arbitration

3 clause.  And the general choice of law provision is in

4 Section 9 of the agreement, but  excuse me, in Section

5 10  but it says, "notwithstanding the foregoing."  In

6 other words, the fact that State law and FCC or other

7 law applies.  With respect to the arbitration provision,

8 the FAA shall govern.

9             So our position is, it is nonsensical to say

10 that when the contract goes out of its way to say the

11 FAA shall govern the arbitration provision, that you

12 would take a reference to the law of your State in the

13 arbitration provision and say the law of your State

14 completely unaffected by the FAA.

15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Landau, I completely

16 take your point as to what the parties must have wanted,

17 and it does make this State court opinion unsatisfying,

18 would be a kind word for it, but  but, you know, in

19 fairness to the State court, part of the problem was the

20 way this contract was worded.  Everybody else finds ways

21 to word contract provisions like this so that there

22 isn't a problem.  If the contract had said, you know, if

23 class action waivers are invalid in your State, then

24 Section 9 is unenforceable, there would have not have

25 been this problem.  This is  it's a very unusual

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 contract provision.  Most companies use very clear ones. 2 This one did not. 3             And so the  the State court had to sort of 4 puzzle over what it meant and, as you say, probably got 5 the answer wrong.  Strike the "probably."  Got the 6 answer wrong.  But, you know, wrongness is just not what 7 we do here. 8             MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, but, again, 9 wrongness is not what you do here, but this is an 10 arbitration contract.  And, again, I think this is why 11 you have to  12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did you draft this 13 provision, Mr. Landau? 14             MR. LANDAU:  I did not, Your Honor. 15             (Laughter.) 16             MR. LANDAU:  But, again, I  I  I am not 17 defensive about the way this was drafted. 18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How  19             MR. LANDAU:  They said State  20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How was the provision 21 changed?  Now, this provision is no longer in DIRECTV 22 contracts; is that right? 23             MR. LANDAU:  That's correct, Your Honor. 24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what  what  it 25 was taken out and what was put in instead?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1             MR. LANDAU:  The new provision, Your Honor, 2 which I have here, it says  it just  it takes out 3 the word "State law" and just says "if this is 4 unenforceable." 5             And, again, the  but the reason it said 6 State law was not to suggest that inoperative State law 7 should do it.  It was recognizing the fact that the evil 8 against which it  the clause was being put in was 9 State laws that would force you into class arbitration 10 against your will. 11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we have  do we have 12 someplace that has the change that was made in the 13 language of the contract? 14             MR. LANDAU:  I do, Your Honor.  I have the 15 new  here it is, Your Honor.  The current version of 16 the DIRECTV contract says, "A court may sever any 17 provision of Section 9 that it finds to be unenforceable 18 except for the provision on class representative and 19 private attorney general arbitration."  That's in 20 Respondent's brief on Page 36. 21             Again, I'm not saying there aren't other 22 ways to write it, but the fact that there are other ways 23 to write it doesn't mean that it's ambiguous.  And 24 again, I'm sure this Court construes many statutes that 25 could have been written in other ways, but that doesn't
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 make them ambiguous.

26

2             Let me just please underscore one more

3 point.  If the contract  and the California Court of

4 Appeals said, if in Section 9 the law of your State is

5 governed by the FAA, if that had been in Section 9, then

6 they would have had no problem with this enforcing the

7 arbitration provision.  But it does say that.  It just

8 says that in Section 10.  Section 10, the choice of law

9 provision, specifically says that the FAA shall govern

10 Section 9, the arbitration provision.  The law of your

11 State language in Section 9 is governed by the FAA.  So,

12 in fact, it is right there on the contract.

13             And, again, at the end of the day, we know

14 that Congress had a  Congress was concerned because of

15 this kind of gimmick where courts were coming up with

16 strained interpretations to avoid enforcing arbitration

17 provisions.  This is FAA 101.  We are not asking this

18 Court to make any new law, but just to reinforce what

19 you said in Volt, which is ordinarily, it is a matter of

20 State law.

21             And, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, you said

22 that you couldn't find any case.  Well, Volt is a case

23 where the Court went on to examine.  The Court didn't

24 say we defer to California State law and it is,

25 therefore, unassailable to use the words that

Alderson Reporting Company

1 Respondents would.

Official

27

2             To the contrary, Volt said we are going to

3 consider the  the interpretation proffered by the

4 State court and decide whether we think it is consistent

5 with the Federal policy favoring arbitration in the FAA.

6 So there is a Federal component.  It isn't 

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the  Volt says the law

8 of the place interprets the law of the place exactly in

9 the way  or allows that interpretation exactly in the

10 way that this State court interpreted it.

11             The law of the place was just the law of the

12 State unmodified by any possibly preempting Federal law.

13             MR. LANDAU:  Right.  But in Volt, of

14 course  the issue in Volt was that the court there did

15 not refuse to enforce arbitration.  The Volt court said,

16 you know, we don't have a problem with this, because

17 this is all about the efficient process in terms of

18 arbitration.  And the Volt court went out of its way to

19 say we find that this favors the Federal policy

20 fostering arbitration.

21             And the court reiterated that specific

22 interpretation of Volt and insisted on it in

23 Mastrobuono, Casarotto and Preston.  In other words,

24 Volt took pains to say that the interpretation that we

25 upheld there was a pro arbitration provision that gave

Alderson Reporting Company

28

2             I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

4             Mr. Goldstein.

5           ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

6               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief

8 Justice, and may it please the Court:

9             This case is a reprise of Oxford Health.

10 The argument of the party that wanted arbitration in

11 Oxford Health, the arbitrator had just gotten it

12 terribly wrong under this Court's decision in

13 StoltNielsen.  And this Court may well have had

14 sympathy for that, but the Court realized that it was

15 going to actually have to write an opinion about the

16 case, an opinion that the lower courts were going to

17 have to apply in later cases.  And the difficulty is

18 that if you interject Federal law here, you are going to

19 have just a wealth of DIRECTV challenges, because in

20 every instance in which the State court announces here's

21 how we understand this language, which is State law

22 language in our contract, it will be open to the party

23 proposing arbitration to say no, actually, if there is

24 an ambiguity in the  in the law  excuse me  in the

25 contract, then you are obliged to apply a presumption in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 favor of arbitration, and this is always a Federal

29

2 question.

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but that's 

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  So if you said that 

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If  that may be a

6 problem with the FAA.  But the FAA was adopted because

7 State courts were hostile to arbitration and Congress

8 didn't like that.  Now, how were they hostile to

9 arbitration?  They were hostile to arbitration by

10 adopting special rules of contract interpretation that

11 disfavored arbitration.  And in those instances, what

12 the FAA says is that that's what they wanted to stop,

13 special rules of contract interpretation, ordinarily a

14 matter of State law, but not when it's hostile to the

15 FAA.

16             And what could be more hostile to the FAA

17 than to interpret a phrase that says nothing about the

18 FAA to dispense with our holdings about  as they came

19 about  our holdings about what the FAA has to say.

20 And to do that even though there's a provision in the

21 contract that says this is governed by the FAA.

22             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So, sir 

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, I

24 understand  I'm sympathetic to the notion that this is

25 a matter of State contract interpretation, but that is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1 precisely what the FAA was getting after, State judges 2 interpreting contracts under special rules hostile to 3 arbitration. 4             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So, Mr. Chief Justice, if I 5 could deal with your real concern about where this 6 statute comes from, the idea that this is kind of the 7 core discrimination against arbitration that the statute 8 is after kind of structurally and then what exactly 9 happened in this case. 10             The root of the FAA  and it's reflected in 11 the  in the statutory text in Section 2  is that 12 State courts were adopting doctrines that were hostile 13 to arbitration.  Discover Bank's one of them this Court 14 concluded.  What the FAA is not concerned with  and 15 Congress could well pass a law that would be  is the 16 threshold question of whether there's an arbitration 17 agreement in the first place; that is, we have been 18 unable to locate in this Court or any other court a time 19 when the courts overturned the determination under State 20 law whether the parties had agreed to arbitrate vel non. 21 That's an antecedent question. 22             It may well be that Congress could conclude 23 that there is a problem like that and adopt a statute 24 like it.  But to do that here is to really open up an 25 enormous can of worms.  What you have is the 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure that I

31

2 understand what you're arguing.

3             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're arguing that the 

5 the FAA does not cover State gimmicks that disfavor

6 arbitration so as long as what they say is there is no

7 arbitration agreement in the first place.

8             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, Justice Scalia, don't 

9 don't misunderstand me.  If the Court were to 

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what you said.

11             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize, then.

12             If the Court were to conclude that this is

13 just an effort to discriminate against arbitration, then

14 I think the Court has doctrines and the lower courts

15 have doctrines.  We are not saying that you have to turn

16 entirely a blind eye to the idea and let a State court

17 get away with anything.

18             My point is different.  And that is, that

19 this is not a doctrine that is intended to discriminate

20 against arbitration.  It is not an indicia of a

21 pattern 

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if we were to

23 look to determine whether it is 

24             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah.

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   surely, that's a

Alderson Reporting Company

1 Federal question.

Official

32

2             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  If you were to  we

3 agree that there is a backstop here, and it's an

4 important backstop.  And that is, if you conclude that a

5 court is just, you know, making it up and discriminating

6 against arbitration, we think that's an important role

7 for the court to play.  But the difference here is that

8 the argument is that the State court really got this

9 wrong and had an obligation to kind of presume that the

10 parties wanted to engage in arbitration.

11             That is a very, very, very different

12 proposition of law because it asks the Federal courts to

13 interject and the State courts to interject 

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's exactly what Volt

15 says, what Mr. Landau quoted, is "Due regard must be

16 given to the Federal"  in interpreting a contract.

17 We're talking about interpreting the intent of the

18 parties  "Due regard must be given to the Federal

19 policy favoring arbitration and ambiguities"   we

20 could ask whether or not this clause is  this statute

21 is ambiguous  "and so the scope of the arbitration

22 agreement must be resolved in favor of arbitration."

23             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  There are two points

24 about that.

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, if this was a State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 law contract looking at State law principles, but there 2 is a Federal rule that must be followed in  in making 3 that interpretation, and that is a matter for us to 4 review. 5             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  There are two things 6 about that.  The first is, Justice Kennedy, the language 7 that kind of trailed off in your sentence is that the 8 Court has been very clear that ambiguities in the scope 9 of an arbitration agreement have to be construed in 10 favor of arbitration, and here's the reason.  And that 11 is, if we know these parties have agreed to arbitrate  12 this is in the first options.  It's in lots of cases  13 if we know you and I have agreed to arbitrate so that 14 there's an arbitration agreement, we're going to assume 15 that all of the cases fall into the bucket of 16 arbitrability, and that's a fair commonsense 17 presumption. 18             But what the Court said in Justice Thomas's 19 opinion for the Court in Granite Rock is that the 20 question of whether there's an enforceable arbitration 21 agreement at all is not  is a State law question, not 22 a Federal law question, and here's the reason.  There 23 are two interpretive principles under the Federal 24 Arbitration Act.  Number one is, we want to only require 25 people to arbitrate when they have  we are convinced
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 under their State law contract they did intend to

34

2 arbitrate.  We can't presume that you and I intend to

3 arbitrate because that's the question we're asking.

4             And the most important thing for you to

5 understand about the nature of this Section 9 in the

6 contract is that it does determine whether there is

7 going to be any arbitration at all in California.  That

8 is to say, is there any agreement between DIRECTV and

9 its California consumers to arbitrate?

10             And I can point to  it's very important

11 that you understand that.

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I just don't

13 understand, then, Mr. Goldstein  and maybe it's the

14 same question that Justice Scalia asked  I don't see

15 why it's better somehow to discriminate against

16 arbitration by declaring arbitration agreements

17 unenforceable writ large than it is by narrowing the

18 scope of arbitration agreements unfairly.

19             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  There are two just 

20 there are two rules at stake.  When it comes to the

21 question of whether you and I have an arbitration

22 agreement at all, what the court has said is two things.

23 One is, this is going to be a matter of State law.  But,

24 of course, if all you're doing is  this is a game.

25 You're just trying to evade enforcing the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
35 1 Arbitration Act.  That's a  you know, that's a role 2 for the Federal courts. 3             What Mr. Landau is relying on and what the 4 language that's quoted from Volt that comes from Moses 5 H. Cone is talking about is something quite different. 6 And that is, construe every ambiguity in favor of 7 arbitration.  That's what I'm resisting, not  8             JUSTICE BREYER:  What he'll say, I think, is 9  we certainly pressed him on it enough  is that 10 the  read the sentence, the relevant sentence.  "If 11 the law of your State would find the agreement to 12 dispense with class action procedure unenforceable, then 13 the entire Section 9 is unenforceable."  All right. 14 That's what it says. 15             Now, would the law of California find the 16 agreement "dispense with class action" procedure 17 unenforceable?  The answer to that question is clearly 18 no.  Because they did have a law like that, but it was 19 invalid.  So in order to read this in your favor, you'd 20 have to say these words:  If, however, the law of your 21 State would find this agreement, you have to read it as 22 saying, if, however the invalid law of your State would 23 find this agreement to dispense with class action 24 unenforceable, then. 25             Now, nobody  it's very hard to say that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 the parties meant if the invalid law of your State would 2 find it and, therefore, contract interpretation is a 3 question of law, this question of law was decided by 4 California to read the word "law" as "invalid law," 5 there is no case in California or anywhere else, to our 6 knowledge, that has interpreted contracts in such way 7 out of the arbitration context, and therefore, this rule 8 of law interpreting this word this way is discriminating 9 against arbitration.  That's something like what the 10 argument he's making.  Your answer to that is? 11             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  First, is that there is no 12 administrable line that he can identify between 13 something that's wrong and really, really wrong.  But in 14 any event, it's not  it's not correct that the 15 contract is improperly interpreted. 16             Here are the reasons:  The first is that, 17 Justice Breyer, if you and I have a contract that says 18 if California law would prevent us from having a class 19 action waiver, we will not arbitrate at all.  That is 20 not preempted.  That's the second holding of Volt. 21 Remember, all AT&T versus Concepcion is, is a rule that 22 says, if California forces us to engage in class action 23 arbitration.  But you and I can agree to anything at 24 all. 25             This contract, when it says, "If the law of

37 1 your State would find the class action waiver invalid" 2 is a perfectly fine thing for us to agree to.  That's 3 State law and even accounts for preemption because the 4 FAA does not preempt California law in that 5 circumstance. 6             JUSTICE BREYER:  But does California have a 7 law, a valid law that would find the agreement to 8 dispense with class action unenforceable?  Does it or 9 doesn't it? 10             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It does.  It does. 11             JUSTICE BREYER:  It does.  In other words, 12 California now has a law that makes it okay to dispense 13 with class action procedures. 14             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  In several respects.  The 15 first is there are several cases  there are an array 16 of cases that aren't subject to the Federal Arbitration 17 Act.  And the second is if you and I agree to follow 18 that law, it is not preempted. 19             Let me also point to some other indicia 20 that's going to make it very hard for  21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you have to agree with 22 Justice Breyer  or do you not  that California 23 interpreted this contract as saying if there is an 24 invalid State law that prohibits arbitration, then 25 that's binding on us.

1             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's what you're saying.

3             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We don't, Your Honor.

4             So remember, my point is this:  If you and I

5 have a contract to follow that State law, which is this

6 is a contract, then it's not invalid because Concepcion

7 and preemption only apply when the State forces you to

8 do something.  But in all events 

9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, sure.  The parties can

10 do anything they want.  But the question is, did the

11 parties do what they want  did the parties do that

12 here?

13             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.  And, Your Honor, my

14 problem is that that's going to be the question in every

15 case.  And if we say we're going to reverse this

16 decision, then every time there's going to be a Federal

17 question about whether this is really what the parties

18 intended, that every time that the contract is  is

19 ambiguous under State law.

20             But I did have a couple of other things 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's one horrible, and

22 the horrible on the other side is if we  if we agree

23 with you, the States can do whatever they want to  to

24 invalidate arbitration agreements so long as they're

25 doing it under the guise of contract interpretation.  Is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that not also a horrible?

39

2             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is  is a possible

3 horrible, Justice Scalia.  So let me just give you the

4 choice between the two of them.  There is no evidence

5 that the latter is actually happening, and you do have

6 the backstop.  And that is, we fully agree that if you

7 conclude that a State court is just making it up and

8 discriminating against arbitration, the FAA has a role

9 to play.

10             What I'm saying to you is that they do, in

11 truth, want a different legal rule, and that is, you've

12 got to construe these in favor of arbitration.  That's

13 the principle that he's trying to derive from Volt, Your

14 Honor.  That's a whole other kettle of fish than the

15 backstop that you and I are talking about.

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if we could see a

17 State court opinion that doesn't say anything that is

18 explicitly against arbitration, but it interprets a

19 contract in such a strange way that the only possible

20 explanation for the interpretation is hostility to

21 arbitration, can that be invalidated?

22             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I think so, Your Honor.

23 And 

24             JUSTICE ALITO:  So that's the question.

25 Does this case fall to that category?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  All right.  If that's what 2 the question is, because that is not the Volt principle. 3 That is the idea that this is just wildly out of bounds. 4 It's the incredibly factbound question about whether 5 this one decision is wildly out of bounds.  So let me 6 talk about the other reasons it's not remotely wildly 7 out of bounds.  Because if you write an opinion about 8 anything other than legal rule you just articulated, 9 Justice Alito, we are going to be in an incredible way. 10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you say that's not 11 the Volt principle.  Why isn't it the Volt principle? 12 Ambiguities.  I mean, this is even more than an 13 ambiguity.  Even ambiguities have to be interpreted  14 resolved in favor of arbitration.  And this is more than 15 an ambiguity. 16             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay, Justice Kennedy. 17 Because in my  I may be mistaken, but I think that you 18 and Justice Alito are describing two different legal 19 rules.  Justice Alito is saying, as I understand it  20 and I don't purport to speak for the Justice, 21 obviously  is that if this is a crazy decision, it's 22 invalid under the FAA.  The ambiguities construed in 23 favor of arbitration principle is an ordinary 24 interpretive principle.  And the reason, Justice 25 Kennedy, just to bracket this, why the Volt principle,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 the Moses H. Cone principle doesn't apply here, and that 2 is that it's ambiguities in the scope of an arbitration 3 agreement.  Here the question is whether the parties had 4 an arbitration agreement whatsoever. 5             So we  I think we've now agreed on the 6 legal rule perhaps.  And so let me tell you, if I could, 7 why I don't think you can write an opinion that says 8 this is nuts. 9             JUSTICE ALITO:  And add to that, what did 10 the Ninth Circuit say about this?  The Ninth Circuit 11 said it was absurd.  Was that the word? 12             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah, it was  13             JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. 14             MR. GOLDSTEIN:   nonsensical. 15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Nonsensical. 16             If we agreed with the Ninth Circuit that it 17 was nonsensical, we  18             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I mean, I just don't want to 19  I don't want to play around with words, Your Honor, 20 about nonsensical or not.  I think you and I are 21 basically on the same page about the FAA principle. 22             Here's what I have in terms of why this is 23 not remotely outside the bounds, why, if you write an 24 opinion reversing here, you are going to invite an 25 enormous amount of secondguessing of State law contract
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 interpretation.  The first is that Section 10 of the

42

2 contract expressly contrasts State and Federal law; that

3 is, it says the law of your State, and then

4 distinguishes Federal law from that.

5             The second is, as Justice Ginsburg says, why

6 is it the parties even referred to State law at all if

7 what they are talking about is just "it would be

8 invalid."

9             The third is both before this contract and

10 after this contract, DIRECTV wrote this contract very

11 differently in the way that it now says this contract

12 means, and it says if it would be found invalid, and as

13 was mentioned in the first half hour, every other

14 Fortune 500 company wrote it that way as well.  So there

15 are a whole series of very good contrasts for us.

16             I also have what I think is the pushback to

17 the intuition that DIRECTV really must have always

18 intended for the contract to pick up Federal preemption

19 law.  And here's the reason why that's not right:

20 DIRECTV claims and has applied the power to unilaterally

21 change this contract, and that is a huge deal in the 

22 in the context of a national form contract.

23             Here's what happened here:  DIRECTV put this

24 into the contract in 2006 before AT&T v. Concepcion was

25 a glimmer in anyone's eye at all.  And it referred to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 State law, and everybody agrees at that time that

43

2 California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act was going to

3 control and was going to prevent any arbitration in

4 California whatsoever.  DIRECTV filed an amicus brief in

5 Concepcion saying we will not arbitrate with anyone in

6 California before the court's decision in Concepcion.

7             And the way that DIRECTV intended to account

8 for changes in the law is that they would change the

9 contract unilaterally when the law changed, and I can

10 prove it.  In the wake of Concepcion, DIRECTV rewrote

11 the contract.  It did it before the California Court of

12 Appeals' decision in this case.

13             DIRECTV had another mechanism fully

14 available to it that would account for the idea that

15 now, under the Federal Arbitration Act, the State can't

16 forbid class action waivers.  It didn't need this

17 contract to do anything other than to pick up existing

18 California law.

19             And I will add a couple of other points just

20 about whether, as a matter of Federal law, you would

21 want to say that right now we have to go to arbitration.

22 Remember, DIRECTV's position is in the teeth of the

23 efficiency of the Federal Arbitration Act.  Its view is

24 that the parties intended that three years into the

25 litigation, what they would want is to blow up the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 litigation and send everybody to thousands of individual 2 arbitrations.  That is an extremely implausible 3 interpretation of what the parties would want if their 4 goal was to have an efficient dispute resolution 5 mechanism. 6             And so what I'm  the point that I'm trying 7 to make, Your Honors, is while I am sympathetic to the 8 concern, and it may be a concern directed at California 9 in particular, that we need to be attentive to whether 10 or not those courts are discriminating against 11 arbitration.  My point to you is that you may believe 12 this is wrong, like you were concerned in Oxford Health 13 that the arbitrator had got it wrong, but you have to 14 adopt a legal rule here.  And there are too many points 15 in favor of the California Court of Appeals' decision to 16 say that this is wildly out of bounds and have an 17 administrable legal rule that the lower courts can 18 actually apply.  You can say it's way out of bounds; you 19 could say it's nonsensical.  But then the lower courts 20 are going to look at what happened here, and they are 21 not going to view it as something that is just wildly 22 impossible. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess I don't 24 understand why it's a question of way out of bounds or 25 slightly out of bounds.  It's a question of whether it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 demonstrates hostility to arbitration.  And I think the 2 way you show that is you say, well, look, here they 3 found a number of provisions illegal, and they struck 4 the whole thing.  Here, every other case that's not 5 about arbitration, when they find a couple of provisions 6 illegal, they just sever those; they keep  you know, 7 try to keep in effect the rest of the agreement. 8             That's a different rule for arbitration 9 contracts than other contracts.  It's not a question of 10 way out of bounds or way in bounds.  It may be a hard 11 question in some cases; it may be easy in others.  But 12 it's a very simple question of  of what the rule is. 13 The rule is does it demonstrate hostility to arbitration 14 contracts? 15             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Mr. Chief Justice, 16 let me just distinguish this case from the one that you 17 granted in the Long Conference, which is the factual 18 scenario that you just described.  In that context, what 19 you have is an arbitration agreement.  You know that the 20 parties have agreed to arbitrate and what you then do is 21 assume that they intend the arbitration to be effective. 22 This is importantly, doctrinally a very different case. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's  I 24 understand the point and  but, as I understand the 25 arbitration law, if you have an arbitration agreement,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 says you're going to arbitrate workplace disputes, but 2 not safety disputes  3             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   and if there's an 5 issue, is this a safety dispute or not, that's covered 6 by the arbitration agreement.  The arbitrator decides 7 that. 8             If you have a contract that says you agree 9 to arbitrate with all of our subsidiaries except the one 10 that does this, that's not for the arbitrator because 11 you have to decide if that other subsidiary has agreed 12 or not. 13             Now, this one talks about methods of 14 arbitration.  It doesn't seem to me to be covered by 15 either of those two paradigms. 16             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Excellent.  So you've just 17 described Prima Paint and the assignment between the 18 court and the arbitrator.  Here is why it is in the 19 paradigm of not favoring  not presuming arbitration, 20 and that is, the effect of this contract, Your Honor. 21 The effect of Section 9 is not to determine  this was 22 Justice Sotomayor's question about whether there'd be 23 some arbitration in California, but just not class 24 arbitration.  The effect of this provision is to mean 25 that there will be no arbitration between DIRECTV and
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
47 1 any of its customers in California at all.  There is no 2 agreement to arbitrate any dispute. 3             And let me just give you the proofs of that. 4 They filed an  5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but just clear 6 up, there is an agreement to arbitrate some disputes 7 between DIRECTV and its customers. 8             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Your Honor  9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's the arbitration 10 agreement. 11             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Your Honor, so  if I could 12 just distinguish.  There is an agreement on the subject 13 of arbitration, that is to say, Section 9 is in the 14 contract.  What Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act 15 asks is, is there an agreement with  to resolve any 16 disputes by arbitration?  And what Section 9 tells you 17 in the States where it is effective, where the  what 18 we call the blowup clause takes effect, is that in all 19 of those States, DIRECTV will not arbitrate with 20 individuals, it will not arbitrate with respect to class 21 arbitration. 22             If I could just give you the reasons we know 23 that's true.  DIRECTV filed an amicus brief in 24 Concepcion saying we do not arbitrate with anybody in 25 California.  It then  and you can see this in the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Stevens declaration in opposition to the motion to

48

2 compel arbitration said we have gotten 215 small claims

3 requests related to these early termination fees, which

4 is  and in court, which is the subject matter of our

5 complaint.  And we have arbitrated with one party.

6             So what was going on  and so there  in

7 California, DIRECTV was arbitrating with no one

8 whatsoever because of this contractual provision.  And

9 that brings it not within the Volt principle, Your

10 Honor.  We interpret  when we have an arbitration

11 agreement, we're going to put things into the bucket,

12 your argument  your  your point, Your Honor, about

13 scope when it comes to safety disputes.  But rather,

14 within Granite Rock, which said quite expressly, what we

15 are  when we are talking about the antecedent

16 question, we're trying to figure out if you and I have

17 agreed to arbitrate any subjects whatsoever.  When we're

18 in that circumstance, we can't presume that we are

19 arbitrating, because the first principle of the Federal

20 Arbitration Act is to not force people to arbitrate when

21 they haven't intended, and to require people to

22 arbitrate when they have.

23             So, Justice Kennedy, the distinction I was

24 drawing with Justice Alito is if we had an arbitration

25 agreement and we were trying to figure out if, say,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 class cases were in and individual cases were out, it 2 would make a little bit more sense to say we're going to 3 presume and resolve ambiguities in favor of putting 4 class cases in. 5             But this is not that situation.  It is the 6 question whether we are going to arbitrate with anyone. 7 Now, that is not to say that Federal  8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It may be, but that's quite 9 different from the question of whether there was an 10 arbitration agreement.  Certainly, whether there was an 11 agreement in the first place is quite different from 12 what the meaning of the agreement is.  And the  the 13 courts decide the  the first thing, and it's  and 14 not the arbitrator.  But this is not a  there is no 15 doubt here that there was an agreement. 16             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I  17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is no doubt that 18 there was an agreement.  The only issue was a matter of 19 interpretation of that agreement, whether a provision of 20 the agreement blew it up. 21             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay. 22             Justice Scalia, what I am saying is you  23 I  you and I agree, but the consequence of the place 24 we disagree is important; that is, you and I agree that 25 this is in the contract.  We have a contract on the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1 subject of arbitration.  When this Court has said that 2 we will construe arbitration agreements and their scope 3 to include all the subject matter, that is, we will 4 construe them in favor of arbitration, it has been doing 5 so when we not only have an agreement on the subject of 6 arbitration, but we have an agreement to arbitrate some 7 disputes. 8             JUSTICE BREYER:  It may have.  They may 9 have.  And I just don't want  I want to give you one 10 other issue. 11             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah. 12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because it's in my mind, 13 and I'd like you to respond to it, if you wish.  Because 14 I think there's some pretty good arguments that this 15 particular interpretation, consciously or unconsciously, 16 is flying in the face of an opinion of this Court, which 17 I disagreed with.  That was an opinion that  that said 18 that this particular provision of California law is 19 invalid.  I dissented. 20             All right.  So we have, on the one hand, the 21 risks that we'll get into, too many State law cases, if 22 we take their side.  On the other hand, there is the 23 risk that they'll run around our decisions.  Now, when 24 you get to that second thing, even though I dissented, I 25 think it's an extremely important thing in a country
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1 which has only nine judges here and thousands of judges 2 in other places who must follow our decisions  and 3 think of the desegregation matters, et cetera  that we 4 be pretty firm on saying you can't run around our 5 decisions, even if they're decisions that I disagree 6 with, okay? 7             Now, I raise that because I think it is a 8 factor, and so I would like you to  to say whatever 9 you want. 10             (Laughter.) 11             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Breyer, there's one 12 threshold point that needs to be made, and that is five 13 members of the Court in Concepcion, as I understand 14 their opinions, would not have applied Concepcion in 15 this circumstance.  They would not extend it here 16 whatsoever, because the four members of the Court who  17 you and the other members of the Court who agreed with 18 it would not extend it to the circumstance in which the 19 parties have agreed by contract. 20             And Justice Thomas explained in his opinion 21 in that case that the opinion there  that the  the 22 principle opinion depended on obstacle preemption, and 23 there is no argument here that this case implicates 24 obstacle preemption because it's a question of contract 25 law.  So at the threshold, I don't think Concepcion
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 would apply here at all.

52

2             But your question is bigger.  And that is,

3 look, I'm concerned that if we, as the Supreme Court 

4 U.S. Supreme Court articulate a question of Federal law,

5 particularly on a statute that's as important as the

6 Federal Arbitration Act, particularly on a statute that

7 is  is rooted in a concern about hostility of the

8 State courts, we have to show people that we're serious.

9 A couple of things about that.

10             First is, we know the California courts are

11 serious in the wake of  excuse me.  We have filed a

12 supplemental brief.  The California Supreme Court has

13 decided a case called Sanchez.  And Sanchez dealt with

14 the contract that is written like every other Fortune

15 500 contract is.  And it talks about if the  the

16 provision barring class action waivers would be deemed

17 invalid.  And the California Supreme Court said that's

18 controlled by Concepcion.  That is an enforceable

19 arbitration agreement right there.  And so now we are

20 dancing on the head of the pin about one contract that's

21 entirely defunct, and the question of whether the

22 reference to State law, when contrasted in another

23 provision of the contract with Federal law, is so far

24 out of bounds.

25             I think that what you have to do is compare

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
53 1 two prospects, Justice Breyer.  One is the concern.  And 2 we recognize the concern that if you write in an opinion 3 that says, nah, we're not going to take too hard a look, 4 that the State courts will run wild.  All I can tell you 5 is that there really isn't evidence of that happening at 6 all.  And the Court has doctrines like discrimination 7 against arbitration that can handle it. 8             The second is a reality.  We know for a fact 9 that if you announce an opinion that says, this 10 interpretation of State law  because we know what the 11 California law is here.  The California Court of Appeals 12 has told us.  This interpretation of State law is just 13 too bad and invalidated my arbitration agreement, that's 14 now a question of Federal law, and we are going to 15 relitigate what State law means.  That is a boundless 16 rule that is going to be invoked in every single 17 arbitration case.  And so you just have to choose 18 between those two prospects. 19             One is you know what will happen.  You will 20 be going against the very first principle of Federal 21 arbitration law, which is that we look to State law in 22 determining whether an arbitration agreement is formed, 23 or you have the hypothetical prospect.  And what I can 24 say to Your Honor is we have a legislature that is there 25 in the event that the hypothetical prospect comes to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
54 1 pass.  We have doctrines to deal with this.  I am just 2 terribly worried about how it is that you write an 3 opinion that says this is not just wrong, it's really 4 really wrong, and explain why in the face of the other 5 things in this contract, the contrast with other 6 contracts that I have given you are out there.  You do 7 retain the possibility, of course, of not deciding the 8 case at all in the wake of Sanchez, why it is that we 9 need to have an opinion about this, given that this is a 10 contract that doesn't exist anymore, and the California 11 Court of Appeals has resolved it is a question that  12 that is, you know, very difficult to answer. 13             But if you are going to write an opinion in 14 the case, please do not do it in a way that just invites 15 litigation upon litigation upon litigation because you, 16 as in Oxford Health, are concerned that this Court got 17 it wrong, just like you were concerned that the 18 arbitrator got it wrong.  It is an unfortunate cost of 19 the Federal system that Congress decided this is the job 20 of the Federal courts.  Not everything is a Federal 21 case. 22             If there are no further questions. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 24             Mr. Landau, you have three minutes 25 remaining.

2               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3             MR. LANDAU:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I'd

4 like to make three very quick points.  First, the fact

5 that opposing counsel, my friend, started with Oxford

6 Health is very telling because Oxford Health was a very

7 different case about the scope of this Court's review of

8 an arbitrator's decision.  Everyone there agreed that

9 the parties had delegated the question of the

10 interpretation of the clause to the arbitrator.  And

11 that's a very different question.  We don't have that

12 here.  We are  in this case, this Court is reviewing

13 what a court did.  You're not reviewing it under the

14 arguable standard.  It's a very different standard.

15             Second, my friend said that, well, no

16 question that special rules for arbitration would be

17 preempted is discriminatory.  And again, those tend to

18 be easy cases.  You're not probably seeing as many of

19 those cases anymore.  But now this case in a sense shows

20 that there's a new frontier, when a court will just

21 basically reach the same goal by saying black means

22 white.  Guess what?  I haven't done any different rule.

23 I'm just applying State court principles of

24 interpretation.  But at some point, you can't just have

25 a rule

2 everybody is assuming that this is just a crazy

3 interpretation, but if you start with the proposition

4 that it's the intent of the parties, and everybody's

5 framing this as invalid State law, or valid State law,

6 but your own company decided before Concepcion that it

7 was okay, they would litigate everything, they would

8 take the words as they stood.

9             MR. LANDAU:  Because prior to Concepcion,

10 State law was valid.  The question is 

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, it wasn't.  If it

12 was preempted, it was preempted back then.

13             MR. LANDAU:  Well, Your Honor, but it's hard

14 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And  and it's

16 preempted forever.

17             MR. LANDAU:  And it would have been futile

18 to make that argument.  In fact, we would have been

19 subject to punitive damages.  I mean, we were just

20 taking it at its 

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Probably could have done

22 what happened here and bring it up to the Supreme Court.

23             MR. LANDAU:  Well, again, you know, hats off

24 to AT&T for doing that, but there are futility doctrines

25 that recognize that not everybody has to do that.

57 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And how far does this 2 go?  When do we make this judgment? 3             MR. LANDAU:  Again, Your Honor, you could 4 decide this case on the ground, as the Chamber of 5 Commerce urged in its amicus brief, that this is so far 6 beyond the pale as an interpretation, that it can only 7 be explained as discrimination.  Again, discrimination 8 is  you know, it is an existing category for knocking 9 these out.  It's not the exclusive category.  And I 10 think discrimination becomes a hard principle to apply 11 when you have individual contracts.  Somebody can always 12 say well, you know, my  you know, discrimination 13 anticipates you have two things that are similarly 14 situated.  So how can you say you're discriminating? 15 Again, I  16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why  why is it that 17 it's so farfetched  18             MR. LANDAU:  It's so farfetched  19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   to place the 20 legitimacy of this action at the time the complaint is 21 filed as opposed to three years later or the day before 22 a trial or the day after a trial before judgment is 23 entered? 24             MR. LANDAU:  Because the parties use  25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You could come in and

1 make a motion at any of those times.  Why does the

58

2 interpretation of the contract 

3             MR. LANDAU:  They use 

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   have to be at the

5 time that you make your 

6             MR. LANDAU:  Because they use the verb tense

7 "would find," Your Honor.  They didn't say State law

8 right now.  They didn't freeze it in place.  There's

9 nothing  and they have no way of saying when it would

10 be frozen in place.  Just a line  in a sense, this is

11 the ultimate gotcha kind of case.  And the question

12 before this Court is, is this Court going to basically

13 give a stamp of approval to a gotcha?

14             The last point I want to make is that the

15 other  my friend says that there's a question here

16 about whether there was an arbitration agreement in the

17 first place.  There is absolutely no question that

18 there's an arbitration agreement.  The California Court

19 of Appeal acknowledged that there was an arbitration

20 agreement and construed it to be selfdefeating,

21 construed there to be a blowup provision that destroyed

22 what the parties were trying to accomplish.

23             Thank you, Your Honors.

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
