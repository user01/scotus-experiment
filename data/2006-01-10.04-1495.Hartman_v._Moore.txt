1 PROCEEDINGS

2 (11:18 a.m.)

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument now in

4 04-1495, Hartman against Moore.

5 Mr. Kneedler, whenever you're ready, you may

6 proceed.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9 MR. KNEEDLER: Justice Stevens, and may it

10 please the Court:

11 Respondent alleges in this Bivens action that

12 petitioners, who were postal inspectors, caused him to

13 be prosecuted in retaliation for activity protected by

14 the First Amendment. In order to make out such a

15 claim, however, respondent must establish that there

16 was no probable cause for the prosecution. That is so

17 for three mutually reinforcing reasons.

18 First, that requirement accords with the

19 deference this Court has consistently held in Armstrong

20 and other cases must be given to the prosecutorial

21 function because that function is core to the executive

22 branch's operations and because prosecutorial decision-

23 making is ill-suited to judicial second guessing.

24 Second, that rule accords a -- an important

25 objective screen and check against claims of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 retaliatory prosecution in order to guard against the

2 chilling effect that would otherwise routinely arise

3 from inquiry into the subjective motivations of those

4 involved in the prosecutorial decisionmaking process.

5 And third, that rule is deeply rooted in

6 history. A claim of First Amendment retaliatory

7 prosecution is but one species of a claim of malicious

8 prosecution, and it has long been required that an

9 essential element of a claim of malicious prosecution

10 is that the plaintiff show an absence of probable cause

11 for the prosecution.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm not sure why --

13 why we should make the classification that you did,

14 that -- that retaliatory is simply a species of -- of

15 malicious. I mean, I -- I can see the similarities,

16 but we've also got an entirely separate First Amendment

17 value here which just is not part of the -- the

18 analytical mix when you're talking about malicious

19 prosecution. So I'm not sure why we should -- we -- we

20 should classify it as you argue.

21 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- for several

22 reasons. First of all, the -- the First Amendment --

23 the alleged First Amendment retaliation describes the

24 malice, a form of the malice that would arise in --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's -- it's a peculiar,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 if you will, a peculiar malice with its own set of

2 constitutional values, and I don't know of anything

3 comparable in -- in malicious prosecution generically.

4 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, to be sure, what renders

5 it malice or wrongful is the First Amendment, but --

6 but the derivation of -- of the reason for why it's

7 wrongful does not, I think, detract from the essential

8 relevance of the tort of malicious prosecution.

9 And if -- if I may add to that, the -- the

10 reason why the -- the tort of malicious prosecution is

11 highly relevant here is not simply because on the

12 malice side of it, but also because it has long been

13 recognized, beginning with Blackstone before the First

14 Amendment and the Constitution were even adopted, that

15 there are critical interests on the other side, not

16 simply the defendant's interest in avoiding badly

17 motivated prosecutions, but the important

18 countervailing public interest of ensuring that

19 wrongdoers are brought to justice and that those who

20 have information about it will come forward.

21 And -- and that was recognized by Blackstone

22 early on and has been recognized consistent --

23 consistently by this Court in -- in many, many

24 decisions, including recent cases of this Court

25 involving immunity issues, which is what we have here,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 specifically recognizing that the tort of malicious

2 prosecution is very instructive in deciding how rules

3 should be applied when a Bivens action or a 1983 action

4 is brought in the specific context of prosecution.

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, here --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there is probable

7 cause for a prosecution, but the prosecutors are

8 extremely busy and they -- they have to select their

9 cases and they select one in which they bring the

10 prosecution against the defendant on account of his

11 speech. Is that a violation of the prosecutorial duty?

12 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, in -- in terms -- in

13 terms of the responsibilities of the prosecutor, there

14 --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

16 MR. KNEEDLER: -- that -- that should not --

17 that should not be a -- a selection criterion in

18 itself, but it --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm asking is it a

20 violation of the prosecutor's professional obligations

21 and his professional duties?

22 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I would think

23 ordinarily yes, but with this caveat. Unlike race

24 which is never relevant to the prosecutorial decision-

25 making process, there can often be a prosecution -- and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 this case is one of them -- in which you might have

2 claims of public corruption. And -- and in fact, there

3 was a guilty plea here on the part of a member of the

4 Postal Service board of directors for receiving

5 payments to -- for his activity on behalf of

6 respondent's corporation and others. This -- this --

7 involving contracts for $250 million. This was a very,

8 very important procurement by the Post Office

9 Department and it is understandable that in connection

10 with that prosecution, the prosecutors and the Postal

11 Service investigators would look into issues of

12 respondent's, or people in his behalf, approaching the

13 Government.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just going back to the

15 hypothetical, if -- if you acknowledge -- and I think

16 you must -- that there's a violation of the

17 prosecutorial duty in -- in the instance I suppose,

18 then why shouldn't the law recognize it and -- and give

19 force to that sanction and give force to that rule?

20 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, there -- there are

21 certain restrictions -- certainly restrictions on what

22 the prosecutor may do, but several points about that.

23 First of all, this is not a Bivens action

24 against the prosecutor. The prosecutor is absolutely

25 immune from suit. The prosecutor's decision-making

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 process is -- is, in fact, as is the grand jury's, a --

2 a critical protection against malicious prosecution --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well, then

4 we'll just change the hypothetical to make it the

5 investigators. The investigators select their case

6 based on this speech that they consider unwelcome.

7 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the question is

8 whether in that circumstance the -- the Bivens

9 plaintiff, the criminal defendant, has a First

10 Amendment right to be excused from prosecution or,

11 after the prosecution is unsuccessful, to bring a civil

12 action, whether he has a right not to have been

13 prosecuted in those circumstances notwithstanding the

14 existence of probable cause and the independent

15 judgment by the prosecutor.

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, does he have a right

17 not to be singled out because of his speech?

18 MR. KNEEDLER: He does -- he does not have a

19 -- he does not have a First Amendment claim in those

20 circumstances where there is probable cause for the

21 violation. The --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I asked does he have a

23 right not to be singled out because of his speech.

24 MR. KNEEDLER: He does not have a First

25 Amendment right not to be singled out in those

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 circumstances.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, you -- you

3 would advise law enforcement officials that they can

4 single out persons for prosecution based on distasteful

5 speech.

6 MR. KNEEDLER: I would not. I -- I'm not --

7 I'm not endorsing the motivation. What I'm -- what I'm

8 saying is what is --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What I want you to do is to

10 agree. I -- I think you have to concede there is this

11 principle in the law, and I think your answer has to be

12 even though there's that principle, there's a lot of

13 problems with enforcing it because there are going to

14 be too many suits, it's hard to -- it's difficult for

15 the Government to defend, and -- and so forth and so

16 on.

17 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. I -- I'm not disputing

18 that it -- that -- that a -- a prosecution should not

19 be brought or should not be heard --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you're not disputing

21 either, as I understand it. As the case comes to us,

22 we assume the prosecution would not have been brought

23 but for the retaliatory motive.

24 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- it is -- we certainly

25 disagree with that with our proposition.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: But don't you assume that

2 for the purposes of your argument?

3 MR. KNEEDLER: For -- for purposes of our

4 probable -- probable cause claim, yes.

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's the only

6 argument.

7 MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that is true, but

8 that, of course, was also true at common law for -- for

9 malicious prosecution.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the -- one of the

11 differences -- am I not correct, that at common law the

12 prosecutor did not have absolute immunity?

13 MR. KNEEDLER: At common law -- at common

14 law, yes. As this Court has recognized in

15 reformulating the common law principles of -- of

16 immunity, the -- the public prosecutor now has absolute

17 immunity under -- under these --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Now does, but not at common

19 law.

20 MR. KNEEDLER: -- under these Court's --

21 under this Court's decisions.

22 But at common law, the prosecutor did have

23 the protection of malicious prosecution, and as

24 Justice Scalia observed in his concurring opinion in

25 the Kalina decision, the elements of the tort of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 prosecution essentially had a built-in qualified

2 immunity, and the probable cause requirement was

3 essentially that. It afforded protection for the

4 prosecutor. The -- the private citizen who -- who --

5 the complaining witness -- he could not be the subject

6 of a suit for damages if -- if the charges were

7 dismissed, not simply upon a showing -- it required

8 more than simply a showing of malice. It required a

9 showing of an absence of probable cause for reasons

10 that are essentially identical to the qualified

11 immunity and absolute immunity -- the -- the reasons

12 for qualified and absolute immunity.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they're not totally

15 identical because you didn't have the First Amendment

16 interest involved in those cases, whereas you do have a

17 First Amendment interest at stake here.

18 MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but on -- on the -- on

19 the governmental interest side of the balance, the

20 interests are exactly the same in both -- in both

21 circumstances. And that is not to chill -- not -- not

22 to create circumstances where people would hold back

23 from coming forward with information of violations of

24 the law because of fear that they would be sued and

25 retaliated against afterward. And that hasn't changed

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 now that we have public prosecutors. It's still

2 critical.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, may -- would

4 you clarify just one point about this probable cause?

5 There was a grand jury that indicted this man, and then

6 there was a trial judge who said, I'm throwing this out

7 at the close of the Government's case. There is not

8 enough evidence here to convict this man.

9 Are you saying that as long as the grand jury

10 indicts, there can be no Bivens claim because in order

11 to indict, the grand jury would have had to find

12 probable cause?

13 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, at -- at common law

14 on the tort of malicious prosecution, the indictment

15 created a presumption because an indictment does have

16 to depend upon probable cause, and under the -- under

17 this Court's decision in Gerstein v. Pugh and other

18 decisions, that can't be reexamined by the court in the

19 prosecution.

20 But at common law, the -- the indictment

21 created a presumption that was subject to rebuttal by

22 the -- by the civil plaintiff. There was some

23 disagreement about what would be necessary, whether you

24 would have to show fraud on the grand jury or whether

25 you could just retry --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, tell me about now,

2 not at the common law.

3 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We do not -- we do not

4 think that the existence of the grand -- it has not

5 been our position that the existence of the indictment

6 is dispositive and cannot be challenged, but we do

7 think it --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the grand jury did

9 find probable cause. So what would the plaintiff have

10 to show to overcome -- to -- to negate that finding of

11 probable cause?

12 MR. KNEEDLER: We -- we think in a -- in a --

13 it would have to show by at least a preponderance of

14 the evidence, maybe a clear showing, that there was not

15 probable cause. And I think that also ties in to the

16 -- to the standard for qualified immunity, which is

17 could a reasonable person in those circumstances have

18 believed that there was probable cause. I think, if

19 the grand jury returns an indictment, that that should

20 be pretty persuasive evidence but not compelling

21 evidence -- I mean, not dispositive evidence that there

22 was probable cause.

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The case that comes

24 closest, as far as I can see, is probably United States

25 v. Armstrong, and in that case, this Court said in the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 ordinary case, so long as the prosecutor has probable

2 cause to believe the offense was committed, the

3 decision to prosecute or go before a grand jury rests

4 entirely in his discretion. But, of course, the

5 discretion is subject to constitutional constraints,

6 the equal protection component of the Due Process

7 Clause. The decision whether to prosecute may not be

8 based on an unjustifiable standard such as race,

9 religion, or other arbitrary classification. And the

10 standard the Court articulated there was the defendant

11 must present clear evidence --

12 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, clear evidence, and the

13 Court stressed that it was a --

14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- to the contrary. Now,

15 that's different from your proposition of probable

16 cause.

17 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think several

18 things may explain that.

19 In Armstrong, that was a claim of selective

20 prosecution that was brought --

21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Based on race.

22 MR. KNEEDLER: Based on race. That was one

23 of the distinctions I was going to point to. And

24 secondly --

25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So why should that be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 different than the First Amendment violation?

2 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, as -- as this Court's

3 decision in -- in Johnson, for example, shows, there --

4 distinctions based on race are subject to strict

5 scrutiny no matter what the context, in that case even

6 in the prison context, whereas First Amendment claims

7 often take account of the context in which they are

8 raised. For example, this Court in the American-Arab

9 Anti-Discrimination case held that there would -- could

10 be no claim at all of selective prosecution in the

11 immigration context because of the important

12 countervailing interest in enforcing the law.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're willing to

14 acknowledge -- and -- and the Government concedes that

15 you can have a different standard when the -- the basis

16 for the selective prosecution happens to violate the

17 Constitution from the standard you apply where the

18 basis for the selective prosecution doesn't violate the

19 Constitution, such as I'm prosecuting him because he

20 was mean to my brother-in-law. Okay?

21 MR. KNEEDLER: No.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to apply a

23 different standard there than you would apply where --

24 where the reason is some First Amendment reason?

25 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, no. The -- the other

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 distinction -- and -- and I'm not sure if this goes to

2 your point or not. The other distinction is that in

3 Armstrong the claim was made in the criminal

4 prosecution itself. Here, the claim is the civil

5 action after the criminal prosecution is over with, and

6 it's in that -- in that context especially that the

7 analogy to malicious prosecution is very strong and why

8 the element of -- that the person has to -- that the --

9 there has to have been a favorable termination for the

10 -- for the plaintiff and there has to be a probable cause.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that doesn't --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But would you answer my

13 question?

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

15 MR. KNEEDLER: I'm -- I'm not sure that I --

16 maybe -- I guess I --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's going be a different

18 criterion -- you -- you say it's going to be different

19 for the First Amendment and the -- and -- and the Equal

20 Protection Clause, at least where race is involved.

21 What if there's no constitutional violation at all, but

22 I just selectively prosecute him just because I don't

23 like this guy or because he was mean to a relative of

24 mine?

25 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't -- I don't --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there going to be a

2 different standard --

3 MR. KNEEDLER: No. There -- there wouldn't

4 be any -- any constitutional claim and any -- any

5 common law --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, and would you apply

7 a different standard because there isn't a

8 constitutional claim?

9 MR. KNEEDLER: No. There wouldn't be any

10 claim at all. I mean, there wouldn't be any basis for

11 a claim.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- a malicious prosecution

13 claim. You'd have a malicious prosecution claim.

14 MR. KNEEDLER: There -- there -- and in the

15 -- in the Federal sphere, if there was a malicious -- a

16 common law malicious prosecution claim, that would have

17 to be brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act against

18 the United States.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Kneedler, I

20 understand your argument to be they should be treated

21 just like a malicious prosecution claim, which is no

22 distinction between a constitutional basis and a common

23 -- and just that he hated his brother-in-law. I think

24 you're saying they're the same. That's what I

25 understand Justice Scalia to be asking you.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I'm asking.

2 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, yes. I -- I am -- I am

3 saying that --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which places no weight at

5 all on the fact the Constitution is involved.

6 MR. KNEEDLER: Oh -- oh, it does because the

7 -- because the -- the first -- the existence of the

8 First Amendment claim is what gives you the Bivens

9 cause of action in the first place. So otherwise,

10 there wouldn't be any Federal cause of action at all

11 without -- without the First Amendment claim.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's how you'd get at

13 least as much protection as if it was an ordinary

14 malicious prosecution claim, but you don't get any more

15 under your view.

16 MR. KNEEDLER: No, because -- and -- and

17 again, this -- this is -- this is because of the -- of

18 the background of the common law tort of malicious

19 prosecution, which strikes exactly the balance that I

20 -- that I'm talking about.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: But you really want three

22 things. You say we want the protection, number one, of

23 there -- if you're -- if there's probable cause, that's

24 the end of it. Number two, if you're trying to show

25 there wasn't probable cause, you have to bear clear and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 convincing evidence, and number three, we also have

2 qualified immunity. And I guess, number four, you have

3 to prove the whole thing by clear and convincing

4 evidence.

5 MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: It sounds a little bit like

7 the person who has the overcoat, turns up the heat, you

8 know, five or -- what about one?

9 MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: What about this one? And I

11 want to know -- you simply say you need clear and

12 convincing evidence that that was the motive and it

13 wouldn't have been brought otherwise. And the

14 existence of probable cause is a strong factor, maybe

15 even a presumption, that suggests to the contrary.

16 Now, have States and other places tried

17 things like that without the world collapsing?

18 MR. KNEEDLER: No. My understanding from --

19 from reading the treatises on -- on malicious

20 prosecution, for example, that there has been no

21 watering down of the probable cause requirement because

22 it is understood to be a critical check against --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: So as far as you know, every

24 State and every jurisdiction where -- and investigators

25 if they don't have absolutely immunity, whatever -- in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 all those jurisdictions, nobody has ever said that even

2 a constitutional violation, if there's probable cause,

3 that's the end of it.

4 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I'm -- I'm focusing on

5 the tort of malicious prosecution which is --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I'm not focusing.

7 MR. KNEEDLER: -- which --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: I want to know --

9 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- if --

11 MR. KNEEDLER: I'm not -- I'm not aware --

12 I'm not aware that any jurisdiction has done that.

13 But in response to your proposal, the -- the

14 -- what -- what's wrong with that is that it would

15 allow extensive inquiry, discovery, other inquiry into

16 the subjective motivations of persons involved in the

17 decision-making process with no mechanism analogous to

18 immunity or the -- or the probable cause criterion to

19 weed out --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: We have no experience. We

21 don't know. Okay. As your -- as far as you can tell.

22 The other question I have, which you might

23 want to be brief about, is in looking through this

24 record, as far as I could see from the briefs, they

25 went ahead and prosecuted this man with only two pieces

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of evidence. The first evidence was that he tore some

2 pages out of his notebook. But he introduced lots of

3 notebooks to show he always tore pages out when he gave

4 them to his secretary. And the second was that he told

5 some witnesses be very careful and answer the question.

6 Now, you know, he said a few other things, but they

7 all seemed like the kind of things that people would

8 always say to witnesses.

9 Now, if that's the only evidence, except for

10 the fact he owns the company, how is there probable

11 cause here?

12 MR. KNEEDLER: There -- there was much, much

13 more evidence.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I didn't see any in

15 the brief.

16 MR. KNEEDLER: There --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: I saw a lot about other

18 people in the brief, but not about him.

19 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, for one thing, it's

20 absolutely conceded that there was a conspiracy. Three

21 people pleaded guilty, including --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: There are all kinds of

23 things about other people.

24 MR. KNEEDLER: No, but -- but --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KNEEDLER: -- the -- it isn't all about

2 other people. The -- the -- that crime included -- and

3 it's accepted in this case that the Postal Service

4 board of -- board member accepted 30 percent of the

5 fees paid by respondent's company to the consulting

6 firm. Respondent's company. He was the chief

7 executive officer.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: I would like you to limit

9 yourself to what I didn't concede. I concede it's his

10 company. I concede that he tore some pages out of his

11 notebook, and I concede that he told -- which he did a

12 lot of times. And I concede that he told witnesses

13 answer the question, et cetera. Now, is there anything

14 else connecting him, not his company?

15 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. In -- in the summer of

16 1984, before there was even a consulting agreement,

17 there was a series of conversations between Voss, the

18 postal board -- board member, and respondent, including

19 one for which there are notes in which Voss said I am

20 working for you.

21 There -- there was an -- there is an

22 abundance of evidence involving Reedy who is -- no. I

23 -- I know, but just in -- just in terms of -- just in

24 terms of the sequence.

25 There is evidence that Voss and Moore were

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 good friends. Voss said that he had a close

2 relationship with respondent, and when the contract was

3 first being negotiated, Reedy acknowledged that Voss

4 and Moore were good friends. They had a close

5 relationship. They were not distant.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, I know you're

7 responding to Justice Breyer's question, but I think

8 for purposes of our decision, we're not supposed to

9 decide whether there was probable cause or not, but

10 we're to give you the opportunity to prove there was if

11 -- if you win on your --

12 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, although I -- I certainly

13 do not want to leave the misimpression that -- and

14 there is -- there is much more.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's a disputed

16 issue, and we don't have to decide the probable cause

17 issue. Is that not correct?

18 MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that -- you do not

19 have -- you do not have to decide it, but I would

20 certainly urge the Court not to proceed on the

21 assumption or make any comments that there is because

22 there were -- there were --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But because the other side

24 is arguing that even if there is probable cause, the

25 burden shifts when they prove the retaliatory motive,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and you have to prove that you would never -- you made

2 -- you would have brought the prosecution even if there

3 had been no retaliatory motive. That's what we're

4 arguing --

5 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, and that is their

6 position. And that position accords -- yes, that is

7 their position. And that accords no particular --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the question I would

9 ask is why should this be different from a wrongful

10 discharge case in which there's ample cause to

11 discharge and the issue boils down to whether or not he

12 would have been discharged anyway. Why isn't it the

13 same -- same situation?

14 MR. KNEEDLER: What is very different is that

15 this is the prosecutorial function. As this Court

16 recognized in Armstrong, that is a core executive

17 branch function and it is one that the courts are ill-

18 suited to second-guess because a whole variety of

19 determinations can enter into whether to prosecute

20 somebody, whether they -- whether the particular

21 conduct -- how culpable the person is, whether the

22 conduct fits into the overall prosecutorial priorities,

23 whether there will be cooperating witnesses, what --

24 what the office's resources are. There are a whole

25 bunch of -- of judgments that courts are ill-suited to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 second-guess, and it would be very chilling if the

2 prosecutor had to --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't -- wouldn't all

4 those considerations justify a rule that makes the

5 burden of proving the retaliatory motive very high,

6 say, maybe it has to be by clear and convincing

7 evidence or something like that? But once you have it

8 acknowledged -- I don't know if they're really

9 acknowledged here, but there's strong evidence of

10 retaliatory motive -- why shouldn't the burden shift

11 just on that, on the basis of that proof?

12 MR. KNEEDLER: Well -- oh, not -- we do not

13 think there is strong evidence of retaliatory motive.

14 And I -- I can -- can address that, but --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if you had a --

16 MR. KNEEDLER: -- but --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- if you had a heavy

18 burden of proof at that stage of the proceeding,

19 wouldn't that protect the interests that mainly concern

20 you?

21 MR. KNEEDLER: We -- we think the more direct

22 -- I don't think so for -- partly for the reason that I

23 -- that I gave to Justice Breyer is that -- that that

24 would not protect against discovery and -- and the sort

25 of chilling inquiry that this Court has recognized in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 its immunity cases, and especially in the prosecutorial

2 function where the prosecutor would be required to

3 disclose. Even though the prosecutor is absolutely

4 immune, the prosecutor's decision-making process and

5 his communication with law enforcement agents would --

6 would be exposed for judicial scrutiny, public scrutiny

7 in a way that could chill the prosecutorial function.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, the defendant

9 here is not the prosecutor. Right?

10 MR. KNEEDLER: Right.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just someone who provided

12 information to the prosecutor that -- that was

13 erroneous and allegedly maliciously motivated.

14 MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think erroneous. It

15 was allegedly maliciously motivated.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Allegedly maliciously

17 motivated, at least.

18 I don't understand how you would apply the

19 test, would -- you know, would you have prosecuted

20 anyway, when -- you know, but for the malicious motive,

21 when the person you're -- you're suing is not the

22 prosecutor. It wasn't up to this person whether there

23 would be a prosecution.

24 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that's a -- I think

25 that's a very important point, and before a -- a court

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 enters into that, in the end, unknowable question,

2 maybe a court can -- can, in the end, determine

3 probabilities, but before a court undertakes that,

4 which requires looking not simply at the motivation of

5 the -- of the law enforcement officers, but the

6 prosecutor and -- and who knows whether the grand jury

7 would have returned an indictment, and yet a court

8 certainly couldn't be expected to inquire into that.

9 Now, so we -- we think that that's another reason why

10 the probable cause requirement is a critical gateway

11 before a court is -- is going to enter into that

12 determination.

13 And all -- and it's important to remember

14 it's not just proving the question of causation, but

15 these are people who are several steps removed from the

16 -- from the prosecutorial decision. And the -- and the

17 personal liability would be visited on the law

18 enforcement agents who were doing their job and

19 cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office.

20 This case was -- this case got attention at

21 the highest levels of the U.S. Attorney's Office. The

22 U.S. Attorney personally met with the -- the respondent

23 -- lawyers for respondent.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, the D.C.

25 Circuit, looking at this case, looking at the record

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 closely, typed it one in which the evidence of

2 retaliation was strong and probable cause weak. This

3 is on 28a of the appendix to the petition for cert.

4 That was the appraisal of the D.C. Circuit panel. And

5 I think you've been arguing that that is not the case,

6 but at least for our purposes at this posture, don't we

7 -- shouldn't we accept that that is the picture here,

8 weak evidence of probable cause, strong indications of

9 retaliation?

10 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I don't -- I don't think

11 there's any reason to accept that because there's no

12 factual determinations to that effect.

13 There -- there are really just two snippets

14 of evidence that are primarily relied upon by the court

15 of appeals for the view that there was a retaliatory

16 motive here. And they were -- they were really

17 observations that the -- that the inspectors made to --

18 to show -- the first one was why the corporation should

19 be indicted, not just -- not just Moore, but why the

20 corporation should be indicted. And it was just an

21 observation that the corporation, through its agents,

22 was involved in a lot of activities and should be held

23 accountable. It was not -- it was not evidence of a --

24 of a retaliatory motive, and there were subpoenas for

25 -- for documents about political contributions. But

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 let's remember that this was a case involving bribery

2 of a public official, and it was -- it was

3 understandable that the AUSA and the -- and the

4 inspectors would -- would look to see whether there was

5 money directed elsewhere.

6 If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of

7 my time.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. McCartan.

9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK F. McCARTAN

10 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

11 MR. McCARTAN: Justice Stevens, if it please

12 the Court:

13 If I may, Your Honors, I would like to start

14 with the very pointed inquiry that Justice Kennedy made

15 at the opening of the argument here.

16 The petitioners here do not challenge,

17 because they cannot challenge, as was evident from the

18 concession made here this morning, that a criminal

19 prosecution cannot be based upon the exercise of a

20 constitutional right. What they want is an exception

21 to that rule, an exception that would mean, despite the

22 overwhelming evidence of retaliation of record in this

23 case, there would be no violation of the First

24 Amendment here and that would treat any prosecution

25 based solely upon race, religion, or protected speech

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the same as a tort for malicious prosecution. And to

2 accomplish this end, what they are trying to do is to

3 force probable cause as a standard into a framework

4 where it doesn't belong, where it won't work, and

5 which, if done here, is going to be contrary to several

6 existing decisions of this Court.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCartan, how does --

8 how does your standard work? The same question I asked

9 Mr. Kneedler. The -- the test you would propose is

10 whether but for the retaliatory motive, the prosecution

11 would have been brought anyway?

12 MR. McCARTAN: That would be the test, Your

13 Honor, for recovery when the matter goes to trial.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

15 MR. McCARTAN: The test that I would propose

16 is the very test that this Court set forth in Harlow

17 against Fitzgerald because we're here really on a very

18 limited issue of qualified immunity. We have to

19 determine whether the defense of qualified immunity is

20 available to the petitioners here. The standard, the

21 proper standard for making that determination was set

22 forth by this Court in Harlow and it's whether the

23 conduct alleged --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. McCartan, I don't

25 mean to interrupt you, but I thought the primary issue

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was not the qualified immunity issue, but whether we

2 have a cause of action in the first place.

3 MR. McCARTAN: Well, Your Honor, whether --

4 no, I think that the --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: And on that, they say you

6 don't have a cause of action unless you're able to

7 prove an absence of probable cause.

8 MR. McCARTAN: I think what they are saying

9 is the defense of qualified immunity should be

10 available if there should be probable cause for the

11 action that was taken here. I think the case before

12 the Court is on the very limited issue of whether the

13 defense of qualified immunity is available to the

14 petitioners.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I think they would say

16 absolute immunity, not qualified. I -- I think they're

17 saying if there's probable cause, the game is over. No

18 -- no qualified --

19 MR. McCARTAN: That's exactly what they're

20 saying, and what I'm saying is that is the wrong

21 standard to be applying.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but there are two

23 questions in the cert petition and it's the second one

24 that's the qualified immunity issue, and the first one

25 is whether there's a cause of action.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. McCARTAN: All right. Well, Your Honor,

2 let -- let me -- let me back up for just a moment then

3 with respect to that.

4 Let me say that probable cause is not the

5 proper standard which should be applied here. The

6 proper standard is the standard that is set forth by

7 this Court in Harlow and as refined later in Anderson

8 against Creighton and a number of other decisions.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the difficulty I think

10 we're all having with it is that the qualified immunity

11 issue and the standard to which you are -- are

12 adverting responds to a question that doesn't arise

13 unless we first assume that there is -- that there is a

14 constitutional violation.

15 MR. McCARTAN: That's correct.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: And our questions are, what

17 is the standard for determining the constitutional

18 violation? Once we get that squared away, then we'll

19 get to Harlow.

20 MR. McCARTAN: The standard that is to be set

21 forth to determine whether there is a constitutional

22 violation is that that this Court applied in Mt.

23 Healthy City School District against Doyle and in

24 Crawford-El against Britton, and that is if there is

25 illegally or unconstitutionally motivated conduct, it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 will not be excused simply because there may be some

2 objectively valid basis for taking such action. That

3 is the conceptual framework that was established in

4 those cases and which should be applied by way of

5 analysis.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: If it is applied here, I --

7 I thought we just granted question one. There were two

8 in the cert petition. I -- my notes say we just

9 granted question one. And that means what they have is

10 the screen. We're going to screen out absolutely any

11 such claim as yours if there is probable cause.

12 Now, the reason they advance for doing that

13 is that in the -- a reason is in the absence of a

14 screen like that, here's what's going to happen. Every

15 single case -- not every one, but millions of cases or

16 thousands, anyway -- involving companies -- well,

17 companies are going to Congress all the time. They

18 have ads all the time. They run into agency hostility

19 all the time. The Hell's Angels? That's a pretty

20 unpopular defendant. They say things all the time that

21 investigators disagree with. And what will happen is

22 in a vast number of cases the defendant will decide to

23 bring a Bivens action, particularly if he gets off, and

24 then we'll have discovery and we'll look into every

25 statement that the -- the investigator made to the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 prosecutor, and before you know it, we have a nightmare

2 of tort cases. And they say that's unfortunate to cut

3 off a claim like yours, but after all, the prosecutors

4 totally cut them off because they have absolute

5 immunity.

6 Now, we're saying at least let's restrict

7 them, where investigators are involved, to cases where

8 it turned out there was no probable cause, otherwise

9 the criminal process itself will be seriously injured.

10 Now, I take it that's the argument. I'd like

11 to hear your reply.

12 MR. McCARTAN: That is exactly the argument,

13 Your Honor, and what it comes down to is whether the

14 burdens of litigation in a situation of this kind will

15 justify judicial alteration of the protection of the

16 First Amendment. And I think that's been very clear

17 from the outset in the first question Justice Kennedy

18 asked.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but are you going to --

20 I mean, is there any light you could shed? And that's

21 why I asked in my question initially. I thought maybe

22 there were some jurisdictions somewhere that -- that

23 survive without the rule they want, but maybe I'm

24 wrong. And -- and how do I judge this? I would be

25 concerned. I don't -- the -- after all, these other

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 cases you mentioned are civil tort cases and -- and

2 they don't involve the criminal process. And when we

3 get into criminal prosecutions, we have rules on

4 selective prosecution that are designed to screen out

5 all but the very worst.

6 MR. McCARTAN: But see --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's what he's arguing

8 for here.

9 MR. McCARTAN: That's what he's arguing, and

10 those are not screening mechanisms, Your Honor.

11 Probable cause was evident and was present in United

12 States against Armstrong and Wayte against the United

13 States. It was not deemed by this Court to be a bar to

14 the selective prosecution claims that were advanced in

15 that -- in those cases.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Leaving -- is there anything

17 you can say before I give up on this? And maybe the

18 answer is no. Is there anything you can say that would

19 relieve my concern, which is completely practical at

20 the moment, that if I decide in your favor, there

21 suddenly are going to be large numbers of criminal

22 cases where defendants will say the reason I was

23 prosecuted was because of something I said? I was

24 advocating motorcycles. I was advocating beating

25 people up. I was advocating a congressional change of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 something. Many, many such cases. They'll all get at

2 least discovery, and the prosecutor's door will become

3 open to the world. Now, that's what's concerning. Can

4 you say anything to relieve that concern?

5 MR. McCARTAN: Yes. I think, first of all,

6 empirically, Your Honor, there's no evidence to the

7 effect that Bivens has had that result after 35 years

8 in full force and effect.

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But if this Court opens

10 that door, don't you think we might see a different

11 problem?

12 MR. McCARTAN: I don't think so, Justice

13 O'Connor. I think if you examine part IV of the

14 Court's opinion in Crawford-El, there is a very careful

15 pattern that is set forth as to how cases of this kind

16 should proceed and what protections are available to

17 protect Government officials against overly burdensome

18 litigation.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which opinion was that? I

20 missed that.

21 MR. McCARTAN: Pardon, Your Honor?

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which opinion are you

23 talking about? I missed it -- missed it.

24 MR. McCARTAN: The opinion in Crawford-El

25 against Britton.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.

2 MR. McCARTAN: There, the Court held that if

3 there are factually specific allegations that would

4 indicate a violation of the Constitution, that at that

5 point the court may consider whether some additional

6 discovery should be permitted even if there should be

7 an independently valid basis.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: This wasn't addressing --

9 this wasn't -- didn't involve prosecution, though. It

10 didn't involve unlawful prosecution.

11 MR. McCARTAN: It did not, Your Honor, but it

12 provides the same --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it was a suit against

14 a prison.

15 MR. McCARTAN: It provides the same framework

16 for the proper analysis of a claim of this kind.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but we treat

18 prosecutions quite differently. We do not give, for

19 example, absolute immunity to the wardens of prisons as

20 we give absolute immunity to prosecutors.

21 MR. McCARTAN: That's --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a specially

23 dangerous area in which to allow litigation.

24 MR. McCARTAN: It is far less dangerous, Your

25 Honor, than when this is asserted by way of defense in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the middle of an ongoing criminal prosecution. It can

2 be far more disruptive to allege a violation of

3 constitutional rights as a defense to a criminal

4 prosecution, while that prosecution is in progress, and

5 an effort is made to examine prosecutorial decision-

6 making than in an after-the-fact, after-acquittal civil

7 action for damages, such as we have here. You have

8 already permitted that kind of examination in criminal

9 cases where probable cause is present.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCartan, I -- I still

11 don't entirely understand what you would want the

12 Government to prove under your system in order to -- in

13 order to -- to win this case. They would have to prove

14 what? That -- that --

15 MR. McCARTAN: They would have to prove that

16 something other than hostility to protected speech was

17 the reason for the prosecution being advanced.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it would not be enough

19 to show that the prosecution would have gone forward

20 anyway.

21 MR. McCARTAN: No. That's -- that's what I

22 mean. Absent -- if there is an objectively valid basis

23 --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 


25 MR. McCARTAN: -- the Government claims there 


1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 is an objectively valid basis for the action they

2 action they would take.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

4 MR. McCARTAN: Then if the plaintiff has made

5 a showing that there was an improper motivation, the

6 burden shifts to the Government to show that the

7 prosecution would have proceeded absent the illicit

8 intent.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You see now in -- in the

10 employment cases where -- where somebody is dismissed

11 for a -- a racially discriminatory reason and -- and

12 you have to prove that the same action would have been

13 taken anyway, you ask the person who fired them with

14 the discriminatory motive whether that person would

15 have taken that action anyway. Whereas here, the

16 person who brought the prosecution is not in this case.

17 It's somebody who gave information to the prosecutor.

18 I don't know how that person could -- could possibly

19 establish that the prosecution would have been brought

20 anyway. It wasn't up to him.

21 MR. McCARTAN: Well, as --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: It had nothing to do with --

23 MR. McCARTAN: -- as -- as you pointed out

24 earlier, probable cause is not the standard that

25 governs the investigator's conduct. These

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 investigators procured a prosecution based upon a

2 violation of the petitioner's -- or excuse me -- the

3 respondent's constitutional rights.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they did, but wouldn't

5 you have to prove under your standard not that they

6 would have procured or tried to procure it anyway, but

7 that in fact the prosecutor would have prosecuted

8 anyway? In other words, that's the distinction between

9 the -- the normal case and -- and the case that we're

10 dealing with here --

11 MR. McCARTAN: No, I --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- with a prosecutor who has

13 absolute immunity.

14 MR. McCARTAN: Well, the prosecutor has

15 absolute immunity. There's a qualified immunity here

16 with respect to the investigators, and that means that

17 the facts and circumstances of the case are going to

18 have to determine whether there's liability.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. All right --

20 MR. McCARTAN: The burden would shift once

21 the illegal motivation is shown. It would shift to the

22 Government to establish that the prosecution would have

23 proceeded absent the illicit event.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But would it -- would it

25 have been a complete defense? Suppose the prosecutor,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 who is immune, gets on the witness stand and says,

2 well, I know all about this -- the First Amendment

3 stuff, but I was going to bring this prosecution anyway

4 because it seemed to me there was a serious crime here.

5 That's all he says. Wouldn't that be the end of the

6 case?

7 MR. McCARTAN: It shouldn't be the end of the

8 case. It would be an issue of causation at that

9 point, Your Honor, if there were evidence.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but the question is

11 the motivation for his decision to bring the case.

12 MR. McCARTAN: The motivation for his

13 decision --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: And he says I -- I would

15 have brought it anyway.

16 MR. McCARTAN: But in this case, the

17 prosecutor's decision to bring these charges to the

18 grand jury I don't think has any probative force

19 whatsoever.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think the defendant

22 can subpoena the prosecutor?

23 MR. McCARTAN: Of course.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I thought the

25 prosecutor had absolute immunity.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. McCARTAN: The prosecutor is not a

2 defendant, Your Honor.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say he -- he can't be

4 brought into court to defend his own -- his own

5 judgment, but he can be brought into court when -- when

6 an investigator is sued in -- in order to take his

7 testimony as to what would have happened?

8 MR. McCARTAN: His testimony was taken in

9 this case and can be taken in this case because at that

10 point in these proceedings -- and you have to look at

11 the evidence of record to this point in this proceeding

12 -- there is very clear evidence of retaliation as a

13 motive for this prosecution.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he may have done it

15 voluntarily here, but I find it hard to believe that he

16 could be subpoenaed, when -- when he has absolute

17 immunity from suit against himself, to testify in a

18 suit against somebody else. It seems to me a very

19 strange kind of a --

20 MR. McCARTAN: Your Honor, the fact that he

21 has absolute immunity does not immunize him from giving

22 testimony in the case.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: So he's a witness. Suppose

24 his testimony --

25 MR. McCARTAN: He's a -- he's a witness.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that the person is

2 convicted.

3 MR. McCARTAN: Suppose the person is

4 convicted.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Can you bring your

6 Bivens claim anyway?

7 MR. McCARTAN: Well, Heck against Humphrey I

8 think would stand in the way of that, Your Honor.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Really? So that's a -- but

10 it's not a civil case.

11 MR. McCARTAN: Well, it's not a simple case.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: So you say that if he's

13 convicted, after all, he may have been convicted but it

14 may be because of the retaliatory motive.

15 MR. McCARTAN: Well, if he is convicted and a

16 civil action for damages is then brought --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

18 MR. McCARTAN: -- then I think you are in the

19 framework of Heck against Humphrey --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you -- so you

21 say --

22 MR. McCARTAN: -- where the court --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- if he's convicted, that's

24 the end of it --

25 MR. McCARTAN: No.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- whether there was a

2 retaliatory motive or not.

3 MR. McCARTAN: No. I think it's very

4 difficult in that case.

5 In Heck against Humphrey, which this Court

6 viewed as a collateral attack on an outstanding

7 conviction, the Court held that there had to be a

8 favorable termination of the criminal proceeding in

9 order to maintain the civil action for damages under

10 section 1983.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, that's 1983.

12 MR. McCARTAN: The Court went on to say,

13 however, that if the civil damage action would not

14 necessarily impugn the conviction, that the case could

15 proceed even though there had not been a favorable

16 termination, reversal, or expungement --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So what he does

18 is he --

19 MR. McCARTAN: -- of the conviction.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- he brings his action and

21 he says here I am 20 years in prison and I agree I'm

22 guilty, but they never would have prosecuted me without

23 the fact that they hate the Hell's Angels and they, in

24 fact, criticize everything that we say.

25 MR. McCARTAN: I don't think that action

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 wouldn't be permitted to proceed.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

3 MR. McCARTAN: It would be viewed as a

4 collateral attack on an outstanding conviction.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. He's saying I was

6 -- I was guilty, but the -- all right. Anyway --

7 MR. McCARTAN: I -- I don't think --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: I won't force you into that.

9 MR. McCARTAN: -- with all due respect, Your

10 Honor, that's a real-world example.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: I'll take basically

12 virtually never if he's convicted. They concede that

13 you could bring this kind of action if there's no

14 probable cause. So we're talking about that range

15 where there was probable cause but acquittal. That's

16 what we're talking about here.

17 MR. McCARTAN: That's right. And why

18 probable cause is not the appropriate standard is

19 because it does not distinguish between what might be

20 an unconstitutional prosecution -- that is, one based

21 solely upon race, religion, or protected speech -- and

22 one that is not. When you look to these earlier cases,

23 Your Honor, I agree they arose in employment contexts.

24 They arose in the context of a prison.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you're -- you're in the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 cases, but I'm -- I'm trying to pursue this. You've

2 given me another idea --

3 MR. McCARTAN: Yes.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- which is I would like to

5 say one word about this. I'm sorry to interrupt your

6 train of thought here, but look.

7 I'm looking for other screens. Is there --

8 is there -- the particular point that they're worried

9 about is you say we want to establish the retaliatory

10 motive. That's what's worrying them because they see,

11 in that establishment of the retaliatory motive,

12 discovery, and discovery means you not only talk to the

13 investigators, but you're also talking to, as a

14 witness, the prosecutors to find out who said what to

15 whom in order to see if you could establish that they

16 didn't like the speech of the defendant. Now, can you

17 give me any screen, not your case, but any kind of a

18 screen that will help --

19 MR. McCARTAN: Yes.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- weed out the sheep from

21 the lambs --

22 MR. McCARTAN: And I --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the goats from the sheep

24 or whatever --

25 MR. McCARTAN: Your Honor --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in that area?

2 MR. McCARTAN: -- I submit the screen is that

3 set forth by this Court in Harlow, which is an

4 objective standard and which is whether the conduct

5 involved violated a clearly established statutory or

6 constitutional right of which a reasonably prudent law

7 enforcement officer or Government official should be

8 aware.

9 That's why I tried to say earlier this

10 standard that should govern this case is not probable

11 cause, but the standard set forth by this Court in

12 Harlow --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: So the -- the screen, in

14 effect, is --

15 MR. McCARTAN: And is a screening.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the qualified immunity

17 screen.

18 MR. McCARTAN: That's right.

19 And there was no screening mechanism in

20 United States against Armstrong. The Court made it

21 very clear that what you were applying there were

22 ordinary equal protection standards.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Have there been cases where

24 in the context of the prosecution, there's been a

25 motion to dismiss the prosecution because it was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 brought in retaliation for the exercise of the First

2 Amendment right?

3 MR. McCARTAN: This Court has not decided

4 what the proper remedy would be there, Your Honor. And

5 the cases --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Have there been cases in

7 the other courts?

8 MR. McCARTAN: I'm not aware of any cases

9 where that has succeeded except at the circuit court

10 level --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but it did in the

12 Armstrong --

13 MR. McCARTAN: -- where the conviction has

14 been invalidated for that reason.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in the race context, it

16 is a dismissal of the prosecution itself. Isn't it?

17 MR. McCARTAN: Yes, Your Honor. It might be

18 the same here.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- with Harlow here.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My -- my question was

21 directed to the First Amendment.

22 MR. McCARTAN: For the First Amendment. No,

23 I'm not aware of -- certainly no decisions of this

24 Court, and I think the only cases arise --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- well, surely the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 prosecution --

2 MR. McCARTAN: -- in the circuit courts of

3 appeals, Your Honor.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely the prosecution would

5 go ahead if there were probable cause. No? No? I

6 mean, suppose it was brought up during the prosecution.

7 MR. McCARTAN: Well, the question --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean to say if there was

9 -- if there was perfect probable cause for the

10 prosecution, that you can stop the prosecution in its

11 tracks by -- by an allegation of the First Amendment

12 violation?

13 MR. McCARTAN: You can move for dismissal of

14 the charges.

15 But look, as far back as 1886, this Court --

16 this Court found a violation of the Equal Protection

17 Clause in a racially motivated prosecution in a

18 situation where there was clearly probable cause and,

19 indeed, overwhelming evidence of guilt for violation of

20 a facially neutral statute. In United States against

21 Armstrong, the existence of probable cause did not

22 stand as a bar to the selective prosecution claims.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: But that -- that's true. I

24 now think we're making some progress. I don't think it

25 is quite a qualified immunity. I think it's possible

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and don't -- I'm putting words in your mouth and deny

2 them if I am. One, he's convicted, no case. Two, no

3 probable cause, everybody agrees there's a case.

4 Three, now there is probable cause, but he's acquitted.

5 Okay?

6 MR. McCARTAN: That's this case.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: In that circumstance,

8 suppose you say we cannot even allow discovery. You

9 don't even get to discovery on your retaliatory motive

10 unless you show clearly, question mark, or unless you

11 show likely, question mark, that the investigator not

12 only retaliated, but he retaliated under conditions

13 where any reasonable person would have known that what

14 he was doing was contrary to the Constitution.

15 MR. McCARTAN: Exactly, Your Honor. That --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don't show that

17 as a -- as a threshold, you don't even get discovery.

18 MR. McCARTAN: We don't -- that is exactly

19 the Harlow standard. That is exactly the standard that

20 was applied in Crawford-El against Britton as the first

21 step in the stage of developments in that case.

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if you turn the Harlow

23 standard around -- I mean, you're -- you're making the

24 -- the negation of the Harlow standard the screening

25 device --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. McCARTAN: Exactly. 


2 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in Justice Breyer's 


3 example.

4 MR. McCARTAN: Exactly.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

6 MR. McCARTAN: That's the threshold

7 determination in a Bivens action of this kind.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCartan, what was the

9 1887 case or 1880 --

10 MR. McCARTAN: Yick Wo against Hopkins.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yick Wo.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said

13 Armstrong.

14 MR. McCARTAN: No, no. Armstrong --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yick Wo.

16 MR. McCARTAN: -- much more recently, but

17 Yick Wo against Hopkins.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask you this.

20 Suppose the law enforcement official -- the postal

21 inspectors bring the prosecution to the prosecutor

22 because of their disagreement with his First Amendment

23 views. The prosecutor said, I don't care about the

24 First Amendment views. I'm glad you brought this to

25 me. I'm going to prosecute because there's probable

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 cause here and this is a bad actor. What results?

2 MR. McCARTAN: The result is that's a

3 question of causation, Your Honor, if there is

4 evidence.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why --

6 MR. McCARTAN: Yes. If there is evidence

7 here with respect to retaliation, then the question of

8 whether the independent act of the prosecutor somehow

9 immunizes that conduct is a question of fact for the

10 trier of fact in the case. If the action --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the prosecutor

12 said, you shouldn't have brought this to me because you

13 -- you're -- you're motivated by the First Amendment.

14 But now that it's here, I have my own independent

15 interest in going ahead.

16 MR. McCARTAN: That's the evidence the

17 Government can bring forward when the burden of proof

18 shifts upon a showing of an illegal or unconstitutional

19 motive for bringing the prosecution to begin with.

20 That's the kind of evidence the Government would

21 present to show that the prosecution would have taken

22 effect in any --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if the burden does shift

24 that way --

25 MR. McCARTAN: Exactly.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- wouldn't it be consistent

2 with the screening mechanism that Justice Breyer

3 suggested and -- and that you accepted? Wouldn't --

4 wouldn't the -- the -- when the burden shifts, wouldn't

5 the obligation be on -- on the point of substance, as

6 opposed to the point of -- of screening, not to show

7 that the -- that the prosecutor would have brought the

8 prosecution anyway, but to show that the investigator

9 would have acted to procure that prosecution anyway?

10 So you would have parallel standards.

11 MR. McCARTAN: Exactly.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

13 MR. McCARTAN: Because the prosecutor has

14 immunity, cannot be a defendant in the case.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But just -- I

16 just want to nail this --

17 MR. McCARTAN: No, absolutely.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- to make sure I understand

19 it. So you're -- you're modifying your position of a

20 minute ago in which you said the standard would be

21 would the prosecution have been brought anyway, and

22 you're now saying, which I think would be consistent

23 with your answer to Justice Breyer, the -- the question

24 is would the investigators have tried to procure the

25 prosecution anyway. And do I understand you correctly,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and -- and have you changed your position?

2 MR. McCARTAN: Well, I think that is a

3 significant distinction, Your Honor, but I think we

4 have to establish that they procured the prosecution

5 and that it did proceed by reasons of the illegal

6 motivation and not for some independently objective

7 standard.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, because the

9 prosecutor could have gotten a lot of other information

10 from other people.

11 MR. McCARTAN: Absolutely.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're not going to

13 throw out the prosecution just because this one piece

14 of information was bad.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's a dual --

16 MR. McCARTAN: Consider too what the facts of

17 record are here. This prosecutor was a complicit

18 conduit in this action. He admitted in the presence of

19 a grand jury witness that he couldn't care less about

20 the guilt or innocence of these people. He just wanted

21 a conviction so he could obtain a lucrative position in

22 private practice. I understand he is still a

23 prosecutor at this time. But that decision of the

24 prosecutor, based upon facts of that kind, has no

25 probative value whatsoever in terms of the independent

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 action that might have broken the chain of causation in

2 a case of this kind.

3 Nor does the indictment of the grand jury

4 have any probative value because exculpatory evidence

5 was withheld from the grand jury. And I think in

6 determining the value of the grand jury's action, you

7 have to really determine not only what was presented to

8 the grand jury, but also what was withheld from

9 examination.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to one

11 question Justice O'Connor asked you earlier? To what

12 extent are there -- is there precedent out there in

13 other courts that have decided this very issue? Are

14 there -- is there precedent for what you're asking us

15 to do?

16 MR. McCARTAN: There -- there is precedent in

17 the courts of appeals, Your Honor. The cases, I think,

18 are cited in our brief where prosecutions have been

19 invalidated based upon violations of constitutional

20 rights.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: But a violation of First

22 Amendment rights or --

23 MR. McCARTAN: First Amendment rights. I

24 think that is the case. Not cited in our brief. But

25 there are cases to that effect.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: And -- and were those cases

2 in which the prosecution itself was brought to a halt,

3 or were they post-prosecution damage actions?

4 MR. McCARTAN: Post-prosecution. Not post-

5 prosecution damage actions but appeals, direct appeals,

6 to invalidate the conviction --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: The conviction.

8 MR. McCARTAN: -- based upon the violation --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is there any precedent

10 for a damage action of this kind?

11 MR. McCARTAN: Well, Bivens is.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but not quite.

13 Bivens isn't exactly like that. This is Fourth

14 Amendment.

15 So is there -- is there precedent for a

16 damage action brought on the theory that the

17 prosecution was brought for -- to retaliate for First

18 Amendment speech?

19 MR. McCARTAN: I'm not aware, Your Honor, of

20 any precedents --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not either.

22 MR. McCARTAN: -- in the three circuits where

23 probable cause is not a bar to an action of that kind.

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, that -- that means one

25 of two things: either what you're arguing for is not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 going to bring a flood of litigation, or everyone has

2 assumed that probable cause is a -- is a requirement.

3 MR. McCARTAN: Well, I think it would be the

4 former rather than the latter, Your Honor, since

5 probable cause does not distinguish between what may be

6 an unconstitutional act on the part of the Government

7 and one that might be motivated by a legitimate

8 grievance.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but I'm not

10 sure that that proposition has been established in the

11 cases.

12 MR. McCARTAN: No, Your Honor, and that's why

13 I think this case is before this Court at this time.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Neither -- neither does

15 absolute immunity for the prosecutor distinguish

16 between whether the prosecutor was acting just

17 illegally or just acting unconstitutionally. I mean,

18 yes.

19 MR. McCARTAN: If I may --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: You apply the same rule

21 there.

22 MR. McCARTAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Is

23 that -- was that an observation or a question?

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, your -- your

25 point that -- that there -- there has to be a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 difference between whether there's a constitutional

2 violation or not in this context seems to me not well

3 taken because we don't make that distinction in the

4 context of giving absolute immunity to the prosecutor.

5 We don't say he doesn't have absolute immunity when --

6 when he's been guilty of a constitutional violation.

7 MR. McCARTAN: But as Justice Souter brought

8 -- questioned whether the prosecution was procured for

9 unconstitutional reasons, the immunity of the

10 prosecutor has nothing to do with the reasons for which

11 the prosecution is brought. It only protects him from

12 civil damage liability. The investigators themselves

13 have no such immunity. It is qualified.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. But the point

15 remains that if in the prosecutorial context that the

16 immunity exists whether or not there's a constitutional

17 violation, then that teaches us that the same rule

18 should apply to this case. That was Justice Scalia's

19 --

20 MR. McCARTAN: No. I think that is the

21 difference, Your Honor, between absolute and qualified

22 immunity. The Court has given absolute immunity only

23 to those functions that are so intimately associated

24 with the judicial process, that they have to give

25 immunity to those people, otherwise there would be an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

58
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 unjust interference with --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?

3 Maybe I should ask Mr. Kneedler. But am I correct in

4 assuming that even if you should lose on the issue that

5 we're faced with today, the case would, nevertheless,

6 go forward because you would still seek to prove an

7 absence of probable cause?

8 MR. McCARTAN: Well, certainly that would be

9 a question for the jury, Your Honor, absence of

10 probable cause.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the case wouldn't

12 be over if you lose here.

13 MR. McCARTAN: Well, it depends on what

14 ground we would lose here. If the Court went on to

15 decide the sufficiency of the allegations in a Bivens-

16 type case, which I don't think it should and which the

17 Court declined the invitation to do so in Harlow, then

18 we would not lose. If you did --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't worry a lot about

20 that, Mr. --

21 MR. McCARTAN: All right.

22 May I say one word about the tort of

23 malicious prosecution, which I say is not a proper

24 analog for the analysis of cases of this kind?

25 The interests that are protected by the First

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

59

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Amendment are far different from those that are

2 remedied by the tort of malicious prosecution, and the

3 injury to which is of far greater magnitude than what

4 the common law sought to address by the tort of

5 malicious prosecution. The tort of a malicious

6 prosecution tells us nothing about the interests

7 protected by the First Amendment. It remedies

8 different interests. It is not a proper analog and,

9 therefore, shouldn't be involved in definition of what

10 the First Amendment rights may be.

11 If you look at those cases where the Court

12 has referenced the common law in determining how

13 constitutional rights should be remedied, they have

14 been situations where the interests protected at common

15 law are identical to those that are protected by the

16 particular constitutional provision that is involved.

17 A good example is Wilson against Arkansas, Fourth

18 Amendment situation, the question of whether the knock-

19 and-announce principle of common law should be

20 incorporated into the reasonableness determination of

21 the Fourth Amendment. The interest protected by the

22 common law in that situation against unreasonable

23 searches and seizures was identical to the interest

24 protected by the Fourth Amendment. For that reason,

25 the Court said that should be taken into consideration

60

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

1 in determining the reasonableness of the action under

2 the Fourth Amendment.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to ask you one

4 other question. Suppose you win on this on the grounds

5 we've been discussing. What happens in the middle of

6 the trial when a defendant wants to say the same thing?

7 Can he avoid conviction by showing the same thing?

8 MR. McCARTAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: What happens when the same

10 claim is made in the middle of a trial that I --

11 whether I'm guilty or innocent? I haven't been

12 convicted yet, and I want to show that this prosecution

13 wouldn't have been brought in the absence of the

14 retaliatory motive. Can he make that claim in the

15 middle of trial or not?

16 MR. McCARTAN: Well, if he were foolish

17 enough to make such a claim --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, he believes it.

19 MR. McCARTAN: I can't believe that a

20 defendant in a criminal prosecution who is acquitted in

21 a subsequent civil suit --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. He's not acquitted.

23 MR. McCARTAN: Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

24 You say he's not acquitted.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: He's in the middle of trial

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

61

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and he wants to say --

2 MR. McCARTAN: Well, I don't think he'd be in

3 the middle of trial under Heck against Humphrey.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's the criminal trial.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a criminal trial.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: The original criminal trial.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: He's in a criminal trial,

8 and what he wants --

9 MR. McCARTAN: This is not a civil action for

10 damages.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: No.

12 MR. McCARTAN: This is a criminal case.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: They read our opinion which

14 holds in your favor. Then the next thing is in -- in

15 the criminal cases the defense lawyers say, hey, I -- I

16 think my client wouldn't be here today were it not that

17 the FBI had a retaliatory motive.

18 MR. McCARTAN: That would not suffice. 


19 JUSTICE BREYER: Because? 


20 MR. McCARTAN: And that was the whole purpose 


21 of Harlow, mere --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. They're going

23 to show exactly the elements that we write in our

24 opinion.

25 MR. McCARTAN: If the -- if the defendant in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

62

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that case had established evidence tending to show the

2 essential elements of the claim, it would present a

3 question for the court, but I think the court would use

4 the admission against interest as a basis for paying no

5 attention to such --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you very much, Mr.

7 McCartan.

8 Mr. Kneedler, you have 3 minutes left.

9 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

10 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11 MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Justice Stevens.

12 I'd like to respond to Justice Breyer's

13 suggestion that this could all be solved by an

14 application of the Harlow qualified immunity standard.

15 With all respect, I don't think that that would really

16 work at all because if -- if the point is that it would

17 be unconstitutional to bring a prosecution only because

18 of protected First Amendment activity, that could be

19 taken as a given and still be enormous inquiry into

20 what actually happened between the investigator and the

21 prosecutor, what the real motivation was, what the

22 prosecution's policies were. That is the concern we

23 have for the post hoc inquiry into the process.

24 And not only that, it isn't just the

25 discovery. It's what -- what consequences this will

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

63
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 have on law enforcement generally if police officers

2 operate under the assumption that if the prosecution

3 fails, they will be subject to civil liability, which

4 is exactly what Blackstone said, as this Court quoted

5 in Dinsman v. Wilkes.

6 The reason for the rule is that it would be a

7 very great discouragement to public justice if

8 prosecutors, who have a tolerable ground of suspicion,

9 were liable to be sued at law whenever their

10 indictments miscarried.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're not talking

12 about prosecutors there --

13 MR. KNEEDLER: No, but -- but that included

14 complaining witnesses. That -- that was what

15 prosecutor meant at common -- at common law. And

16 there's no reason to grope for some sort of screen

17 because the common law furnishes it. The tort of

18 malicious prosecution is what this Court relied upon in

19 Heck v. Humphrey for the favorable termination rule,

20 that you could not bring a 1983 suit unless the

21 conviction had been set aside and the proceeding was

22 terminated in favor of the plaintiff.

23 That same tort, that tort of malicious

24 prosecution, contains the probable cause requirement to

25 guard against an objective screen, to guard against the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

64
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 very thing that Blackstone was worried about and that

2 this Court noticed in -- in the Dinsman case. And that

3 is, that it is important not to have law enforcement

4 officers be chilled from the important function of

5 furnishing information to prosecutors.

6 And this Court's decision in Armstrong

7 imposed an important objective test that you have to

8 show that there's somebody similarly situated before

9 you even inquire into prosecutorial motives. You have

10 to show an objective factor that someone else was

11 similarly situated. Respondent's position would offer

12 no such -- no such protection.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the judge

14 granting a motion to quit at the close of the

15 Government's evidence? Why isn't that objective?

16 MR. KNEEDLER: Because at -- at common law --

17 and I think this was an important insight. At common

18 law, it was not even evidence of the absence of

19 probable cause because a judgment of acquittal turns on

20 the determination that a factfinder -- a reasonable

21 fact finder could not find beyond a reasonable doubt

22 that the defendant had actually committed the crime.

23 Probable cause is a very different standard, which is

24 whether it would lead a reasonable, cautious, prudent

25 person to believe that a crime had been committed.

1 That is the --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I wasn't --

3 MR. KNEEDLER: An acquittal does not --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your opponent says -- says

5 there is no probable cause requirement. You are now on

6 there's no objective test. It's all subjective. I

7 suggest that there could be an objective test. This is

8 not going to the probable cause question. Objective

9 test? Was this case thrown out at the close of the

10 Government's evidence?

11 MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but my -- my point was

12 at common law, that the wisdom of the courts was that

13 -- that that wasn't even evidence of a -- that should

14 -- that -- that shouldn't allow the suit to go forward

15 because it was a sufficient guard -- protection for the

16 prosecutors.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.

18 The case is submitted.

20 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
