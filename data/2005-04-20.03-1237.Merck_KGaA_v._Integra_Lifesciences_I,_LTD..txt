3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument

4 now in the Merck KGaA v. Integra Lifesciences.

5 Mr. Rosenkranz.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

7 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your -- Mr. Chief

9 Justice, and may it please the Court:

10 Your Honors, there is no dispute among the

11 parties, nor among the 19 amicus briefs presented before

12 the Court today. As to the answer to the threshold legal

13 question, everyone agrees that the FDA exemption does,

14 indeed, apply, with full force, to the sorts of

15 experiments that are conducted and that would be relevant

16 to the FDA in consideration of an Investigational New Drug

17 application, a so-called IND. So the battleground now

18 shifts to Integra's alternative arguments in support of

19 the judgment --

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, would you just clarify

21 something for me as we start to consider the case? I

22 guess this thing went to the jury under an instruction

23 that tried to come to grips with the definition under the

24 statute in some way. Was that instruction one to which

25 Merck preserved an objection?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. We did not

2 object to the core of the jury's instructions stating the

3 legal standard. And we --

4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think it was properly

5 stated in that instruction?

6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The core of the instruction,

7 yes, Your Honor, was --

8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That's as good as we could

9 do.

10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I believe -- the

11 answer is, the core was as good as this Court can do, and

12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. And, under that,

13 you think that Merck was entitled to a directed verdict --

14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.

15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- from the evidence?

16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It was entitled to a verdict as

17 a matter of law, but let me just --

18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, but the Court of

19 Appeals for the Federal Circuit did not address the case

20 in -- by looking at the evidence and whether a directed

21 verdict should have been given --

22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the --

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- or not?

24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- the Federal Circuit did

25 understand that this was a JMOL case --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I know, but it seemed to decide

2 the case based on its view of the statute as just applying

3 to generic drugs or something like that.

4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That is absolutely correct,

5 Your Honor.

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So it didn't, in fact, come

7 to grips with the evidence.

8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It absolutely did not come to

9 grips with the evidence, nor did it grapple with the

10 alternative arguments that Integra was presenting --

11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, so --

12 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- so they --

13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- maybe all we have to do is

14 deal with whether that court should have addressed the

15 evidence.

16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That would be one answer, Your

17 Honor, reverse and not addressing the alternative legal

18 grounds, but I would urge this Court to address the

19 alternative grounds, because they raise --

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: All of them? You mean, like

21 the research tools problem?

22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, because the

23 research tools problem was never presented --

24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.

25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- as an issue before the jury

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 or before the District Court. And --

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Or the Tripps Treaty?

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.

4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.

5 MR. ROSENKRANZ: In fact, that's not even raised

6 by Respondents. It's raised by amici's --

7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. And how about the

8 common-law research example --

9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I would -- I would urge the

10 Court not broach the subject of any of the questions that

11 are not properly presented --

12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, so --

13 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- to this Court.

14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- all we're doing is looking

15 at the statute.

16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: We're --

17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Thank you.

18 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, we're looking

19 at the statute --

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay.

21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- but it is an -- it is

22 important, in answer to the very first question, to

23 embellish a bit, because the lower courts need this

24 Court's guidance, because every one of the theories on

25 which Integra defends the judgment below raise exactly

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the same problems that the Federal Circuit's opinion

2 raises. They defy the plain language of the statute

3 Congress passed. They are equally at odds with the

4 purpose that Congress had in mind when it passed the FDA

5 exemption.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What are the

7 alternative grounds that you're discussing now passed on

8 by the Federal Circuit?

9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, they were not

10 passed on by the Federal Circuit, except perhaps to the

11 extent that the Federal Circuit may have concluded that

12 all -- or that, excuse me -- that safety is the only issue

13 before the FDA when it is considering an Investigational

14 New Drug application, or that a drug innovator may not

15 harbor additional purposes in an experiment beyond the FDA

16 exemption, or that the -- excuse me -- beyond FDA

17 regulatory purposes -- or, third, that the exemption does

18 not cover efforts to optimize the drug candidate after

19 it's identified and that drug candidate is, in fact, the

20 lead candidate.

21 Those are the three legal theories, Your Honors,

22 on which Integra is resting its defense of the judgment

23 below. And every single one of them is either incorrect

24 as a matter of law or immaterial as a matter of law. If

25 this Court were to ask Integra to come up with a single

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 genuine issue of fact that does not relate to one or

2 another of those three propositions, it will not be able

3 to do so, save a footnote to be addressed later about the

4 credibility of witnesses on a topic on which Integra never

5 argued the witnesses were not credible.

6 Just beginning with the safety question, and

7 I'll defer to the Government on that, because the

8 Government can speak better than anyone else as to what it

9 is that is relevant to the FDA in consideration of an IND,

10 suffice it to say that the regulations say, as a matter of

11 law, that safety is not the only consideration before the

12 FDA as it considers an IND. The FDA cares very much about

13 whether a drug will work: efficacy. The FDA cares very

14 much about how it works: mechanism of action. It cares

15 about what the body does to that drug: pharmacokinetics.

16 And it cares very much about what that drug does to the

17 body: pharmacology. And Integra's position before the

18 jury, and before this Court, depends upon the proposition

19 that it can bring in a witness to argue that the law is

20 other than what the law clearly is. And the same thing

21 goes for the so-called GLP studies that the FDA considers

22 in connection with safety data, but need not limit itself

23 to GLP studies when it's considering those other IND-

24 relevant topics.

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, just one

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 piece of information. Because the IND is so important at

2 this point, is it in the record -- do we have a copy of

3 the IND?

4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The IND, Your Honor, is not in

5 the record, because it was excluded from evidence, which

6 may be why the jury reached the wrong conclusion. But, I

7 hasten to add, that will not be uncommon in these sorts of

8 cases, because there are many circumstances in which a

9 preclinical study begins and fails, and the IND will never

10 materialize. There are circumstances in which a

11 preliminary injunction is brought and won, and the

12 research stops cold, so an IND never materializes.

13 And, again, it's important to understand, as one

14 assesses the FDA exemption, that the inquiry is always ex

15 ante, it is always, "What is a reasonable drug innovator?

16 What does that drug innovator or scientist know at the

17 point in time at which it is about to perform the next set

18 of experiments?" So you always reflect back to a point in

19 time before the IND materializes.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rosenkranz, the items you

21 listed earlier seemed to me to more narrow than what I

22 took to be the point of your opening brief, which was that

23 the decision below was wrong because the Federal Circuit

24 simply excluded all consideration of materials prepared

25 for purposes of the IND, as opposed to materials prepared

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 for the -- for the drug application, later on. Are you

2 abandoning that more expansive position?

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because I don't read the

5 opinion that way. I don't think that opinion has to be

6 read to say that they're not going to allow in anything

7 that goes to the IND.

8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, there is certainly

9 a way to read the Federal Circuit's opinion -- and this is

10 also in response to Justice O'Connor's earlier question --

11 in which it did grapple with the very questions we're

12 talking about now, and did answer the questions about

13 whether it's just safety -- and I believe the Federal

14 Circuit believed that only safety data were relevant; that

15 is certainly what it indicated in oral argument -- and

16 also that dual purposes are not permissible.

17 So let me now turn to the dual-purpose question,

18 because it's another major theme of --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Have you answered my question?

20 You're abandoning the assertion that the Federal Circuit

21 did not consider anything that didn't go to the IND --

22 that didn't go to the --

23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- drug application.

25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. I believe that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there are two ways to read the Federal Circuit's opinion.

2 To the extent that the Federal Circuit said nothing before

3 the clinical stage is relevant to the FDA exemption -- if

4 that is what the Federal Circuit held, we are -- we are

5 not abandoning the position that that is wrong. I

6 understand that there is another way to read the Federal

7 Circuit's opinion that grapples with the subsidiary

8 questions that we're discussing here, which are all fairly

9 presented in our question presented. And that's what I'm

10 addressing myself to now.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: For your first answer, are you

12 relying what the Federal Circuit said in its opinion --

13 and it's in 10a of our cert petition appendix -- that is,

14 the Federal Circuit's statement of the question presented,

15 whether the preclinical research conducted under Scripps-

16 Merck agreement is exempt from liability for infringement

17 of Integra's patents.

18 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. And then, two

19 pages later, on 12a, the Federal Circuit states its

20 conclusion, and I quote, "Thus, the Scripps work sponsored

21 by Merck was not solely for use as reasonably related to

22 clinical testing for the FDA."

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it -- it's not at all

24 clear in the opinion that the Court was using preclinical

25 and clinical in the very technical sense that you were --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that you use it, which means "clinical" is stuff submitted

2 for the drug application, and "preclinical" is for the

3 earlier application. That is not at all --

4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it's not at all

5 clear. And, just as in Boyle, when this Court faced a

6 situation where it wasn't clear what the Federal -- or,

7 excuse me -- what the Court of Appeals held, the Court --,

8 "The best thing for this Court to do is to address what

9 appears to be the threshold question that the Court of

10 Appeals decided," but then also to address the subsidiary

11 questions on the basis of which Integra is defending the

12 judgment below.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Rosenkranz --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: A moment ago -- a

15 moment ago, you were reading from 12(a). Was it the first

16 sentence you were reading from?

17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It was the first

18 paragraph, and I was reading from the end of that

19 paragraph, Your Honor, the -- which begins, "Thus," three

20 lines -- really two -- the word "thus" is at the end of

21 the third line from the bottom of that paragraph, Your

22 Honor.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you.

24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And so, I was saying earlier

25 that a critical component of Integra's case revolves

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 around the notion that the use may not have more than one

2 purpose, and that purpose can only be FDA directed. That

3 argument is also incorrect as a matter of law. And one

4 way we can tell that is that there is no such thing as a

5 preclinical course of study that has only one purpose.

6 When one is studying mechanism of action, a scientist is

7 deeply interested, not just in how this drug works, but in

8 how the disease works. And the language of the statute

9 is, of course, the touchstone here. The statute is

10 triggered by uses. The use, in this context, is an

11 experiment. And the statute covers, provides a safe

12 harbor for, experiments that develop the sorts of

13 information that are relevant to the FDA. If that --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would that -- would that --

15 would that be explained by the research-tool doctrine, or

16 not?

17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, absolutely not, Your Honor.

18 The research-tool question -- let me begin by saying,

19 these were not research tools; these RGD peptides were the

20 objects of study.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess what I was asking,

22 Would you ever use the peptide as a research tool, was my

23 -- was my question.

24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Oh, yes, Your Honor. There are

25 circumstances in which these peptides could be used as

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 research tools to stunt the growth of blood vessels and

2 study what happens next with other compounds, but they

3 were emphatically not used as research tools in this case.

4 In this case, they were the objects of study, and Integra

5 won a jury verdict based upon that presentation. And, in

6 fact, never argued to any court or to the jury that there

7 is a resource tool carve out. So, I was just talking about

8 the subjective purpose earlier, and it is -- again, it's

9 important to note that the information can be used for

10 other purposes. There's nothing in the statute that

11 prohibits that.

12 Now, let me turn, just briefly then, to what is

13 often one of the most important questions in these FDA

14 exemption cases, which is the timeline question. At what

15 point in the arc of drug development is it unreasonable

16 for a jury to conclude that the FDA is an inappropriate

17 audience for the next set of experiments? Our position --

18 and people may differ, as a matter of law, as to whether

19 it is earlier -- but our argument is, at a bare minimum, at

20 the point in time at which a drug developer has a known

21 structure and cures a disease in an animal with that known

22 structure, all eyes turn to drug development; which is to

23 say, all eyes turn to the FDA. As a matter of law,

24 everything after that, so long as it's relevant to the

25 FDA, is FDA -- is appropriate to view as FDA directed.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you agree then that at

2 whatever period, however you want to describe the period,

3 at which the researcher is basically trying to figure out

4 what drug to concentrate on, that that period is too far

5 back in time to come within the exception?

6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. That's exactly

7 the trigger moment. If it has a structure, and it's

8 investigating analogs of that structure to figure out

9 which of these various structures are the best ones to

10 move forward, everything from that point on is FDA

11 directed.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, here's what -- here's the

13 problem I have with your argument. I can understand that

14 argument more easily under the statute, under the text of

15 the statute as it is written, than I can understand it

16 under the instruction that you agreed to, because the

17 instruction that you agreed to had a limitation, a textual

18 limitation which is not in the statute itself, that refers

19 to "relatively directly" as describing the relationship

20 between this information and its object. And if we decide

21 this case on the basis of the statute, and we read the

22 statute more broadly than the instruction, then you're

23 getting something that you're not entitled to, because you

24 agreed to the instruction. If we decide this issue by

25 construing the statute as if your instruction is correct,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 then we're making an assumption about the proper

2 construction of the statute that has not been argued here.

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: It seems to me that the law of

5 the case, as to what the statute means for your case, is

6 set by the instruction, and that is why I am reluctant to

7 get into the issue that you raise here, because I think

8 we're rather -- you are limited, and we are tied in what

9 we can do as a result of your agreement with the

10 instruction.

11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor -- and I see my time

12 is running out; I'd like to reserve a bit for rebuttal, so

13 let me answer, just briefly. Under Praprotnik, of course,

14 this Court is not bound by law of the case by the

15 instruction. But the instruction, as I understand it, says

16 exactly what the statute says. "Reasonably directly" is

17 simply another way of saying, "Are these activities

18 reasonably related to the FDA purposes?" And every one of

19 the comparative experiments is relevant to the FDA's inquiry,

20 whether this drug or that is the optimum drug. Every

21 experiment that is involved here -- and there were only 10

22 percent that were comparative in nature -- develops

23 information about the lead drug candidate, including

24 understanding why this one works, rather than that one.

25 So, if it's all right, Your Honors, I'd like to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.

3 Rosenkranz.

4 Mr. Joseffer.

5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

6 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

7 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

8 MR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 I believe the question before the Court is the

11 proper construction of the statute, and we believe the

12 lower courts committed three important legal errors that

13 should be corrected.

14 The first is in drawing the clinical/preclinical

15 distinction. And, understanding that, Justice Scalia, I

16 think the important thing to understand is that clinical

17 studies refer to studies conducted on humans, and at the

18 IND stage, the whole question is to decide whether studies

19 should be conducted on humans. So at that point in time

20 the only information that's available is the preclinical

21 studies on animals and in test tubes. So when the Court

22 distinguished between preclinical and clinical, it was

23 essentially saying, you cannot do the information that's

24 necessary to submit an IND, necessary to do clinical

25 trials, necessary to get your drug approved. And that's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 why we -- it seems to us that that's clearly wrong.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Do you have to have

3 the FDA's permission to start clinical testing?

4 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes, that's the purpose of an IND

5 application, is -- the whole -- the only thing that FDA is

6 looking at, at that point, is whether to permit human

7 clinical trials to proceed.

8 The second important legal error committed by

9 the Federal Circuit was in apparently concluding that only

10 tests regarding the compounds ultimately submitted to FDA

11 in an IND are subject to the protection. Now, the problem

12 with that is that a company can decide which specific

13 compound to submit only by first comparing -- doing

14 studies on that compound and on others in order to

15 determine which would be the best compound to submit,

16 which would strike the best balance between obtaining

17 health effects or avoiding safety concerns. So, if the

18 exemption only --

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you state again what

20 you say the second error was?

21 MR. JOSEFFER: The second error, we believe, is

22 that the Federal Circuit indicated that only studies

23 undertaken on the single compound ultimately submitted in

24 an IND are protected by the exception. And the problem

25 with that is that I can't figure out what that one

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 compound is until I've done studies on it and on other

2 compounds to determine --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: That --

4 MR. JOSEFFER: -- which is the best to submit.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that might well determine

6 whether the research was relatively directly related. I

7 mean, if I were a juror, I would -- I would say it's

8 relatively directly related if it relates to that

9 particular compound which is ultimately submitted, and not

10 relatively directly related if it was preliminary, trying

11 to found out which compound to submit.

12 MR. JOSEFFER: We would -- we would look at it

13 this way. If I'm -- say I have 12 compounds that I'm

14 going to test and decide which is best and go forward

15 with. At the time I'm doing a test on any one of those

16 compounds, if those tests succeed, it's reasonably

17 foreseeable I'll submit an IND for that compound.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand all that.

19 But --

20 MR. JOSEFFER: And the --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I'm just saying that that is

22 certainly one interpretation of "reasonably directly."

23 And if that is so, then you are erroneous in your

24 assumption that the question before this Court is the

25 meaning of the statute. It might not be. It might be --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it might be the meaning of the instruction.

2 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, I think we would disagree

3 with that, for two reasons. The first is that the Federal

4 Circuit, as Justice O'Connor noted, reserved -- resolved

5 these questions entirely as a matter of law, based on a de

6 novo interpretation of the statute, without regard to the

7 jury instruction. And that's the holding that's now

8 before this Court.

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's your position on the

10 jury instruction? Does it correctly state the law?

11 MR. JOSEFFER: We think that it's -- if it's

12 construed correctly, we think that it's correct, but just

13 too general to be of assistance to the courts in

14 addressing the more specific questions of the issue here.

15 And this is -- remember, Merck has sought judgment as a

16 matter of law. And when a party seeks judgment as a

17 matter of law, the courts are not constrained to only

18 applying the law that's found in the jury instruction;

19 they can also articulate and apply -- and do all the time

20 -- other legal principles that are relevant. Praprotnik

21 v. St. Louis is a great example of a case where this Court

22 did that.

23 Now, there would be a problem if the jury

24 instruction was inconsistent with the correct rule of law,

25 because then there could be a waiver concern. But we

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 don't see that at issue here, because the jury

2 instruction, we think, was just too general to speak to

3 these issues.

4 But getting back to my point about why it can't

5 be limited to that single compound --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But who's fault is that

7 that the jury instruction is too general. I mean, if both

8 parties agreed to it, aren't they, in a sense, bound by it?

9 MR. JOSEFFER: We think that the Petitioner

10 should not, and is not, arguing inconsistently with the

11 jury instruction. The point is just that juries, being

12 lay people, tend to be instructed --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The Petitioner said he

14 agreed with the core of the instruction, whatever that is.

15 MR. JOSEFFER: I think that's just with the

16 general principles. Take, for example, a negligence case.

17 Jurors are instructed all the time that the Defendant has

18 a duty of ordinary care. And then courts, on appeal, will

19 determine more specific legal questions, whether entire

20 classes of conduct do or do not comply with the ordinary

21 care, in much greater detailed instructions to the jury.

22 And example of a case where this Court did that would be

23 Shenker v. B&O Railroad, at 374 U.S. 1. And we think that

24 in a -- in determining whether a Petitioner is entitled to

25 judgment as a matter of law, this Court should just

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 articulate and apply the specific legal principles here;

2 they're not inconsistent with the jury --

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was the court below wrong in

4 saying that the statute was enacted only to help generic-

5 drug development?

6 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. In fact, this Court already

7 held in Eli Lilly v. Medtronic that the statute is not

8 limited to generic drugs. In fact, it's not even limited

9 to drugs, but also applies to things like medical devices,

10 food additives, color additives. And it's a very

11 important point, because the Federal Circuit thought the

12 statute to be construed in an artificially narrow manner

13 in light of a supposed focus on generic drugs, which is

14 just inconsistent with this Court's authoritative

15 construction of the statute.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that going to be your third

17 point, the third error that the court supposedly

18 committed?

19 MR. JOSEFFER: No, the third is the error

20 committed by the District Court and relied on by

21 Respondents here, which is the statement that FDA only

22 considers safety, and not efficacy, in determining whether

23 to permit human clinical trials to proceed. It's a very

24 important point, because at the IND stage the question for

25 FDA is whether a drug should be given to human beings.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And because there's no such thing as an absolutely safe

2 drug, because all drugs entail at least some safety risks,

3 FDA will not let human clinical trials proceed unless

4 there's some reason to believe that the study could be

5 useful. It's a -- it's a benefit-risk analysis. The

6 Court looks to whether the potential benefits of the test

7 would outweigh the risks of the test; and if not, the

8 Court will not let a test proceed.

9 Now, Congress charged FDA with doing that by

10 instructing FDA to determine whether the drug would pose

11 an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of humans.

12 And FDA has construed that, as I said, to mean the

13 benefit-risk.

14 The most express articulation of that comes in

15 the guidance document that FDA has put out regarding the

16 preparation of the investigators brochure, which is a

17 required part of the 9d submission. And the investigators

18 -- and the guidance document explains that the

19 investigators brochure must provide sufficient information

20 for the -- for the reader to, quote, "make his/her own

21 unbiased risk-benefit assessment of the proposed

22 clinical." That's set forth on the bottom of page 10 of

23 our brief. And --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What are the

25 consequences if someone goes ahead and conducts a clinical

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 trial without the approval of the FDA?

2 MR. JOSEFFER: That's contrary to federal law.

3 I -- certainly would be severe civil consequences. And my

4 guess is there are criminal consequences for doing that,

5 too.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your time is short, so could

7 you tell us how far back you think, under the statute, you

8 can go and not -- and be within the safe harbor?

9 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. We think that the proper

10 test looks to whether a company is trying to develop a

11 particular drug, by which we mean a substance with

12 particular characteristics designed to achieve particular

13 objectives. To explain that, we recognize that basic

14 scientific research into human biology and disease

15 processes is not protected. That's just too far down the

16 stream of causation. But once I get a particular concept

17 for a drug, this says I'm going to treat the disease in a

18 particular way by targeting a particular part of the

19 disease process. Then we think that the work done, going

20 forward, with includes comparing different substances to

21 figure out which would be the best active ingredient, is

22 protected. To provide a concrete example --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that basic research?

24 I mean, I want to -- I want to treat this disease by

25 stifling the development of blood cells around it, or

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 something like that, and then you ask yourself, "Gee, what

2 would stifle the production of blood cells?" And let's

3 assume there hasn't been any research done in that field

4 before. You wouldn't consider that basic research, so

5 long as the idea I have in my -- in my head is, I want to

6 create a drug to treat this disease that will stifle blood

7 cells?

8 MR. JOSEFFER: No. And here's why. The basic

9 insight, and then I'll explain it, is that the first time

10 a study -- a study is run on a particular substance, if

11 that's -- first study is not protected, then the exemption

12 is worthless, because I'd have to commit that infringing

13 study before I gained the protection of the exemption.

14 So, we would say that the -- in this case, for

15 example -- I think it's easier on particulars -- the

16 basic research was figuring out that the key to cancer is

17 -- the key to the growth of tumors is angiogenesis, and

18 the key to blocking angiogenesis is blocking the alpha v

19 beta 3 receptors. That's the basic research into how the

20 body works. But once I then start trying to figure out

21 which substance would best block an alpha v beta 3

22 receptor, it's very specific, because I know what that

23 receptor is, I know what it's like, I know what

24 characteristics I'm going to need in a drug to block that.

25 And when I try different things out to block that, that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 first experiment, at that point, has to be protected,

2 because, otherwise, I'd have to commit the infringement

3 before I could get --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the earlier process that

5 you described, the basic research, is that within the

6 common law research exemption?

7 MR. JOSEFFER: The -- it would be if it was

8 noncommercial.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How does the common law

10 research exemption figure into this case, if at all?

11 MR. JOSEFFER: It's not directly before here

12 because Petitioner has not relied on it at all, and

13 for good reason, which is that the courts have

14 consistently held that the common law research exception

15 applies only to noncommercial activity. The most obvious

16 example would be kids in their basements. But when a drug

17 company, that its entire business is developing and

18 manufacturing drugs, undertakes the activity, that's

19 commercial, and that's never been considered protected by

20 the common law exception.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does Scripps -- is Scripps in

22 the business, too?

23 MR. JOSEFFER: I see my red light is on, if I

24 could answer the question.

25 Some of Scripps' work, when it's working

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 directly for Merck, certainly is, we would think, you

2 know, tied closely to Merck's commercial activities.

3 Scripps may also do some other bioresearch --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.

5 Joseffer.

6 Mr. Flores.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAURICIO A. FLORES

8 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9 MR. FLORES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11 This Court stated, in Black versus Cutter

12 Laboratories, which is cited on page 27 of our brief, as

13 follows, "At times, the atmosphere in which an opinion is

14 written may become so surcharged that unnecessarily broad

15 statements are made. In such a case, it is our duty to

16 look beyond the broad sweep of the language and determine

17 for ourselves precisely the ground on which the judgment

18 rests."

19 This is such a case. The judgment of the

20 Federal Circuit was its order affirming the District

21 Court's denial of Merck's motion for judgment as a matter

22 of law. The precise grounds for the Federal Circuit's

23 opinion is set forth in page 14a in the appendix attached

24 to Merck's petition for certiorari. And there the Federal

25 Circuit said that it upheld the denial of Merck's motion

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 for judgment as a matter of law because the Federal Circuit

2 discerned no error in the District Court's interpretation

3 of section 271(e)(1), which raises the question --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is this? Page 14a --

5 MR. FLORES: Yes, Your --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are you quoting from?

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it just before the letter

8 "b" on 14a?

9 MR. FLORES: Yes, Your Honor.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: What are the first few words of

11 the sentence there that you quoted?

12 MR. FLORES: "Because the language and context

13 of the safe harbor do not embrace the Scripps-Merck

14 general biomedical experimentation, this Court discerns no

15 error" --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. And so, they are

17 saying that they're wrong on their ground for thinking

18 that the language and context don't embrace it. Since

19 they used the wrong standard, they never got to the

20 question of whether the evidence warranted a directed

21 verdict. So I don't see how we avoid looking at all of

22 what you'd call the atmospherics.

23 MR. FLORES: The precise holding and the

24 reasoning of the Federal Circuit was, they found no error

25 in what the District Court's --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Because they interpreted the

2 statute in a particular way. Isn't that right? I'm

3 asking. I'm not --

4 MR. FLORES: No, Your Honor.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: No?

6 MR. FLORES: The only interpretation of the

7 statute that can be found in the District Court's order

8 denying Merck's motion for judgment as a matter of law is

9 the standard articulated in the jury instruction.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but I think -- I think the

11 Justice was asking whether it was the Court of Appeals

12 that --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- applied a particular

15 standard. And certainly it had to have been. Didn't the

16 Court of Appeals have a particular standard as to what

17 constituted general biomedical experimentation, as opposed

18 to the kind of experimentation that's covered by the -- by

19 the safe harbor exemption? It must have had. I mean, how

20 could you -- how could you rule on the question before you

21 unless you have, in your head, a notion of what the safe

22 harbor consists of and what is beyond it?

23 MR. FLORES: The question before the Federal

24 Circuit was whether the District Court erred by not

25 applying the rational predicate interpretation of section

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 271(e), which was the sole focus of Merck's appeal to the

2 Federal Circuit.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should we say that's the

4 question, when the Federal Circuit, itself, said what I

5 read before from 10a?

6 MR. FLORES: Your Honor, on page 10a, the Federal

7 Circuit said, "Thus" -- and this is in the -- the last

8 sentence in the middle paragraph of the page -- "Thus,

9 this Court must determine whether section -- the section

10 271(e) safe harbor reaches back down the chain of

11 experimentation to embrace development and identification

12 of new drugs that will, in turn, be subject to FDA

13 approval."

14 JUSTICE BREYER: That would answer that question?

15 MR. FLORES: It does not. The Federal Circuit

16 answered that in the negative. The Federal Circuit

17 rejected the interpretation advanced by Merck, which was

18 the rational predicate standard, which was basically a

19 causal test, and held that the District Court's

20 interpretation, under the Intermedics standard that's

21 given in the jury instruction, that Merck now concedes is

22 the correct standard.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: So they say that it does not --

24 the safe harbor does not reach, among other things, back

25 down the chain of experimentation to embrace the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 development of new drugs that will be subject to FDA

2 approval. In your opinion, is that statement, as I read

3 it -- I left out the word "identification" -- as I read

4 it, is that statement a correct statement of the law, or

5 incorrect statement?

6 MR. FLORES: That is a correct statement of the

7 law.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: That is a correct statement of

9 the law. So then, I take it, the other thinks that it

10 isn't, because, for example, you could have a situation

11 where you are developing drugs, and, in developing drugs,

12 you do some experiments and you get some information that

13 would be useful to the FDA and the IND process, and,

14 therefore, they are within the safe harbor.

15 MR. FLORES: No, Your Honor. I believe the

16 Solicitor General agrees with this aspect of the Federal

17 Circuit's opinion and makes that clear at the bottom of

18 page 15 and onto page 16 of the Solicitor General's brief.

19 Merck no longer challenges this aspect of the Federal

20 Circuit's opinion. Merck concedes that there are

21 experiments in the basic research phase, that, although

22 they're necessary in the chain of causation, are not

23 exempt. The rational -- Merck has abandoned the rational

24 predicate standard that the Federal Circuit rejected here.

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Flores, when I asked you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 about the sentence on page 10, I intended, not the one

2 that you read, but an earlier one that precedes it, and

3 that is, "The questioning arising in this case is whether

4 the preclinical research" -- that is, the research on

5 animals, as distinguished from humans -- "conducted under

6 the Scripps-Merck agreement is exempt from liability for

7 infringement of Integra's patents."

8 Now, if you just took that as the question, then you

9 would say it -- this Circuit is drawing the line between

10 clinical and preclinical. It's not a crystal-clear

11 opinion, by any means, but that is one question presented

12 that they've identified. And how do they answer that

13 question?

14 MR. FLORES: Your Honor, I disagree. I think

15 the operative language in this sentence is the reference

16 to "the Scripps-Merck" -- is to "research conducted under

17 the Scripps-Merck agreement."

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the way I read it. It

19 -- the -- and this is why I was disagreeing with counsel

20 from the other side. It -- well, counsel ultimately

21 conceded, you could read it not to draw the line between

22 clinical and preclinical. And the way you read this

23 sentence is -- the question, they say, is not whether

24 preclinical research falls under 271(e)(1); it's whether

25 the "preclinical research conducted under the Scripps-

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Merck agreement." And then the next sentence explains

2 what that means. The experiments did not supply

3 information for submission to the United States Food and

4 Drug Administration, but, instead, identified the best

5 drug candidate.

6 So, I think what they're describing as the

7 question presented is whether preclinical research that is

8 -- that is not directed to supplying information for

9 submission to the Food and Drug Administration, but,

10 instead, to selecting the drug candidate, whether that

11 type of preclinical research is within the safe harbor.

12 MR. FLORES: Yes. In fact, Justice Scalia, if

13 this opinion by the Federal Circuit were interpreted to

14 hold that preclinical experiments are categorically

15 excluded from the scope of the exemption, that holding

16 would be inconsistent with the District Court's

17 interpretation of the law, because the District Court's

18 interpretation of the law was that preclinical experiments

19 are potentially eligible, and the District Court submitted

20 the question to the jury.

21 So the Federal Circuit would be completely

22 inconsistent, if, on the one hand, it categorically

23 excluded preclinical experiments, and, on the other hand,

24 it approved the District Court's reasoning.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: This very dialogue

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 makes me able to ask a question that I think will reveal

2 better to you what I need an answer to.

3 Reading this, and listening to the discussion,

4 and your use of the word "atmospherics," suggests that the

5 opinion below is pretty foggy. We have Merck, the Food

6 and Drug Administration, the Government, the entire

7 biotechnology industry, the drug industry of the United

8 States, and everybody else telling us that they are wrong

9 in the way they stated the standard. And you, yourself,

10 urge us to look beyond the way they stated it. So, what's

11 the harm, and why wouldn't we, given this and the

12 unclarity, just try to do a better job at stating the

13 standard, say, "That's the standard," and then send it

14 back, and then you can make all your arguments there about

15 how it applies.

16 MR. FLORES: Yes. The reason it would not be

17 appropriate for the Court to do so is because no standard,

18 other than the Intermedics standard that was applied by

19 the District Court, was ever suggested to the District

20 Court. There was only one standard ever considered.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We're not reviewing the

22 District Court's opinion. We granted certiorari as to the

23 particular question which will deal with what was the

24 Court of Appeals opinion. We don't ordinarily simply

25 compare the Court of Appeals' opinion with the District

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Court's opinion to see if they parse.

2 MR. FLORES: Yes, Your Honor. But in this case

3 the issue before the District Court was whether the

4 District Court erred in denying a motion for judgment as

5 a matter of law.

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, don't you think that

7 the Federal Circuit may have focused too much on generic

8 drug applications? Do you think it was right about that?

9 MR. FLORES: I think the Federal Circuit was

10 right, as a factual matter, in describing the impetus for

11 Congress adopting section 271(e).

12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it seemed to be driven

13 by its very narrow focus on generic drug development. Do

14 you -- do you think that the efficacy of the drug being

15 suggested plays a role in the IND application?

16 MR. FLORES: No, Your Honor, it does not.

17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: See, I think there may be a

18 difference there, because I think the other side thinks

19 that how the drug is expected to work, in practice, and

20 whether it, in fact, will attack a certain disease, is

21 part of what the FDA looks at. Apparently, the Government

22 takes that position, as narrowly as I could determine.

23 But you reject that, as well.

24 MR. FLORES: Yes, Your Honor. I think the

25 answer to that is in the statute. It's a -- it's section

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- it's 21 United States Code 355(i)(3)(B)(i). And in

2 that --

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can you repeat that 355 what?

4 MR. FLORES: (i) --

5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- (i) --

6 MR. FLORES: -- (3) --

7 -- (B)(i) again. And, in this

8 section, Congress is telling the FDA what are the

9 considerations that the FDA has to weigh in making the

10 safety decision, the decision whether to allow clinical

11 trials in humans --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this text that you're

13 referring to, is it someplace -- is the text someplace

14 where we can look at it while you're explaining this to

15 us?

16 MR. FLORES: No, Your Honor, it's not in the

17 appendix, unfortunately. Let me read that statute,

18 because it's instructive about what Congress told FDA to

19 weigh for the --

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But does the -- does the

21 statute -- is that the only place we would look to decide

22 whether safety is the only consideration for the FDA?

23 MR. FLORES: No, Your Honor. The regulations, I

24 believe, address that. And the regulations are 312.22(a),

25 which is in the appendix attached to Integra's brief on

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the merits. And I'll read that. It says --

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But you do --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: What are you --

4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- you do agree, do you not,

5 that the Government does not agree with you on this point?

6 MR. FLORES: The Government disagrees, Your

7 Honor.

8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: What are you reading from?

10 MR. FLORES: Page 3a in the addendum to

11 Integra's brief.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

13 MR. FLORES: That's 21 C.F.R. Section 312.22(a).

14 It states that, "The FDA's primary objectives in reviewing

15 an IND are, in all phases of the investigation, to assure

16 the safety and rights of subjects, and, in phase two and

17 three, to help assure that the quality of the scientific

18 investigation of the drugs is adequate to permit an

19 evaluation of the drug's effectiveness and safety."

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, that talks about the

21 primary concern. There is certainly going to be concern

22 with efficacy to this extent. They are going to want to

23 know, before they allow clinical trials, whether the drug

24 that it is proposed to give cancer patients has some

25 relationship to cancer, as opposed to the common cold.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Admittedly, at the clinical trial they're trying to find

2 out how effective it is on human beings, but there's got

3 to be some threshold showing of effectiveness. They can't

4 simply ignore effectiveness and look at safety entirely

5 prior to that point.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: In fact, that paragraph refers

7 to effectiveness, as I read it.

8 MR. FLORES: Yes, it does, Your Honor. But it

9 does -- it refers to it in the context of phases two and

10 three. And the simple fact is that until there's clinical

11 trials in humans, there's no way tell whether this drug is

12 going to be effective.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: But there is at least --

14 there's got to be some way to tell whether it even

15 addresses the disease. That is essentially a threshold

16 effectiveness question.

17 MR. FLORES: The FDA statutes and regulations do

18 not use the term "efficacy" to describe that. In section

19 355(i)(3)(B)(i), when Congress listed the factors to

20 consider, what it listed was not efficacy. Efficacy is

21 not to be found where its listed --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Congress described the need

23 that there be some relationship between the consequences

24 of taking the given drug and the disease which is supposed

25 to be addressed by taking the drug. If they didn't use

1 the word "efficacy," what word did they use?

2 MR. FLORES: They --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: They used the word

4 "effectiveness," which is pretty close.

5 [Laughter.]

6 MR. FLORES: No, Your Honor, they used the word,

7 in the statute, "the condition for which the drug is to be

8 investigated."

9 JUSTICE BREYER: That's important. They say they

10 want to know the pharmacological action of the drug in

11 relation to its proposed therapeutic indication. The

12 reason, I take it, the word "efficacy" is not there

13 directly is because that word has a history, the Kefauver

14 hearings, and it was involving drugs that don't do

15 anything. Safety is a different matter. But of course

16 when you consider whether something is safe, you must

17 know, since, for example, cancer drugs poison people, the

18 extent to which that poisoning is outbalanced by its

19 effect in curing people. So how could you possibly,

20 particularly where cancer is at issue, know whether this

21 is an appropriately safe drug, without knowing how

22 effective it is, as well as knowing the side effects that

23 are -- that are harmful? If I knew that there was any

24 answer to that question at all, I might be tempted to

25 agree with you, because it doesn't use the word. But

1 what's the answer?

2 MR. FLORES: The answer is that the FDA

3 considers what information is available to it. It does

4 not have information about the effectiveness of the drug,

5 because clinical trials have not taken place; and,

6 therefore, the regulations and the statutes say you do the

7 -- what you can. You look at the condition for which the

8 drug --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why wouldn't it have

10 information about effectiveness on animals? I mean, if

11 the -- you show that the -- all the FDA's interested in is

12 that it didn't kill the animal, never mind whether it was

13 effective to cure the tumor?

14 MR. FLORES: The FDA is concerned with safety in

15 animals. And there may be some cases in which there is a

16 known safety risk to a drug, and there will be a

17 heightened look at potential benefits in order to balance

18 that out. But the regulations focus on safety. And in

19 this particular case --

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but it's absolutely

21 clear, I thought, that the FDA, at the end of the day in

22 some of these drug applications, ends up looking at not

23 only safety, but how effective it is. And sometimes if

24 the safety risk is minimal but the effectiveness is great,

25 I understood at least, that could affect the decisions.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 So, I would think that you would want to encourage the

2 exemption to cover those matters.

3 MR. FLORES: Your Honor, of course FDA is very

4 concerned about efficacy, and it -- but concerned about

5 that after it gets data from human clinical trials.

6 That's the -- that is the basis of --

7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I'm not sure. If there's

8 data earlier, at the IND stage, as a result of the lab tests

9 and the animal tests, I would think that would be part of

10 the exemption.

11 MR. FLORES: If efficacy -- or some information

12 about what benefits the drug might have, is probably a

13 better way to phrase it -- is considered at the safety

14 stage as part of the safety balancing, then it's got to be

15 done under good laboratory practices, because --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that we concluded --

17 well, I don't want to cut you off. Go ahead, please. If I

18 cut you off.

19 MR. FLORES: Yes. If -- I believe the Solicitor

20 General's point is that the safety decision is a practical

21 one, and you've got to look at both sides of the ledger --

22 potential harm, potential benefit -- I don't believe it's

23 proper to call that "efficacy." But whatever you call it,

24 if it's part of the safety balancing it has to be done

25 under good laboratory procedures. That, I think, is clear

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 from the FDA regulations. And, as a matter of policy, it

2 wouldn't make any sense for the FDA to say that half of

3 the safety equation need not be done under good laboratory

4 practices. Both parts of the safety equation have to be

5 done under that.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- so what? I don't

7 understand what conclusion that leads to.

8 MR. FLORES: Well, Justice Scalia, let me say

9 that I think that this whole discussion about the

10 interpretation of the FDA law is really somewhat off the

11 point here.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I was beginning to think that,

13 too.

14 [Laughter.]

15 MR. FLORES: And the reason I say that is

16 because we're not here to judge the legality of an FDA

17 action in its discretion, saying we want to consider

18 preclinical --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but the reason you

20 brought it up is because the particular certificate that

21 is for a safety-certified lab is not applicable to the lab

22 that used this stuff. That's why you brought it up, I

23 think.

24 MR. FLORES: That is correct.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: And I understand that. And

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you'd have to conclude, for them to win -- but suppose I

2 did conclude -- suppose, for hypothetical -- the sake of

3 -- for -- as a hypothetical, suppose I thought, yes, this

4 does include the safety part, looking at how effective

5 drugs are, too. Suppose I concluded that the statute

6 meant sometimes you could do that, in an ordinary

7 laboratory that didn't have the special certificate?

8 Suppose I concluded that, indeed, you could look well in

9 advance of the clinical test period to get the information

10 for the IND? And suppose I concluded that sometimes,

11 where it was reasonably related, you could, in fact, look

12 at other drugs, too, that are related to the ones you do.

13 If I concluded that -- and I'm not saying I would -- then

14 would you concede that a directed verdict would have been

15 appropriate against you?

16 MR. FLORES: No, Your Honor.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Because? And what's your

18 strongest argument that it wouldn't?

19 MR. FLORES: Well, Your Honor, there's numerous

20 admissions in the record that Merck made which would

21 indicate that they've -- that the program carried out at

22 Scripps was not reasonably related to the FDA, that the

23 real FDA work was being done in Germany, that the majority

24 of these experiments conducted by Scripps were conducted

25 on chicken embryos, which Merck's own scientists agree

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 have nothing to do with safety, and, by logical extension,

2 they can't tell you much about efficacy, either. Merck

3 agreed that a significant portion of these experiments in

4 which Merck was looking for non-peptide compounds as

5 possible drug candidates, is something that --

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, we don't -- I hope we

7 don't have to, at this Court, look at all the evidence and

8 try to sort it out that way. What we have to focus on is

9 whether the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was

10 in error in articulating the scope of the exemption.

11 MR. FLORES: Your Honor, this Court does not

12 have to get into Rule 50 review of the evidence here --

13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.

14 MR. FLORES: -- because there's no dispute about

15 the legal standard. We've all heard that this morning.

16 The only other possible issue is Rule 50 review. But

17 Merck has failed --

18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I thought the issue was

19 whether the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit

20 correctly determined the scope of the exemption. If they

21 were wrong about it, then it is open to us to correct that

22 and send it back.

23 MR. FLORES: Your Honor, the Federal Circuit

24 didn't determine the scope of the invention. There's --

25 it's --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Exemption. The statutory

2 exemption. I thought that was what we were looking at.

3 MR. FLORES: Yes, that's what I was referring

4 to. The Federal Circuit didn't articulate a standard for

5 that. The Federal Circuit approved the District Court's

6 use of the Intermedics standard, under which preclinical

7 experiments are potentially --

8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but it certainly thought

9 that the FDA considers only safety, and nothing else, that

10 it was directed at generic drugs, not others, and that

11 there was a cutoff point earlier than that argued by the

12 Government and the Petitioner for what is exempt

13 preclinical trial information.

14 MR. FLORES: The Federal Circuit's opinion, I

15 believe -- the Federal Circuit's opinion rejects the

16 rational predicate theory. It does not articulate an

17 alternative standard to that. It merely ----

18 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: They spent about ten

19 pages in the appendix trying to do that.

20 MR. FLORES: But Federal Circuit didn't do that.

21 That was discussion in there. It gave a lot of background

22 about the statute, which may not have been necessary for

23 its ultimate holding. But the Federal Circuit, when it

24 comes down to it, didn't do anything other than approve

25 the District Court's interpretation.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Now, if the Federal Circuit did something

2 different than that, which we just -- which is -- Integra

3 does not believe is the case, its judgment should be

4 upheld on the grounds articulated, that it could discern

5 no error in the District Court's judgment -- in the

6 District Court's denial of Merck's motion for judgment as

7 a matter of law.

8 To respond to one of Justice O'Connor's earlier

9 questions, "Does this Court have to get into a Rule 50

10 review," the answer is no, because Merck failed to

11 preserve its right to Rule 50 review. In the District

12 Court, in the Federal Circuit, the -- Merck argued the

13 rational predicate standard as a matter of law. That was

14 rejected.

15 Rule 50 review, under the Intermedics standard,

16 is an entirely different argument, and Merck never raised

17 that argument in -- before the Federal Circuit. In its

18 brief, Merck relies, on pages 50 and 51 of its brief to

19 the Federal Circuit, saying there it argued substantial

20 evidence. But what it argued there was, the experiments

21 are rational predicates. Merck never argued, before the

22 Federal Circuit, that the verdict can't be sustained under

23 Rule 50, under the Intermedics standard, as opposed to the

24 rational predicate standard, so it's not entitled to that

25 review here.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The dissenting judge did not

2 -- the dissenting judge, Judge Newman, did not read the

3 Court's opinion the way you do. Is that correct?

4 MR. FLORES: That is correct, Your Honor.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe we should take that

6 into account, to some extent, that someone who

7 participated on the bench had a different take on what her

8 colleagues were saying?

9 MR. FLORES: That is certainly a consideration,

10 but we disagree with Judge Newman on that point.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a difference between

12 you and Merck concerning the scope and extent of the

13 common law research exemption? And if there is, does that

14 even enter into our case?

15 MR. FLORES: That issue hasn't entered into the

16 case, so there's been no differences articulated, Your

17 Honor.

18 And to get back to the point that Merck did not

19 preserve its right to Rule 50 review under the Intermedics

20 standard, even if it had raised that issue before the

21 Federal Circuit, clearly the Federal Circuit didn't reach

22 that issue. And if the Federal Circuit didn't reach an

23 issue that was properly presented before it, that was

24 error, and Merck would have had to seek relief from that

25 error. And it did not do so in its petition for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 certiorari. So, I do not believe this Court even needs to

2 address the issue of Rule 50 review.

3 There is no dispute in this case as to the

4 substantive standard that governs the scope of Section

5 271(e)(1), and Merck, having failed to preserve its rights

6 to Rule 50 review under the Intermedics standard, there

7 his no controversy for this Court to decide.

8 If the Court does reach the issue of Rule 50

9 review under Intermedics, it is -- the case should be

10 decided under the basic principles that it is the

11 exclusive province of the jury to weigh the evidence and

12 to determine the credibility of the witnesses.

13 And my time is up, but -- almost -- but I'll say

14 one thing. After 25 days of trial, the District Judge, in

15 his denial of Merck's motion for judgment as a matter of

16 law, expressly said that the jury had reasonable cause to

17 disregard the testimony of Merck's main witness, Dr.

18 Cheresh. And, on that ground alone, the judgment of

19 the Federal Circuit should be sustained. Merck can't be

20 rescued from the jury's verdict unless this Court

21 determines, as a matter of law, that the jury was required

22 to believe the testimony of Dr. Cheresh. And Merck can't

23 show that, and hasn't even attempted to show that.

24 Unless there are any questions --

1 Mr. Rosenkranz, you have two minutes remaining.

2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

3 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.

5 With my two minutes, I want to make one

6 overarching important point, and it's really in response

7 to a question Justice Scalia asked.

8 The emphasis in the statute is about the use, so

9 let's get past labels about, Is this drug discovery or

10 basic research, or is it, as Merck says, optimization on

11 the lead drug candidate, and look at exactly what was

12 occurring here. Here, this was not a, "Gee, we'd like to

13 see what affects angiogenesis." Merck knew what affected

14 angiogenesis. It had a structure. And if you look at

15 page 42 of the supplemental appendix, you will see that

16 structure. It knew exactly what that structure did and

17 how it did it. It then tweaked it by changing, literally,

18 three atoms to compare that activity with other activity,

19 exactly the sorts of research that any drug innovator

20 would do to verify that they have the best and most

21 effective candidate. Then, with -- and with every single

22 one of its experiments, it was examining information that

23 was relevant to mechanism of action, pharmacology,

24 pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. With 10 percent of the

25 experiments, it was also running them in parallel with a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 series of analogs that were designed to look exactly like

2 the RGD peptides, and to work exactly like the RGD

3 peptides. And no rational drug innovator ever proceeds to

4 clinical trials, nor does the FDA want it to, without

5 conducting that research, because you don't spend millions

6 of dollars for expensive toxicology studies until you know

7 you've got the safest and most effective drug candidate.

8 The FDA reviews that evidence, because it wants to know

9 why you're proceeding with that candidate. And if you

10 shift midstream to another lead, as Merck, in fact, did in

11 this very case, the FDA wants to understand why.

12 So each of those experiments, even in

13 comparison, developed information that is relevant to the

14 FDA.

15 Thank you, Your Honors.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.

17 Rosenkranz. The case is submitted.

19 above-entitled matter was submitted.]
