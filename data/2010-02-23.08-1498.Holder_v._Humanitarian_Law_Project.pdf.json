    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This as-applied challenge asks whether the government can make it a crime for Ralph Fertig and the Humanitarian Law Project to speak in association with the Kurdistan Workers Party. Specifically, they seek to advocate for legal reform in Congress and the UN, to write and distribute articles supportive of Kurdish rights, to inform the Kurds of their international human rights and remedies, and to advise them on peaceful conflict resolution. It is undisputed that the Kurdistan Workers Party engages in a wide range of lawful activities and that plaintiffs seek to support only lawful ends. The government has a concededly compelling interest in combatting terrorism, yet it has not even tried to defend these prohibitions under strict scrutiny. Instead, it rests its entire case on the proposition that criminalizing plaintiffs' speech is a regulation of conduct, not speech, and therefore can be upheld under O'Brien. That view is mistaken for two fundamental reasons. First, as this Court has already held, O'Brien is inapplicable where the government prohibits pure speech --"

    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Right. Yes. It’s core -- and I think the reason, Your Honor, is it is core political speech on issues of public concern. It is advocating only lawful, peaceable activities. This Court has never upheld the criminal prohibition of lawful speech on issues of public concern."

I think for -- in order to apply -- to decide this case, Your Honor, all the Court has to find is that when the speech advocates solely lawful, peaceable activities of the sort advocated here, that's not sufficient. I think specific -- we've suggested a specific intent standard, which is lower than Brandenburg, would be appropriate --"

The Nazis have a hospital, and you are giving them advice on how to run a hospital, but the government decides that anything that legitimizes the Nazi Party, you know, promotes that group's terrorist activities.

    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

Well, I think all the Court held in Regan and Zemel was that it is permissible for the government to regulate conduct -- not speech -- travel, and economic transactions, not speech. Those were essentially O'Brien cases. And, in fact, in Regan the Court distinguished a prohibition on travel to Cuba across the board from a prohibition directed at a group, the Communist Party, in the Kent and Aptheker cases, where the Court held that --"

The individual who seeks to engage in that conduct says, I want to do it for speech purposes. But the Court says the government has a freer hand in regulating conduct than speech, and, therefore, as long as you’re regulating the non-expressive element of the conduct, we'll apply O'Brien. But what this Court has said is that when --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "No, but the whole point of the Cuba -- the Cuba travel cases is that -- again, as this Court said, it was an across-the-board ban. It did not apply to different political groups. It applied to anyone who sought to travel to Cuba. And it was about travel."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Right. Well, with respect to the hypothetical, I think the question, Your Honor, would be whether the government's interest in banning that travel is unrelated to the associational or speech purposes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "It's what the Chief Justice says: In any context, support ultimately will inure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we have a governmental interest in not allowing that."

  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "There's no -- there’s no dispute, Your Honor, that the government has a compelling interest in cutting off aid to terrorism. The question is whether it can do so by criminalizing pure speech."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, it hasn't criminalized speech. It has criminalized providing aid and assistance to these organizations. Most of that aid and assistance that is prohibited is not in the form of speech, but it happens to include speech as well."

  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Right, but, Justice Scalia --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Well, I don’t -- I think it's not in this -- in this sense, Justice Scalia. Imagine a statute that banned aid to overthrow the United States Government. And it had three provisions: One, you can't assassinate the president; two, you can't provide bombs and weapons to groups attempting to overthrow the government; three, you can't advocate overthrow of the government. If that were applied to someone for speaking in advocacy, we wouldn't say it's a regulation of speech."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "That's not the right -- that's not the right number three. The right number three is you cannot advise and assist an organization that is seeking to overthrow the government. That's what is at issue here, not --"

    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Well, but --"
  },

    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "-- not independently promoting the objectives of these terrorist organizations. Your -- your clients are free to do that."

  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "But when they assist the organization by providing advice, that's a different matter."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Well, the government says if they -- even if they speak in conjunction with the group, they -- and they’re providing a benefit to the government, that's prohibited. So, for example --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Okay. When they provide a benefit, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "So, for example, under that view, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the L.A. Times, all of which published op-eds by Hamas spokespersons -- Hamas is on the list -- thereby providing a benefit to Hamas, working with the Hamas spokesperson, they’re all criminals. President Carter --"

  {
    "speaker": "COLE",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "No, no. No, no. I thought that he was -- he wants to meet with the people. The New York Times didn't meet with Hamas to tell them how great their editorial was."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "No, but it's not about -- it's not about whether you meet with them. It's about whether you coordinate with them, and they've certainly coordinated with the Hamas spokesperson in editing and accepting and then publishing his editorial. That is -- that would be providing a service. It would --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "It depends on what \"coordinating\" means, doesn't it? And we can determine that in the next case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Well, let me -- let me also answer it this way, Justice Scalia: If you look at the specific speech which our clients seek to engage in, it includes writing and distributing literature in conjunction with the Kurdistan Workers Party in the United States advocating their support. How is that different from the New York Times?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Supposing that -- what you say is you want to engage in political advocacy on behalf of the Kurds. That's your words. All right. Suppose -- and these are two hypotheticals. Hypothetical one, your clients, let's say, or some other people, know that what the Kurds' hypothetical plan is, is to pretend they're a political advocacy organization, but to go around shooting the people who don't agree with them. Okay? Case one, the hypothetical defendant knows it. In case two, he doesn't know it, but it's true."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Well, I think -- I think if you -- if you specifically intend and know that your aid will further the group in its terrorist activities, then it's not protected speech. But if you're -- if you don't know that and you don't intend that, and in this case --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "And that goes for all forms of training? No form of training or expert assistance can be prohibited unless the individual specifically intends to further -- that the training will be used to carry out terrorist activities?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Alito, this is an as-applied challenge. So the question simply is whether training in what international human rights consist of, in how to advocate for international human rights, and how to advocate politically in Congress and other bodies. That's the speech that's at issue here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, just out of curiosity, I thought your position was that no form of training or assistance could be prohibited -- -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "No, I was just --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "-- consistent with the First Amendment. That's not your position?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "No. I think -- I think, again, it depends upon the form of speech. There may be some forms of training that are so closely connected to the -- to the end that Congress seeks to -- legitimately seeks to proscribe, like training in bombmaking or training in military exercises."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "The end that Congress seeks to proscribe is the existence of these terrorist organizations. And the theory of the legislation is that when you aid any of their enterprises you’re aiding the organization. Hamas, for example, gained support among -- among the Palestinians by activities that are perfectly lawful, perhaps running hospitals, all sorts of things."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "But that is what fosters the terrorist organization and enables the terrorist activities. Why isn't that a reasonable connection? Any assistance you provide to these organizations cannot be separated from assistance to their terrorist activities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Right. Well, Your Honor, that is precisely the argument that the United States made to this Court in Scales. And here I’m quoting from the government's brief: \"Active membership can be proscribed even though the activity be expended along lines not otherwise illegal, since active support of any kind aids the organization in achieving its own illegal purposes.\" That was with respect to an organization that Congress spent 10 years studying, made findings that it was an international conspiracy directed and controlled by the Soviet Union with the aim of overthrowing the United States by force and violence, using terrorism. And, nonetheless, this Court in Scales held you've got to distinguish between that aid and support and membership which is furthering the lawful activities and that which is furthering the illegal activities; otherwise you are penalizing the exercise of lawful speech. The Court said the same thing in De Jonge."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Cole, as I remember, Scales upheld a conviction, wasn’t --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "It did, Justice Ginsburg, but only because it interpreted the statute to be -- to be limited to specific -- to members -- active membership that is specifically intended to further the illegal ends of the group, precisely --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "But it didn’t -- it was not a statute which involves banning financial or other tangible support, and page 17 of your brief made -- this is a difficult case for me. And the second paragraph, page 17, you say: \"The narrow focus of plaintiffs' claims in this Court means that the case does not involve the propriety of banning financial or other tangible support.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Right. JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then you say: \"Nor does it involve speech advocating or teaching criminal or violent activity.\" But it does involve speech, let's say arguendo, that is tantamount to material support."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Well, I -- right, but --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Suppose the speech is tantamount to material support in that it legitimizes, encourages, or strengthens the organization."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Well, two things in response to that, Justice Kennedy. First, that is what the United States argued in Scales. And, again, the Court, not only in Scales but in a host of cases striking down Communist Party statute, said you have to distinguish between aid that’s intended to further lawful activity and aid that’s intended to further illegal activity when it's in the form of protected activity -- association, here speech and association. And, secondly --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "In those cases, the real question was whether membership was enough, wasn’t it?"

  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "Yes."

    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "-- which the government says constitutes more than mere nominal membership."

  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "And this is support. It's different."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, in De Jonge, one of these cases, one of this Court's first First Amendment cases, the government argued that Mr. De Jonge aided the Communist Party in its illegal ends by conducting a meeting for them and being their lead speaker at the meeting. And this Court said: We've got to look at what he did, and what -- yes, he conducted the meeting; yes, he was a member of the Communist Party; yes, he solicited people to join the Communist Party. But what did he do? He advocated lawful peaceable activities. And this Court said --"

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "And here there is, and this is in aid of that prohibition."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Right, but Your Honor, what would -- if Congress came along after the Communist Party cases and said, okay, you've said we can't make it a crime to criminalize membership in the Communist Party; we are now going to make it a crime to speak in conjunction with the Communist Party -- do you think the decisions would have come out any differently? I don't think so, because this Court has said that speech is different from money, that it --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "I think it's very unrealistic to compare these terrorist organizations with the Communist Party. Those cases involved philosophy. The Communist Party was -- was -- was more than a -- than an organization that -- that had some unlawful ends. It was also a philosophy of -- of -- of extreme socialism. And -- and many people subscribed to that philosophy. I don't think that Hamas or any of these terrorist organizations represent such a philosophical organization."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Your Honor, this -- this Court accepted Congress's findings. Congress's findings were not that this was a philosophical debating society, but that it was an international criminal conspiracy directed by our enemy to overthrow us through terrorism."

    "speaker": "SCALIA",

The Humanitarian Law Project has no interest in furthering terrorism, but the Kurdistan Workers Party are the principal representatives of the -- of the Kurds in Turkey.

I think the Al-Qaeda was one instance that was mentioned, and, at least according to the briefs, you conceded that if you wanted to do just what you describe with respect to the Kurdish group or the Tamil group, the ban would be permissible, if the group -- if the group were Al-Qaeda, and I’ll throw in the Taliban."
  },

What the statute does is to prohibit Petitioners from giving support to foreign terrorist organizations in their ability to petition international organizations. And that's a very different thing. It's a different thing for several reasons. First, remember that these are foreign organizations, and as several of you have suggested, the ability of Congress and of the Executive Branch to regulate the relationships between Americans and foreign governments or foreign organization has long been acknowledged by this Court. It was acknowledged in cases like Regan and Zemel and others, not only with respect to nations with which we are at war, but with respect to foreign nations and other entities as well -- foreign nationals. And in fact, the Petitioners' supposed First Amendment claims really are not speech claims at all. They are all association claims. Petitioners can do whatever independent advocacy they wish. What Petitioners cannot do is to provide support to a foreign terrorist organization.

First, because with respect to overbreadth, all of those uncertain or even unconstitutional applications will be but a thimbleful, compared to the ocean full of completely legitimate applications of this statute. And, second, because those hypotheticals have nothing to do with this case. Mr. Cole said several times, I heard, this is an as-applied challenge, this is an as-applied challenge. And to the extent that the Court thinks that there are certain categories of activity that the statute could not prohibit that would raise serious constitutional concerns -- which I must say I -- I disagree with, but there may be some.

    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "They say in this case that they want to provide training in the issue of humanitarian international law, and they want to provide training and expert advice and assistance in respect to how you petition the UN. Now focusing on those two things, and going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, why -- what is the government's interest in the following? Under O'Brien or any other test, you look at it and say, does teaching have a First Amendment interest -- training? Yes. And what about teaching about advocacy? That's what they are doing, teaching about a certain kind of advocacy. Yes. Therefore there is a First Amendment interest implicated, seriously. Now, when that is seriously implicated, there is also a government interest, on the other side, in not having terrorism. But there is a less restrictive alternative which they suggest, that in that situation, what they're entitled to read this statute as saying is that, if they believe and a person reasonably would believe that their teaching, assistance, training, would not significantly aid this organization in its unlawful ends, then they are not guilty. Now, what is the government's interest in not accepting that interpretation? The First Amendment is hurt; there is an interest; but there is what they describe as -- and what I have narrowed -- a less restrictive way of going about it. And they have to be reasonable in what they think. Now, what's the objection to that?"

    "speaker": "KAGAN",

And Congress reasonably decided that when you help a terrorist -- foreign terrorist organization's legal activities, you’re also helping the foreign terrorist organization's illegal activities. Hezbollah builds bombs. Hezbollah also builds homes. What Congress decided was when you help Hezbollah build homes, you are also helping Hezbollah build bombs. That's the entire theory behind this statute, and it's a reasonable theory for exactly the kinds of reasons that Justice Kennedy was suggesting by that hypothetical."

If you attended a meeting and you helped to arrange the chairs in advance or clean up afterwards, you’d be providing a service to the organization."

And --"

And, indeed, the government, as we discussed in our brief, believes that there are certain kinds of joint activities that would be allowed by the statute. Now, that's not to say that Congress could not have gone farther. In this specific context, where one is regulating dealings with a foreign organization, it's possible that Congress could have gone further.

We should look to the activities that this organization wants to conduct, unless -- unless you think that there is an overbreadth problem. And that seems to me -- I'm not even sure that the Petitioners assert that here. Clearly, the -- the broad scope of this statute is -- is constitutional, and whatever aspects of speech it may run afoul of are -- are minimal. That being the case, of what relevance are these hypotheticals? It's a lot of fun, and it's very interesting, but we can deal with all of that when the situations arise, can't we?"

The court of appeals specifically said it's not vague on its face, and there is no facial vagueness claim here, and yet they appeared to incorporate aspects of overbreadth analysis into their as-applied claim. I think --"

This is, of course, a case that might never have reached this Court, except that it was brought as a declaratory judgment action.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Again, the government did not bring this action. Judge Fertig and the Petitioners brought this action to try to get a declaratory judgment. As applied to them, the statute indeed covers their various efforts or proposed activities of being an agent of, of representing the PKK and the LTTE, that falls within the statute and I think makes the as-applied claim here not vague at all."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to start by addressing the question of strict scrutiny. The -- the -- Justice Kennedy, you asked, and a number of the Justices asked, doesn't it make a difference that what they've done is prohibited a wide range of conduct and just some of that is speech? Well, that's precisely an accurate description of the breach of the peace statute in Cohen v. California. It forbade breaches of peace through loud noises, through horse racing in the streets, through any kind of offensive conduct. But when California applied that statute to the words on Mr. Cohen's jacket and then argued because we are not interested in the words on his jacket, we are interested in preserving the peace, however it’s breached, O'Brien should apply, the Court said no. We deal here with the conviction resting solely upon speech, not upon any separately identifiable conduct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "I -- I agree. And that was as applied to a conviction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "I just haven't seen an as-applied challenge on declaratory relief. The government doesn't seem to object to that procedure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "No. Well, the government doesn't object because there are actually many cases, and FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life is only the most recent. But, again, the notion is somebody who is told you can meet with a group, you can discuss with a group -- in fact, the House report says that you are free to speak with and on behalf of a designated group. But then you have a statute that says, if you advocate in any coordinated way, if you tell them anything that’s derived from specialized knowledge, if you tell them anything of specific skill, you're -- you're engaged in a crime and you could go to jail for 15 years. That's why the Humanitarian Law Project came to me. They said: We’ve been doing this kind of lawful activity. We think it's our right, but we’re not going to risk going to jail for 15 years to do it. The government has spent a decade arguing that our clients cannot advocate for peace, cannot inform about international human rights."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",

Now --"
  },

    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "No, and, in fact, the government has never even attempted to defend the statute under strict scrutiny, because I think it clearly could not satisfy strict scrutiny. And under this -- under Cohen, strict scrutiny is what must be applied here. In addition --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, why don't -- why don't we remand it to the lower courts to apply strict scrutiny if we agree with you that O'Brien doesn't apply here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COLE",
    "speech": "I think it would be appropriate to remand for -- for application of strict scrutiny if you read it that O'Brien doesn't apply. O'Brien also doesn't apply if the statute is not content neutral. This is a statute that doesn't bar all aid; it doesn't even bar all speech. It permits unlimited provision of religious materials, even if they advocate jihad, but proscribes any secular material, even if they are advocating peace. So -- so there are -- the -- the lower court, again, found that the statute was vague, that our clients were reasonably chilled, that they had a right to engage in this activity. I think you can reach that result either through vagueness, or you can reach it by applying strict scrutiny, or I think because the fit is so poor here, and because -- and the vagueness, in fact, undermines the fit, because people are chilled from engaging even in speech that the government doesn't want to prohibit. All right, if I am told you -- you -- you’ll go to jail if you tell them anything that’s derived from special --"
