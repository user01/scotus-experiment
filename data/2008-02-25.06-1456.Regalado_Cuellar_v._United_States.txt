1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:02 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument first 4 today in Case 06-1456, Cuellar versus United States. 5 Mr. Beard. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY V. BEARD 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. BEARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 9 and may it please the Court: 10 Section 1956, the money laundering statute, 11 requires an intent to minimize the criminal taint of 12 unlawful proceeds. But the statute does not criminalize 13 concealing money's existence. In this case, 14 Mr. Cuellar's conviction should be reversed for two 15 reasons. First, while the method of the transportation 16 involved may have been designed to conceal, the 17 transportation itself was not. Secondly, while Cuellar 18 may have in fact concealed money itself, he did not 19 conceal the nature, source, location, ownership or 20 control of the unlawful proceeds. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he certainly 22 concealed the location. They were secreted in the car, 23 under the goat hair and everything else. The location 24 of the money was certainly concealed. 25 MR. BEARD: Chief Justice, in the broader
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 sense location was concealed. The point to be taken 2 here I think is this: An examination of the text itself 3 reveals particular listed attributes, and location 4 numbers among them. But what this suggests, the 5 requirement that there be a design to conceal or to 6 disguise these particular attributes, necessarily means 7 a plan, if you will, for those -- excuse me -- for those 8 attributes to be presented either to law enforcement if 9 they intercept the money or inject it into legitimate 10 commerce later. In other words, they'll be observed 11 later. Location has independent meaning, but it's also 12 understood within the context of the words that surround 13 it. All money changes location, whether concealed or 14 not. Location in this context means more than the 15 location that the money was found in the car. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe I should ask you this 17 now because you've probably thought about it and I can't 18 work it out. I don't see any problem with the word 19 "location." I thought what you would say is it isn't 20 the transportation in this instance that concealed the 21 location, it's the method of transportation that sealed 22 the location. 23 MR. BEARD: Yes, Justice -24 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you read it that 25 literally, then there is no problem in getting to your
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 interpretation of the statute, or is there? Because 2 since you didn't advance that argument, I thought maybe 3 there's something I've not seen here. 4 MR. BEARD: No, Justice Breyer; you're 5 correct. There is a huge difference between the method 6 of transportation and the transportation itself. And in 7 this particular case, the difference is certainly 8 implicated. What we understand the government to be 9 arguing is that the method of the transportation 10 signifies the listed attributes. But if that were the 11 case it would effectively render all transportation of 12 funds necessarily to be money laundering. 13 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask, what do 14 you mean by method of transportation in this case? I 15 mean, that it was in a car or the fact it was wrapped up 16 in dirty -- in a dirty kind of container, and so forth 17 and so on? 18 MR. BEARD: Justice Stevens, what I'm 19 referring to is certainly that it was in a car, but 20 there was a secret compartment, goat hair was sprinkled 21 around to try to throw off drug detection dogs, and 22 those type of characteristics. 23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't that all just 24 evidence that there was a motive to conceal the 25 ownership?

1 MR. BEARD: No, I don't think so, 2 Justice Stevens. What we're looking at here is that the 3 design of the -- the fact Mr. Cuellar may or may not 4 have known, for example, who owned -- where the money 5 was coming from or who owned it, that doesn't go to the 6 design of the transportation. The design of the 7 transportation itself is just to get the money to 8 Mexico. I can say that abstractly, but in this case in 9 particular because we know from the government's 10 evidence that what this was was essentially the last leg 11 of a drug trafficking deal. We know that this was 12 repayment. So in this particular case at least, the 13 purpose of this transportation was to get this money 14 back as repayment money. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If he were a courier 16 bringing the marijuana into the United States what would 17 be the crime and the penalty? 18 MR. BEARD: Justice, if he was bringing -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If he was bringing 20 marijuana into the United States instead of returning 21 with the proceeds? 22 MR. BEARD: Well, presumably, Your Honor, it 23 would be a drug trafficking crime. But of course, as I 24 understand your hypothetical, he would possess marijuana 25 at that time.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now he possesses 2 money. And you're not saying this is innocent behavior. 3 It is criminal behavior, so what is the crime if not 4 money laundering? 5 MR. BEARD: We have suggested that 6 Mr. Cuellar's, liability, liability or culpability, lie 7 more properly under the bulk cash smuggling statute. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that requires knowing 9 that it's illegal to take out more than X amount of 10 money, and there's nothing that indicates that the 11 common courier would know anything about such a 12 provision. 13 MR. BEARD: Yes, you're correct that it 14 would require inference as opposed to direct evidence. 15 This is why in our reply brief, we gave an example of 16 where the identical type behavior arose, not in Texas 17 but in Alabama, and in fact the individual pleaded 18 guilty to bulk cash smuggling. 19 So I suppose my response would be this. The 20 same weak inferences that supported the money laundering 21 conviction in the government's eyes would be the same 22 inferences that would support the cash smuggling. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we take it that you 24 concede -- I don't want to say that you concede. If we 25 take it the government has a strong case under the
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 smuggling statute, wouldn't it have an equally strong 2 case under (i) of the statute that we're considering 3 here, which doesn't require concealing or disguising the 4 nature, just to avoid a transportation reporting 5 requirement. That's the same as the smuggling statute. 6 MR. BEARD: No, I don't think -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know the government 8 didn't indict under (ii). 9 MR. BEARD: But I don't think it is the 10 same, Your Honor, because the cash smuggling, the bulk 11 cash smuggling statute, speaks to currency and of course 12 this speaks to transactions. So I think that there 13 is in fact -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean as the proceeds 15 of an illegal transaction? 16 MR. BEARD: Well, I'm distinguishing between 17 currency and transaction because as I understand it at 18 least transaction might implicate in a banking context, 19 but cash is cash, if you will. So -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it doesn't matter for 21 purposes of the bulk cash statute that it was illegal. 22 It could be perfectly lawful money. 23 MR. BEARD: Yes, Your Honor, absolutely. 24 That's certainly true. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why -- why isn't
8

1 this transporting to conceal the location or the 2 ownership in this sense? Suppose you have someone the 3 police suspect of engaging in drug activities. They 4 know he sold, you know, so much marijuana or whatever 5 and got cash back. They think it's there, and they're 6 going to investigate it, but this fellow comes in and 7 they transport the proceeds across the border. 8 Isn't that transportation to conceal the 9 location or the ownership? 10 MR. BEARD: As I understand it, Mr. Chief 11 Justice, if the police are aware of it and then the 12 flush, if you will, takes the money across, I think 13 that's -- that's much closer. That's -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they think 15 it's there, but they're not sure, and they -- you know, 16 that would help them make their case, to find out that 17 the guy they think sold the drugs has $80,000. So they 18 get a search warrant or whatever, and it turns out he 19 doesn't, because it's been transported to conceal the 20 location or ownership. 21 MR. BEARD: I would -- no, I think that 22 the -- if the police were aware, if the police were 23 aware and the kingpin were aware and put in place some 24 type of design, if you will, to flush the money and 25 perhaps to -- to Mexico under the circumstances you
9

1 described, then you would be closer to, to having money 2 laundering liability, although certainly I don't know 3 that the courier necessarily would. 4 However, I think it's very important to 5 consider that the money laundering statute necessarily 6 contemplates this notion of -- of detection or the money 7 resurfacing, if you will. And the reason I think that's 8 important is because it gives a particular meaning to 9 those listed attributes. If the police were just -10 well, in this case, just stumbled upon it, and nothing 11 was -- had been done and there was no evidence on the 12 record to suggest that there was going to be anything 13 done in this case other than repayment, money laundering 14 liability is simply not going to arise. 15 Now, I think that -16 JUSTICE BREYER: I still don't see why isn't 17 what the Chief Justice said absolutely right? If you 18 are transporting this money to get it out of town so the 19 police can't find it, you're transporting it to conceal 20 it. That falls right within the statute. 21 MR. BEARD: I -22 JUSTICE BREYER: If you're transporting it 23 simply to pay some courier somewhere else, you're not 24 transporting it to conceal it. And if in fact the 25 transportation is done in a way that conceals it, that's
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 beside the point because the statute is interested in 2 transporting it in order to conceal it. 3 MR. BEARD: I think that -4 JUSTICE BREYER: What is wrong with that? 5 MR. BEARD: I think what's wrong, Your 6 Honor, is that the -- the statute focuses on the 7 transportation or some of the other transfers of 8 transmission and specifically is coupled, if you will, 9 with this notion of -- of the attributes themselves. I 10 don't know that it's -- it's simply too broad, in fact, 11 to say that all transportation's will necessarily incur 12 the money laundering liability. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- maybe I don't 14 understand the -- I thought he was helping you, but 15 maybe -16 (Laughter.) 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Were you helping him? I 18 thought so. 19 (Laughter.) 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It sounds like he was 21 making the distinction that didn't the dissenting judge 22 make between -- the dissenting judge says transporting 23 to conceal is no good, but concealing to transport is 24 okay. 25 MR. BEARD: That -- you're correct, Your
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Honor, and that is, I think, a point to be made. The -2 Judge Smith below did try to highlight the fact that if 3 you transport to conceal, then you're beginning to 4 implicate money laundering liability. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose someone transports 6 money across a border and is recorded surreptitiously on 7 tape explaining exactly why the person did it, and the 8 person says: The reason why I'm transporting this 9 across the border is because I know that when I get it 10 to the destination country, that's a place where people 11 use huge amounts of cash for bank deposits, for 12 purchases; and, therefore the act of transporting it 13 from the United States to the other country will 14 disguise the nature of the cash as drug money. 15 Would that fall within the statute? 16 MR. BEARD: No, I don't think so, 17 Justice Alito, and the reason I don't is because that 18 -- what you've described implicates potential money 19 spending, this notion that the money is easier spent. 20 But without more, money spending would not equate to 21 money laundering. That's -22 JUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't that fit the 23 literal language of the statute? It's a transportation 24 across the board with the design to conceal the nature, 25 i.e., that it's drug money, of this money?

1 MR. BEARD: I'm not sure, Justice, that

2 you've actually concealed the nature. If the money was

3 going -- if the money was dirty and going across dirty,

4 it remained dirty and just happened to be spent. But --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but it doesn't remain

6 dirty simply because it goes to a place in which the

7 appearance of this kind of cash does not have the dirty

8 appearance that it does at home.

Why -- why isn't

9 that the correct answer?

10 MR. BEARD: I --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't that make it

12 laundering?

13 MR. BEARD: Again, I don't know that there

14 has been -- as I understood the hypothetical, I don't

15 think that there's been any suggestion of a design to

16 conceal, the why. You're just taking dirty and you're

17 --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the design to

19 conceal -- maybe I misunderstood the hypo, but I thought

20 the design to conceal was you conceal the dirty

21 character of the money by taking it to a place and using

22 it in that place where use of large amounts of cash,

23 whether for bank deposits or spending in luxury stores,

24 does not have the dirty implication, the dirty

25 appearance that it does in the United States.

1 So, why doesn't that therefore satisfy the 2 concealment? 3 MR. BEARD: I -- Justice Souter, I think 4 that the answer to the question is here. The statute is 5 designed to take -- or purposed to take these dirty 6 proceeds, unlawful proceeds, and to cleanse them so as 7 to prevent their injection into streams of legitimate 8 commerce. 9 What you've described as spending is 10 admittedly spending, but I don't think that the spending 11 that's -- that you've contemplated there basically 12 implicates the core concern, if you will. The money -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have any evidence 14 like that here anyway, do we? Do we know that this was 15 going to "Spendy Land" where everybody has a lot of 16 money? Did we know that? 17 MR. BEARD: Justice Scalia, what we know, 18 because the government's evidence established it, is 19 that the money was being sent back to Mexico to repay 20 -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does everybody have a lot 22 of money in Mexico? Is that -23 MR. BEARD: Well, I would hazard to say no, 24 of course, but the record -25 JUSTICE ALITO: Was there -- was there
14

1 evidence about the nature of the Mexican economy? 2 MR. BEARD: There was. There was, Your 3 Honor. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: What was the evidence? 5 MR. BEARD: I'm sorry? 6 JUSTICE ALITO: What was the evidence? 7 MR. BEARD: The evidence that you just asked 8 about went to that it was easier to spend money in 9 Mexico. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't there an expert who 11 said that Mexico has a cash economy? 12 MR. BEARD: Yes, yes. And it -- and -13 JUSTICE ALITO: And what does that mean? 14 MR. BEARD: What I take it to mean -15 JUSTICE ALITO: Does it mean people can 16 spend a lot of cash without raising eyebrows? 17 MR. BEARD: Certainly more than here. That 18 was what I think that the evidence was offered for. And 19 the same expert, of course offered, you know, 20 established -- or the government established through the 21 same expert that the purpose of this particular 22 transportation was to complete the transaction, the drug 23 transaction. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: In your brief, you argue 25 that there has to be a design to create the appearance
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of legitimate wealth. Are you drawing back now from 2 that argument? 3 MR. BEARD: No, and, of course, we are well 4 aware that those words are not found in the statute, nor 5 do we suggest that they were. But what we have 6 suggested is simply that that's, if you will, shorthand 7 for describing what necessarily occurs if the 8 attributes, the listed attributes, are obfuscated. That 9 is the cleansing mechanism. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would that be so? 11 Suppose -- I mean, just take -- modify my hypothetical. 12 What this person says on the tape is: I'm sending this 13 money across the border because I know that if it -14 once it gets there, it will be harder to establish my 15 ownership of it. People will still know that it's drug 16 money perhaps, but they -- it will be harder to 17 establish my ownership of it. 18 Now, would that fall within the statute? 19 MR. BEARD: Well, at that point, yes, 20 because I think -21 JUSTICE ALITO: But there wouldn't be an 22 attempt to create the appearance of legitimate wealth 23 there then, would there? 24 MR. BEARD: Well, to the extent that the 25 individual who has been taped is contemplating the
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 money's resurfacing, I think that there would be. It 2 would be not legitimate wealth, though. And perhaps I 3 need to drive this point home. It would be less dirty. 4 In other words, there's not a requirement that the dirty 5 money necessarily be made clean or a description, but 6 that the dirty money be made less dirty. And that I 7 think is -- is what we're talking about. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the statutory purpose 9 have to be the only purpose or the principal purpose? I 10 mean, I could conceive that the principal purpose of 11 this transportation was to give the money back to the 12 fellow who gave the drugs, to pay the provider of the 13 drugs. I assume that would be the principal purpose. 14 But what if you know that when the -- when 15 the provider of the drugs is paid, he'll be able to 16 spend this cash easily in Mexico, which has a cash 17 economy? And let's assume that the latter is enough to 18 satisfy the purpose requirement of this statute. What 19 -- what would be the result? 20 MR. BEARD: If we -- well, Justice Scalia, 21 if we -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you assume a primary 23 purpose to pay off the -24 MR. BEARD: Right. If we assume that the -25 that the latter, as you just said, satisfies the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 statute, then you have a conviction. 2 But we certainly don't assume that, because 3 that implicates money spending, and money spending 4 hasn't -- hasn't been held to be money laundering. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though that wasn't the 6 real purpose -- I mean, the real purpose was to pay off 7 this fellow, who otherwise might come to hurt you. 8 MR. BEARD: Yes, absolutely. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But once you do pay him 10 off, you know that the money is going to be ready 11 spendable. 12 MR. BEARD: Well, certainly in this case, we 13 don't have any evidence that Mr. Cuellar knew any such 14 thing. If you were to remove it from the confines of 15 the Cuellar case, I think you -- your hypothetical does 16 come closer to implicating liability; but that's simply 17 not what we have here, at least. 18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, what you understand 19 the language "disguise the nature of the proceeds of 20 this specified unlawful activity" to mean, does that -21 is that satisfied by merely proof that it is proceeds of 22 unlawful activity? Or do you have to tell that -- what 23 is the word "nature" talking about? 24 MR. BEARD: No, Justice Stevens. It would 25 again, I think, require more. If all that were required
18

1 is to show that there was unlawful proceeds -2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's what it seems 3 to say. What I'm asking is: What do you think it 4 means? 5 MR. BEARD: Well, what I think it means is 6 that there has to be some -- the transportation or what 7 have you has to be purposed, designed, to take the 8 nature and obfuscate it. And this -9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm just asking about 10 the word -- the meaning of the word "nature." What is 11 the nature, other than the fact it's proceeds of 12 unlawful activity? 13 MR. BEARD: That it would -- I think that it 14 would -- "nature" is perhaps the first and foremost of 15 the attributes, but I think that it means, that it means 16 dirty, unclean. 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: "Dirty" in some sense 18 other than being proceeds of specified unlawful 19 activity? 20 MR. BEARD: Oh, okay. I don't know. 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: I just don't know what 22 that means other than that it is proceeds of unlawful -23 MR.

BEARD: Proceeds of unlawful activity 10 are the -11 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's always dirty. 12 MR. BEARD: There may be -- well, yes, I see 13 where you're going. Is there -- what is the independent 14 meaning of "nature." I think that -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't it simply to 16 change the nature from being drug money to look like 17 it's apparently innocent? I mean the change of the 18 nature -- the nature going in is it's always dirty. 19 It's drug money. And the purpose of the concealment is 20 to get it converted to some different nature, i.e., 21 clean money. 22 Isn't that what "disguise the nature" means? 23 MR. BEARD: I don't -- I brook no quarrel 24 with that. I mean, yes. I'm just -- what I was simply 25 suggesting --

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the verb is not 2 "transformed." The verb is "disguise" or "conceal." 3 MR.

And, of 6 course, "disguise" would be to maybe create a false 7 explanation of where the money is -8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there a reporting 9 requirement for -- for this shipment. If he had gone to 10 the border, would he -- well, then, a lot of what you're 11 arguing about isn't very important because they could 12 just indict under (ii). 13 MR.

BEARD: A currency-reporting 24 requirement, yes. I'm not sure that there is a 25 transaction-reporting requirement. I think that that --
21
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I see. 2 MR. BEARD: -- may implicate different 3 considerations. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if he -- if he didn't 5 know about the currency-reporting requirement, then he's 6 not guilty under that statute because it requires 7 knowledge. 8 MR. BEARD: Yes, Your Honor, I understand. 9 And so where we are left is he may not be guilty under 10 money laundering and perhaps, perhaps not under bulk 11 cash smuggling. But that in itself does not necessitate 12 a broadly interpreted understanding of the money 13 laundering statute. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If he's not -- if he 15 doesn't fit into either category, then there's no crime? 16 MR. BEARD: That's a possibility, yes, 17 absolutely. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, can I ask 19 you to go back to Justice Stevens's line of questioning? 20 If -- do you conceal the nature of proceeds if you 21 conceal the proceeds? 22 MR. BEARD: No, and I think that -23 Mr. Chief Justice, I think that it's important to 24 understand, for example, that hiding money is not 25 necessarily the same thing as -- I mean, concealing
22
Alderson Reporting Company

1 money is not necessarily the same thing as concealing 2 the location. And I think you could make the same type 3 of analysis in the other -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that -- that 5 doesn't seem to follow. I understand the argument with 6 "nature." In other words, you're not concealing the 7 nature; it's just not there. But when you're hiding it, 8 you are concealing the location. 9 MR. BEARD: Yes. But, again, I think that 10 the term "location," which is understood in the context 11 of the words surrounding it, if I take money and hide it 12 in my -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that gets me 14 to a question. Several times you've referenced the 15 attributes. Are you saying that the statute would have 16 a different meaning if it just said "location"? 17 MR. BEARD: What I'm suggesting, Chief 18 Justice, is that if the -- that the statute would have a 19 particularly different meaning from the one that the 20 government wants if the attributes just listed existence 21 of the money. There is a huge difference between hiding 22 money or hiding the location of the money. 23 If you just had location by itself, I'd be 24 making the same argument; but there's a huge difference 25 between hiding money or hiding the location.

BEARD: Yes. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if you just hide 17 the money, you assume he's just going to leave it 18 somewhere and forget about it? 19 MR. BEARD: No. No, Mr. Chief Justice. If 20 you just hide the money, that would encompass just 21 hiding money, for example, in the back yard of your 22 house with -- with -- or in a tin can or under a 23 mattress or whatever. It's a much broader -- broader 24 concept. 25 And I think that that's really what is at

1 play here because, to the extent that the government is 2 focusing on the method or -- of the concealment here, 3 they're -- they're implicating that type of behavior, if 4 you will, and saying it's sufficient to support a money 5 laundering conviction. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: But what if there is a wire 7 transfer to a bank in another country because that bank 8 has bank secrecy laws that will make it impossible to 9 ascertain the location of the money once it is there? 10 Does that fall within the statute? 11 MR. BEARD: At this point, no, Justice, 12 because you haven't suggested that there was any type of 13 design, any intent to disguise or conceal. You've just 14 suggested it went to another place. If I sent it to an 15 account -16 JUSTICE ALITO: If that's the purpose. If 17 the person says, I'm sending this to blank country 18 because they've got bank secrecy laws there that make it 19 impossible to find this money once it gets into their 20 banking system. 21 MR. BEARD: No. 22 JUSTICE ALITO: That's not -23 MR. BEARD: On those facts, no, I don't 24 think so. Now, if I were sending money to accounts in 25 the jurisdiction you've described, and perhaps with a

1 little bit more, different names on the accounts or what 2 have you, then I -- then I think a different result. 3 But if I'm just sending from my account here to my 4 account there, then no. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you say the same 6 thing for -- if you just put it in a safe deposit box in 7 a bank in the Bahamas? 8 MR. BEARD: I would make the same -- my 9 answer would be the same without more, Your Honor. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the "more" is 11 they don't hold it under your name. They hold it under 12 a numerical account number. Then that changes 13 everything? 14 MR. BEARD: It very well may. At least -- I 15 don't know that it changes everything, but it very well 16 may lead to a different result. But you just modified 17 the hypothetical. 18 What I'm -- what I'm suggesting is that if 19 you're just putting money in a safety deposit box or 20 this account or under the mattress or in the hole in the 21 back yard -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because the police can't 23 find it in that account even if it is still under your 24 name. In an account here the police would be able to 25 find it. In an account in the Cayman Islands, they

1 won't be able to. Isn't that -- isn't that transporting 2 it in order to conceal, to conceal it? 3 MR. BEARD: Justice, no, I don't think so, 4 and I'll briefly answer and try to come back to you in 5 rebuttal. 6 But I think that it's important to 7 understand the money laundering statute is not a 8 detection statute. That's not where the focus of the 9 statute rests. 10 Mr. Chief Justice, if I can reserve the 11 balance of my time. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 13 Beard. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that, so 15 I hope you will explain it later. It doesn't mean 16 anything if it's not a detection statute. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Schertler. 18 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER 19 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 20 MS. SCHERTLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 21 it please the Court: 22 The international concealment money 23 laundering statute contains no appearance of legitimate 24 wealth requirement, nor does it demand proof that the 25 illegal proceeds will be cleansed after they cross the
27

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 United States border. Petitioner's construction of the 2 statute is not supported by its tests and would defeat 3 its purpose. 4 What the statute does require is proof 5 beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knows that 6 he has illegal proceeds and that he knows that the 7 transportation across the border of those known illegal 8 proceeds is designed in whole or in part to conceal or 9 disguise one, at least one, of the facts in the statute 10 about those proceeds. The phrase "designed in whole or 11 in part" directs a full examination of the plan, of the 12 way in which the cross-border transportation of these 13 known illegal proceeds was planned out. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: Does the word 15 "transportation" mean the act of transportation across 16 the border or the method of transportation? 17 MS. SCHERTLER: The word "transportation" 18 itself means the carrying of something from one place to 19 another. The phrase "designed in whole or in part," 20 suggests that one should look at the entire plan, the 21 way that this transportation was conceived or planned 22 out in the mind, which would include, we would submit, 23 the method that was -- that was chosen to be used for 24 this transportation, the individual who was designated 25 to conduct this transportation of known illegal proceeds
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 across the United States border, and, yes, reasons for 2 conducting that transportation as well. 3 But it is not limited, as Petitioner would 4 suggest, to just one fact, that being what's going to 5 happen to the funds after the transportation is over. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: You go back to 7 Justice Alito's question. I agree with you that you 8 could read this as including a prohibition against a 9 method of transportation which method is to hide the 10 money. You could. But you could also read it the way 11 that the question suggests, to refer only to the 12 transportation. So you transport it physically in order 13 later to hide it. 14 Now, the difference between the two is if we 15 accept yours, which is the broader, this statute 16 includes everything that has nothing to do with the 17 common word "money laundering." Any time you hide 18 something, for whatever reason you hide it, to take it 19 to pay the couriers, you're money laundering. Any time 20 you run a gambling operation and the people stick the 21 money in the wad of their shoe, they're money 22 laundering. 23 I mean, why would you think Congress would 24 want that narrow reading when it can be read to focus 25 much more closely on money laundering just by reading it
29

1 literally for what it says? 2 MS. SCHERTLER: Your Honor, several 3 responses to that, to that question. 4 First of all, what's the purpose -- if we 5 want to look beyond the words "designed in whole or in 6 part" in the context of the international money 7 laundering statute to try to discern what the purpose 8 was of the statute, the purpose of this statute was to 9 prevent criminals from taking their proceeds abroad 10 where they would be outside the reach of all of these 11 controls that have been set up in the United States in 12 order to detect illegal proceeds and use those proceeds 13 to trace back to the crimes and the criminals that 14 generated them. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if that's all they were 16 getting at, they wouldn't have to have this 17 international component at all, because if you totally 18 eliminated the "to or through" requirement and you were 19 able to focus or properly focus solely on the method of 20 the transportation, et cetera, then you would cover not 21 only cases in which the concealment ultimately would 22 take place by crossing a border, but you would pick up 23 cases in which the concealment would take place even 24 within the United States; and that would certainly be in 25 the government's interest.

1 But if you add, if you say, well, but this 2 is limited by a to or through requirement, then it 3 suggests, it seems to me, as Justice Breyer's question 4 does, that it must -- the statute must be getting at 5 what happens when it crosses the border as opposed to 6 the means of crossing. 7 What's your answer to that? 8 MS. SCHERTLER: My answer to that, Your 9 Honor, is that that would have -- that would defeat the 10 purpose for which this statute was enacted. The -- the 11 premise of this statute was that once illegal proceeds 12 are taken abroad, taken outside of the United States 13 system, we lose control of them, we lose the ability to 14 find them, and we will have no idea -15 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that would be -- that 16 would be equally true and an equally appropriate 17 objective without the "to or through" requirement in 18 there. In other words, you don't have to have the "to 19 or through" requirement in order to give the government 20 a tool for exactly the purpose that you describe. 21 MS. SCHERTLER: And there -- there could 22 have been drafted a statute that was even broader than 23 this one in that respect. But the way -- the reason 24 that Congress imposed the "to or through" requirement is 25 that it knew -- is that that was when law enforcement in

1 the United States would lose the ability to use ordinary 2 investigative methods to find the proceeds of illegal 3 fraud. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then what you're saying, I 5 suppose, is that the movement of funds, if they're 6 illegal proceeds, outside of the country is a per se 7 concealment? 8 MS. SCHERTLER: No, Your Honor. We do not 9 -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Give me an example of when 11 you take money outside of the country that's illegal 12 money -13 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's not a 15 concealment? 16 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes. Let's say you have a 17 drug dealer who conducts a number of drug transactions 18 on one side of the border, takes his daily take, puts it 19 in his pocket or his wallet and crosses the border into 20 Mexico. Based on that evidence alone, the government 21 would not be able to show beyond a reasonable doubt that 22 merely taking those illegal proceeds, known illegal 23 proceeds, putting them in your pocket, that that was 24 designed to conceal the location, that there was a 25 plan --

Now, of course, 8 ultimately -9 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if he gives it to his 10 brother and says take it across for me, will you? 11 MS.

SCHERTLER: That would -- that would -18 that would get close. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't that 20 enough? If, for example, he's being -- he thinks he's 21 being watched by law enforcement because they know he's 22 up to something, but his brother isn't, why isn't that 23 concealing? 24 MS. SCHERTLER: With that additional 25 evidence, absolutely. I think there would be a basis
33

1 for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that that 2 was designed, that that was designed to conceal. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, let me back up. 4 Then let me add this. It seems to me that you're 5 saying, as you have to say, that any movement of illegal 6 funds outside the country which is concealed is per se 7 concealing a relevant attribute? 8 MS. SCHERTLER: We don't go that far, Your 9 Honor. As I said -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you do. 11 MS. SCHERTLER: -- you need to find -12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you have to go 13 that far to make the case you're making. 14 MS. SCHERTLER: No, not at all. I mean, 15 what -- Congress could have said every cross-border 16 transportation of illegal proceeds is covered. And they 17 did not. What they did was they set up this filter 18 for the ones -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're always 20 concealing the control. You're always concealing the 21 ownership. You're always concealing the location if 22 it's in your shoe or in the bottom of the car. 23 MS. SCHERTLER: I don't -- you have -- they 24 have to find a design to conceal. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: He purposely puts it in his

1 shoe, okay. 2 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a design. He knows 4 he's going to do it. So -- and you're saying, I take 5 it, 100 percent of the time that's illegal. If you're 6 not saying that, I don't understand what you're saying. 7 MS. SCHERTLER: No -8 JUSTICE BREYER: If you are saying that, I 9 don't know why they call this statute "Laundering of 10 Monetary Instruments." Why didn't they call it "shoe 11 hiding"? 12 (Laughter.) 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're basically 14 confronting face-on the dissent here, which drew a 15 distinction between transporting to conceal and 16 concealing to transport. And all you have here is 17 concealing to transport, and the question is whether 18 that violates the statute. 19 I agree with Justice Breyer that if this is 20 a statute directed at concealing to transport, it's a 21 funny name for it to think that it's a money laundering 22 statute. 23 MS. SCHERTLER: Your Honor, the title of 24 this statute, "Money Laundering," this is exactly 25 what -- among the conduct that Congress had in mind when
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it enacted and when it confronted money laundering in 2 1986. It saw money laundering as the variety of ways in 3 which criminals prevent the detection of their illegal 4 proceeds and thus are able to profit from their crimes. 5 It covered a wide range of conduct that included 6 converting, yes, illegitimate wealth into legitimate 7 forms through very complex means. 8 But Congress was also concerned about 9 criminals taking their proceeds across the border 10 surreptitiously -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Were they concerned that 12 this was a 20-year penalty, not what you're talking 13 about, the person who gets -- who is the drug dealer, 14 but all that this evidence shows is that we have a 15 courier. We don't even know if he knows who put the 16 money in the car. We don't know if he knows the -- who 17 the person is that he's to deliver the money to. 18 So on your theory, all you have to prove is 19 that this defendant drove a car in which illicit money 20 was hidden in order to get it out of the country. No 21 grand design. All he is is a courier. 22 MS. SCHERTLER: He needs to know that part 23 of the design, part of the plan of that transportation, 24 was to conceal or disguise -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a -- that's a lot
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of fancy language. All he knows, in fact, if he's just 2 a courier is that somebody gave him money to take this 3 car in which drug money is hidden across the border. 4 MS. SCHERTLER: And the use of that courier 5 also was part of a design to conceal or disguise the 6 ownership and control -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not his design. His 8 design is only -- I mean, he's just a drug courier, and 9 I think that's what -- that's a problem with your 10 interpretation of the statute. One can think of the 11 kingpin having this elaborate plan, and when it gets to 12 Mexico it's going to go into this bank and that place. 13 But here the defendant is simply a courier, and on the 14 government's theory anyone who transports hidden money 15 to get it out of the country, who drives the car, just 16 the driver, is a money launderer. 17 MS. SCHERTLER: Justice Ginsburg, the -18 Congress's purpose here was in getting at exactly this 19 kind of conduct by third parties in particular, because 20 when you use a third party that violates another purpose 21 at which the statute is directed: using third parties 22 to conceal who the true owner in control of the proceeds 23 is. 24 JUSTICE SOUTER: I suppose then the brother 25 should be -- giving the money to the brother should
37
Alderson Reporting Company

1 satisfy the statute. 2 MS. SCHERTLER: It -3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Because if I'm -- if I'm in 4 the drug business and my -- my brother is an 5 international social worker or something, I'm certainly 6 going to conceal when I give it to him and he carries it 7 across the border. 8 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Justice Souter, that 9 would be another example of using a third party so that 10 a -- so that one part of the design of that 11 transportation is to conceal the ownership and control 12 of the proceeds. 13 And in response to Justice Ginsburg's 14 question, Congress also -- well, in the sentencing 15 guidelines system now, the guidelines takes account of 16 whether you have the individual who is also engaged in 17 the underlying offense or whether you have a third party 18 who had not been involved in the underlying offense. 19 But no -- no matter how you see it, this was 20 precisely the conduct that Congress is getting at. It 21 saw that the only way to -- to get at crime -- one way 22 that was very important to it was to get at the money 23 and in order to get at the money you need to be able to 24 counteract the ways in which the criminals would prevent 25 law enforcement from getting at the money.

That would -- would that be money 5 laundering by him, to start out with? 6 MS. SCHERTLER: If he had designed this 7 transportation, yes, Your Honor, because the whole -8 the design of this transportation was to conceal or 9 disguise all five of the attributes of these illegal 10 proceeds. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a question of -12 isn't that a question of his intent? 13 MS. SCHERTLER: I -14 JUSTICE ALITO: It's not the effect of the 15 design, is it? It's the intent of the design. 16 MS. SCHERTLER: It -- it is -- what was -17 what was the plan? What was the conception? What 18 decisions were made about why and how we get these 19 proceeds from point A to point B. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Everybody knows he's a drug 21 dealer, back in Juarez or wherever he lives in Mexico. 22 MS.

SCHERTLER: And he's arranged it in a 4 way, if we're assuming the transportation here, so that 5 his ownership and control of those proceeds will be 6 disguised -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: It won't be disguised. 8 MS. SCHERTLER: -- during the course of the 9 transportation by saying, I'm going to select a third 10 party. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: During the course of 12 the transportation. That is not what you say in your 13 brief. I'm looking at page 41 and what you say is: "If 14 no independent evidence establishes that concealment or 15 disguising of the pertinent attribute of the proceeds 16 would occur at the point of destination, then a 17 factfinder would lack a reasonable basis for inferring 18 that the transportation was designed to conceal or 19 disguise." 20 In other words, in the hypothetical 21 Justice Scalia just gave -- in other words everybody 22 knows he's a drug dealer, he spends the money -- there 23 is no concealment or disguising the pertinent attribute 24 at the point of destination. 25 MS. SCHERTLER: That -- the sentence,
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Mr. Chief Justice, that you just read is the last in a 2 series of "if's" that we lay out in our brief, where we 3 -- where we assert that at any point in the 4 transportation a jury could find evidence of a design to 5 conceal or disguise. And that last sentence says if 6 they haven't found any evidence concerning the means and 7 the method and the person used for the act of 8 cross-border transportation, and if in addition there 9 was no evidence of what would occur at the point of 10 destination, then there would be no evidence. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there is no money 12 laundering if they conceal the proceeds in a suitcase 13 that's in the trunk of the car? Is that enough? 14 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, that would -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that concealing 16 the money? 17 MS. SCHERTLER: If we're talking about just 18 the attribute of location, use of a suitcase I would say 19 provides some evidence that there was a design to 20 conceal the location of those illegal proceeds during -21 as part of this cross-border transportation. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does use of a 23 suitcase provide that evidence? 24 MS. SCHERTLER: I think it would provide 25 basis for a jury to make --

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When I use a 2 suitcase I'm using it to carry my clothes, not to 3 conceal them. 4 MS. SCHERTLER: And if the jury were 5 presented with testimony that that was the design -6 that the only design, the only purpose, the only plan in 7 using that suitcase was to use it to secure money for 8 travel, then we would not have met our burden, but based 9 solely on the circumstances. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your answer to 11 Justice Scalia's hypothetical is still not clear to me. 12 It -- it seems to me your answer should be yes, because 13 he's concealing the ownership as of the time he goes 14 across the border, which brings me to my earlier 15 question, if once it's concealed, the statute is always 16 -- is always valid. 17 Then you indicated that oh, well, what 18 happens at the destination is very important. Then we 19 had Justice Scalia's hypothetical. I'm not sure where 20 you came out on that. 21 MS. SCHERTLER: Oh, our -- let me -- let me 22 be clear. I think even if one were to hypothesize that 23 there would be no effort whatsoever to conceal the money 24 at the point of destination, but a jury could find that 25 the transportation itself was designed in other
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 respects -- in its method, in its means -- to conceal or 2 disguise an attribute of the proceeds, that would be 3 enough to find that it was designed in whole or in part, 4 in any part -5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So Concealment, 6 concealment during the transportation is always a 7 concealment of an attribute under the statute. That has 8 to be your position. 9 MS. SCHERTLER: Concealment -- yes. The 10 only exception that we make would be in the Chief 11 Justice's example, if the jury were to find that there 12 was no design to conceal the location, for instance, to 13 prevent its discovery; it was only -- my only design was 14 to secure this for transport, like I put my money in my 15 wallet to do that. 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a broader 17 question, forgetting the text of the statute for just a 18 minute, because the text is extremely broad. Do you 19 think the question whether there's an attempt to create 20 an appearance of legitimate wealth has anything to do 21 with the analysis? The question presented is whether 22 there must be such a -23 MS. SCHERTLER: The question presented -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you're arguing that's 25 totally irrelevant and that -- and also that that

This -5 JUSTICE STEVENS: There is no -- okay. 6 MS. SCHERTLER: This statute -7 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the term "laundering" 8 really should be totally ignored? 9 MS. SCHERTLER: The term "laundering" under 10 -- when it is understood to mean the way Congress meant 11 it and the way Congress was viewing this conduct is much 12 broader than Petitioner suggests. 13 Laundering is the many ways in which 14 criminals prevent detection of their proceeds. It would 15 include and Congress certainly had evidence before it -16 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand you could 17 find a violation of it, but what I'm really asking you: 18 Is this just a total wild goose chase? We shouldn't 19 even consider laundering at all? As I understand your 20 argument, it's totally irrelevant. 21 MS. SCHERTLER: The title of the statute 22 says -- but the terms of the statute are what matter 23 here. 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it is irrelevant? 25 MS. SCHERTLER: The terms are plain. But
44
Alderson Reporting Company

1 even if you were to look at the term "laundering," it 2 would not support Petitioner's argument that that has a 3 narrow meaning that includes only conduct that creates 4 an appearance of legitimate wealth. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if this fellow 6 were driving to Canada would that be a different case, 7 because Canada does not have the sort of cash economy 8 we've heard about in Mexico? 9 MS. SCHERTLER: If the method of 10 transportation were exactly the same, it would make no 11 difference, Your Honor. In this case, this -- this 12 transportation method was designed, a jury could find 13 beyond a reasonable doubt, to conceal or disguise the 14 ownership and control of the proceeds through the third 15 party, and if that were the case and they were going to 16 Mexico it would be the same. The nature and the 17 location of the proceeds through the use of this secret 18 compartment and the goat hair to discuss the scent of 19 the proceeds from the drug detection dog. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what if the 21 fellow says: You know, there are dangerous roads 22 between here and Mexico. I'm hiding the money so that 23 if, you know, a gang comes up they don't find it. And 24 you say: No, we think you're hiding it because it's 25 illegal proceeds? Is that enough to get to the jury?

SCHERTLER: Yes, Your Honor. It's -8 that is enough. Concealing to transport when the jury 9 -- when it is part of the design of the transportation 10 to conceal the location, nature, source, ownership, or 11 control, any single one of those things. And all of 12 those are in here. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why do you make 14 distinctions between methods of concealment? And if the 15 design is to get the money out of the country, why 16 should it matter whether you put it in a travel bag, you 17 put it in the glove compartment, you put it in your 18 wallet, or you go through this elaborate disguise that 19 we see here? 20 What -- if what's important is getting it 21 beyond the border beyond the reach of law enforcement in 22 the United States, why should it make a difference how 23 carefully it is concealed? 24 MS. SCHERTLER: That need not make a 25 difference if there is evidence before the jury, if
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there is evidence that the ultimate design of the 2 transportation is to conceal or disguise the proceeds at 3 the point of destination. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then your only 5 defense is to go across the border and before you go 6 across you put all the money in your arms so the people 7 can see it? That's the way you do it? 8 (Laughter.) 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than that? 10 MS. SCHERTLER: In that situation, there 11 would no basis to find concealment or disguise of 12 location. Now, some of the other attributes may be at 13 issue if a third party is conducting that 14 transportation, but location from the method alone. So 15 the jury would need information about, well, what is the 16 design, what is the purpose of this cross-border 17 transportation? They could still find that the 18 necessary design to conceal or disguise is satisfied by 19 evidence that the whole purpose here is to get it to 20 Mexico where it will be turned into legitimate wealth, 21 for instance. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's transporting to 23 conceal. 24 MS.

In any part, was it designed to conceal or 6 disguise? And that would encompass all of the stages 7 that we are -- that we are discussing. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In your brief, you said 9 the bulk cash statute would not apply to a courier. Do 10 you still take that position, that the government's 11 choice is to indict for money laundering or nothing? 12 MS. SCHERTLER: The bulk cash -- well, 13 the bulk -- in this case, there's no evidence in this 14 record that a bulk cash smuggling statute charge would 15 have been viable because there's no evidence in this 16 record that this defendant knew of a currency reporting 17 requirement and intended to evade it. 18 Petitioner's argument that the bulk cash 19 smuggling statute shows that the conduct here was not 20 intended to be covered by the money laundering statute 21 is incorrect for the very reason that Justice Kennedy 22 has identified. The bulk cash smuggling statute could 23 not have filled a gap in the money laundering statute 24 for the conduct here because it has always contained a 25 provision that covers the transportation of known

1 illegal proceeds across the border to evade a -2 reporting requirements. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: There's no principle that 4 all criminal statutes have to cover every -- every bad 5 act. Maybe Congress has left a gap. I'm willing to 6 entertain the possibility that this individual, 7 obviously doing something very bad, doesn't -- falls 8 between the two stools. He is neither guilty under the 9 taking currency out of the country statute because he 10 didn't know of the existence of the statute, and he's 11 not guilty under one because he was not transporting to 12 conceal but was concealing to transport. And so there's 13 a gap. The Justice Department can certainly get that 14 gap filled readily enough. I don't know why we should 15 torture either one of the statutes to close it. 16 MS. SCHERTLER: The plain reading of the 17 money laundering statute covers this conduct, and 18 Congress specifically had this conduct in mind. As 19 Senator Biden said in questioning -- and he became one 20 of the co-sponsors -- questioning a witness about this: 21 Isn't it the truth that if we -- if we strengthen all 22 our domestic controls against money laundering, aren't 23 the criminals going to resort to physically transporting 24 their cash out of the United States? This is a -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many co-sponsors

SCHERTLER: I don't know, Your Honor. 3 This is part of the core conduct at which 4 this statute was directed, this international 5 concealment money laundering statute. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: How does that show what you 7 want it to show? I mean, what I just heard you say is 8 that Senator Biden said if we make it very tough to 9 launder money in the United States, then criminals will 10 send their money abroad to be laundered. 11 MS. SCHERTLER: And -12 JUSTICE BREYER: They'll transport it abroad 13 in order to launder it. How does that help you? 14 MS. SCHERTLER: They will resort to taking 15 their money physically out of the United States. And 16 the Senate report says that this provision was designed 17 to halt this flow. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: In order to launder it. 19 Were they not talking about money laundering? 20 MS. SCHERTLER: If the premise -21 JUSTICE BREYER: Or were they not talking 22 about it? I'm just going back -- I didn't read Senator 23 Biden's statement, so I'm just curious. 24 MS. SCHERTLER: This provision was directed 25 at preventing the illegal moneys from leaving the

It would have made no sense for Congress, 2 having understood that when money leaves the United 3 States we have little if any ability to know what 4 happens to it, to require in the statute proof beyond a 5 reasonable doubt of what would happen to the money once 6 it -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you're trying to prevent 8 the money -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you, in response to 10 one of my hypotheticals, said that it would be relevant 11 in some cases to show that it was designed to create the 12 appearance of legitimate wealth. So you put that back 13 in -14 MS. SCHERTLER: If -15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you put that back into 16 play. 17 MS. SCHERTLER: If we have that evidence, 18 yes, Your Honor. But to take Petitioner's position that 19 it would be necessary evidence in every case in which to 20 prevail under this statute to know of future plans to 21 launder abroad, when the premise of this statute is that 22 when the money leaves the country we cannot know what 23 happens to it, makes no sense. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if --- if that's what 25 they're concerned about, taking the money out of the
51

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 country, why do they have the concealment requirement? 2 They could have just said, you know, if you take dirty 3 money out of the country you're guilty. 4 MS. SCHERTLER: They -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't say that. They 6 have a concealment -- I can't understand why, if the 7 money is hidden during the transportation, it's any 8 worse than when the money is not hidden during the 9 transportation. It isn't -- it isn't the hiding during 10 the transportation they're concerned about. The statute 11 doesn't make any sense that way. 12 MS. SCHERTLER: I think that it does, Your 13 Honor. 14 The Court -- the Congress certainly could 15 have written it in the broad way that you've suggested. 16 It's not unlike the way that they wrote section 1957, 17 which covers broadly all transactions in illegal money. 18 They chose to not cover everything and to 19 cover cross-border transportation's where there's 20 evidence of some intent on the part of that individual 21 to conceal or disguise. And when you think about it, 22 they had set up regulatory provisions like the 23 transaction reporting requirement when there's no 24 conceal or disguise. There were other controls in place 25 as, say, the first line of defense against money

1 laundering to say, $10,000 or more is leaving the 2 country, we're going to know about it because we have 3 reporting requirements. 4 Here the Senate report says that they made 5 the decision to require evidence of concealment. 6 "Evidence of concealment of a crime" is what the report 7 says. And any time one of these attributes of illegal 8 proceeds is being concealed or disguised, that is 9 concealing a crime in a way that impairs law enforcement 10 from finding those proceeds. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask 12 this question? If the statute did include -- and I know 13 you think it does not -- a requirement of trying to 14 create an appearance of legitimate wealth, you would 15 lose? In this case. 16 MS. SCHERTLER: I don't think so, Your 17 Honor, and I would -- I would go back to the evidence 18 that Justice Alito has pointed out that is in this 19 record, that there's evidence in this record that -20 that the -- by taking the funds to Mexico, they would be 21 able to be used in a way that would not raise suspicion. 22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, there's also, 23 consistent with the evidence, they want to pay the drug 24 dealer for the drugs. And then a jury -- you can't say 25 it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt that that was not

I think that we do -- I 4 see that my red light is on. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you finish 6 your answer? 7 MS. SCHERTLER: Your Honor, there was -8 there was evidence in this case that the proceeds were 9 removed -- this is expert testimony -- removed from the 10 United States to conceal so as not to go through 11 reporting requirements, so that the money would not be 12 identified to U.S. law enforcement. We believe the jury 13 could also infer that further efforts to conceal and 14 disguise those proceeds would occur at the point of 15 destination. 16 Thank you, Your Honor. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 18 Ms. Schertler. 19 Mr. Beard, you have four minutes remaining. 20 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY V.

54

1 (Laughter.) 2 MR. BEARD: Happily I've been thinking about 3 it. Disruption versus detection I had told you, told 4 the Court that this was not a detection statute as much 5 as it is a disruption statute. 6 I think it is important for the Court to 7 recall that the very broad interpretations that the 8 government advances today are essentially the very broad 9 interpretations that the Congress rejected explicitly 20 10 years ago. The Congress rejected the notion that the 11 transportation of illicit funds in and of itself created 12 money laundering liability. And we've discussed that. 13 I think it's important, Justice Scalia, in 14 particular, in response to your question to bring this 15 up, because the Congress recognized that detection would 16 be harder in rejecting that type of legislation, but 17 rejected that they did. 18 The Congress has also shown itself capable 19 of -- of -- in the 1957 context of taking transactions 20 involving unlawful proceeds and making those per se 21 illegal. They could have easily done the same thing in 22 the transportation context if they had wanted to, but 23 instead they were looking at the separate behavior that 24 comprises money laundering. I mean, it is the notion 25 that you're taking money somewhere else and you're doing
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 something else and it gives rise to separate liability. 2 I think the true harm in the government's 3 interpretation, it basically conflates liability for 4 money laundering with the underlying offense, because 5 all of the underlying offenses involve concealment. 6 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask the same basic 7 question of you? Do you think that this line, "create 8 an appearance of legitimate wealth" is an essential 9 element of the offense? 10 MR. BEARD: It is not an element, 11 Justice Stevens. As I said, so -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: So then your question 13 presented raised that question, you're walking away from 14 that question? 15 MR. BEARD: We have spoken in the question 16 presented in that broad term, because we think that that 17 language encapsulates what's taking place. 18 JUSTICE STEVENS: It is not an essential 19 element of the offense? 20 MR. BEARD: It's not an element. But what 21 is an essential element is the need for the 22 transportation -- the transportation to be designed to 23 accomplish the same thing, to obfuscate those 24 attributes. It's -- and that's -- and therein is the 25 reason why --

1 JUSTICE ALITO: -- the same thing, 2 appearance of legitimate wealth goes to one of the 3 attributes, the nature of what's being transported. It 4 doesn't go to all the other attributes. 5 MR. BEARD: The Congress had identified, 6 Justice Alito, those particular attributes as being key 7 to allowing the launderer to inject the money back into 8 commerce. It may be that nature is implicated more 9 often, but the Congress chose to list the others because 10 they felt that those were the particular attributes 11 that, broadly speaking, allowed for the laundering 12 process. 13 This notion of -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the evidence is 15 clear that he knew he was taking it across the border 16 and it was to pay the drug dealer? Would that suffice? 17 MR. BEARD: For liability under the statute, 18 Justice? No, because the purpose there was not to 19 obscure the attributes. It is simply repayment. It's 20 the final leg, if you will -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- no, no. He 22 conceals it, in order to pay the drug dealer. 23 MR. BEARD: Yes. I'm saying that -- I may 24 have misunderstood. If you are saying Mr. Cuellar were 25 to know he was paying the drug dealer?

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 2 MR. BEARD: That wouldn't give rise to 3 laundering, because all you have there basically is 4 money spending. It's the conduct of the underlying -5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's concealing who owns 6 and controls. 7 MR. BEARD: No, I don't think so. I think 8 what you would have under these circumstances is merely 9 the final step, if you will, in the underlying unlawful 10 activity. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Beard, can't you give 12 us something we can get this guy on? 13 (Laughter.) 14 MR. BEARD: I'm not comfortable doing that. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's carrying dirty money. 16 It even smells of drugs. 17 (Laughter.) 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't we get him as an 19 accessory to drug dealing or something? You say he has 20 to walk? 21 MR. BEARD: Well, Justice, I'm not 22 uncomfortable with the notion of him walking, because 23 I'm not uncomfortable with the notion you brought up 24 earlier with that there may indeed be a gap. If there 25 is a gap, then there's a remedy for that. But I think

1 that if -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The point -- the point 3 about aiding and abetting something, this money reeks of 4 marijuana, and that was very puzzling to me. Why this 5 is the standard operating procedure to take this money 6 and wrap it in containers that had contained the drug. 7 So when the police find it, they know it's drug money. 8 MR. BEARD: Justice, I know that the -9 initially the way this went down was the money that was 10 in his pocket. That's what triggered the -- that's what 11 they said smelled like raw marijuana. And then 12 eventually, they found the drug money. And I can't tell 13 you why they did it this way. But I think that your 14 question underscores they were concerned not with 15 obfuscating any attributes, obviously, they were 16 concerned with getting this money back to repay the 17 person who had sent the drugs north under the 18 government's theory. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 20 Mr. Beard.
