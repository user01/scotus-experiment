1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:00 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Case 07-581, 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett. 5 Mr. Salvatore. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL SALVATORE 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 8 MR. SALVATORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief 9 Justice, and may it please the Court: 10 There are three reasons why this Court 11 should reverse the Second Circuit's blanket ban on 12 collectively bargained, arbitral forum -- forum 13 selection clauses. 14 First, the Second Circuit ignored section 15 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act, by which 16 Congress empowered unions to bargain on behalf of their 17 employees over anything germane to the working 18 environment, including methods of workplace dispute 19 resolution. 20 The forum in which an ADEA claim is heard 21 falls squarely in that authority. Indeed, forbidding 22 unions from bargaining about the procedural right to an 23 arbitral forum will carve a judicial exception into the 24 labor law permitting employers to bypass the union and 25 deal directly with their employees, defeating Congress's

1 national labor policy. 2 Second, the Second Circuit failed to 3 consider Congress's strong endorsement of workplace 4 arbitration contained in both the FAA and section 301. 5 Third, the Second Circuit erroneously and 6 exclusively relied on Alexander versus Gardner-Denver. 7 Gardner-Denver is a case about claim preclusion, not 8 about enforcing an agreement to arbitrate a statutory 9 claim. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Salvatore, you take the 11 position that the only thing that is at stake here is 12 simply, in effect, a selection of the arbitral forum. 13 What do you -- what do you say to the 14 argument that, in fact, the -- under -- under the 15 collective bargaining agreement the employee is subject 16 not merely to the right of the union to choose the 17 arbitral forum, but, in fact, to -- to assert any claim 18 at all? What -- what is your answer to that? 19 MR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, in -- in our 20 collective bargaining agreement, the collective 21 bargaining agreement here, the -- the union -- the 22 employee tenders the claim to the union. And in the 23 majority of cases the -- the employee and the union's 24 interests will be aligned, and the -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here it wasn't.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. What -- what -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here we are dealing with 3 claims that the union said: Sorry, we are not going to 4 process these claims because we have some tension since 5 the younger workers that replaced you, we also represent 6 them. 7 So you are proposing, as far as I understand 8 it, a situation where these workers would have no 9 individual right at all if the union says: We -- we 10 won't represent you. 11 MR. SALVATORE: No, Your Honor. The -- the 12 clause requires all claims to be arbitrated, and "all 13 claims" means that the individuals then have to go to 14 arbitration with their private counsel in this case and 15 -- and have their claims heard in the arbitral forum. 16 So that no one is denying -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does -- where does 18 the contract say anything about the -- the individual 19 succeeding to whatever arrangement there is between the 20 union and the employer? 21 MR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, I'm looking at 22 the petition appendix. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that only -24 only the union can invoke the arbitration clause, not an 25 individual.

1 MR. SALVATORE: No, Your Honor. That's -2 that's not the -- the way the contract reads. I'm 3 looking at the petition appendix page 48a, which is the 4 "no discrimination" clause. 5 And just -- just as a quick prelude to -6 before I -- I go through that language, I just want to 7 -- to note that this argument that these employees were 8 not bound to go individually to arbitration was never 9 raised below. 10 The Second Circuit did not consider it. 11 Indeed, the Second Circuit found that the clause covered 12 these employees, and -- and this only came up in the 13 Respondents' brief in this Court after cert was granted, 14 the red brief. 15 So that this -- this argument is one that 16 the factual premises for were never considered below in 17 the district court or in -- in the court of appeals. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just so I'm clear -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't -- I don't wish to 20 delay your reading, but -- but as -- as part of the 21 decision we have to make, don't we have to have in the 22 background the consideration of the -- that the -- the 23 potentiality that the union might do just what it did 24 here, and that would help, it seems to me, inform our 25 decision on the question that you are presenting.

1 Now, whether or not it's properly raised 2 here, I do agree with you it comes rather late. But 3 isn't it a factor that we must necessarily consider? 4 MR. SALVATORE: Yes, Your Honor. And -5 and, indeed, the collective bargaining agreements --and 6 we'll look at the language in one second -- are -- are, 7 as this Court has recognized, a little more complicated 8 to understand than -- than average contracts. You have 9 to look at the practice and the custom. 10 The practice here for this union has been to 11 turn over claims to the individuals. We've had this 12 clause in place for nine years. The New York courts 13 have enforced it repeatedly and -- and -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this included in the 15 question presented anyway? 16 MR. SALVATORE: It was -- it was not, Your 17 Honor. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it have anything to do 19 with the way the Second Circuit resolved this case? 20 MR. SALVATORE: It does not, Your Honor. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Second Circuit simply 22 said you could not deprive an individual of the right to 23 a court trial. 24 MR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the issue is whether --
7

1 now, if -- if we held that you can require the 2 individual to go to arbitration, in some later case we 3 could confront the question of whether, if the union is 4 in exclusive control of the arbitration and the -- the 5 individual will -- will not get a fair arbitrated deal, 6 that would invalidate it. 7 But it has nothing to do with the question 8 presented: Is an arbitration clause which clearly and 9 unmistakably waives the union member's right to a 10 judicial forum enforceable. 11 MR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 12 That is my argument with respect to why this does not 13 need to be taken up now. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I hate to get into 15 this, you know, 9 years history of dealings between the 16 union and -- and the employees. 17 MR. SALVATORE: There is no factual record, 18 Your Honor, for it in the record at all. And -19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there is at least 20 some. The collective bargaining agreement is in here. 21 And if we are deciding anything at all, we are going to 22 decide whether in this case the -- the Second Circuit 23 was correct. 24 The question is posed in generalities, but 25 we are not going to decide the general question in total

1 ignorance of this case. And in this case we've got the 2 particular collective bargaining agreement in front of 3 us, and you started to answer the question that -- that 4 I and Justice Ginsburg posed by referring to the "no 5 discrimination" clause. 6 MR. SALVATORE: Yes, Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: And will -- will you go on 8 to that? 9 MR. SALVATORE: I will. The clause is -- I 10 am looking at petition appendix 48a, the "no 11 discrimination" clause. This is the -- the clause at 12 issue in this case. It covers any present or future 13 employee. It goes on to state the -- the types of 14 protected characteristics that are covered by this 15 clause as well as the -- the relevant statutes 16 incorporating statutory law, public law, in the -- in 17 the clause. 18 And then in the second-to-last sentence five 19 lines up from the bottom it states: "All such claims 20 shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration 21 procedure, Articles 5 and 6, as the sole and exclusive 22 remedy for violations." 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does that mean? Does 24 that mean that they must go to arbitration even if the 25 union decides that, you know, this claim is -- is so
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 insignificant we don't want to take it to arbitration? 2 MR. SALVATORE: What this means, Justice 3 Scalia, is that these individuals cannot go to court. 4 They have to go either through the union, as has been 5 the practice here, or the union will turn the claim over 6 to them and let them go by themselves. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where did we get this 8 phrase -- where do we get the language "or the union 9 will turn over to them"? The only thing that I can see 10 in here that addresses that is on page 46a. And the -11 the clause there reads: "All union claims are brought 12 by the union alone, and no individual shall have the 13 right to compromise or settle any claim without the 14 written permission of the union." 15 There is -- there is a lot of gray area in 16 that, but the one thing that seems clear is that the 17 union has total control over any claim, including an 18 arbitration claim. 19 And that seems to lend some substance to the 20 -- to the point made by the other side that if we accept 21 your position here, we are accepting a position not 22 nearly as far -- that the designation -- a procedural 23 designation of a forum should be enforced but that, in 24 fact, total control over the assertion of a statutory 25 Federal right is also being ceded. Now, why doesn't

1 that language from section 46 support that? 2 MR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, it does not 3 support it for the -- for the following reason. The -4 the section 30 clause on page 48a. The "no 5 discrimination" clause, was added in 1999. It was added 6 after the Court's decision in Wright. It was added to 7 comply with Wright. That's an undisputed fact. 8 It -- it was added as a separate section 9 with a separate arbitration promise because "all claims" 10 is broader than "union claims." "Union claims" was 11 something that goes back for 75 years, but before we put 12 in section 30 -13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then, "all such 14 claims" -- "such claims" refers among other things to 15 the statutory right. 16 MR. SALVATORE: That's correct. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if the statutory right 18 is the appropriate section of an arbitration agreement 19 and the union has ultimate control of the arbitration 20 agreement, then it follows that the union has got 21 ultimate control over the assertion of the statutory 22 right. 23 MR. SALVATORE: No, Your Honor, not unless 24 -- not if the union turns that over. The employee's 25 reading --

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where -- where is the 2 guarantee that the -- if the union says, we don't want 3 to touch this, as in this case, that the employee has 4 the right either to arbitrate or, for that matter, to 5 sue? Where do you find that? 6 MR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, that -- that 7 right is -- is described from this language, "all such 8 claims." There is another route. What Articles 4, 5, 9 and 6 describe is that -- that the -- you must go to the 10 office of the contract arbitrator, and it doesn't 11 specify whether you go with the union or you go by 12 yourself. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Has any court decided this 14 issue of the interpretation of the collective bargaining 15 agreement in this particular. 16 MR. SALVATORE: No court has decided this 17 very issue like this, Justice Alito. But what the New 18 York courts have said is in interpreting this clause 19 over the last nine years, that they compel the 20 individual union member to go to arbitration when they 21 have brought claims in court in violation of this 22 clause. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Salvatore, I -- I 24 didn't think we took this case to -- to determine the 25 specific meaning as to this issue of this -- of this

1 particular contract, which is not an issue of national 2 importance. Why -- why must we decide the case here? 3 Could we not simply decide that the Second 4 Circuit was either correct, in which case the case would 5 be over, or incorrect to say that you -- that you -- you 6 cannot -- you cannot in a collective bargaining 7 agreement have the union responsible for arbitration of 8 Title VII claims? Why couldn't we just decide that? 9 And then if there is any issue of whether 10 such concession to the union deprives an individual of 11 even the right to arbitration, that can -- that can be 12 decided on remand by the Second Circuit, couldn't it? 13 MR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the Second Circuit 15 could look into all of these details. 16 MR. SALVATORE: Absolutely. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: And inquire into the New 18 York law that you're talking about now and that I don't 19 recall being in any of the briefing. 20 MR. SALVATORE: Justice Scalia, as cited in 21 our briefing, there is a long footnote listing the 22 cases. But -- but you're right, the -- the issue here 23 really is can the union agree to this? And that goes to 24 Congress's giving the union the power under section 9(a) 25 of the National Labor Relations Act to be the exclusive
13

1 bargaining representative -2 JUSTICE BREYER: I ask you -- let me ask you 3 a naive question possibly that may -- may reflect a 4 misunderstanding. But my understanding is that suppose 5 you are -- you are an employee. You believe your 6 employer discriminated against you, say, on gender 7 grounds. You have to go to the EEOC. 8 Now, the EEOC looks into it and very often 9 what they do is they don't really resolve it. They just 10 give you a letter that gives you a right to sue. 11 So here Congress was so worried about this 12 kind of thing that they said our specialized agency, you 13 know, won't be the bottom line. People will go there 14 and then they have a right to sue later. 15 Now, that's how Congress felt about this 16 particular statute. Why would they want the union to be 17 the bottom line when, in fact, the employee himself 18 hasn't agreed? I mean, the employee might agree in the 19 first place. He might say I'm going to take that 20 letter, I'm not going to bring my suit. That's up to 21 him or her. But here the employee wants to bring her 22 suit, just like the EEOC letter. 23 MR. SALVATORE: Well, Justice Breyer, the 24 ADEA provides not only a right to go to court after 25 you've gotten your right-to-sue letter or waited 60
14

1 days, but -- but it also provides multiple, as this 2 court recognized in Gilmer, multiple avenues that 3 Congress wants to use: Conciliation, persuasion, 4 conference -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. That's my point, 6 is that the statute as a whole reflects a considerable 7 effort not to let this employee get cut off at the pass 8 and an employee who is reasonably determined to get to 9 court probably can do it. It's not definite. The EEOC 10 doesn't have to give them a letter giving them a right 11 to sue, but probably can do it. 12 And if that's a situation where you have 13 this whole expert thing cut in, it seems to me there is 14 a parallel here that Congress then wouldn't want the 15 union and the employer together to be able to cut that 16 right to sue off, at least not very easily. 17 MR. SALVATORE: Justice Breyer, you have 18 competing policies here because you have the policies of 19 the labor laws which say that unions should have a -- a 20 broad portfolio of -- of topics to bargain about. This 21 Court has said that anything germane to the working 22 environment, dispute resolution mechanisms -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the union could not 24 bargain about these anti-discrimination rights. These 25 are rights given to individuals by Congress. The union
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 couldn't bargain about them the way it bargains about 2 collective rights, the way it bargains about wages and 3 hours and -- and other things. This is, this is not a 4 bargainable right. This is a right Congress says you as 5 an individual have a right not to be discriminated 6 against. This is nothing that the union can bargain 7 about. 8 MR. SALVATORE: Justice Ginsburg, I agree to 9 the degree we're talking about -- you're talking about 10 substantive rights. What we are talking about here is a 11 procedural switch. As this Court has approved in 12 Gilmer, what we are talking about is moving the forum 13 from the judicial one to the -- to the arbitral one. 14 And here in the -- the scheme of a collective bargaining 15 agreement where arbitration is the preferred remedy and 16 has been used for many, many years very successfully in 17 the -- in the -- by those parties. 18 It's -- it's taking employment arbitration 19 and putting it in the collective bargaining context. 20 And -- and there is, unions do this in many different 21 ways. Unions bargain about substantive rights. We are 22 not talking about substantive rights here, though. We 23 are talking about procedural rights. And the policies 24 of the labor laws are served and the policies of the 25 ADEA and the anti-discrimination statutes are not
16

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 disserved in any way. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Salvatore, would you -3 would you object to or oppose a ruling that said -- that 4 says yes, the -- the right can be subjected to union 5 arbitration, but if the union chooses not to arbitrate 6 it the individual must have the right to arbitrate it on 7 his own? 8 MR. SALVATORE: That's -- that's the 9 practice under this agreement, Your Honor. We would -10 we would wholeheartedly endorse that -- that rule 11 because, that's the practice here. And there is -- when 12 you're talking about statutory rights, why would the 13 union want to interfere with the ability of the employee 14 to get a forum if their interests are not aligned? This 15 goes to the tension that this Court has -- has 16 recognized in its prior cases. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that means 18 that if there is z totally frivolous claim and the 19 employer -- pardon me, the union says we are not going 20 to arbitrate, the -- the employee still has the right to 21 then proceed? The employer hasn't gotten very much. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: He has got an arbitration 23 instead of a lawsuit. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you would -- if you 25 would answer the question. The employer hasn't gotten

SALVATORE: Well, in -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it hasn't got the 10 ability to have the union help them weed out frivolous 11 claims. 12 MR. SALVATORE: Well that's true. The 13 union -- the union wouldn't play that function, except 14 that we have in this industry, the real estate industry 15 in New York City, a longstanding relationship that -16 that goes back decades. And -- and -- so it's a mature 17 collective bargaining arrange -- arrangement. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm 19 not sure that employers nationwide would -- would -20 would accept -- would accept that view. 21 MR. SALVATORE: Well, I think that -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And again, maybe that's -23 that's a reason for us not to reach it in this case. 24 MR. SALVATORE: Well, one of the issues 25 that -- that Congress allows the bargaining parties to
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 figure out is what the scope of their collective 2 bargaining arrangement should be. That's one of the 3 hallmarks of the NRLA. So, yes, some collective 4 bargaining parties may make that choice, Justice 5 Kennedy; others may make a different choice. 6 What is the alternative here? The 7 alternative is that employers can bypass the union. 8 They can just go around the union and -- and have 9 individual Gilmer agreements signed up. That's what the 10 D.C. Circuit said en banc in -- in -- in the ALPA Pilots 11 case. 12 And indeed, the -- the union in that case 13 was arguing the position that we are arguing here, that 14 this is a mandatory subject of bargaining, and this is 15 right in the union's portfolio of -- of what they should 16 be using to -- to bargain with the employer because it's 17 a procedural right and there are no substantive outcomes 18 that are diminished in any way whatsoever. 19 Unions are deemed trustworthy enough to 20 bring lawsuits in the federal courts on behalf of their 21 members. Under principles of associational standing, 22 associational standing, the members are bound by 23 their -- their union's actions. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And nonmembers, too? 25 What about the people who -- who are not members of the
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 union, but they have to pay an equivalent amount for the 2 union's services in collective bargaining? They would 3 be bound as well? They couldn't -4 MR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice 5 Ginsburg. The -- the -- the -- and this type of service 6 is one of the core functions that an agency payer would 7 have to pay for. The LM2 that 32B, the local, filed 8 here on behalf of 80,000 employees has two agency fee 9 payers out of 80,000. So it's not really an issue in 10 this case. 11 But that's what unions are for. When 12 Congress makes them the exclusive bargaining 13 representative you're -- you're in for it one way or the 14 other. You're -- you're -- either you're in or you're 15 out. And if you're in, then you have to go along with 16 the -- the -- the entire collective bargaining deal that 17 is made -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said -- the -- fine. 19 I -- I grasp your answer to that. But you 20 said that the employee would have the absolute right if 21 the union says, "sorry, for whatever reason we can't 22 represent you," absolute right to that arbitral forum. 23 What -- who pays then? 24 I mean, if the union is in it, then the 25 union and the employer are going to split -- split the
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 cost. But what happens when the union drops out and you 2 have the individual and the employer in this arbitral 3 forum? 4 MR. SALVATORE: In -- in this situation the 5 employer pays. That's the only -- the Office of the 6 Contract Arbitrator is an -- essentially a mini7 American Arbitration Association that these parties have 8 set up, and the -- the RAB, which is the multi- employer 9 organization that represents all the real estate 10 employers in -- in New York, they pay for the 11 arbitration, because the union in this case has said we 12 are not going to pay. 13 As you point out rightly, if the union is 14 not involved, they -- they shouldn't pay. So there is 15 no cost to the employee for that arbitration and -- and 16 as Justice Edwards said in the D.C. Circuit Kohl case, 17 that -- that that procedure is -- is a fair one, to have 18 the employer pick up the -- the costs given -- given the 19 -- the balance between the -- the two of them. 20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salvatore, are you 21 going to get to your explanation about Gardner-Denver 22 before you're all through? 23 MR. SALVATORE: Yes -- yes, Your Honor, 24 Justice Stevens. Gardner-Denver is -- is a case, as 25 this Court has described, that -- that didn't involve
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate. The 2 Gardner-Denver line of cases, McDonald and Barrentine 3 and Gardner-Denver, had the quite different issue as 4 this Court said in Gilmer, of whether a contract-based 5 claim precludes subsequent judicial resolution of a 6 statutory claim; and so that distinguishes the rule. 7 But factually these cases are very different as -- as 8 well. 9 Mr. Alexander in Alexander v. 10 Gardner-Denver, the contract there, the collective 11 bargaining agreement, had a plain vanilla arbitration 12 clause. It didn't have a clause like the one we looked 13 at page, petition appendix 48a, that incorporated all 14 the -- the statutes and gave the arbitrator the power to 15 sit and -- and to apply those statutes and apply the law 16 under those statutes and apply the remedies that derive 17 from those statutes. In that case, the arbitrator sat 18 as the proctor of the bargain between the collective 19 bargaining parties, and didn't have that broad 20 authority, as this Court has -- has recognized. 21 And -- and we agree that arbitration that -22 that resolves just a collective bargaining agreement 23 claim should not be dispositive of a statutory claim. 24 They're fish and fowl. So that Gardner-Denver is 25 correctly decided. Gardner-Denver puts out the rule for
22

1 -- for that situation. This is a different situation 2 that we are talking about. 3 And -- and here, unlike in Gardner-Denver, 4 where Mr. Alexander would have had no access to the -5 to have his Title VII claim heard if this Court had 6 affirmed the Tenth Circuit, he -- the door to the 7 courthouse would have been shut in that case for 8 Mr. Alexander -- here we are trying to move to compel 9 arbitration so that there is a forum, and -- and that 10 these individuals -- these employees -11 JUSTICE STEVENS: But not a judicial -- not 12 a judicial forum. 13 MR. SALVATORE: An arbitral forum, Your 14 Honor. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Salvatore, would you 16 just clarify something for me? I thought that the union 17 ceded its rights to the employees and said that they 18 could use this collective bargaining agreement's 19 arbitral regime so long as they paid for it. But you 20 tell me they don't have to pay anything; the employer 21 pays everything. 22 MR. SALVATORE: That's -- that's correct. 23 That's the union counsel's affidavit. He was saying he 24 doesn't -- the union doesn't want to pick up the costs, 25 Justice Ginsburg, but the collective bargaining

If the 3 union is not paying, then the RAB has to pay. 4 Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the 5 rest of my time for rebuttal, please. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 7 Mr. Frederick. 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 9 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 10 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 11 Justice, and may it please the Court: 12 The Second Circuit's judgment should be 13 affirmed for three reasons. First, a collective 14 bargaining agreement gives the union exclusive control 15 over workers' grievances. Second, unions have inherent 16 conflicts of interest with respect to individual 17 statutory anti-discrimination rights; and third, unions 18 lack authority to serve as gatekeepers of individual 19 workers' substantive ADEA rights. 20 With respect to the first point, a 21 collective bargaining agreement generally gives the 22 union exclusive control over whether to bring grievances 23 on behalf of workers and how such grievances are 24 pursued. In such circumstances -- which is this case, 25 the workers have not advanced the requisite agreement to

1 arbitrate, and control over the arbitral forum to 2 satisfy this Court's standards in Gilmer for effectively 3 vindicating the workers' statutory anti-discrimination 4 rights. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: Under your first point, are 6 you saying it's impossible for there to be a collective 7 bargaining agreement that reads the way Mr. Salvatore 8 reads this collective bargaining agreement; a collective 9 bargaining agreement which says that the union's -- that 10 the grievance must be arbitrated, and it will be done 11 either by the union, or if the union declines to pursue 12 it, by the individual employee? 13 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Alito, I've looked 14 comprehensively through the cases. We've never found a 15 collective bargaining agreement that gives the kind of 16 interpretation that Mr. Salvatore offered in this case. 17 Now, is it theoretically possible that a collective 18 bargaining agreement would confer on individuals the 19 rights this Court said in Gilmer are necessary to 20 vindicate that? I would acknowledge it's theoretically 21 possible, but it has to be done within the confines of 22 whether there is actual consent by the individual to the 23 arbitration, whether the individual has control over the 24 mechanisms of arbitration, and whether or not the 25 structure of the arbitral forum effectively vindicates
25

1 the individual's substantive rights. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: But there is nothing in 3 Federal labor law that would preclude the negotiation of 4 a collective bargaining agreement like that. 5 MR. FREDERICK: Nothing except this Court's 6 case in Magnavox where the Court said that the union may 7 not bargain away an individual's rights where there 8 would be a conflict between the union's interests and 9 the individual's. Here, because this is a 10 discrimination claim, unions are often brought as 11 defendants in such claims, particularly in circumstances 12 as here, where the union agreed to the conditions that 13 gave rise to the discrimination on the basis of age by 14 these workers. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Even in a case in which you 16 don't have -- assume -- just assume for the sake of 17 argument that we don't have the discrimination issue or 18 the conflict issue. I understood you elsewhere to be 19 arguing that there had to be the kind of knowing, 20 intelligent and individual waiver, which I would suppose 21 a collective bargaining agreement will never include. 22 So I thought it was the -- ultimately the implication of 23 your argument that in any -- in any case in which 24 arbitration is claimed, there would have to be -- or a 25 right to go to arbitration is claimed by the employer --
26

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there would have to be, not merely the collective 2 bargaining agreement, but a specific waiver by the 3 employee to -- to go ahead and do that. Is that right? 4 MR. FREDERICK: That -- that's correct. And 5 that's why I think the Gilmer point is -- is essential 6 here, Justice Souter and Justice Alito. Because in 7 Gilmer there was individual consent; there needs to be 8 such individual consent under the ADEA waiver itself, 9 and knowing and individual waiver is necessary before 10 the person can waive the substantive ADEA rights. That 11 would need to be part of the hypothetical collective 12 bargaining agreement that I was positing with Justice 13 Alito. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Would that mean -16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Go ahead. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Would that mean that the 18 employer could not unilaterally impose an arbitration 19 requirement on employees? 20 MR. FREDERICK: I think that would follow, 21 as that would be a condition of employment that could 22 not be imposed. The airline -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It wouldn't be 24 unilaterally imposing, right? He would say if you're 25 going to work for me, you've got to arbitrate, and that
27

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 could be negotiated theoretically, and with individual 2 employee. And -- I mean, the whole point, the whole 3 benefit of collective bargaining is that that doesn't 4 happen. You say, well, the employer has a lot of 5 leverage if he wants to insist upon that, but it would 6 not -- it would be a matter for negotiation between the 7 individual and the company. 8 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, Mr. Chief 9 Justice, but there are two different points at which the 10 condition of employment arose. I understood the 11 questions on this side to be after the agreement had 12 taken place and the worker was already on the work site. 13 Under your hypothetical, if an employee gains entrance 14 to the work force and is asked, "will you sign this," 15 there is individual consent in that circumstance. That 16 is the fact situation in the Air Line Pilots case. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the one thing that's 18 uniform throughout in your answer is that the collective 19 bargaining agreement alone can never subject the 20 employee to -- to mandatory arbitration? 21 MR. FREDERICK: That's -- that's how we read 22 this Court's statutory -23 JUSTICE BREYER: Is also true -- is that 24 also true with an ordinary tort or any other kind of 25 suit?

Somebody is hurt as a result of 6 machine improperly functioning, or there isn't adequate 7 notice or so forth. Is your view the same there? 8 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that those 9 category of cases do stand in a different position 10 because there is less of an inherent conflict of 11 interest. The union there -12 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? 13 MR.

FREDERICK: It refers to discrimination, 20 and as we cite on page 27 of our brief, there are 21 provisions in the anti-discrimination laws that are 22 specifically directed at union discrimination. The 23 legislative history of these statutes indicates that 24 discrimination by unions was one of the concerns 25 animating Congress --

So you think 6 sometimes unions do discriminate? 7 MR. FREDERICK: And that's why -8 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And sometimes 9 unions also would rather have the more effective machine 10 or sometimes unions feel their workers are stupid not to 11 read the machine label properly or -- I mean, I can 12 replicate anything you might think. We can think of 13 tort suits, the two of us, which could put unions and 14 employees on opposite shores, just as we can think of 15 discrimination suits. Most unions don't want 16 discrimination. I mean, most of the time. And most 17 unions don't want dangerous machines most of the time. 18 So if I decide for you in this case, am I 19 also saying that they can't arbitrate ordinary tort 20 suits or contract suits or just whether or not the 21 workplace which is made of wood is filled with termites? 22 I mean, you know? 23 MR.

FREDERICK: I don't think Congress -8 JUSTICE BREYER: If I think that, then I 9 should decide against you? 10 MR. FREDERICK: Well, no, because there are 11 two other reasons: The exclusive control over the 12 machinery and the union serving as the gatekeeper. 13 I'm not aware of tort suits being subjects 14 of collective bargaining, Justice Breyer. Nor am I 15 aware of cases in which the unions have given up 16 individuals' tort claims in situations, principally 17 because unions are not the persons against whom such 18 tort suits are brought. 19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but those -- I'm 20 sorry. 21 Those examples are examples. You're getting 22 down to individual cases. I thought you drew the global 23 line in answer -- which would answer Justice Breyer's 24 question by saying the -- in the cases that we're 25 talking about here, Congress has passed a statute giving

1 a specific individual right and that individual right 2 cannot in effect be compromised except in -- except in 3 violation of that statute, and that's where we draw the 4 global line so that when you got to torts, you'd look at 5 the individual situation rather than draw a categorical 6 line. 7 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, you would, but the 8 principles this Court has applied in looking at that 9 broad line, I'm trying to suggest that there might be 10 situations in which those principles, where the union is 11 serving as the gatekeeper, thereby not allowing a person 12 to vindicate his individual rights in the tort context, 13 to be not -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: I agree with you, but I 15 think -- I don't want to put words in Justice Breyer's 16 mouth -17 JUSTICE BREYER: Very helpful of you. 18 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I thought what he was 19 getting at is, if I hold for you here, am I going to 20 have to hold for you in every case in which somebody has 21 in effect a tort claim which is subject to an 22 arbitration clause? 23 MR. FREDERICK: And the answer is no. I 24 thought -25 JUSTICE BREYER: Then I replicate my

1 question because what I'm thinking is simply that there 2 are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, kinds of claims 3 that people go to arbitration over. And what I'm 4 wondering here is if you win here, what is the set of 5 such claims that I have now said that a union, through a 6 collective bargaining contract, can force the employee 7 against his will to go to arbitration over? I don't 8 have a feeling for that from the briefs. I don't have a 9 feeling that you want to say that discrimination claims 10 are special in that regard, that there's no line in that 11 regard, or that there's some other line. 12 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Breyer, I 13 think that your question really is getting at the theory 14 behind collective bargaining agreements and what extent 15 the union can exercise control over the individual 16 rights and circumstances of employment. That question 17 is a very complex question over which many, many -18 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, can you give me a 19 hint as to the principle? 20 (Laughter.) 21 MR.

1 because all we are arguing for is that the 2 Gardner-Denver line, which was written by this Court 3 unanimously more 30 years ago, continue to be the law of 4 the land, as the Court has reaffirmed -5 JUSTICE ALITO: What if a collective 6 bargaining agreement requires the arbitration of 7 discrimination claims that are not based on Federal law? 8 Maybe they are based on -- they are based on State law 9 that goes further than Federal law, or maybe they are 10 based on a type of discrimination that's prohibited 11 neither by Federal or State law. Maybe it's 12 discrimination against young people under 40. Could 13 those be -- those would still be discrimination claims 14 with the same potential for -- with a potential for a 15 conflict of interest. Could they be subjected to 16 mandatory arbitration? 17 MR. FREDERICK: I -- I think that is a 18 harder case, Justice Alito, but I think that the answer 19 under this Court's decisions in Gardner-Denver points 20 the way here, in footnote 19 of the decision.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if it's not a 2 statutory right; it's just a wrongful discharge? One 3 practical problem is so often these are overlapping 4 claims. You can say, "I was discriminated against 5 before because of my age. I was arbitrarily 6 discriminated against. It was a wrongful discharge. It 7 was a discharge without just cause." Usually, there's 8 multiple claims that can be made, and some of them would 9 be bargainable, I mean, would come under the union -- I 10 mean if it was just a question of the worker says, "I 11 was discharged without just cause," no Title 7 or 12 anything else, that would come under the arbitration 13 clause, wouldn't it? 14 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, and I think that there 15 have been conditions of employment and discharge that 16 have been arbitrable, and I don't see that there is a -17 an issue there where -- except where that intersection 18 with the statutory discrimination rights occurs.

1 about the fact that my grievance here has some 2 discrimination attached to it? 3 Your briefing talks as though it is 4 something totally apart from a mere economic right. 5 Ninety-nine percent of the time, you're talking about 6 economics. "I was fired because of discrimination." "I 7 wasn't promoted because of discrimination and therefore 8 I lost this -- this amount of money or that amount of 9 money." 10 Why is it unthinkable that the -- that the 11 employee would have to go through the union-prescribed 12 arbitration for the fact that he wasn't paid for the 13 last three months but does not have to do it for an 14 economic injury that occurs because of discrimination? 15 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I'm not sure actually 16 in answering your hypothetical that they would 17 necessarily have to go through the union on the 18 nonpayment because of the Fair Labor Standards Act case. 19 This Court in Barrentine said that, where an FSLA claim 20 is at issue, the worker does not -- is not confined or 21 precluded after arbitrating at the union grievance 22 process from bringing an FLSA suit in court. 23 So I want to reserve, accepting all of your 24 hypothetical, Justice Scalia, but in further answer to 25 the point, I think it's important to keep in mind that
36

1 in the discrimination context, you're talking about more 2 than just money. Here my clients are older workers who 3 are forced into more physically strenuous positions that 4 they had gotten away from by virtue of their growth in 5 seniority at the building. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that 7 kind of conflict always present whenever you have 8 collective action? I mean, you may be a particularly 9 good worker and could demand a higher wage than the 10 union has negotiated, but you're still bound by the 11 collective bargaining agreement. That happens in every 12 situation where you have collective action. 13 MR. FREDERICK: Certainly, Mr. Chief 14 Justice, but where Congress has made a choice that 15 individual claims for individual anti-discrimination 16 rights need to be vindicated in particular ways, and 17 where this Court's -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they don't 19 have to be vindicated in particular ways. The 20 individuals can agree to arbitrate these claims, and 21 they would be -- the arbitration would be binding. 22 MR. FREDERICK: Certainly, but there is 23 individual consent in that circumstance. I would like 24 to make a couple of other points before closing. 25 One is that on pages 4 to 5 in the brief in opposition
37
Alderson Reporting Company

1 to cert we specifically raise the issue that the union 2 controls the arbitration, and there is no opportunity 3 for individual arbitration under this collective 4 bargaining agreement. 5 There is nothing in the provision set out in 6 the petition appendix that gives individual rights, the 7 individuals the right to arbitrate under this collective 8 bargaining agreement. The payment provision calls for 9 50 percent by the employer and 50 percent by the 10 employee with the employer having the sole right to 11 terminate the arbitrator for any or no reason at all. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You did raise that issue, 13 but you didn't say that the consequence of that issue 14 was that you win. You said the consequence of the fact 15 that that issue was involved in this case was a good 16 reason not to -- for us to accept cert. And we didn't 17 take your advice on that. 18 MR. FREDERICK: Well -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's a totally 20 different issue whether because of that question you -21 you should -- you should win the case. 22 MR. FREDERICK: Certainly, the 23 interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is 24 fairly included within the question presented. And as 25 this Court found in Wright in a situation where it
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 granted certiorari on the very same question here but 2 then looked at the specific provisions of the collective 3 bargaining agreement to determine that, in fact, under 4 the facts there a different rule applied for a clear and 5 unambiguous waiver. 6 All we are saying here is that under this 7 provision there is no opportunity for the individual to 8 arbitrate, and that raises a -- a problem analogous to 9 the one that is in Wright. We think that is fairly 10 included within the question presented, and that the 11 Court can affirm on that basis, certainly where the 12 Second Circuit had relied on precedent that said that 13 where the individual doesn't have a right, that it is 14 union control of arbitration. That is consistent with 15 Gardner-Denver. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't have to be 17 within the question presented. You -- you can sustain 18 the judgment below on any ground. 19 MR.

If you want to work in this workplace, 10 you sign an arbitration agreement that says you have no 11 access to the court, and you have to -- just like in 12 Gilmer, just like in Circuit City. 13 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 14 guess I would answer that question by saying we will pay 15 our money and take our chances in the sense that the 16 unions here are supporting the workers where the unions 17 are acknowledging that there is this kind of conflict of 18 interest, and the question of whether or not imposing 19 arbitration on the individual workers would be a 20 condition of employment. That is a question that you 21 can safely leave for another day. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they may go 23 the other way. They may say: Look, we don't like to 24 arbitrate. In fact, the arbitration is of great benefit 25 to workers, but it is very expensive to bring these
40

1 claims, even with the prospect of recovering fees. 2 Most of them like the idea that the union is 3 going to stand up for them and take it to management, 4 but they could say: Look, we don't want it. If -- if 5 you are discriminated against, you know, sue us. 6 MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, in fact, 7 empirically that is not correct. There is a study that 8 is cited in a footnote in one of the amicus briefs that 9 arbitration is more expensive than bringing civil 10 litigation. And it is because the -- under -- under 11 their provision if you pay 50 percent of the 12 arbitrator's costs, you can run up quite a big tab that 13 you would not have to pay -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But under my 15 scenario, the employer wouldn't have to pay for 16 arbitration. There would be -- there would be no 17 arbitration at all. 18 MR. FREDERICK: Well, under your scenario, I 19 think where the employer would control the arbitral 20 process, the arbitrator knows who is buttering his 21 bread. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. There is no 23 arbitration.

GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 5 please the Court: Respondents' fundamental right to a 6 workplace free of invidious, class-based discrimination 7 is something their union has no power to barter away in 8 collective bargaining, and the union -9 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I just want to be sure 10 that at some point you answer this question, if you can. 11 I -- I -- the -- the issue in front of us, 12 as I see it, is just what you said: When can a union 13 require the worker to accept arbitration rather than a 14 court case in an instance where the union member has not 15 signed a special waiver? That's the question, right? 16 Okay. 17 And what I think some of us were struggling 18 for here is: If we say yes to you they can force them, 19 or no to you they can't, what's the principle? 20 Now, the easiest kind of case where you tend 21 to think they can force the worker into arbitration is 22 where the right grows out of the collective bargaining 23 agreement, period. 24 Then we have what we were talking about with 25 Justice Souter, a common law tort claim. Then we might
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 have a State law giving a claim. Then we might have a 2 Federal law like this one giving a claim. 3 And we just heard -- I would assume if 4 Justice Scalia thought of such a case, then the response 5 was, which was the FSLA: Oh, well, maybe we can't, you 6 know, force the worker to give that one up either. 7 So what is the line here that we are drawing 8 with this case? Is it a line that says discrimination 9 laws, Federal or special? Federal laws are special? 10 State laws are special? Common law is special? 11 Collective bargaining, too? What is the principle? 12 MR. GANNON: Yes, Justice Breyer. This 13 Court's cases have not yet described a specific law, and 14 -15 JUSTICE BREYER: That's why I am asking you 16 for the principle. 17 MR. GANNON: I think that the -- the best 18 line that we have is -- is stated in both Gardner-Denver 19 and Barrentine as contrasting statutory rights that are 20 related to collective activity, and especially economic 21 activity, are the kinds of things that are normally 22 delegated to the union. Those are the sorts of things 23 that the union can actually engage in collective 24 bargaining about. And when the union negotiates the 25 underlying right, then it makes perfect sense that the
44

1 labor arbitration framework that's set forth here would 2 continue to resolve disputes that are arising under -3 out of that specific right. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why doesn't this 5 come within that? 6 MR. GANNON: Because -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't many of these 8 cases, if not most of them, come within that? The union 9 negotiates the salaries for various levels, and then the 10 person says: I should be at this level. The only 11 reason I didn't get it was that I was discriminated 12 against. 13 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think, Justice 14 Scalia -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you call it a 16 non-economic theory. Phooey, it's an economic case. 17 MR. GANNON: But I think what's important, 18 Justice Scalia, is -- is, though -- is the line that the 19 Court stated in Barrentine: That if a statute is 20 designed to give specific, minimum protection to 21 individual workers, then that's the sort of thing that 22 the union doesn't have the power to engage in collective 23 bargaining over. 24 And so your salary may well be something 25 that the union can normally bargain about. But if you

The -- the union is not taking away the right. 13 It's just saying to vindicate it, you have to go to 14 arbitration instead of to the courts. 15 MR. GANNON: Yes. And the difference is 16 that the union is making the decision about where the 17 claim will be vindicated. And in this case in 18 particular, the union is going to control whether the 19 claim will actually be able to be officially vindicated. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have -- you have 21 focused on the fact that Congress has given individual 22 rights. But for the many matters that you say are the 23 subject of collective bargaining, you don't need a 24 statute. I don't need a statute to negotiate with 25 someone whether I get paid $20 an hour or $15 an hour

They are just 12 saying -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. I am -14 the -- the forum for asserting the right. 15 MR. GANNON: Well, in this instance Congress 16 gave individual employees the right to bring a civil 17 action in a judicial forum as a means of enforcing their 18 antidiscrimination claims. And although arbitration may 19 always provide an alternative forum for that, this Court 20 has repeatedly made clear that arbitration is always a 21 matter of contract. And it does not impose on the 22 employer any more than on the employee a requirement 23 that they arbitrate a claim when they -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would any 25 employer want to agree to arbitration under this system?

And if you look at the empirical data that's 14 mentioned in some of amicus briefs, including the 15 particular amicus brief of the National Academy of 16 Arbitrators, it is true that even when there is just a 17 labor arbitration machinery that was invalid under the 18 terms of Gardner-Denver and would not be binding on the 19 employee if the employee happens to lose in that 20 arbitration, in most of those cases when the employee 21 loses that arbitration, he does not go on to file an 22 independent case in federal court. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your position -- so 24 their position is going to hurt most employees, because 25 assuming that the employer wants to arbitrate, the union
48

1 gets something in return for agreeing to that. I don't 2 know what it is, another 50 cents an hour, if you agree 3 to arbitrate all these claims. Well, you don't get that 4 anymore, because and employer is not going to agree to 5 arbitrate if it -- if the employees don't have to 6 arbitrate. 7 MR. GANNON: Well, we don't think that there 8 is any reason why the employees will not be able to make 9 a grievance with the employers, as was made possible in 10 Gilmer. And so that the point is that it just can't be 11 a vicarious agreement to arbitration on behalf of the 12 individual. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the employees 14 have no -- no leverage. I mean, if the -- if the 15 employer wants to say, look, if you want to work here, 16 look, you got to arbitrate -- I mean, the employees 17 don't have bargaining leverage. That's the whole reason 18 you have a union. 19 MR. GANNON: Well, there was an argument in 20 Gilmer that they didn't have leverage, either. And the 21 Court stressed that as long as the employee has actually 22 agreed to it, that -- and -- and as long as the arbitral 23 forum is going to be adequate to provide for effective 24 vindication of the underlying statutory rights, then -25 then the arbitral forum would be adequate.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the employer did 2 have the practice that the Chief Justice suggested, it 3 tells each employee you have to sign an arbitration 4 form, could the union in its collective bargaining 5 negotiations say that you will withdraw this forum and 6 that you shall not impose this obligation? 7 MR. GANNON: Well, that's -- as 8 Mr. Frederick mentioned and is as discussed in several 9 of the briefs, that's an undecided question of labor 10 law. The National Labor Relations Board -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking in your view if 12 it came up to it, how would that be decided -13 MR. GANNON: Well -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I'm concerned it's 15 the same thing as the Chief Justice mentioned, I just 16 don't think the employer is going to get very much under 17 this interpretation. And that may, ultimately, hurt the 18 employee. 19 MR. GANNON: We think that as long as the 20 employee have been -- have been able to indicate exactly 21 the same level of individual agreements that was upheld 22 in Gilmer and that the arbitral forum itself is going to 23 be adequate, that that takes care of that half of the 24 question. 25 The National Labor Relations Board which
50

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 has -- which would be entitled to deference on this 2 question and which has never spoken to the labor law 3 question of what role the unions might be able to play 4 in helping facilitate the agreements negotiated between 5 the employers and the individual employees, it could 6 come out in at least three different ways. 7 One of them is the arrangement outlined in 8 the Abbott D.C. Circuit decision that -- that 9 Petitioners rely upon. But, of course, that's an 10 instance where there were two completely separate 11 agreements that the employment arbitration was agreed to 12 by the employees before they are even represented by the 13 union. It was at the outset of the establishment of the 14 employment relationship, which Mr. Frederick discusses. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't it boil down -16 doesn't your argument really boil down to this: That 17 the only case in which it's really going to matter is 18 the case in which the arbitration agreement contains a 19 clause that gives the union plenary authority over the 20 disposition of the claim? And I say that for this 21 reason. If -- if this is outside the subject of 22 mandatory bargaining, then the employer can impose it; 23 in effect, as a matter of individual contract. 24 If it's within the subject of mandatory 25 bargaining but it's not effective unless the employee
51

1 also signs at the time of the incident or at the time he 2 is hired an individual waiver, then, in fact, the only 3 case in which it's going to make any difference as to 4 whether you win or he wins is the case in which the 5 agreement has got a clause in there that gives the union 6 plenary authority to dispose of the claim. 7 Isn't that correct? 8 MR. GANNON: Well, not necessarily, Justice 9 Souter, because there are all sorts of other attributes 10 of the arbitral forum that might -- might well be 11 relevant to the question of whether it's sufficient to 12 effectively been -- rights. In Gilmer itself, the Court 13 specifically considered whether the employee, 14 Mr. Gilmer, would have an opportunity to play a role in 15 selecting the arbitrator. 16 In this instance, even under Petitioner's 17 view of the CBA, which we don't think is supported by 18 the text of the CBA, this -- these employees are still 19 stuck with an arbitrator who has been chosen by the 20 employer and by the union. And those are the two 21 entities that have already decided that their claim is 22 meritless. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: -- more variables of Justice 24 Souter's question, if those variables are satisfied, 25 what's -- what is your answer to his question?

GANNON: If the variables are -2 JUSTICE ALITO: You're saying that this 3 might -- this might not be true and that may not be 4 true, but suppose all of those other requirements are 5 satisfied? 6 MR. GANNON: We think that there needs to be 7 individual agreement in order to comply with Gilmer 8 because of the underlying inherent tension between the 9 collective interest of the union and the individual 10 interests of the employees, especially in 11 anti-discrimination statutes. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 13 Mr. Salvatore, you have four minutes 14 remaining. 15 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL SALVATORE 16 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 17 MR. SALVATORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief 18 Justice. A couple of quick points in response. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Salvatore, would you 20 straighten out this business it seems about who pays? 21 Mr. Frederick said that 50 percent would have to be paid 22 by the employee. If the union bows out and there is 23 just the employer and the employee in the arbitration, 24 that employee would have to pick up 50 percent. I think 25 I understood him to say that.

The way 22 that the parties -- the bargaining parties have 23 determined that these costs be shared is that if -- if 24 the union is not involved in a case, the employer pays. 25 And -- and so, that's -- I mean, that's right from the

And 5 there are -- are several points. First, there is no 6 conflict here in this case. The union did the right 7 thing. It turned the claim over to the individual 8 employees with their private counsel and let them go 9 arbitrate it themselves. They refused. This isn't a 10 Magnavox situation. The union is not -11 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, they didn't turn it 12 over, did they, until the action had been brought in the 13 Federal court? I mean, they didn't -- maybe I'm wrong 14 in this, but I didn't think that on day one they -- they 15 said, oh, well, because the union doesn't want to 16 proceed with this, you're welcome to chug ahead by 17 yourself. 18 MR. SALVATORE: Let me explain that time 19 frame, Justice Souter. What happened here was the claim 20 was originally tendered by these employees to the union 21 to bring an arbitration. The union decided after the 22 first hearing day with the arbitrator that they couldn't 23 go forward for whatever reasons -- it's not in the 24 record -- and then they, several months went by, these 25 employees filed with their counsel at the EEOC under
