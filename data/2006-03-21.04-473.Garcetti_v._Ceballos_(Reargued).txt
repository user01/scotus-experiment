3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 next in 04-473, Garcetti versus Ceballos.

5 Ms. Lee.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CINDY S. LEE

7 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8 MS. LEE: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and

9 may it please the Court:

10 At its core, the First Amendment is about

11 free and open debate on matters of public importance.

12 It's about citizens' rights to participate in public

13 debate and contribute their personal opinions and views

14 whether they are mainstream or not. The first

15 amendment is not, however, about policing the

16 workplace. It is not about constitutionalizing the law

17 of public employment. Nor should it be. Yet, if the

18 Ninth Circuit's approach is accepted or adopted, this

19 is what it will do.

20 In this section 1983 action, a deputy

21 district attorney prepared a disposition memorandum,

22 First Amendmentpursuant to his prosecutorial duties,

23 setting forth the reasons why, in his prosecutorial

24 judgment, the criminal case that he was supervising was

25 likely to be dismissed. The fact that the supervisor

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 did not agree with the content of that memorandum should

2 not give the plaintiff a constitutional right to

3 challenge adverse employment decisions that he claims

4 were in response to the product of that memorandum.

5 There are no First Amendment interests that

6 are served when public employees are allowed to perform

7 assigned job duties in such a way as to the

8 disagreement of the public employer. Essentially, what

9 the --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I --

11 MS. LEE: -- Ninth Circuit --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I suppose the public

13 might have an interest in knowing about this debate. I

14 don't know if you can say there are no public interest

15 served. It might be that there are other

16 counterbalancing first -- interests, but I don't think

17 you could say we have no interest in speech. This was

18 -- this is a -- on its face, a rather interesting -- a

19 rather interesting argument that they're -- that

20 they're having.

21 MS. LEE: When --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They're interested in

23 criminal law, criminal procedure, et cetera, et cetera.

24 MS. LEE: Well, it's our position that when

25 speech by public employees cannot fairly be said to be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 speech as a citizen, then the Government should have a

2 presumptive right to manage its personnel affairs and

3 internal --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- yes, that's

5 something different. But your statement, that there's

6 just no First Amendment interest --

7 MS. LEE: Well, there's no core First

8 Amendment values that are furthered when public

9 employers have to justify employment decisions that

10 they make on a routine basis.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why wasn't that

12 equally true in Connick?

13 MS. LEE: Well, the difference in Connick is

14 that the employee -- the prosecutor in that actions

15 spoke more closely with a citizen, and the Government -

16 -

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I mean that's --

18 MS. LEE: -- had --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that's a fine

20 characterization, but I'm not sure that that helps us.

21 In Connick, the one subject of the speech that was

22 held to be protected was the speech questioning

23 political pressure to help in campaigns and so on. The

24 issue here that would arguably favor protection is the

25 issue of calling public attention to lying by police

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 officers in criminal cases. And it seems to me that

2 the -- that if there's a public interest in political

3 pressure, there's a public interest in mendacity in law

4 enforcement.

5 MS. LEE: Well, if the employee is required

6 to investigate or report that kind of conduct pursuant

7 to their normal duties of employment, then that is

8 speech that the employer should absolutely or

9 presumptively have an ability to monitor.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes, but why?

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's the difference,

12 not the lack of public interest --

13 MS. LEE: That's --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that you're --

16 MS. LEE: -- absolutely right.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- pointing to, is that in

18 one case he is making this statement as an employee;

19 and you say the employer, if it's a stupid statement,

20 ought to be able to fire him for it. In --

21 MS. LEE: That's correct.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the other case, he's

23 making the statement as a member of the public. And

24 what the First Amendment is all about is that we allow

25 stupid statements to be made. Right?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. LEE: If it's not part of -- if it's --

2 if it's not part of your core job duties that you --

3 that employers should evaluate.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it may well -- I

5 guess the point that I'm trying to get at -- and it

6 goes back to your original public-interest issue -- is,

7 let's assume -- as Justice Scalia's hypo had it, let's

8 assume that the statement made by the employee on the

9 subject within job duties -- case like this one -- is,

10 in fact, a "stupid statement." Let's assume it's

11 wrong, it's inaccurate, whatnot. The issue is not

12 whether an employer, it seems to me, should, if that

13 turns out to be the case, be able to fire. The issue,

14 it seems to me, is whether, if it is not stupid, it

15 should be totally unprotected, so that the employer

16 could do anything, even if it's an accurate statement.

17 And my understanding is that your argument on public

18 interest was an argument that says, even if it's

19 accurate and they were lying and so on, that there

20 should be no protection. Am I -- and do I understand

21 you correctly?

22 MS. LEE: Well, our position is, whether or

23 not the prosecutor in this case made an accurate

24 statement during the performance of his job -- so, in

25 other words, if his disposition memorandum -- if the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 employer accepted it and agreed with it, and the case

2 didn't go any further, there wouldn't be a basis of

3 First Amendment, because normally he is acting pursuant

4 to his job duties and it's up to the employer to

5 evaluate whether or not he's adequately performing

6 those job --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but take --

8 MS. LEE: -- duties.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- take the case in which

10 the employee says, "It was accurate." The employer

11 says, "No, it was stupid. You got everything wrong."

12 I take it, in -- your position is that regardless of

13 whether the employee got it right or not, there

14 shouldn't be protection, because it's within job

15 duties. Is --

16 MS. LEE: Right. It --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that correct?

18 MS. LEE: -- should not be protected under

19 the First Amendment.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

21 MS. LEE: That's not to say that the public

22 employer is free from being challenged with regards to

23 the employment decision. It may be a matter for the

24 employee to seek, through the grievance procedure, that

25 -- like Mr. Ceballos did initially, or even pursue it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to civil service remedies. And those are the type of

2 decisions that the personnel in those departments are

3 more ably, I think, to decide.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or he could go public, I

5 assume. He could say, "I got fired for saying this.

6 And this was true." Right? Take it to the press. The

7 press would love it.

8 MS. LEE: If his job --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right?

10 MS. LEE: -- is not -- if that speech was not

11 required to be kept --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm assuming it was --

13 MS. LEE: -- internally.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not required to be kept

15 confidential.

16 JUSTICE ALITO: But if he -- if it's part of

17 his job to speak publicly, then he has no -- things

18 that are said publicly in the performance of official

19 responsibilities have no First Amendment protection?

20 MS. LEE: In our view, no. If it's a job --

21 if the public employee's assigned job duties is to, on

22 behalf of the Government or the employer, speak to the

23 public about certain things that are going on in the

24 office, and he happens to get disciplined for it, that

25 wouldn't pass our step.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE ALITO: So, what if the employer

2 tells the employee to go out and lie? There's no First

3 Amendment protection if the employee, instead, tells

4 the truth?

5 MS. LEE: Well, I don't know if that's a --

6 if that's a detailed enough hypothetical. I mean, if

7 the employee's core job duties are to report X, Y, and

8 Z, and that employee goes out to the public and reports

9 X, Y, Z, E, and F --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no, that's not --

11 MS. LEE: -- I think that's --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's not -- that's not

13 the hypothetical. So, suppose that a supervising

14 district attorney tells the deputy district attorney,

15 "Go in and make a misrepresentation to the court, or

16 conceal evidence," or whatever --

17 MS. LEE: Well, the question would be if he's

18 --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and he refuses to do

20 that, or he goes in and he says the opposite, he tells

21 the truth, and he's fired. What result?

22 MS. LEE: Well, I think the plaintiff could

23 argue that, "That's not my core job duties. My job

24 duties is to" -- if it's a prosecutor, "is to make

25 statements" --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, so --

2 MS. LEE: -- "pursuant to" --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- so you're saying that

4 there's an exception to your rule, so that if, in this

5 case, he has a -- he has a defense if he said, "Well,

6 it's my duty to call it as I see it"?

7 MS. LEE: Absolutely --

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then --

9 MS. LEE: -- not.

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, if that's so,

11 you ought to remand this case.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, sure you'd agree with

13 that, if it's his duty to call it or -- just as it's

14 the duty of a -- of a lawyer not to lie to the court.

15 If there was a similarly clear legal duty for him to

16 say something, you'd say that was part of his job

17 description, right?

18 MS. LEE: That would be the required

19 assignments of his job.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and I suppose, in

21 this case, in the hypothetical we propose, that the

22 California courts and the California bar would have

23 disciplinary mechanisms against the senior attorney who

24 hypothetically told the junior attorney to mislead.

25 MS. LEE: Well, that would be an issue of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 fact.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does California have, or

3 have not, disciplinary procedures in the hypothetical

4 case where a senior attorney who tells a junior

5 attorney lie to the court --

6 MS. LEE: They do.

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the --

9 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is it?

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the California

11 remedy? Let's say his boss says, "Don't turn over

12 Brady materials."

13 MS. LEE: And the employer goes ahead and

14 turns it over?

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

16 MS. LEE: If the boss makes a determination

17 that, "This is not Brady materials. I don't want that

18 disclosed," and the employee goes ahead and discloses

19 it, our position is, that would not be protected First

20 Amendment speech.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- you were

22 talking about public speaking. There was, as I

23 remember, a talk that was given to the Mexican-American

24 Bar Association, and that was not something that his

25 employer required him to do, but he --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. LEE: No, it wasn't. And it's not part

2 of this lawsuit, because there's no dispute that the

3 communication at issue in this case is that disposition

4 memorandum that he prepared purely pursuant to his

5 prosecutorial duties.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But would have a 1983 case

7 if he were disciplined or disadvantaged in the

8 workplace because of the talk that he gave to the

9 Mexican-American Bar Association in which he criticized

10 DA office policies?

11 MS. LEE: Then our position is, it gets past

12 step one, because it's not normally something that a

13 prosecutor is required to do, and it would be subject

14 to a balancing --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Pickering balancing, I take

16 it.

17 MS. LEE: Correct.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I thought -- correct me

19 if I'm wrong, just as a matter of fact -- I thought his

20 1983 claim listed the speech to the Mexican-American

21 Bar Association as one of the reasons that he was

22 demoted, or whatever it was, transferred.

23 MS. LEE: It was initially alleged, but,

24 through the course of discovery, the focus of it was a

25 disposition memorandum, because by the time he went to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the Mexican-American Bar Association, he had already

2 been disciplined, so there is no causation between his

3 public speech to the Mexican Bar Association and the

4 disciplinary actions that were --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the --

6 MS. LEE: -- are at issue.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the focus may have

8 changed, but, I mean, he hadn't dropped the -- he

9 hadn't dropped the claim that that was one of the

10 causes --

11 MS. LEE: Well, in --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- of the --

13 MS. LEE: -- in essence, he did, when we --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Did he?

15 MS. LEE: -- when we went to the summary

16 judgment motion. And that's why the district court was

17 very clear that the issue --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

19 MS. LEE: -- in this case was a

20 communication in the disposition memorandum. And that

21 was -- it was undisputed that that was purely pursuant

22 to his prosecutorial duties --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The court --

24 MS. LEE: -- and --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the court of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Appeals did --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the court of

4 Appeals specifically did not address the Mexican-

5 American Bar Association speech. It focused only on

6 the memorandum, correct?

7 MS. LEE: Correct.

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you concede that's

9 Pickering balancing, anyway.

10 MS. LEE: Well, in -- to the extent that he's

11 alleging that if that's -- "I went to the Mexican-

12 American Bar Association, and I alleged -- or I made

13 statements that there were some improprieties in the

14 district attorney's office," that would probably get

15 past step one and the matter of public concern, and

16 then the question would be whether or not his interest

17 in speaking as a citizen outweighed the interests of

18 the Government.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: But let me -- let me raise

20 this question. If, in this case, he gets past step one

21 because of the Mexican Bar Association speech, and if,

22 as you suggested in answer to a question a little while

23 ago, that anybody could go public and get at least past

24 step one of Pickering, what is to be gained by the

25 extremely -- well, strike the "extremely" -- what is to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 be gained by the restrictive view that you take that if

2 he doesn't go to the Bar Association, or doesn't go

3 public, there's no protection at all? In other words,

4 it seems to me that the public is being protected in a

5 way subject to an immediate end run.

6 MS. LEE: Well, I think what Your Honor is

7 really asking is, if the plaintiff in this case had

8 taken his disposition memorandum, and, rather than give

9 it to his supervisor, which what he -- what he was

10 required to do, he went to the public and gave it to

11 them on a pending case, I don't necessarily think that

12 would be protected under Pickering, as well.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: But what if he simply goes

14 to the public and says, "Look, there's Brady material

15 here, and it should be turned over, and, instead, my

16 boss is telling me to suppress it." That wouldn't be

17 turning over his work product. And I took it, from

18 what you said earlier, that, in that case, you would

19 say at least he gets pasts step one of Pickering for

20 the --

21 MS. LEE: Well, he certainly --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- newspapers --

23 MS. LEE: -- wouldn't be speaking in his

24 capacity as a prosecutor, but that doesn't necessarily

25 mean that his interests would be outweighed by the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 employer's interest. In --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, he might -- he might

3 ultimately lose, just the way, on all issues but one,

4 the employee in Connick lost. That's quite true. But

5 at least --

6 MS. LEE: And --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- there would be a claim to

8 go through the balancing --

9 MS. LEE: Well, in --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- exercise.

11 MS. LEE: -- in some respects, if you're

12 talking about job-required speech that you are -- part

13 of those duties, and the function, is to keep it

14 internally until at least there's some decision by the

15 supervisor, and, rather than do that, you send it to

16 the press or leak that information out, I think a

17 governmental disruption in efficiency can be presumed

18 there. So, I don't think it's as -- I don't think it's

19 as clear that that -- that Mr. Ceballos would have

20 ultimately prevailed under the balancing. I mean, if

21 he had taken the --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

23 MS. LEE: -- the speech externally, I think

24 there -- that he ultimately would have lost, as well --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I understand your point.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. LEE: -- because there is --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're not saying he would

3 win on Pickering balancing, but he would at least get

4 to the point of going through the balancing exercise.

5 MS. LEE: And ultimately the result would be,

6 there's no protected --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe.

8 MS. LEE: -- First Amendment speech.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

10 JUSTICE ALITO: How do you go about

11 determining whether something falls within somebody's

12 job duties? How specifically does that have to be set

13 out?

14 MS. LEE: If it's a function of the person's

15 job -- assigned job duties. So, the -- you look at the

16 speech at issue. And here is -- it's a disposition

17 memorandum that was purely pursuant to what the -- what

18 his duties required. He's -- it's normally a function

19 that the employer would take into consideration for

20 things like promotions --

21 JUSTICE ALITO: And you have to look at --

22 MS. LEE: -- or demotions.

23 JUSTICE ALITO: -- you have to look at a job

24 description? And does it have to be listed

25 specifically in a job description? Could there ever be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 things that it's understood that are things that any

2 employee ought to be concerned about, such as very

3 serious wrongdoing within the office?

4 MS. LEE: I mean, there could be situations

5 where there's a general code of conduct by all

6 employees; you know, employees who feel that they've

7 been, you know, harassed, sexually harassed, or feel

8 that others are, should report that. But that may not

9 be that person's assigned job duties. In other words,

10 that person is not assigned to investigate and report

11 those type of things.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if --

13 MS. LEE: And --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you adopt a principle

15 that every employee ought to -- ought to report to his

16 superiors known wrongdoing by his co-workers, and that

17 that's part of his job duties, you -- then you always

18 cut off the ability of that employee to go public,

19 right? I mean, that's a -- sort of an expanding

20 category, "job duties."

21 MS. LEE: Well, it would be assigned job

22 duties, things that normally the employer would take

23 into consideration for things like terminating or

24 promoting.

25 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

5 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

6 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

7 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8 please the Court:

9 Much of the work of public employees is

10 performed by speaking or writing, and much of that work

11 concerns matters of public interest. Under the Ninth

12 Circuit's decision, public employees engaged in such

13 work have at least a presumptive First Amendment right

14 to perform their jobs as they see fit.

15 That conclusion rests on a fundamentally

16 mistaken view of the First Amendment. When the

17 Government pays for somebody to do its work, it has an

18 absolute right to control and direct the manner in

19 which that work is performed. That is a basic rule of

20 agency law, and insofar as Federal employees are

21 concerned, it's a basic rule of our constitutional

22 structure. Article II of the Constitution gives the

23 President the power and responsibility to take care

24 that the laws be faithfully executed. Effectuation of

25 that power, and effectuation of the principle of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 accountability that it embodies, requires that

2 supervisors in the executive branch be able to control

3 and direct the work of their subordinates. The First

4 Amendment, which was adopted just a few years after the

5 Constitution, was not meant to interpose the First

6 Amendment in that relationship between supervisor and

7 subordinate or otherwise to regulate the internal

8 affairs of the executive branch. That is the function

9 of civil service laws adopted by the legislature and

10 internal executive branch directives taking into

11 account the relative costs and benefits of certain

12 types of regulation. And finally --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, you take the position,

14 then, that -- going to the earlier hypothetical that

15 somebody brought up, that, say, in a Brady case, if the

16 --if the Federal prosecutor believes there was Brady

17 material that -- and let's assume he's correct, just to

18 make it a simple case -- that there's Brady material to

19 be turned over, and the U.S. attorney says, "Do not

20 turn the Brady material over," that if the -- if the

21 U.S. -- if the -- if the prosecutor tells this to a

22 court, that he can be disciplined?

23 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, there would, no doubt,

24 be other restrictions. Justice Kennedy mentioned

25 ethical rules. Under the Federal whistle-blower

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statute --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I'm sure --

3 MR. KNEEDLER: -- there would --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that's so --

5 MR. KNEEDLER: -- be a restriction.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- but what about, you know,

7 the basic First Amendment --

8 MR. KNEEDLER: The First Amendment would not

9 be the -- would not be the source of protection.

10 Whether there would be some argument that, if the

11 employee could not be fired, it would be an

12 unconstitutional condition to require him to put his

13 job at peril for committing a due process violation or

14 something like that, whether there would be a claim

15 like that, that would be a different matter. But the

16 First Amendment --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: But why would you recognize

18 a due process violation if you wouldn't recognize a

19 First Amendment violation?

20 MR. KNEEDLER: Because the First Amendment

21 does not address speech that an employee undertakes in

22 the performance of his duties.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, neither does due

24 process.

25 MR. KNEEDLER: No. No, I was just suggesting

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there would have to be some unconstitutional condition.

2 Well, the due process --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but to get to the

4 unconstitutional condition, wouldn't you normally look

5 to the First Amendment?

6 MR. KNEEDLER: My point is that the due

7 process -- due process clause does address the conduct

8 at question, which is the requirement that exculpatory

9 material be turned over to the defendant. And so, the

10 question is that the employee would be put in a

11 position where he would -- where he would be instructed

12 not to perform what he understood to be a

13 constitutional violation. I think most civil service

14 laws, most ethical rules, would take care of it. And,

15 as I mentioned, the Federal whistle-blower statute, in

16 2302(b)(9), I think it is, has a provision that

17 protects employees who refuse --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And --

19 MR. KNEEDLER: -- to obey an order --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- perhaps, 1983, if you go

21 the unconstitutional condition argument, and certainly

22 in 1983 -- or arguably a civil rights prosecution

23 against the senior who ordered --

24 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, there would be -- there

25 would be those sorts of restrictions. My only point is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that the First Amendment is not addressed to speech or

2 writing that an employee undertakes in the -- in the --

3 in the course of his official duties. This --

4 JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't there this -- isn't

5 there this anomaly in the position that you're

6 advocating? It would seem to me that categories of

7 employee speech that are most likely to be disruptive

8 would be public speech that's outside of the employee's

9 duties, or internal speech that is outside of the

10 employee's duties. How much of a -- of a problem is it

11 that employees are bringing First Amendment claims

12 based on largely internal speech that falls within

13 their own job duties?

14 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that would be a huge

15 problem, because it would effectively constitutionalize

16 the day-to-day interactions between supervisors and

17 subordinates within the Government, and put the Federal

18 Courts in charge of overseeing that. Even if these

19 cases might ultimately be disposed of on summary

20 judgment, there would be discovery, there would be the

21 burdens of the litigation. And in a case like this,

22 where the -- where the Government is taking the

23 position that the -- these actions were not even taken

24 against the employee because of this disposition

25 memorandum -- they say they had perfectly valid other

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reasons -- but this case exemplifies what the problem

2 would be, is that the employee could identify something

3 that he said or did in the course of his duties that

4 involved speech and say, "That's the reason that I was

5 disciplined."

6 JUSTICE ALITO: But are these going to be

7 difficult cases under Pickering balancing? You have

8 the case like this, where the employee, let's say, says

9 to the prosecutor, "I think the case should be

10 dismissed." The prosecutor says, "Well, I'm the

11 supervisor, and I disagree. We're not going to dismiss

12 the case." Typically, the employee wouldn't be

13 disciplined for doing something like that. Now, if the

14 employee persists and, you know, is insubordinate,

15 there would be another basis for taking disciplinary

16 action.

17 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, but in this case, if we

18 look at what the Ninth Circuit said, for example, when

19 it got to step two, it said that the employee could

20 only be disciplined if the -- if the agency could show

21 that there was disruption or reckless disregard for the

22 truth. But when somebody is actually carrying out his

23 job duties --not engaged in outside activities that may

24 reflect back and be disruptive, but engaged in the job

25 duties themselves, the employer has a right to insist

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 on more than that the employee not be disruptive or

2 reckless; he has a right to insist that -- the employer

3 has a right to insist that the employee affirmatively

4 contribute to the work of the office and exercise good

5 judgment. And the -- and the supervisor has to be in a

6 position to make judgments about whether that judgment

7 was good or not.

8 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, is this going to lead

9 to difficult problems in determining what falls within

10 the job duties of a particular employee?

11 MR. KNEEDLER: I don't -- I don't think it --

12 I don't think it will, and certainly no more problems

13 than the -- than this Court has wrestled with, and the

14 lower courts have, in terms of what's a matter of

15 public concern. I think it's a common inquiry to

16 determine what a person's job duties are. And I think

17 it's a very important place to have a clear line, just

18 as there is a clear line with respect to matters of

19 public concern.

20 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose, in the memo here,

21 the assistant district attorney had said, "I think that

22 this deputy lied, and I think the deputy should be

23 fired." Now, whether the deputy should be fired or not

24 probably isn't within the job duties of this -- of this

25 employee. So, would that be outside of your rule?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I think it would probably

2 be inside the rule. I think -- I would think,

3 particularly for a -- for an assistant DA to make a

4 recommendation about the consequences of illegal

5 conduct would be within his -- within his job duties.

6 I also want to say that this Court's decision

7 in Pickering, and in that line of cases, I think, fully

8 support this, because, as this Court pointed out in

9 Connick, this Court has repeatedly stated that the

10 protection afforded by Pickering is for action taken as

11 a citizen on matters of public concern. That "as a

12 citizen" phrase was reiterated in virtually all of this

13 Court's cases in the area. And the underlying

14 principle is that --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: But does the Givhan case

16 fall within that?

17 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Yes, it does. But all

18 the Court addressed in Givhan was the question of

19 whether, if you take your concerns not publicly to the

20 newspaper, but express them to the -- in that case, the

21 principal, that you don't lose First Amendment

22 protection. But the Court did not address the question

23 of whether those comments were within the scope of the

24 employee's duties. And I think a reading of lower

25 court's decision in Givhan indicates that they were

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 not. She was an English teacher, and she was

2 commenting to the principal about employment practices

3 at the school. That would not have been within the

4 scope of her employment. And then --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if she was the vice

6 principal, that would be -- then it would come --

7 MR. KNEEDLER: I'm --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- within your --

9 MR. KNEEDLER: It might be -- it might be

10 closer to that, yes. I think, again, it would depend

11 if she was -- if she was vice principal for

12 administration or something, I think -- I think it

13 clearly would.

14 But the purpose of the Pickering line of

15 cases is to protect employees when they go outside of

16 their -- of their job, that they shouldn't be penalized

17 for having taken a job to be able to participate in

18 public affairs, as the Court put it in Pickering. That

19 does not suggest that the -- that the employee brings

20 the First Amendment into the job workplace and can use

21 it as a shield or a sword in the day-to-day

22 interactions with his supervisors, and to do so would

23 constitutionalize, as I said, the day-to-day

24 operations of employment. And this is a classic

25 example, where somebody wrote a disposition memorandum

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in the course of --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you're suggesting --

3 MR. KNEEDLER: -- in the course of those

4 activities.

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that a remark made

6 internally could not provide the basis for discipline,

7 but saying exactly the same thing publicly could. I

8 mean -- or vice versa.

9 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if it's made publicly in

10 the capacity as a citizen, assuming the public -- it

11 isn't a speech that he's making in the course of his

12 duties -- if he writes something to the press, he's

13 speaking in his capacity as a citizen. That doesn't

14 mean that it would be constitutionally protected; it

15 simply means that you get to step two of the Pickering

16 balancing, because he's not carrying --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm assuming --

18 MR. KNEEDLER: -- out the job duties.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- a case in which it would

20 be constitutionally protected. But you're saying if he

21 says it publicly -- assuming we pass the balancing test

22 -- but if he said the same thing to his boss directly

23 internally, no protection.

24 MR. KNEEDLER: No, that -- at least not if

25 it's part of his job duties. And I would think --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is a --

2 MR. KNEEDLER: -- ordinarily in that --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- rule that would sort of

4 encourage people to go public rather than --

5 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I mean --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- exhaust their internal

7 remedies.

8 MR. KNEEDLER: Two things about that. When

9 he's saying it internally, he's doing his job. When

10 he's going externally, he may be violating office

11 policies.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

13 Kneedler.

14 Ms. Robin-Vergeer.

15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BONNIE I. ROBIN-VERGEER

16 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

17 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Mr. Chief Justice, and

18 may it please the Court:

19 Petitioners contend that the First Amendment

20 provides no protection when the Government silences or

21 punishes a public employee for speaking up on a matter

22 of vital public importance in the course of performing

23 his job, even if the Government has no legitimate

24 employment reason for doing so. Such a sweeping rule

25 would stifle speech that lies at the very core of the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 First Amendment. Recognizing Richard Ceballos's claim

2 in this case would not convert every public employment

3 dispute into a constitutional case.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it's probably

5 a bit much to say that the core of the First Amendment

6 is internal employee grievances or speech. And I think

7 the concern on the other side is that you may -- as a

8 lawyer, you may have a view of what the -- what Brady

9 requires. Your superior may have a different view.

10 And just because that disagreement exists doesn't mean

11 that you have a constitutional right to continue to

12 voice your view when your superior has reached a

13 different decision.

14 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I agree with that. The

15 First Amendment doesn't bar the Government from

16 disciplining employees for insubordination or poor job

17 performance or for continuing or persisting in a matter

18 once their supervisor's told them to stop. Where an

19 adverse employment action's motivated by such

20 legitimate employment reasons, there's no First

21 Amendment violation. But the Petitioners here have not

22 claimed any legitimate interest in punishing Ceballos

23 for what he said, nor have they made the case --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, their -- the interest

25 they claim that of supervising their employees.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That is not correct. In

2 this case, the Petitioners --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that's the interest

4 that we're concerned with, is of having the Government

5 have the capacity to be able to control the speech of

6 its employees so they could have a consistent policy

7 and so that it can explain to the people what it's

8 doing.

9 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: They've articulated that

10 as an abstract principle that has no application on the

11 facts of this case, because on the --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why --

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- facts of -- sorry.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Go on. I'll let --

15 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: On the facts of this --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- let's hear your --

17 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- case, they never claim

18 that Ceballos did anything improper, that he exercised

19 poor judgment, that he was insubordinate. They just

20 said, "We didn't retaliate." That was their defense of

21 this case. And that presents a fact question for the

22 jury.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're the one that's

24 asking us to adopt a rule. And I'm suggesting to you

25 that there is an interest that's sacrificed by the rule

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that you request, and that is the Government's interest

2 in regularity and consistency of its speech. They

3 don't have to claim it on a case-by-case basis. You're

4 the ones that are asking us to make this rule.

5 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With respect, I disagree

6 with the characterization, because -- well, there are

7 three reasons why Petitioners proposed per se rule,

8 which would be unwise. And it is they who are asking

9 for a per se exclusion where the Court has not

10 previously adopted a per se exclusion. And the reason

11 why it's unwise is that it will chill speech of

12 paramount public importance by prosecutors and many

13 other public employees. It will force many public

14 employees to go public if they want any chance of

15 constitutional protection, and it will lead to

16 arbitrary and unworkable linedrawing regarding whether

17 an employee's speech falls --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

19 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- within his job duties.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because public employee

21 unions are so weak? They're the only strong unions

22 left in the country. I mean, really.

23 [Laughter.]

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: You need the Constitution to

25 protect employees against things of this sort?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Absolutely. The Court

2 has recognized, in Pickering and in other cases, that

3 the threat of dismissal from public employment is a

4 potent means of inhibiting speech. Public employees

5 who speak up within their workplaces about police

6 brutality, falsification of evidence, disaster

7 preparedness, and so on, should not be compelled to

8 shade the reports and the recommendations and tell

9 their superiors only what they want to hear or else

10 face reprisal for their candor.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but neither should a

12 superior be required to get a report from a subordinate

13 that he thinks is way off base, just a result of poor

14 judgment, thinking that there -- that there was a

15 violation here, when there -- when there obviously

16 wasn't, or using facts that were not sufficiently

17 established in order to claim such a violation.

18 Surely, the employer is entitled to say, "On the basis

19 of this report, which you gave me, you're fired."

20 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's absolutely --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- you know, or --

22 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's absolutely

23 correct. And if, in this case, that judgment had been

24 made by Ceballos's employer, that he had exercised poor

25 judgment, that he was rash or reckless in his

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 conclusions, then the employer would have had a valid

2 basis for taking an adverse employment action against

3 him. But that is not what happened in this case.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you're just

5 hiding behind the fact that they claimed that it wasn't

6 in retaliation. Your assertion still puts them in the

7 position of having to defend a constitutional claim on

8 a case-by-case basis every time there's a disagreement

9 between a subordinate and a superior about, as in this

10 case, what Brady requires.

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, actually, the

12 disagreement -- there wasn't any disagreement. He came

13 forward and exposed police misconduct. And his

14 supervisors were on his side.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was a

16 disagreement about whether or not his memorandum

17 accurately reflected, in an appropriate way, what was

18 at issue there. There was a disagreement about the

19 content of the allegations.

20 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I don't think it's

21 important, for, maybe, purposes of this, to iron this

22 out, but I -- respectfully, I don't agree with that

23 characterization, because, even in the resolution of

24 the grievance internally, the -- what they found in the

25 grievance was that they took no adverse action against

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 him because of what he said --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't --

3 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- in connection with

4 this case.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't the point. I

6 think the point is, at least for -- I think point is

7 who is going to decide whether there was some

8 justification here. And I read this memo. I thought

9 that the DA had a pretty good claim, that the police

10 didn't do anything wrong. And there's also an argument

11 they did. All right. So, who decides that kind of

12 thing? A constitutional court or a State, under its

13 protection laws or whistle-blower statutes?

14 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: And the argument that you

16 have to face, I think, is that it will be very

17 disruptive to have constitutional judges dive into

18 this, when there are so many other remedies, and where

19 the very act of their doing it, allowing discovery,

20 allowing court cases, allowing juries, itself, will

21 disrupt the Government. Now, if you say they give you

22 no protection at all, I want to hear what you have to

23 say as to what the standard is to separate the sheep

24 from the goats.

25 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Okay. There are a few

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 points embedded in the question, and I'd like to take

2 them one by one.

3 With respect to the standard, the standard

4 is, if the employer makes a judgment that the public

5 employee has not performed his or her job properly or

6 has been insubordinate, so long as that judgment isn't

7 based on a censorial type motive, like, "We don't

8 tolerate criticism of the sheriff's department,"

9 something like that, then the employer's judgment

10 prevails. And I'm not suggesting that a district --

11 Federal district Court has license to second-guess that

12 judgment, so long as that judgment's actually the

13 judgment that was made. I mean, there's a pretext

14 analysis that might be made in this case --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: The only cases that would go

16 into court are cases where the employer says, "I have

17 no reason at all for firing him"?

18 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, in a case like

19 this, the county never came forward --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's because --

21 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- and said that --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think they have a

23 better claim on the other part. I mean, if -- even if

24 you're right in this one, I promise you, the next one

25 will come along, and they'll say, "Of course we had a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 good reason for firing him. One, we didn't fire him

2 for that reason. Two, if we did, we would have been

3 justified," or whatever. So --

4 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- if your standard is, the

6 only cases that go into court under the First Amendment

7 are cases where the employer says, "I had no basis for

8 doing anything to him whatsoever," then I think there

9 will be few such cases, though you might convince me

10 that that standard --

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- wouldn't do any harm.

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- that's why I said that

14 it would be subject to a pretext analysis. The

15 employer, of course, might come back and -- and, post

16 hoc, come up with a rationale for --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that'll --

18 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- why they did --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- always be --

20 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- what they did.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the claim. That'll

22 always be the claim. They'll always say, "Oh, yes,

23 you said you did it because of that, but you did it

24 because you're retaliating" --

25 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: You know --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- "for this or that." I

2 mean --

3 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- we're not operating in

4 uncharted territory here. The rule that the Ninth

5 Circuit has adopted has been the prevailing rule in the

6 Circuits for years. And I just want to clarify

7 something that came up in the last argument, where I

8 cited some very rough statistics about the numbers of

9 cases. There's a rough -- a rough cut at the universe

10 of public employee free-speech cases, of which this

11 type of case, where the speech is part of the job, is

12 only a tiny subset. These cases are not dominating the

13 courts, and you don't have all the litigation that is

14 being --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that because --

16 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- claimed would occur.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- they're addressed

18 -- is it -- they're addressed under State and Federal

19 whistle-blower laws, or --

20 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No, that's -- actually

21 gets me back to the second part of Justice Breyer's

22 question, which is protection. And it's a complete

23 hit-or-miss situation across the country. And just to

24 respond to something that was said about the Federal

25 Whistle-blower Protection Act, that statute has a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 gaping hole in it, as construed by the Federal Circuit,

2 because the Federal Circuit has construed it to exclude

3 protection for speech that is part of the employee's

4 normal duties. So, in any case that would come up with

5 a Federal employee, leaving aside what judicial

6 remedies are even available for a Federal employee in

7 this area, the Federal employee would be largely

8 unprotected by the Federal Whistle-blower statute. And

9 with respect to what the state of law is across the

10 country, it's complete patchwork. Different types of

11 speech are protected, there's huge holes in coverage.

12 There is no --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about California,

14 which was the State where this episode occurred? Was -

15 - I think you mentioned that he did not make a claim

16 under the State statute.

17 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's correct. And it's

18 sort of interesting that neither the Petitioners, the

19 United States, or any of the amici have cited a

20 California whistle-blower statute that would have been

21 applicable to this claim. I -- frankly, I think that there

22 was one that potentially might have been applicable,

23 not cited by any of the parties, but the law was in

24 flux, and it really wasn't all that clear. And that's

25 -- and California's probably one of the better States,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in terms of whistle-blower protections, compared to --

2 and we're talking about a local government employee,

3 and the odds of protection -- it's just hit or miss

4 across the country.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying --

6 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you -- are you saying

8 the California courts would tolerate a situation where

9 a member of the bar told one of his employees to

10 misrepresent to the court?

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If you're --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The California courts --

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- referring back to

14 hypothetical --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The California courts are

16 certainly not tolerating -- and, in fact, this case was

17 heard by a California court, and the -- and the judge,

18 as I read the record -- it's not altogether clear --

19 seemed to agree with the -- with the police officers.

20 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The motion to reverse

21 that was heard by a State Court judge was not run --

22 that hearing was not run by Ceballos. It was run by

23 the defense lawyers in that case. And Ceballos's

24 testimony was limited by the prosecution's own

25 objection. So, you can't judge anything from how that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 disposition came out, whether the State Court judge

2 thought it was -- the police had lied or not lied. And

3 you can't judge anything by the way that hearing was

4 conducted.

5 But I want to return to why it's so important

6 that the Court not shrink First Amendment activity in

7 the workplace. It is of the utmost importance that

8 public employees, who internally report matters of

9 public concern, enjoy First Amendment protection, and

10 for two basic reasons. First, the public needs to have

11 a Government of public servants who do their jobs

12 honestly and with integrity, and not yes-men afraid to

13 tell public officials the bad news. A per se exclusion

14 of First Amendment protection creates a powerful

15 disincentive for deliberation within Government. The

16 last time, I cited an example of a FEMA employee who

17 was punished for saying to a supervisor that FEMA

18 wasn't ready to handle the next hurricane. But the

19 facts of this case are just as compelling, denying a

20 First Amendment protection for prosecutors who expose

21 police misconduct. And his disposition memo wasn't

22 just a prediction about whether -- how a judge would

23 rule on a motion; he exposed police misconduct and it --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's --

25 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- was so --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's not -- that's not

2 established. That's not established at all. His

3 supervisor obviously thought he didn't --

4 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I'm sorry, I didn't mean

5 to suggest that -- the truth of that allegation may be

6 open to question, but what is not open to question --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's a very serious

8 allegation for somebody who's in the position that this

9 employee was to make against police officers. And as I

10 understood the case, the supervisor said, "Wow, I don't

11 want loose cannons around down there who are accusing

12 perfectly honest and respectable police officers of

13 violating the law." Now, that --

14 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: And --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- hasn't been proven,

16 either. But --

17 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Right. I --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that is certainly a

19 possibility. And I do not want to exclude the ability

20 of a supervisor to fire somebody, if that possibility

21 exists, without having to go through extensive

22 litigation.

23 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With -- regardless of

24 whether he was ultimately correct or not, there's no

25 question, and there's no serious argument here, that he

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 had a legitimate basis for believing that police

2 misconduct had occurred. He conferred with his

3 supervisors and his colleagues before writing the memo.

4 Everyone agreed that there was a problem with the

5 warrant. And they took his allegations so seriously

6 that they released a defendant who had plead guilty.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Say it's a --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if --

9 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: And went to Jail

10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- borderline case --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- none of that were

12 true -- if none of that were true, he could still file

13 his complaint. Presumably it survives a motion to

14 dismiss, and it goes at least to summary judgment. And

15 that's true in every case of a disagreement between a

16 subordinate and a superior.

17 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's true of every

18 public employee government -- excuse me -- public

19 employee speech case, period. Almost all of these

20 cases go to summary judgment. They can't be dismissed

21 at the pleading stage, by and large, because they

22 require factual development. So, all that -- all that

23 this per se rule does is add complexity and a need

24 for greater factual development. It's not the magic

25 bullet that the Petitioners seem to think it is. The

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Givhan case suggests the unworkability of drawing the

2 First Amendment line as what's part of an employee's

3 job. Conferences between a teacher and her principal

4 take in the same level of generality as writing a

5 disposition memorandum --

6 JUSTICE ALITO: But what about the cases --

7 putting aside the clear-cut case where the employee's

8 statement is either clearly correct or clearly

9 incorrect, but what about the case where the objection

10 to what the employee is doing is the manner of the

11 speech? It's on the matter -- it's on the matter of

12 concern, but the supervisor just thinks that it's being

13 handled in a way that's ham-handed or indiscrete.

14 Aren't they going to -- aren't these cases going to

15 cause terrible litigation problems?

16 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No, they won't, and they

17 haven't. If the employee -- employer has a concern

18 about the manner in which it's communicated, that is a

19 valid employment concern. I mean, suppose Ceballos had

20 gone a had a big meeting with --

21 JUSTICE ALITO: But under --

22 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- the sheriff's department -

23 -

24 JUSTICE ALITO: -- then under Pickering --

25 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- and embarrassed them?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE ALITO: -- the test is going to be

2 whether the manner, which may be difficult to recreate,

3 caused -- how much of a disruption it caused to the

4 operations of the office.

5 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: These -- you'd think that

6 if there was that type of disruption and hindrance of

7 the way public agencies were carrying out their

8 missions by these kinds of cases, which have been

9 around for a long time, that you'd see citations to

10 them in the Petitioner's brief, in the United States

11 brief. And their silence on this point is both

12 deafening and telling, because, in fact, it has not

13 been the problem that is being posited here, and this

14 is not a new approach that we're talking about.

15 But getting back to the Givhan case,

16 conferences between teachers and principals are a part

17 of the teacher's job, and it's pure formalism to make

18 the protected status of the Givhan teacher's speech

19 turn on whether the employee manual says a teacher has

20 to work to root out race discrimination. Or what if

21 she was a part-time ombudsman who is charged to improve

22 race relations in the school? Under their approach,

23 you know, boom, it's not protected speech anymore, even

24 though the underlying First Amendment value is exactly

25 the same. It also makes it completely subject to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 manipulation by the employer in making everything a

2 part of an employer -- employee's job, in terms of

3 reporting duties, which --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The First Amendment value

5 may be the same, but it -- but what is present is

6 another value. And unless the person is willing to go

7 public, in which case the balancing occurs, and

8 assuming there's no prohibition of it, that other value

9 is a very significant one, the ability of public

10 officials to run their offices.

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But here's the problem

12 with going public. It's perverse to create an incentive

13 for employees to go public, especially employees in

14 sensitive position -- in a sensitive position. The

15 First Amendment consequences here are especially grave,

16 because Ceballos had no realistic alternative channel

17 for communication open to him. Had he gone to a blog,

18 Web site, podcast, and so on, as Petitioners say in

19 their reply brief, or held a press conference, or gone

20 to Los Angeles Times, and so on, he'd be fired, and

21 he'd lose any First Amendment case that he brought.

22 So, what avenue does a prosecutor who wants --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: But what he has --

24 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- to bring --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: But the argument that I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 think people are worried about, against you, is, you

2 have a case -- it's actually a wonderful example. Your

3 client thinks that, in the affidavit that the sheriffs

4 gave supporting the warrant, they didn't tell the

5 truth, because they said that whoever was looking into

6 it, you know, said there was a private driveway and

7 that there were tire tracks, and there were no tire

8 tracks, and it wasn't a private driveway. The other

9 side says, "Yes, it was a long road, but sort of like a

10 driveway, and the edge of the -- of the driveway was

11 broken down, and that's what the sheriff's deputies

12 were referring to." I found it a dispute on both

13 sides.

14 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, you know --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, if, in fact, he's being

16 disciplined for that, the other side is telling you he

17 has a lot of remedies, he has a variety of remedies.

18 Go to the bar associations. Many States have laws, the

19 statutes that protect people under these situations.

20 And why suddenly go to a constitutional court to get

21 the same relief which will short circuit all the other

22 remedies? And if you do, there are going to be

23 thousands of cases less good than yours, and they'll

24 all run to -- to the constitutional court. All right.

25 So, now, what's your reply?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There is no baseline

2 level of protection that is available by statute or

3 civil service protections. If the Court recognizes

4 that the speech involved here, exposing Government

5 misconduct and so on, is important for First Amendment

6 purposes, as it has previously recognized, then it's --

7 then it needs to be a baseline level of First Amendment

8 protection. And then if whistle-blower statutes are

9 passed that protect it beyond the baseline level,

10 that's fine. I'm not maligning whistle-blower

11 statutes. But there is no such level of protection

12 that is guaranteed. For someone in his position, if

13 the First Amendment does not protect his speech, it's

14 just not protected.

15 And I want to get back to -- I started to say

16 why it's so important that the speech be protected.

17 It's not just that the public needs to have a

18 Government of public servants, but the Government needs

19 to know how it's operating. How can Government

20 function efficiently and effectively if it does not

21 possess the information it needs to make responsible

22 choices? When an employment decision is actually made

23 because the employee has made a bad judgment and he

24 reached an unwarranted conclusion in his memo, or the

25 manner in which he conveyed it was terribly indiscrete,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 he publicized in front of the whole sheriff's

2 department, and embarrassed them, when that's an issue,

3 then the employment can respond, and the courts will

4 make quick -- short shrift of those cases, as they do

5 now.

6 JUSTICE ALITO: When --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that --

8 JUSTICE ALITO: It --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- was my point

10 earlier. They can't make short shrift of those cases,

11 because they're not going to be thrown out at the

12 pleading stage. They're going to have to progress at

13 least to summary judgment, probably in every case in

14 which an employee is terminated, because now one of his

15 defenses against termination is, "You're violating my

16 First Amendment rights."

17 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But, I mean, the Court

18 needs to appreciate that for the universe of public

19 employee free-speech cases, they're mostly decided at

20 summary judgment; they aren't decided on the pleadings.

21 That's already the case. And all that adding a job-

22 duty element to it is, adds complexity and requires

23 more factual development. It -- there's a number of

24 issues here. First of all, what counts as part of an

25 employee's job? Does the speech have to be required by

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the job, or merely related to the job? How do you

2 judge if the speech meets the test? Do you go by the

3 job description? Common practice? What if the

4 employee's speech is not required by the job, but some

5 independent ethical duty compelled him to come forward

6 --

7 JUSTICE ALITO: If Pickering --

8 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- as is the case here?

9 And, also, what if the employee --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Cases involving those

11 questions would have to go to the courts, I assume.

12 But they'd be a small percentage of all the cases that

13 would go to the courts if we adopt your position. I

14 agree, there will still be some cases left that'll have

15 to go to the courts to sort out these questions that

16 you mentioned. But that's going to be a small

17 percentage of the totality.

18 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, it's already a

19 small percentage of the totality, because cases of this

20 type, which involve speech by a public employee while

21 they're doing their job, however that is formulated,

22 are already a small subset of the universe of public

23 employee --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Perhaps --

25 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- cases.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because it's been

2 unclear, until this Court has spoken to the subject,

3 and especially in light of the dicta in our prior

4 cases, which says that he has to be speaking publicly.

5 The reason for the -- for the -- for the paucity of

6 cases can be, simply, that the law was not clear, and

7 most people thought the way -- the way your opponent in

8 this case thinks.

9 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's incorrect. I

10 mean, most of the Circuits have addressed this

11 question, and virtually all of them are -- have sided

12 with the Ninth Circuit and has -- have refused to draw

13 a bright-line rule when speech has come up as part of

14 the job.

15 And the -- and as -- Justice Scalia, you seem

16 to be referring to the "as a citizen" phrase the Court

17 has used in its opinions. And I want to address that.

18 No decision by this Court has ever turned on the "as a

19 citizen" phrase, and it's always been used in

20 conjunction with "matter of public concern." The most

21 that can be said is the phrase characterizes the facts

22 of the cases in which the Court used it. The Court

23 hasn't addressed whether speech that's part of the job

24 --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but the Court didn't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 say this guy had blue eyes.

2 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Speech --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: It said he was speaking as a

4 -- that seemed to the Court to be important to its

5 decision.

6 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Speech -- and I don't

7 mean to suggest it has no meaning, but "speech as a

8 citizen" means speech that one can readily imagine a

9 concerned citizen engaging in. You can imagine a

10 concerned citizen coming forward to report race

11 discrimination --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not --

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- in a school.

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the context in

15 which this law developed. It developed, originally --

16 if you were a public employee, you did not have free-

17 speech rights as a citizen. As Justice Holmes said,

18 you know, you might have the right to speak, but you

19 don't have the right to be a policeman. So, the "as a

20 citizen" part didn't come out of happenstance.

21 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Right.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was recognizing

23 that when you are speaking "as a citizen,"

24 juxtaposition to "as an employee," then you do have

25 First Amendment rights.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But if you look at the

2 way it was used in Pickering, which, of course, is a

3 different case -- but, in Pickering, the Court was

4 emphasizing that public employees, like all citizens,

5 have an interest in speaking on a matter of public

6 concern. The Court, in Connick, suggested that if the

7 prosecutor there had spoken to bring to light actual or

8 potential wrongdoing or breach of public trust, her

9 speech would have presumptively been protected. If she

10 had done that, she'd be speaking in the same capacity

11 that Ceballos spoke here. One can readily imagine a

12 concerned citizen stepping forward to expose Government

13 misconduct. And it can be difficult to sort out in

14 which capacity an employee is speaking. And sometimes

15 an employee can speak in more than one capacity at

16 once.

17 JUSTICE ALITO: If Pickering balancing is

18 done, is there anything special about the situation

19 where the employee's speech is part of the employee's

20 job duties? Is the test applied differently in that

21 situation?

22 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It does, because if the

23 employer makes a judgment -- as I said before, if the

24 employer makes a judgment that the employee has carried

25 his job duties poorly, incompetently, insubordinately,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and so on, that interest is -- it's either dispositive

2 of the balance, or it's nearly so. And it -- so, from

3 that standpoint, the Court could put a gloss on the

4 Pickering balance that explains or emphasizes that the

5 employer's interests are controlling how the jobs are

6 performed, prevails.

7 But to get back, for a moment, to the --

8 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I'm not sure I understood

9 that answer. So, in this situation, if the employer

10 said that Mr. Ceballos was performing his job poorly,

11 that would be enough to tip the balance in the

12 employer's favor --

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If that was --

14 JUSTICE ALITO: -- under Pickering here?

15 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If that were really the

16 case. In a case like this, it would be clearly

17 pretextual, because not only -- not only was that not

18 the basis that was actually offered, but the employer

19 sided with him initially and released the defendant and

20 said he had a legitimate basis for speaking, and called

21 a meeting with the sheriff's department, and took all

22 these steps to show that they actually sided with him.

23 And only when the sheriff's department accused him of

24 -- as acting like a public defender and said, "We're

25 going to get sued if you don't back us up," then the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 office changed its position and went against Ceballos.

2 So, in a case like this, it would clearly be

3 pretextual. In another case, however, it would not --

4 presumably there are cases where it would not be

5 pretextual.

6 JUSTICE ALITO: So, basically, the test --

7 the Pickering balancing is the same in this situation

8 as it is in, let's say, the Givhan situation.

9 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, this case is almost

10 identical to Givhan. The only -- the only thing is

11 that the Court, in Givhan, didn't expressly opine on

12 what capacity in which she was speaking. But it clear

13 that --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I --

15 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- a teacher speaking --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I --

17 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- in both capacities --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you? I

19 thought you said that, in this case, as distinct from

20 Givhan, there would be cognizable employer interests in

21 incompetence, the truth of what was said, the capacity

22 to do the job without roiling the waters unduly, and so

23 on. And that, I take it, is not necessarily so in a

24 Givhan situation. Or is it?

25 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: In --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe the employer has the

2 same interest in each. I --

3 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I think --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I have --

5 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- the employer had the

6 same interest in both cases. The question in Givhan

7 was the fact that it was an internal report to the

8 employer: Did that matter? Did that reduce its

9 protection? The Court said no. So, the only thing

10 that it would take to make Givhan exactly like this is

11 to put it in the employee manual or make her an

12 ombudsman so it's -- so there's not even room for

13 argument that it was part --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but in --

15 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- of her job.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in Givhan, if the

17 employee's assigned duties were all done competently,

18 but she had just gone off the deep end on racial

19 balance or something, the employer would not have had -

20 - if -- so long as it was the -- a private

21 communication like that, I don't know that the employer

22 would have had an interest in saying, "Well, you're

23 incompetent on the subject of racial balance, and

24 therefore I -- you know, I'm going to demote you or

25 fire you." But in the case in which the employee is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 talking on the subject within the job description, then

2 the employer has got -- I thought you were saying he's

3 got a direct interest in competence, truth, and so on.

4 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes, that's --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

6 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- that's correct.

7 That's right.

8 Let me turn, just for a second, to -- getting

9 back to the complexity here, and the linedrawing that

10 has to be done. The Petitioner's own hypotheticals

11 underscore the arbitrariness and unworkability of their

12 approach. In -- if you look in the reply brief, at

13 page 13, note 11, they cite, as an example, a county

14 emergency-room doctor who -- and then they put "is not

15 part of their normal duties," to sort of build it into

16 the hypothetical -- would have a right, a First

17 Amendment right, to come forward and talk about

18 inefficiencies in a county emergency room. Whereas,

19 the State health inspector, who finds health code

20 violations in nursing homes do not. The First

21 Amendment value in those situations are the same. And,

22 if anything, it's greater for the county emergency --

23 for the -- for the -- I've said this backwards -- the

24 county emergency-room doctor who's talking about how

25 the -- how the county hospital is operating. There's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

58

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 no difference there. And it's a completely arbitrary

2 linedrawing.

3 Suppose Ceballos had gone outside the chain

4 of command, suppose he had reported to Garcetti that

5 there was police misconduct. It's not clear where that

6 position would -- where their position would lead them.

7 Now it's not part of his normal job duty to go talk to

8 the DA. He's bypassed the chain of command. But it

9 seems that they would say that, "Well, because it was

10 not part of his normal job duty, it -- then it would be

11 protected." And, if so, what message is that sending

12 public employees about whether they should follow their

13 employer's own rules about how you communicate in the

14 workplace and what the chain of command is? It doesn't

15 make any sense to force public employees to go public,

16 as that does more to increase disharmony and disruption

17 in the workplace than having an employee like Ceballos,

18 who followed every rule and every order and instruction

19 regarding how to handle the case and how to communicate

20 within the workplace.

21 Connick said that the First Amendment's

22 primary aim is the full protection of speech upon

23 issues of public concern, as well as the practical

24 realities involved in the administration of a

25 Government office. The proposed rule is inconsistent

1 with that primary aim. It doesn't do anyone any good

2 to have U.S. attorneys and DAs blind-sided by coverups

3 in their office because their employees were afraid to

4 come forward and tell their supervisors the bad news.

5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, for that reason,

6 they're -- for that reason, they're not likely to --

7 in most instances, they would not be hostile to

8 receiving that kind of information, if it was provided

9 to them.

10 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: May I answer?

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

12 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Unfortunately, there's

13 too much evidence, there's too much water under the

14 bridge, that shows that public employees who deliver

15 bad news, and are the unwelcome messenger, do face

16 retaliation in their workplaces. And here, Ceballos

17 told his workplace, his supervisors, that police

18 misconduct had occurred, and that was an unwelcome

19 message, and he was retaliated against for that reason.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Robin-

21 Vergeer.

22 Ms. Lee, you have 3 minutes remaining.

1 I think that's an important point, Justice

2 Alito. I mean, in this case, it's exactly what

3 happened. The supervisors took Mr. Ceballos's

4 assessment seriously. And the difference was, after

5 they further thought about it, they didn't think --

6 they didn't agree with the proper course of action for

7 the district attorney's office, especially since there

8 was a motion pending, "Let's let the courts decide

9 that." So, if -- where -- I think Plaintiff's

10 suggesting that, but for protecting speech that's

11 required by the duties of employment, employees really

12 would not have much of a right or a remedy if it turns

13 out that the employer believed that maybe they weren't

14 performing their jobs correctly, or, in our case, if

15 the supervisor had considered the speech and said, "You

16 know what? You made a bad judgment call, and we don't

17 think it's entitled to a promotion," that shouldn't

18 give the Plaintiff a constitutional right to challenge

19 that decision. If that -- if the -- if Mr. Ceballos

20 was, in fact, doing his job, that was required of his

21 job, and he was doing it competently, his remedy is not

22 the First Amendment. His remedy is not even -- he

23 doesn't even need a whistle-blower statute for that.

24 He could go through civil service, he could go through

25 a formal grievance procedure, and though -- although

61

1 State statutes on whistle-blowers do vary, there is no

2 State statute, in my understanding, that covers broadly

3 than what the Ninth Circuit does here --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Lee --

5 MS. LEE: -- which is --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what do you respond to

7 the argument that this has been the law in a number of

8 Circuits and the sky has not fallen?

9 MS. LEE: Well, the reason that job-required

10 speech may not be -- may not be filed, or basis for

11 First Amendment retaliation, or the reason why we may

12 not have seen that, may simply be because public

13 employees understandably do not believe they're

14 exercising their First Amendment rights when they are

15 simply performing their duties of employment, when

16 they're speaking pursuant to their job duties or

17 writing reports or memorandums pursuant to their job

18 duties. Just because there may not be the significant

19 increase of First Amendment litigation in the public

20 employment context for purely job-required speech does

21 not mean that this Court should not consider this

22 issue.

23 And I disagree with the representation that

24 the facts in this case are identical to Givhan. This

25 Court commented in that decision that Givhan was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1 citizen speech. And I don't necessarily think that --

2 and it -- what -- that -- where our proposal -- our

3 approach would add further complexity to First

4 Amendment litigation in an employment context. It's

5 certainly not a difficult decision -- analysis in this

6 case.

8 MS. LEE: Thank you.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Ms. Lee.
