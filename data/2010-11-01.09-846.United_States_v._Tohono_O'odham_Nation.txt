1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:05 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Case 09-846, United States v. Tohono 5 O'Odham Nation. 6 Mr. Yang. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 This Court in Keene held that section 1500 12 of Title 28 deprives the Court Of Federal Claims has 13 jurisdiction when the plaintiff has a pending suit in 14 another court based on substantially the same operative 15 facts and left open the question whether some overlap in 16 the relief requested is also necessary to trigger that 17 bar. The Federal Circuit erred in holding that section 18 1500 applies when both suits -- only when both suits 19 seek the same relief, and that the critical distinction 20 in this regard is whether the particular relief in the 21 plaintiff's plea for relief is deemed legal or 22 equitable. 23 Section 1500's text broadly bars CFC 24 jurisdiction whenever any suit that the plaintiff has 25 pending in any other court is a suit for the CFC claim

1 or is merely a suit in respect to that claim. In other 2 words, another suit for a different but a related claim 3 will trigger section 1500. 4 That provision was intended to protect the 5 government from simultaneous duplicative suits against 6 the United States and its agents by forcing plaintiffs 7 to elect between those related suits. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you recognize that 9 sequential suits could be brought. So that if the case 10 in the district court went to final judgment, then it 11 would be okay to go to the Court Of Federal Claims. 12 MR. YANG: That is correct. In some, in 13 perhaps a good number of cases, it's possible to, if you 14 are seasonably prompt in your Court Of Federal Claims 15 case or your district court case first - 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't have 17 control over how long the district court case is going 18 to take, and there is no mechanism to stop the running 19 of the statute of limitations. 20 MR. YANG: Well, I think there is some 21 control that you can exercise over the -- how promptly 22 the suit proceeds. Particularly if we are talking about 23 suits against the government, many suits proceed on an 24 administrative record and go directly to summary 25 judgment; that can be done in a relatively prompt

1 manner. 2 But even if not, the Congress that enacted 3 section 1500 in 1868 knew that essentially what it was 4 doing in many, many cases would prevent a second suit 5 from going forward. That's because the Congress was 6 concerned with the cotton claimants. The cotton 7 claimants had authorization to bring suit in the Court 8 of Claims, but there was a two-year statute of 9 limitations. That statute ran from the end of the Civil 10 War. And this Court in a case called U.S. v. Anderson 11 at 76 U.S., and the relevant pages are 70 to 71, made 12 clear that the end of the Civil War for the purposes of 13 that statute was August in 1866. 14 Congress enacted section 1500 in June of 15 1868. There was a two-month window, if that, to bring 16 suit and Congress recognized, it would have recognized, 17 that if you filed suit or were forced to elect at that 18 point, that would be the end of the game. 19 There was also another statutory provision 20 that Congress enacted during the Civil War that put a 21 two-year statute of limitations on suits against 22 officers. That was discussed in this Court's decision, 23 Mitchell v. Clark, 110 U.S. 633 at pages 641 and 642. 24 So given the time at which Congress was 25 enacting section 1500, it knew it was putting plaintiffs
5

1 to a very hard choice. You had to elect between the 2 Court Of Federal Claims remedy and between a remedy in 3 another court against an officer. That remedy would 4 likely be the end of the game. And Congress did that in 5 a very particular way. It did it in a targeted statute 6 that limited the authority of the court that had its 7 hands on the purse strings of the Federal Government, 8 and that performed the very function that Congress just 9 a few years earlier had itself exercised through the 10 enactment of private bills through its appropriations 11 power. 12 So section 1500 ultimately states in essence 13 that if you are going to bring suit in this specialized 14 court where Congress has vested the Court of Claims with 15 the very special power of distributing money from the 16 Federal fisc, that you could only bring one suit arising 17 from the same operative facts in order to be in that 18 court. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's - 20 you just - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the cotton cases, why 22 isn't my reading of it quite very simple, which is 23 Congress was concerned with ensuring that a claimant 24 didn't get double-recovered in two different suits. 25 MR. YANG: Well -

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that a simple - 2 you know, you've got people suing in different 3 jurisdictions over getting the same pot of money or 4 something close to it. Why isn't our view of 1500 just 5 simply you can't have two suits that are seeking the 6 same pot? 7 MR. YANG: Well, it wasn't the same pot of 8 money. The Abandoned and -- Abandoned Property 9 Collection Act -- we will call it APCA -- provided for a 10 special statutory trust remedy. That remedy was for the 11 net proceeds of anything -- any -- any auction sales 12 that might have resulted from cotton. If the cotton was 13 lost, it was damaged, it was destroyed, if the proceeds 14 were paid but ultimately didn't make their way into the 15 fisc, you got nothing or you got a substantially reduced 16 fund. If you sued in court, you might be able to sue, 17 as we explained in our reply brief, under certain 18 doctrines that would give you the property in specie, or 19 you could seek monetary relief. These are quite 20 different things. And even in -- it's not - 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you couldn't get 22 both. I mean, that's I think Justice Sotomayor's point, 23 about duplication. It's not -- even if you can say, 24 yes, it's a different mode of relief, but you could - 25 couldn't get -- I mean, suppose we didn't have 1500 and
7

1 you prevailed in your suit on the APCA or whatever you 2 call the statute. You could not then turn around and 3 sue the government official, because you have the -- the 4 single claim, you've been compensated. 5 MR. YANG: I don't know - 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not here -- it's 7 quite different. I mean, one suit is not precluded by 8 the other. You -- you recognize that by saying you 9 could bring the Claims Court suit after the district 10 court suit. That's not so in -- in the cotton cases. 11 MR. YANG: You may in certain instances. 12 But particularly in the cotton cases, Congress knew that 13 it -- what it was doing was forcing one path and only 14 one path. It wasn't about duplicative recovery. You 15 had to choose and you not -- you weren't going to have 16 time to bring another suit, and Congress would have 17 known that when it enacted the section 1500's 18 predecessor two months before the statute ran in APCA 19 and perhaps after the statute ran for bringing a tort 20 suit against officials under the cases -- the statute 21 that this Court construed in Mitchell. 22 So it wasn't simply that duplicative relief 23 was at issue, Congress was actually forcing you to make 24 a choice in cases where the types of relief are quite 25 different. And the type of relief, for instance, that
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you would get in a suit against an agent of the United 2 States, what you get out of that suit is not a pot of 3 money; the court does not say at the end of the case, 4 here you go, you asked for $1,000, here it is. The 5 court enters an order; it enters a judgment. It says, 6 "Defendant, perhaps Tony Yang, officer of the 7 government, you pay $100 million, $50 million." 8 It doesn't mean much to the plaintiff if 9 they get at Tony Yang as an individual. This is very 10 different relief than a money judgment against the 11 United States. It's not the same relief. And in fact, 12 we don't normally think of a claim as embodying a 13 particular type of relief, which is the submission of 14 the trial here. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I'm not sure I 16 understand your answer to my question. Assuming you had 17 a recovery under the -- for the -- confiscated cotton, 18 under the one route you had a recovery. You could not 19 sue again under the other route without -- leaving aside 20 1500, because the claim would be precluded. 21 MR. YANG: That might have been true in one 22 direction but maybe not in the other. And let me 23 explain. The -- I'm not sure that there was an instance 24 of this happening because of section 1500's existence, 25 but if you had, for instance, obtained damages against
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 an individual agent in a suit and you still could have 2 brought suit within the Abandoned -- Abandoned Property 3 Collection Act, the Abandoned Collection Property Act 4 provided a statutory trust for the owner of the cotton. 5 It's not at all clear that that would have been 6 precluded. There may well have been, but for the 7 statute of limitations problem, the ability to get a 8 double recovery. 9 But nevertheless, I mean, our submission 10 ultimately turns on our understanding of the text of 11 this statute, which is quite broad. The text not only 12 precludes - 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's 14 not -- it's not as broad as your test, "arising out of 15 the same operative facts." It doesn't say that; it says 16 "any claim for and respect to which." And it seems to 17 me that the facts of this case draw that precise 18 distinction. When you are asking for an accounting, you 19 are not raising any claims about people doing anything 20 bad at all. You are just saying, let me know what I've 21 got. And then when you bring a claim for -- for money 22 because of mismanagement of the trust, that's -- that's 23 quite different. 24 MR. YANG: I -- that's -- that's true in 25 some cases of an accounting. It's not true on these
10

1 complaints. The complaints here are -- they have the 2 sense of a kitchen sink type of a pursuit of these 3 claims against the United States. The district court 4 case is not simply seeking an accounting of old money, 5 as the Tribe submits. It actually alleges a whole slew 6 of breaches, including the breach to -- to -- of failure 7 to invest money properly, failing to put it to its 8 highest use, says the true balances would be far greater 9 but for these breaches. 10 It specifically seeks a - 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- is that 12 to assert the basis about why an accounting should be 13 required? 14 MR. YANG: No, because back -- the counts - 15 these are back on pages 90 and 91a of the petition 16 appendix. The Tribe not only seeks an accounting, but 17 it also seeks an order to comply with all other 18 fiduciary duties determined by the court. This is 19 paragraph 42. 20 It goes on to say that the tribe is not only 21 entitled to object and essentially challenge the 22 accounting, but it's entitled to any other equitable 23 relief that might be appropriate in light of the -- the 24 court's decision in the case. 25 So the tribe is in no way trying in the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 district court simply to seek an accounting. Just like 2 in the Court of Federal Claims, it's not simply looking 3 to what they claim to be new money. The specific 4 allegations in the CFC complaint say that there has been 5 no money for the -- no accounting for the revenue 6 collected. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is the - 8 maybe I don't know enough about what an accounting is. 9 But why would it be other equitable relief to which they 10 are entitled if they simply say, we want to know what 11 we've got? 12 MR. YANG: The tribe - 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they can get - 14 and then it may be a basis for a further claim that, if 15 that's all we've got, where did the rest of it go, and 16 that might be the Court of Claims action. But it does 17 strike me that they are different -- claims for 18 different relief. 19 MR. YANG: It -- it should be that way if 20 there were a narrowly tailored APA-type-like suit in 21 district court, but that's not this. The tribe's 22 complaints both invoke, for instance, the Cobell 23 litigation which has been going on in -- in D.C. for 24 quite some time, and are modeled on the same types of 25 broad claims that are at issue at Cobell.

1 This is not a simple case where there is 2 agency action withheld and a court says: Agency, you 3 had X duty; do it. This is a -- a situation where the 4 tribe is seeking to impose itself on age-old decisions 5 that have been made a long time ago and to seek to 6 revisit them and at the end of the day restate their 7 accounts to reflect what they think should be in the 8 trust fund. 9 This parallels in both the Federal 10 Circuit -- the Court of Federal Claims and the district 11 court suit. There is substantial overlap in the 12 operative facts. As the two judges -- the only two 13 judges to have addressed this - 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it accounting 15 what should have been in the trust fund or what actually 16 is? You say give me an accounting of the trust fund. 17 Does the officer go back and just add up the bank 18 accounts and value the land and all that? Or - 19 MR. YANG: Well, there's a difference - 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- does he go back 21 and say, well, this should be there but it's not? 22 MR. YANG: The -- there is a difference 23 between the parties, and I don't think it's been fully 24 fleshed out here, about what an accounting is. The 25 statute at issue that the tribe invokes for the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 accounting in our view provides a prospective obligation 2 for the government to provide quarterly statements of 3 what's coming in and out of the account going forward. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Going forward. 5 MR. YANG: Going forward, not going back, 6 and only with respect to moneys that were deposited or 7 invested under a specific statutory authority that 8 involves deposits that were made in banks. So in our 9 view -- you know, our view and the tribe's view I think 10 are quite different in terms of what's at issue in the 11 district court case. And unfortunately, that's not the 12 case that's before you here. But what we're trying to 13 do is say whether or not there is substantial overlap 14 between the two. And - 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, are you at 16 cross-purposes on those two issues? When it comes to 17 what an accounting is, you want to say, oh, that's just 18 going forward; when it comes to this 1500 question you 19 want to say they're the same as the money damages, which 20 goes backward? 21 MR. YANG: No, I don't think we are at 22 cross-purposes. What we are saying is what the 23 complaint alleges. We don't control how the tribe seeks 24 to assert rights. We think that the complaint may be 25 overbroad, but that's not the correct question.

1 I mean, this Court in Keene, for instance, 2 addressed suits which had been dismissed because they 3 were improperly brought in district court, and those 4 suits in district court were sufficient to trigger 5 section 1500's jurisdictional bar simply because they 6 were asserting claims that overlapped with the claims 7 that were at issue in the CFC. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you read the claim in 9 section 1500 the same way that it should be -- or do you 10 think we should read it the same way in 1500 and 11 12(b)(6), failure - 12 MR. YANG: I think so. I mean - 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Whether or not you've 14 stated a claim upon which relief can be granted? 15 MR. YANG: Right, which draws a distinction 16 between the claim and the relief, right? If relief were 17 the particular type of relief, as the tribe asserts, the 18 rule would simply say "failure to state a claim," 19 because you would have failed to state a certain 20 element, a necessary element, of the claim. Instead, it 21 says "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be 22 granted." 23 And I think that -- that keys into the other 24 important provision of rule -- the Civil Rules for this 25 purpose, which is Rule 54(c), which makes clear that the
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 relief that might be initially stated in a complaint is 2 not the relief that is at issue in the case. 3 The relief that comes at issue in the case 4 is the relief that the -- that is proven, whether it be 5 at summary judgment or at trial. And even if, for 6 instance, you ask for a dollar in damages in your 7 complaint, it may well be that at trial you establish 8 your entitlement to injunctive relief or damages far in 9 excess. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not so, not so here, 11 because of the way Congress has set up the authority of 12 each court. You could never -- what is it, 54(c) or - 13 MR. YANG: (C). 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 54(c) is the relief to 15 which you were entitled. The only relief to which you 16 were entitled in the one court, the Court of Claims, is 17 compensatory damages. So there isn't a question of some 18 other form of relief. You have to go to another forum 19 to get different relief. 20 MR. YANG: Well, yes and no. The district 21 court complaint, for instance -- and again, we contest 22 this, but they seek a restatement of their accounts. 23 They seek remedies such as equitable disgorgement and 24 the like. These are monetary remedies that go, again, 25 to the same types of issues.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: But I also thought that the 2 Court of Claims could give - 3 MR. YANG: All of these claims could be 4 brought - 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could be brought - 6 MR. YANG: -- in the Court of Claims. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: They can give injunctive 8 relief where that's necessary. 9 MR. YANG: That's correct, but if you have a 10 claim, for instance -- taking the old money/new money 11 framework, which we don't think is borne out by the 12 complaints, but even if we were correct, if they were 13 seeking so-called old money in district court -- that 14 is, money that should have been there, but was 15 improperly allocated and therefore didn't show up in 16 their account -- they could also bring a claim under the 17 Indian Tucker Act claiming that there was some breach of 18 duty under a statute or regulation, clear and -- this is 19 a Navajo Nation-type question -- and you could get an 20 accounting through -- in order to determine the proper 21 amount that should be there. 22 So this is a way -- the problem that we have 23 here, particularly in these cases where there's an 24 allegation of 100 years of trust duties going back, and 25 simultaneously litigating these cases in courts that
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 might have different views on discovery obligations, 2 different views of the law on various point cases. 3 One of the cases that we cite in the 4 appendix to the petition, the Ak-Chin case, the CFC 5 ordered discovery, for instance, that we have to conduct 6 a review of 33,000 boxes of materials from the archives. 7 Although we claim there is an APA case going on in 8 district court, the plaintiffs are seeking discovery 9 there. We are fighting it. But this type of 10 duplicative legislation and burden on the government is 11 precisely what Congress in 1868 said: If you are going 12 to bring suit - 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any instance 14 you've been able to think of where an Indian tribe could 15 have a claim for money of some kind and some other kind 16 of relief that they seek where they couldn't get it all 17 in the Court of Claims? 18 MR. YANG: A declaratory judgment, for 19 instance. Some -- many -- some of these cases arise - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Declaratory judgment. Is 21 there anything else? 22 MR. YANG: Um -- well, I mean, you wouldn't 23 be able to get injunctive relief. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: No injunctive relief. 25 MR. YANG: Not normally in the Court of
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Claims. There are exceptions. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: No matter what. Okay. 3 Well, then they have a problem, because they might want 4 -- they might want some money and they want an 5 injunction. So what are they supposed to do? 6 MR. YANG: There is no question that section 7 1500 may put a plaintiff at a difficult choice. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a big choice. 9 MR. YANG: It's a choice that has existed 10 since 1868, when Congress - 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: To test that choice - 12 it's pretty stark in the Casman case, where Congress 13 said back pay is for the Claims Court, reinstatement for 14 the district court. 15 But your position is that under your reading 16 of Casman -- let's forget about Congress's amendment. 17 Under your reading of the statute, the Casman decision 18 was wrong and the plaintiff had to choose either back 19 pay or reinstatement; there was no way to get both. 20 MR. YANG: That's correct. And I think that 21 was this Court's suggestion at the end of Keene, when 22 the Court recognized that because there are complicated 23 jurisdictional regimes that apply when you sue the 24 government, the Court explained there may well be 25 situations where this precludes a plaintiff from seeking
19
Alderson Reporting Company

1 all the relief that you would otherwise be able to get 2 if you could bring suit separately. 3 And the Court in Keene said: Look, if there 4 is apparent hardship -- this is following its decision 5 in Corona Coal, which is 1924. If there is a hardship 6 in the statute, it is a question that must be directed 7 to Congress, because Congress is the one that set this 8 up, this jurisdictional limit. And the jurisdictional 9 limit that existed in 1868, remember, was a very 10 difficult choice. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Your basic point is this: 12 You're just saying it's too bad, go to Congress. But 13 you don't deny the basic point, which is that an Indian 14 tribe may think the Bureau of Indian Affairs has really 15 mismanaged everything and what they would like is some 16 money, and also they want an injunction so they won't do 17 it again. 18 And now your view is, it's true, there is no 19 way they can get that, because they have to go to two 20 different courts, and really in your view they can't go 21 to two different courts, period. 22 MR. YANG: Well, let me qualify - 23 JUSTICE BREYER: And hardship is definite. 24 It's just you are saying, that's what Congress wanted. 25 MR. YANG: The hardship may be there. The
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 hardship is less now than it was in 1868 because of the 2 language of the statute - 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't it just as bad as 4 what I just said? 5 MR. YANG: Because you might be able to 6 bring, for instance, an APA suit that completes before 7 the six-year statute of limitations ends. And frankly, 8 we don't think that that's an unusual thing, for an APA 9 action to be brought promptly, even with an appeal. APA 10 actions, again, if it's limited to the administrative 11 record as they should, you can go straight to a summary 12 judgment-like procedure - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to extend a case 14 that I didn't agree with when it came out. You have to 15 extend Bowen in order to achieve that. Does the 16 government want to extend Bowen? 17 MR. YANG: No, no. I'm not suggesting that 18 that was a proper suit. But what you could do is you 19 could pursue it and it could complete and still be - 20 there would still be time to bring a suit in the Court 21 of Federal - 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: You could complete it to a 23 denial of recovery? 24 MR. YANG: Perhaps, that's right. 25 We think these suits -

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that's any 2 comfort to the Indian tribe, do you? 3 MR. YANG: Well, but that's precisely what 4 they are seeking to do here, and we just disagree 5 whether that relief is available in district court. And 6 the question here is whether you can simultaneously 7 pursue it. 8 Let me be clear. These cases in our view 9 should almost all be brought normally in the Court of 10 Federal Claims. These cases are seeking money for past 11 actions and that's precisely what the Court of Federal 12 Claims should address. 13 However, a number of plaintiffs like to try 14 their hand at more than one court and they bring 15 simultaneous suits, just as Tucker -- the cotton 16 claimants did in the 1860's, where Congress provided for 17 a general statute, very broadly worded. It applies to 18 any claim for and in respect to which any suit or 19 process is pending in any other court against the U.S. 20 or any person acting or professing to act as its agents. 21 It's a very broad statute. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not -- I mean, 23 you are putting a pejorative spin on what they are 24 doing, saying, you know, many plaintiffs like to take a 25 chance in more than one court. But your response to

1 Justice Breyer suggests that that's a tough choice if 2 you have to choose between injunctive relief or damages. 3 That's not them trying to, you know, get the same - 4 take two bites at the apple. 5 MR. YANG: In some cases, it's is a tough 6 choice. Casman would have been a very difficult choice. 7 But as this Court suggested in Keene, the question goes 8 to Congress, and when Congress addressed the question it 9 decided relief of that sort should be brought all in the 10 Court of Claims. 11 But in this case, this is not a case where 12 we think particular hardship would be had, because the 13 tribe could pursue its claims in the Court of Federal 14 Claims and probably should be doing that if it simply - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't our rule 16 simply -- what is so wrong with a rule that says if you 17 can bring it in the Court of Claims you have to, but if 18 there's relief that you can't secure there you can have 19 two lawsuits? What is so irrational about that? 20 MR. YANG: Well, that doesn't square - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If there is no double 22 recovery possible. 23 MR. YANG: But that doesn't square even with 24 the history of what Congress is trying to target. The 25 relief that was available in the Court of Claims in the

1 1860's in the Abandoned Property Collection Act was a 2 very limited - 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have already gone 4 through that because most of those claims would have had 5 some element of double recovery, that might have 6 precluded a second action. The point that I raised was 7 if there is a chance of potential double recovery, you 8 can't breach, what's wrong with that? 9 MR. YANG: I don't think it squares with the 10 text of the statute, which is broader than, doesn't 11 provide for a claim, it doesn't provide for relief, it 12 doesn't speak to double recovery. If Congress was 13 intending to target that specific problem it could have 14 done so in a much direct manner. 15 Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve 16 the remainder of my time. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Yang. 18 Ms. Spinelli. 19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI 20 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 21 MS. SPINELLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 22 please the Court: 23 Two suits are for or in respect to the same 24 claim under Section 1500, only if they stem from the 25 same operative facts and seek duplicative relief. And

1 in response to the Government's argument, I would like 2 to explain why that's the best reading of Section 1500's 3 text, as well as the only reading that harmonizes 4 Section 1500 with the overall jurisdictional and 5 remedial scheme. 6 Congress has made a broad range of remedies 7 available to Plaintiffs wronged by the Government. And 8 it's directed Plaintiffs to seek certain remedies only 9 in the Court of Federal Claims, and certain remedies 10 only in the district court. 11 The Government's reading of Section 1500 12 assumes that Congress intended to penalize Plaintiffs 13 for following that direction by barring them from the 14 only forum where they can obtain money damages. But 15 nothing in the statute's text or history suggests that 16 Congress intended to create such a nonsensical scheme. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your argument assumes that 18 there is available in the district courts injunctive 19 relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that 20 is far from clear, even after Bowen, it's far from clear 21 if you had any business being in the district court 22 anyway. And so in a way we are resolving a very strange 23 question, that is if as is not clear, you have a right 24 to sue in the district courts for an injunction, can 25 that suit proceed because of 1500 when there is a suit
25

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 pending in the Court of Claims and that is sort of an 2 abstract question. 3 MS. SPINELLI: Justice Scalia, it is 4 disputed whether or not the district court has 5 jurisdiction to entertain the Nation's claims there. 6 The Government has a move to dismiss on that ground, 7 that motion is pending. We don't believe that the 8 district court's jurisdiction over the claims raised in 9 the district court is a question that this Court needs 10 to face. Rather, the question here is whether the Court 11 of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over the claims 12 brought in the CFC. And that turns not on whether the 13 district court has jurisdiction, but on whether 14 duplicative relief is sought in both suits. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: The main thrust that I was 16 raising was does this really get the Tribe into trouble? 17 They have to forego one kind of relief for another. So 18 what about injunctive relief, that's what he thought of, 19 and Justice Scalia raises the point, well, they are not 20 going to be entitled to injunctive relief anyway because 21 the APA doesn't provide it, if I understand that 22 correctly. So you are giving up the null set. You were 23 giving up the null set. 24 MS. SPINELLI: No, not at all, 25 Justice Breyer. First of all, we would contest that we
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 are not entitled to the relief that the Nation sought in 2 the district court. We believe that the Nation is 3 entitled to that relief. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: But it couldn't get that? 5 MS. SPINELLI: Correct. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: It couldn't get that kind 7 of relief in the Court of Claims? 8 MS. SPINELLI: Correct. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it could. 10 MS. SPINELLI: No, no, no. You are right 11 that it could not. The relief that is being sought in 12 the district court is primarily an accounting. An 13 accounting is inherently an equitable remedy, a remedy 14 that under trust law the trustee owes to the beneficiary 15 to provide the beneficiary with all the information 16 necessary for him to protect his rights. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't it well established 18 that part of the jurisdiction of the equity court when 19 it requires an accounting is to give damages for breach 20 of the trustee's duty? That's Hornbook. 21 MS. SPINELLI: That may well be the case, 22 Justice Kennedy, in common law trust suits. That wasn't 23 requested - 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I'm talking about 25 historically in equity. No. Historically in equity the
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 trustee who breaches the trustee's duty in the equity 2 court is required to give damages. 3 MS. SPINELLI: You are correct that 4 normally, that in the past - 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not common law, it's 6 not common law, it's equity. It's old law, it's equity. 7 MS. SPINELLI: Correct. You are correct 8 that in the days of the divided bench suit for breach of 9 trust were brought in equity. I don't think we need to 10 parse that finely here, because the question here is 11 whether or not the Tribe has sought duplicative relief 12 in both courts. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that unrealistic? 14 You don't want an accounting for the sake of having an 15 accounting so that you can put the accounting in your 16 desk. Oh, look it, they stole $1,000,000,000 from us. 17 You want to get the $1,000,000,000. If the suits are 18 directed at the same object, and it is fanciful to think 19 there is this separate suit for an accounting. The 20 object of that suit is the same thing as the object of 21 the suit in the Court of Claims. 22 MS. SPINELLI: With respect, Justice Scalia, 23 that is not the case. The accounting has enormous 24 benefit entirely apart from any monetary relief that it 25 might ultimately lead to. The Nation, as well as other
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 tribes who have brought these kinds of suits, lack basic 2 information about what they own, what the metes and 3 bounds of their lands are, what leases have been 4 granted, how long they last, what easements and rights 5 of way have been granted over their land, what the 6 status is of their mineral rights and timber rights. 7 All of this is information that the Tribe needs and that 8 Congress recognized in the Indian Trust Fund Management 9 Reform Act that the Tribe needs in order to exercise its 10 Federally granted right to decide how it's assets are 11 best managed, and the longer that that accounting is 12 delayed, the more the Nation is harmed by the inability 13 to do that, the inability to decide whether certain 14 funds should be withdrawn from trusts held by the United 15 States, the inability to decide whether it should bring 16 claims against third-parties. So there's real value to 17 the accounting that's entirely separate from any 18 monetary relief. And the accounting is not sought in 19 the Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal 20 Claims has long held that it lacks jurisdiction to grant 21 that kind of pre-liability historical accounting. 22 Although - 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you get the 24 accounting in conjunction with the claim of damages? 25 Maybe the Court of Federal Claims, you can't go there
29

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and say, look, I want an accounting, but you can say I 2 have been wronged over the century and I would like to 3 find out to what extent, and before you can figure that 4 out you actually have to have an accounting. Can't the 5 Court of Federal Claims get an accounting in that 6 context? 7 MS. SPINELLI: The Court of Federal Claims 8 can order something called an accounting in aid of 9 judgment. Despite the similar terminology, they are not 10 at all the same. An accounting of the type that's being 11 sought in the district court is a remedy by itself. 12 It's a remedy that the beneficiary is entitled to once 13 its received or denied, that's a final order that can be 14 appealed. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. It's a 16 remedy, but is it terribly different from what the 17 accounting the Court of Federal Claims would order to 18 figure out how much - 19 MS. SPINELLI: It is because it requires the 20 trustee to provide all information about the trust that 21 might be relevant to the beneficiary, and it does so 22 without requiring the beneficiary to prove any 23 mismanagement. By contrast - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Were those accountings 25 available before the Administrative Procedure Act was

1 passed? Is the jurisdictional basis for that the waiver 2 of sovereign immunity that allows you to demand an 3 accounting from the United States? Is that just the 4 APA? 5 MS. SPINELLI: The waiver of sovereign 6 immunity that is being asserted in the district court is 7 the APA, that's correct. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about this - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you didn't have a right 10 to that before the APA was passed? 11 MS. SPINELLI: In the district court, no. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Either in the district 13 court nor in the Court of Claims. So this is not an 14 unthinkable situation, is it? 15 MS. SPINELLI: It's a little bit more 16 complicated - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: It was thought about for a 18 century, anyway. 19 MS. SPINELLI: It's a little bit more 20 complicated than that because prior to -- prior to the 21 Court of Federal Claims in its current incarnation, 22 certain claims for an accounting could have been brought 23 before the Indian Claims Commission, but -- I mean 24 that's going a little far afield. The -- at any rate 25 Congress has now recognized specifically by statute that
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this is something that Tribes need, and that's the right 2 that the Nation is seeking to enforce in the district 3 court action. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why have -- you say 5 Congress has specifically recognized it by statute. 6 You're referring to the APA? 7 MS. SPINELLI: No, I'm referring to the 1994 8 Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act, which 9 specifically required the Department of the Interior to 10 provide Tribal beneficiaries with certain statements, 11 certain accountings regarding their - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But did not provide for a 13 lawsuit against -- against the government. 14 MS. SPINELLI: They did not -- they did not 15 expressly do so, no. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: When you are in the CFC, 17 don't you get -- you aren't you asking for compensation 18 for losses and injuries from the commingling or the 19 misappropriation of assets? 20 MS. SPINELLI: No, Justice Kennedy, in the 21 Court of Federal Claims, as a close reading of the 22 complaint will show, the Nation is requesting four 23 specific kinds of relief. First it's asking for damages 24 from the United States' failure to lease its mineral 25 rights for fair market value. That's count 1. Count 2
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is seeking damages from the United States' failure to 2 obtain fair market value for leases of its land. Count 3 3 is seeking damages from the United States' failure to 4 invest judgment funds in a timely way and to obtain the 5 maximum interest rate; and count 4 asserts a similar 6 claim for damages with respect to the trust fund. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your brief makes the 8 -- seems to make the point that that's all just interest 9 on capital. It's not for lost capital. But even as you 10 described it, it sounds to me that you get damages for 11 loss of capital plus interest. 12 MS. SPINELLI: It's -- it's not just 13 interest, you are correct. I mean, maybe if I give an 14 example this will make things a little bit clearer. Say 15 that the government sold a stand of timber belonging to 16 the Nation for $20, even though the stand of timber was 17 worth $40. It then deposited it into the trust account, 18 $10. 19 The suit in the district court seeks an 20 accounting and a restatement of the accounts and to the 21 extent appropriate and available, equitable restitution 22 of the $10 that was missing from the account. 23 The suit in the CFC seeks to recover the $20 24 that the United States should have earned, had it acted 25 as a prudent fiduciary when it was selling the stand of
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 timber. And the Nation is entitled to both sums of 2 money, but they are different, and because the money 3 sought in the two courts is different, the relief is not 4 duplicative. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My problem is that I read 6 the CFC complaint as including both. I will take a look 7 at it. And I intruded on Justice Breyer's question. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to work out 9 still in my mind, is if you say, look, Indian Tribe: 10 You have to go to the court of claims, period. Period. 11 You can't go to these other courts, I mean unless you 12 give up the court of claims. Is the Indian Tribe going 13 to really lose something it needs? 14 MS. SPINELLI: Yes. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: I know you think yes. I 16 realize that. 17 (Laughter.) 18 JUSTICE BREYER: And, what I want to ask you 19 about - 20 MS. SPINELLI: Yes. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- is in section 2 - 22 MS. SPINELLI: I apologize. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- of 1491 there is a 24 sentence which says, about the court of claims, in any 25 case including the 1505 Tucker Act, the court shall have
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the power to remand appropriate matters to any 2 administrative or executive body or official with such 3 direction as it is may deem proper and just. 4 Now that seems awfully broad, so I'm 5 thinking now, if they want money, they can get the money 6 from the court of claims. If they want something like 7 an injunction, they could ask the court of claims, tell 8 the executive branch to behave the way we think they 9 have to under the law and there's your authority. 10 MS. SPINELLI: Justice Breyer - 11 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just quoting. Now 12 what's -- I want to know the response. 13 MS. SPINELLI: Justice Breyer, you're -- you 14 are exactly right about what 1491(a)(2) provides, but it 15 also provides that any such relief can be ordered only 16 as an incident of and collateral to a judgment of a 17 claim of which the Court of Federal Claims otherwise has 18 jurisdiction. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you want money; that 20 causes the problem. If you don't want any money, you 21 don't have a problem. You Just forget about it. 22 MS. SPINELLI: And notwithstanding this 23 language - 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 25 MS. SPINELLI: -- the court of claims has
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 continued to hold that it lacks jurisdiction to grant an 2 equitable pre-liability accounting. All that it can do 3 is after liability for certain acts of mismanagement has 4 been proven, calculate damages for those specific acts 5 of mismanagement. Now - 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I 7 understand. You could not bring in the court of claims 8 the old money claims, and why? That the government 9 mismanaged - 10 MS. SPINELLI: Well, two -- two things, 11 Justice Sotomayor. We believe that the Nation could not 12 bring the old money claims in the Court of Federal 13 Claims because it has held repeatedly that it lacks 14 jurisdiction to grant an equitable accounting. However, 15 I don't believe the answer to that question matters, 16 because the issue here is not - 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It does, because why 18 couldn't you simply have said, they owe us that original 19 extra 10 bucks -- $10, and we want it? What -- what - 20 MS. SPINELLI: Dividing -- well, it is clear 21 that the accounting sought in the district court 22 couldn't have been obtained in the court of claims. And 23 it made sense to seek the old money as the court of 24 appeals called it, in conjunction with the accounting, 25 because the accounting is what should reveal what is
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 missing from the account. And that's the reason, and 2 not for any manipulative or forum-shopping purpose, that 3 the Nation split its complaint the way it did. 4 Now to be sure, there is some fuzziness 5 about the jurisdictional line between the Court of 6 Federal Claims and the district court. There is no 7 doubt about that. The Nation did its best to negotiate 8 that and filed its complaints in good faith. We believe 9 that that question doesn't need to be addressed by this 10 Court, because the only question section 1500 asks is 11 whether the two suits are for or in respect to the same 12 claim, by which we think it means are they for or in 13 respect to the same demand for relief. Here - 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government says the 15 statute is simple. It says you can't have two suits 16 simultaneously, or you can't when the CFC suit is the - 17 the second one. 18 And Mr. Yang told me that yes, the 19 government thinks that in the Casman case there was a 20 choice, you can sue for reinstatement in the district 21 court, you can sue for back pay in the claims court, but 22 you cannot get both. And when Congress realized that 23 that's what was happening, Congress did not adopt a 24 two -- didn't bless the two-state -- two court solution. 25 Congress said, there will be one lawsuit. It will all
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 be in the claims court, and they can grant both the back 2 pay and the reinstatement. 3 So the two-suit approach was rejected, I 4 guess, in -- in Congress's response to Casman. 5 MS. SPINELLI: With respect, 6 Justice Ginsburg, I would disagree. I think that action 7 by Congress in the 1972 Remand Act strongly supports the 8 conclusion that Congress has implicitly acquiesced in 9 this construction of section 1500. 10 Congress -- you are right, Congress decided 11 not to say go ahead with your two suits in two different 12 courts. It thought that was too burdensome for the 13 plaintiff; rather it amended the Tucker Act to permit 14 the plaintiff to pursue both remedies in the Court of 15 Federal Claims. But that shows that Congress was well 16 aware of the Casman holding, and it did not make any 17 change to the statute to cast the holding into doubt, 18 that where two remedies are available in two different 19 courts, one can pursue them by bringing simultaneous 20 suits in the two different courts. 21 All that it did is make it easier for 22 plaintiffs in that specific situation to get full 23 relief. Beyond that, in 1982 - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, excuse me, it didn't 25 make it easier. You -- you had to bring them both in
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the court of claims, no? You didn't still have the 2 option of -- of still bringing two different suits, did 3 you? 4 MS. SPINELLI: No, I think after -- after 5 the amendment - 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: You had to go to the court 7 of claims. 8 MS. SPINELLI: Yes. I mean, other - 9 otherwise that would raise a claim-splitting problem. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but if they were just 11 making it easier, they -- they would have said, you 12 know, you can do either one. 13 MS. SPINELLI: Well, I mean, clearly the 14 easier path is to have one suit. I don't think any 15 plaintiff wants to be forced to bring two suits to 16 obtain two different remedies, both of which it needs, 17 at double the expense and, you know, double the anxiety. 18 But I think what's significant about the 19 1972 action is that Congress did absolutely nothing to 20 suggest that it disagreed with the Casman holding. And 21 the same is true in 1982, when Congress completely 22 revamped the entire jurisdictional scheme, changed the 23 jurisdiction of the claims court very much, and yet left 24 section 1500 entirely untouched. And that makes sense. 25 I mean, just to turn to the text for a minute, the key
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 word, as I think this Court said in Keene, is the word 2 "claim." 3 "Claim" can mean a lot of different things. 4 It can sometimes mean the set of operative facts from 5 which a right to relief arises, which I believe is at 6 least implicitly what the government is saying. It can 7 also mean a demand for relief; for instance, in this 8 Court's cases regarding Article 3 standing, it's 9 routinely said that plaintiff has to establish standing 10 separately for each claim, which means for each form of 11 relief sought. 12 The reason that is the correct reading of 13 section 1500 is because of the nature of the 14 jurisdictional scheme. The Court of Federal Claims has 15 always been a court of limited jurisdiction. It can 16 only grant certain remedies, primarily money damages. 17 And the word "claim" in the Tucker Act and its 18 predecessors, from the very beginning, prior to the 19 enactment of section 1500, has been read by this Court 20 to mean a demand for relief. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be 22 inconsistent with the definition of "claim" in the 23 federal rules, I think. 24 MS. SPINELLI: Yes, I think the definition 25 of "claim" in the federal rules -- I think that's a
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 different definition of "claim." I think what we have 2 here is a narrower definition that was first established 3 in the 19th century through this Court's decisions 4 construing the Tucker Act and its predecessors. 5 Given that the word "claim" in the Tucker 6 Act carries that narrow meaning, it certainly makes 7 sense to construe the word "claim" in section 1500 as 8 having the same meaning. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you give it that narrow 10 meaning, however, the government says you are 11 contradicting what was the case with regard to the 12 cotton suits. That, in fact, some of them were asking 13 for funds from this -- money from this common fund, and 14 others were seeking relief against the individuals who 15 had taken the cotton or replanted the cotton. Those are 16 different claims, as you define "claim," anyway. 17 MS. SPINELLI: I don't think that is our 18 definition of "claim," but let me explain. 19 We don't dispute that certain cotton 20 claimants, you know, brought writs of conversion of 21 trespass. Some may have brought writs of replevin or 22 detinue seeking the cotton itself back. The relevant 23 fact is that the suit saying "I want my 100 bales of 24 cotton back" and the suit saying "I would like money to 25 compensate me for my loss of 100 bales of cotton" seek
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 duplicative relief. And - 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is different from the 3 word "claim." I mean, if you are hanging the whole 4 thing on the word "claim," you gave me a very plausible 5 alternate definition of "claim." But your case does not 6 follow that. Your case hinges on duplicative relief, 7 which is something quite different. I don't know any 8 definition of "claim" that is synonymous with 9 duplicative relief. 10 MS. SPINELLI: The word "claim" in section 11 1500 refers to claims over which the Court of Federal 12 Claims has jurisdiction, just as it does in the Tucker 13 Act. There is no express limitation in the Tucker Act 14 on the relief that can be granted. The word "claim" has 15 been read implicitly to incorporate a limitation on the 16 kind of relief that can be granted. 17 Therefore, in section 1500, a suit for or in 18 respect to a claim in the Court of Federal Claims must 19 mean a suit for or in respect to a demand for relief 20 that the Court of Claims can grant, and where 21 duplicative relief is being sought, that falls within 22 the language of the statute. It falls within the 23 overall jurisdictional scheme which directs plaintiffs 24 to bring suits for different relief in different courts, 25 and it also appears with cotton claimants.

1 The cotton claimants were seeking 2 duplicative relief, and that's the concern that Congress 3 aimed at. Congress was not faced in 1868 with a 4 situation in which plaintiffs had been directed to seek 5 different non-duplicative remedies, remedies that 6 weren't substitutes for one another but complimented one 7 another in two different courts. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: I had under the impression 9 that sometimes they sued for some money out of a fund, 10 which would have been partial, and other times they sued 11 for the value of the cotton, and other times they sued 12 for the cotton itself, which in certain circumstances 13 could have been worth a lot more. By the time of suit, 14 it went up. I mean, do we know it was always 15 duplicative in those cotton suits? 16 MS. SPINELLI: I believe we do know it was 17 always duplicative, notwithstanding the fact that the 18 amount that one might recover might differ. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if the amount 20 differs, then, why do you suppose the cotton belonged to 21 the Indian Tribe? On the one hand, they want an 22 accounting out of the money ever earned out of this 23 cotton in the past and on the other hand, they want what 24 the cotton is worth in the future on the - 25 MS. SPINELLI: That is not -
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE BREYER: That's Justice Scalia's 2 question. 3 MS. SPINELLI: That is not duplicative. 4 What is duplicative is a remedy that is either the same, 5 or a remedy that serves as a substitute for another 6 remedy. And what this Court has said, though, is that 7 even if it's not a completely full substitute -- even 8 if, say, the damages sought in one court are less than 9 the damages sought in another -- if they are duplicative 10 relief for the same injury, they are barred by section 11 1500. And I think that is completely consistent with 12 the holding in Keene. 13 In Keene, the plaintiff was bringing 14 multiple suits against the United States in different 15 courts for duplicative relief, money, and compensation 16 for funds it had paid out to asbestos claimants. And 17 notwithstanding the fact that it brought some of those 18 suits on a contract theory and some of those suits on an 19 equitable tort theory of indemnification, the statute 20 barred those. But Keene was not faced with a situation 21 in which the plaintiffs were forced, as in Casman, to 22 proceed in two different courts to obtain different 23 relief. 24 And another particularly good example is an 25 example of a regulatory taking suit, in which if a
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 plaintiff wants to challenge the legality of government 2 regulation affecting his property, he needs to do that 3 in the district court under the APA. And according to 4 the government, he cannot bring a suit for just 5 compensation in the Court of Federal Claims until that 6 district court suit is completed and any appeal is 7 completed and any cert petition is completed, by which 8 time the six-year statute of limitations on the just 9 compensation claim may very well have expired. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in your case -- now, 11 let's assume the government prevails. You go to the 12 CFC, and you prevail on everything. You get all the 13 findings in your favor and so forth. There is some 14 relief that you don't get. 15 I take it, unless I am missing something, 16 that you could then, after the CFC suit is finished, go 17 to district court and say: Now we want this added 18 protection, this added relief. 19 MS. SPINELLI: The reason - 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the statute wouldn't 21 have run generally, because if you are seeking the 22 injunction, it's only latches bars you, and you are not 23 barred by latches because you couldn't have gone sooner. 24 MS. SPINELLI: There are a couple of reasons 25 why that doesn't work, Justice Kennedy. First of all,
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the Nation needs the accounting now. I mean, it's as if 2 in Casman, Casman had been told, well, you know, first 3 get reinstated -- I'm sorry -- first get your backpay; 4 then go get reinstated. He needs his -- the Nation 5 needs the accounting now, not later. In addition, if it 6 were the case that the accounting uncovered additional 7 mismanagement, this statute of limitations, the six-year 8 statute of limitations might well expire while the 9 district court suit for an accounting is pending, those 10 suits tend to last a very long time. Indeed in the 11 Indian Claims Commission they have been known to last 12 for up to 50 years. And it would force the Nation to 13 run the risk of losing its right to damages. We don't 14 believe that's what Congress had in mind. It doesn't 15 harmonize Section 1500 with the remainder of the 16 statutory scheme. It's not mandated by the history of 17 the statute, and it simply doesn't make sense. 18 Unless there are further questions, we ask 19 for the judgment be affirmed. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 21 Mr. Yang, you have four minutes remaining. 22 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG 23 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 24 MR. YANG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 25 The Tribe is unable to identify a textual

1 basis for its same relief defense to the court of 2 federal claims. If it's definition of claim is as 3 narrow and circumscribed as it defines, it wouldn't 4 capture the cotton claim. Moreover, putting aside the 5 definition of claim, the statute applies when there is a 6 pending suit or process in another court. That is not 7 only for the claim, but in respect to the claim. That 8 substantially broadens the statute. 9 Two, there are two problems with the same 10 relief test that's as a practical matter. In order to 11 determine whether the same relief is being sought in the 12 other court, which is the relevant question under their 13 test, you have to ask, what relief would be sought in 14 district court. But Rule 54(c) makes clear that the 15 relief which is available in district court is not 16 specified by the complaint, it's whatever develops 17 through the case. So you might not know until the very 18 end whether duplicative relief is being sought. 19 Secondly, if you are going to limit the 20 relief that is available in the district court based on 21 what the court of claims' view is of the district 22 court's jurisdiction to issue relief, you are inviting 23 the court of federal claims and the federal circuit to 24 be opining on the jurisdiction of the district court 25 under the APA, in very complicated cases which involve

1 questions of Bowen, Utah Wilderness, this is not the way 2 that you would construe normally a jurisdictional 3 statute. 4 The specter of 50-year old suits proceeding 5 simultaneously in the court of federal claims in 6 district court certainly would have motivated, or spoken 7 to the Congress that enacted Section 1500's predecessor 8 in 1868. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with 10 your friend that there are differences between the 11 accounting you can get in the district court and the 12 accounting you can get in the court of federal claims as 13 a prelude to monetary damages? 14 MR. YANG: I'm not exactly sure the 15 differences that they are pointing to. There are 16 differences in terms of the procedure and what is a 17 relief. The other you would have to show that there was 18 some kind of a breach and you get a full kind of 19 accounting to quantify damages that relate -- in aid of 20 judgment. But at the end of the day, the example, 21 losing $10 and you collect 20 but only debit -- put 10 22 on the books, that is a claim which is cognizable in the 23 court of federal claims if they have a money mandating 24 statute of regulations. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't even know who

1 has hunting leases and - 2 MR. YANG: That's what discovery -- that's 3 what discovery is for. The Ak-Chin case, for instance. 4 33,000 boxes of discovery we have to go through in terms 5 of a discovery request in the court of federal claims. 6 This is done -- this is the way cases normally proceed. 7 They do not proceed on dual tracks where the very 8 premise of liability in the court of federal claims is 9 being litigated in district court, or they are seeking 10 to challenge, you know, an accounting. Accounting 11 normally would be, you know, here's an account of 12 your -- your assets, but they're seeking to challenge 13 it. If you went back to equity, for instance. A 14 trustee does, as an equitable matter, have a duty to 15 account when requested. But the cost of the accounting 16 is taken out of the trust corpus. That's not what is 17 going on here. They are trying to seek to use the APA 18 to force something which we don't think is authorized 19 under statute as a secondary means of discovery for the 20 same claims that are at issue in the court of federal 21 claims. That type of duplicative litigation and the 22 burden on the federal courts is precisely what Section 23 1500 was intended to prevent against, and in the absence 24 of a textual basis for the same relief test that the 25 court of federal claims or federal circuit adopted here

1 I think is fatal to the case. 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the accounting doesn't 3 come out of the trust corpus if there is misfeasance, 4 the trustee has to pay the damages for that? 5 MR. YANG: I can't speak to that, 6 Justice Kennedy, that is possible. I'm just not that 7 versed in equity jurisprudence to be able to give you a 8 definitive answer. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Loveladies 10 situation? 11 MR. YANG: In Loveladies, if I may answer. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. 13 MR. YANG: Loveladies involved a district 14 court claim for a declaration that the action wasn't 15 taken. The district court taking declaration which was 16 ultimately disposed of, but at the same time that 17 Loveladies was seeking does assert a claim for just 18 compensation in the court of federal claims. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Yang, 20 Ms. Spinelli. The case is submitted. 21 (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the 22 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 23 24 25
