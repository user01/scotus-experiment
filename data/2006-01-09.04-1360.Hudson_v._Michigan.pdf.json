That might have been the case when we first adopted the exclusionary rule, but our docket is crowded with 1983 cases brought by these cases are successful below. What reason is there to believe that that wouldn't be an adequate difficult to win a suit. And because it is not a bright line as to when the police officers have to knock and announce, and when they do not -- that is, a no-knock entry will be met with violence or that the evidence will be destroyed? -- courts tend to be of these cases. But the same thing is going to be true if the consequence of not waiting long enough is the exclusion of the evidence. The court is going to they waited long enough, and, as you say, the court is likely to say, you know, \"Let it go.\" 1958 and 1968, this Court was very familiar with the independent-source doctrine. And, really, the argument that the Michigan Supreme Court has adopted it's really an independent-source doctrine."

All I'm asking the Court to the causal connection to the purposes -- as I have tried to indicated -- to the purpose, or purposes, served by the principle violated. What is the Your Honor indicated -- it's to protect against injury to the police, injury of people inside, and inside to prepare to answer -- as Mr. Moran indicated, if they might be in a state of undress or something, they could avoid that embarrassment. argument is that, except in cases in which the people inside the house are not dressed, or cases in which those cases, there will never be a recovery."

In cases where there is violence, there will be there is no nakedness, there is no violence, they simply opened an unlocked door, I would say, yes, because the Court does not always apply the exclusionary rule, even when there would be deterrence -- that that is correct. true. I mean, there are going to be situations, or at least possible, where evidence is going to be a -- police break through the door, and the defendant says, \"The drugs are in the closet,\" and you want to use that declaration to tie him to the drugs -- that today is for this Court to decide that the items -- the physical evidence found within a proper scope, a the hypothetical, but it seems to me it's really a hypothetical."

To not do application of the exclusionary rule. And that's just one example; there are others. This Court has always required that there be a causal connection, so.
