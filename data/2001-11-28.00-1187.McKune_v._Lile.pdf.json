    "speech": "We'll hear argument next in Number 00-1187, David R. McKune v. Robert G. Lile. Mr. McAllister. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER please the Court: Choices have consequences, but they nonetheless remain choices. The mere withdrawal of prison privileges such as a personal television or how much an inmate may spend at the canteen, privileges which are not part of an inmate's sentence and to which an inmate has no legal entitlement, does not amount to constitutional compulsion in violation of the Fifth Amendment, certainly not when the reason for the withdrawal of those privileges is the inmate's failure to comply with an unquestionably legitimate treatment requirement that he accept responsibility for his offenses."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The problem, though, is he's forced, in effect, to confront the treatment possibility. It's not an option. I mean, the tough part of the case for me, I think, is the fact that this is not a scheme, as I understand the Federal scheme, in which the inmate says, I want to take advantage of this treatment program. This is a scheme in which the State says, you're going to take advantage of it, and if you don't take advantage of it, including the admissions in the reports of other offenses, and so on, you're going to lose substantial privileges. That, to me, is the tough part of the case. MR. McALLISTER: That's true, Justice Souter, that respect, but it is still a choice for Mr. Lile. He does not have to incriminate himself in any way. His refusal to participate is not at all incriminating, and what we're talking about in terms of what he may lose here are really relatively mild incentives within the prison --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But what happens if he refuses? Is he put in a different type of confinement with different terms and conditions? MR.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Now, the prisoner says no, I don't want to participate in that program. Does that mean that he stays in that opening level, or is he then potentially put in something even more severe than that? MR. McALLISTER: The Kansas regulations say, if an inmate is recommended for this treatment program and he refuses, he goes from level 3 to level 1. Mr. Lile is at level 3 because when we adopted this incentive scheme several years ago we grandfathered in all the inmates at the highest level, so we started them out with the level 3 privileges, which is the highest they can achieve in prison, and it was then theirs to lose by not complying with rules and committing disciplinary infractions, and so forth, so he was at level 3, and when he refused to participate he then comes down to level 1."
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I mean, the reason he's being chopped down from 3 to 1 was that he was grandfathered. MR. McALLISTER: He was grandfathered in."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But in the future, he would simply not make it from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3, if he didn't go into the program? MR. McALLISTER: Very possibly. I mean, very possibly."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Because there's been some dispute between you and the other side as to whether this is simply the denial of a benefit or a punishment, and I'm not sure there's a whole lot of difference, but -- MR. McALLISTER: And in the context of the prison --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You say it's a possibility. I mean, I suppose it's always a possibility, but does the scheme for those who are not grandfathered provide that they will never yet be on the intake level if they are a sex offender and so on, unless they agree to this? MR. McALLISTER: No. They will progress, unless they have other reasons that they're not, because what happens with this program, it's an 18-month program. Our inmates are not even evaluated, typically, for release until they're 2 years from their scheduled release date, so anybody with a sentence of any length will go several years in the system, working their way up if they're complying with what they're supposed to do."

The person, I take it, like this petitioner here is going to be in the same position as this petitioner. MR. McALLISTER: Yes, potentially, but in our the prison context whether you view it as taking away a benefit or not bestowing a benefit, because none of these inmates come in with an expectation to any of these privileges."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speech": "But then you should say the same anything you're entitled to. You've no liberty interest, property interest, all that. If that follows, then what's wrong with saying -- MR. McALLISTER: But in the First Amendment context he has a right, a free speech right or a right of access to the courts that may be at issue. In this context, all the Fifth Amendment says is, no person shall be compelled, so --"

    "speech": "As I recall it, the First Amendment says -- speaks of abridgement -- MR. McALLISTER: Yes."

    "speech": "I'm concerned about the same thing Justice Ginsburg is concerned -- I have to say I can't find in our cases a statement that a burden on your -- or an unconstitutional condition which involves the Fifth Amendment is barred, but I'm wondering if it oughtn't to be. Is it your -- it seems to me to follow from your position that every prisoner in Kansas could be told, either you confess to the crime for which you've been convicted and all other crimes you've committed or you go to maximum security for the rest of your time here. MR. McALLISTER: Not necessarily, Justice Kennedy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Because I think the State does have an interest in saying, we want to rehabilitate you, and it's best for you to confront your wrong. Would you say the statute, or the rule I've proposed is problematic? Is it different from what you're proposing? MR. McALLISTER: I think it's potentially different, although it is potentially permissible constitutionally, but the question would become, what sort of legitimate valid penological interest do we have? Do we have such an interest in having every inmate do that from the day they enter prison? This is very different."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I think you can make a better argument. MR. McALLISTER: We could make that argument."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'd be very troubled by that. MR. McALLISTER: Well, it's much more than that in this case, because here the therapists are clear that denial is a big problem with sex offenders, and to overcome that denial we need a meaningful acceptance of responsibility, not an immunity that simply allows the inmate to talk with no consequence whatsoever, potentially. We need a meaningful acceptance, and that's what we're after here, and Mr. Lile has not questioned that's a legitimate --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you think it can only be meaningful if you compel them to admit to a new crime for which they could be prosecuted? MR. McALLISTER: Except with all due respect, Justice O'Connor, we would not say we're compelling them. We're simply giving them a choice that has some real consequences. We want people in this program who really want to participate. We have a waiting list to get into this program, so we don't need inmates in this program who are not serious about this. We have plenty who are willing to take advantage of the program as it's done, right now, and it's full, and there's a waiting list."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Then why isn't your penalogical interest satisfied in confining the program to those who want to be in it, who will not be subject to this compulsion, if that's what it is? I mean, your argument is that we have a penalogical interest, in effect, that justifies these consequences. MR. McALLISTER: Yes, we do."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But if you could fill your program without even having to raise the issue that involves these consequences, why do you have a penalogical interest in the insistence that gives rise to this case? MR. McALLISTER: Because these fellows have proven that most -- or, not most, but many of them will not voluntarily engage in this program, even though they need --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm assuming that is so, but if you can fill the program with people who will, why is there an interest in effect in forcing the issue for those who do not want to do it voluntarily? MR. McALLISTER: Because we still have an interest in rehabilitating all of these sex offenders. Just because some of them are more willing to be rehabilitated doesn't mean the State does not have an interest --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, if the program is full, then is your interest in simply getting statements of guilt or something from people who will never go into the program? MR. McALLISTER: No, and that's why he has the choice. He can simply refuse. He could refuse, and there's no incrimination if he refuses to participate, but what he's doing is taking up a bed in the medium part of the facility, which is overcrowded at this point, in essence double-celled everyone, and the medium unit is a working unit. The medium unit is for people who are actively involved in prison programs, and so we just don't have the space. If you're not going to work at your programs, we'll move you. That's what we're trying to do with Mr. Lile."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it's not a voluntary program, it's a conscription system. What you -- first, I'd like you to go back to the rehabilitation thing, because that is an aim, an aspiration for every prisoner, and you made very strongly the point that the first step in rehabilitation is acceptance of responsibility. If that's so, I don't see why you -- this -- you could not do this with every prisoner who enters. You could say, take responsibility by confessing that you did what you were accused of doing, no matter what your defense was. Two, tell us about all your other nefarious deeds. You apply this to sex offenders, but the reasons that you did seem to me to be across the board. Is there any distinction, any constitutional distinction that you would make, or are you saying yes, we could do this in the case of every prisoner? MR. McALLISTER: If there's -- as long as potentially we could. We don't. We're only focused on the sex offenders here, but if there's a legitimate reason to do it, potentially --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, let's take out the if, because is there or isn't there? Is it -- in the case of everyone that you incarcerate there is an interest in rehabilitating that person. MR. McALLISTER: Absolutely."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And you have said that the first step in rehabilitation is acceptance of responsibility for the wrong that you've done. MR. McALLISTER: Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you also rely, don't you, Mr. McAllister, on the fact that the therapists for this particular type of crime have come down very hard on the idea, and I take it perhaps there may not be the same body of support for that sort of treatment for other offenders. MR. McALLISTER: And there's certainly not, for example, treatment programs necessarily for burglars or robbers or other categories. The sex offender program is somewhat special in that respect."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But constitutionally, if suddenly somebody got a good idea here and a psychiatrist came forward saying yes, you can reform property criminals too, we'd be in exactly the same boat. MR. McALLISTER: Yes, potentially, and that's not, in our view, a constitutional problem, because this Court has long said none of the things we're talking about here are atypical in prison. The inmates have no particular expectation of a particular set of living conditions within prison. Meachum v. Fano is very clear. They could be transferred from one prison to another for whatever reason or no reason at all, without violating the Constitution. This is a very mild incentive program to try to get these fellows to meaningfully participate in the program."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The kind of conundrum that puzzles me that I don't have an answer to is illustrated by the trial process itself. I suppose the Government couldn't possibly say, if you insist on your right to a jury trial, and insist on your right to remain silent, we're going to sentence you to 10 more years in jail. But the Government can say, if you confess, and don't go to trial, and show true contrition, we'll give you 10 years less. That's written into the guidelines. But they seem to come to the same thing. Well, that seems to be true of this case, and if I could understand how to analyze the first, I might be able to understand how to analyze the second. the first is different, or in essence we're different, because all of our -- this takes place inside the prison. The expectations are quite different. That's why we discuss Sandin in the briefs, not because it is necessarily transportable to the Fifth Amendment, but what Sandin recognizes is prisons are very different, and what the expectations are, what the hardships are is just a very different situation than free citizens, and what they may be confronted within the way of choices."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You are saying you can have two classes of prisoners, those who have confessed to their crimes and those who haven't, and you can treat them differently, no TV, no meat at lunch, no recreation, no softball, and it seems to me the necessary consequence of that for a prisoner facing a long term is that it's going to induce confessions from innocent people. MR. McALLISTER: Except, Justice Kennedy -- it may do that, but our program, just like the Federal program, has pretty strict confidentiality limits. Basically there's a patient-therapist privilege that operates here, and the only reason -- they're given a form right up front that says the only reasons the therapist will disclose anything that's disclosed to the therapist, very limited, things that deal with safety within the prison, threats to other inmates --"

MR. McALLISTER: My understanding is they could do that in the Federal program as well, because there's no immunity granted under the Federal program either, so if they actually made a statement, the Federal program could prosecute them just like we could. We have not, in 13 years of this program."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "May I ask you, Mr. McAllister, do you understand it. Do any of them give the inmate immunity if he participates in the program? MR. McALLISTER: Justice Stevens, it's my understanding that some may, although I don't know the exact number, and I do know from the State amicus brief the 18 States that signed onto that obviously think immunity is a bad idea and, as I said, the Federal Government does not immunize the inmates who participate in the Federal program."

I don't know exactly what their programs are like. Ours was the first of its kind in some sense when we implemented this program, so some may have followed our model, but I don't know for sure. With the Court's permission, I'd like to remain -- reserve the remainder of my time."

    "speech": "Justice Scalia, the Federal Government has a very limited program that applies in only one facility Nation-wide, and it has made a determination to allow for voluntary participation among convicted sexual offenders in that program. Now, in our view that is a judgment that this Court's decisions clearly enable the Federal Bureau of Prisons to make, and we think that the Kansas prison officials have acted within their judgment to adopt a different kind of program. As the therapists all acknowledge, denial is one of the biggest obstacles to receiving treatment in these kinds of programs, and I think it's important for the Court to recognize --"

Those confidentiality limits are clearly related to legitimate penalogical interests, and we think that the Federal Government --"

The amendment therefore recognizes that there are some sorts of pressures or conditions short of compulsion which would not meet the Fifth Amendment standard, and this Court's cases -- meet it? That is to say, you can have two classes of inmates, those who've confessed and those who haven't, for all of prison life?"

This Court's cases like Sandin and Meachum and Bell v.Wolfish recognize that once someone is lawfully incarcerated, that brings about a necessary withdrawal of many rights and privileges consistent with the needs of day-to-day management."

The Kansas program offers incentives by withholding privileges from those inmates who choose not to take socially constructive steps.

There's widespread agreement the sexual offender treatment programs benefits inmates and society alike by enabling convicted offenders --"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

As I understand your description in the one Federal program, it sounds like if the prisoner says no, I won't participate, the prisoner goes back to the facility of origin and can still, over time, earn various privileges, and Kansas is telling us in their scheme no, they reserve the right to deprive the prisoner of any privilege thereafter during his term in prison, and to put him in a more severe condition of incarceration."

    "speaker": "GARRE",

Indeed, your client went -- he started off in a maximum security part of the prison with a medium security bed, or at least he could have done, and then what happens is, people who participate in treatment programs get bonuses, privileges, and if you don't participate in the treatment program, well, obviously you don't get the privilege. Now, that's their characterization of it, basically. Yours is, well, if you start treatment and you stop, you get punished. Now, you're both describing the same thing, but it sounds as if it has very different consequences, and how are we supposed to say which is the correct description, the appropriate characterization?"

They have rules on this, and Mr. Lile did that. He got to that level. He had achieved something. And what the State does is, it comes along and says, well, if you don't give up your Fifth Amendment rights, and if you don't tell us about all these other uncharged crimes, we're taking that away from you. You'll no longer have it. You'll lose your job."

They can keep that money. If they don't keep all of it, they pay some to the prison, they pay some to victims' restitution, but if they lose their job, under the Kansas structure they will never get to work a job that is even equivalent to that."

You will be in prison for life. On the other hand, if you confess that you are guilty of voluntary manslaughter, you'll get a 15-year term.

They take it away from you. If, on the other hand, the State decided that what we're going to do for those inmates who are participating in the program is extend their good-time credit or make their situation better, or give them a benefit, I don't think that's -- I don't think that would be --"

That person you say is not being compelled because for him it's not achieving privileges rather than having privileges taken away. Is that -- do you adhere to that distinction, that the State of Kansas could do exactly what it's doing now if it said, Mr. Wiltanger and all sexual offenders, you go in at level 1 and you never get out of it unless you take this program?"

The current rule is -- and the way that SATP, or the sex offender treatment is structured is, you don't really become eligible to take it or forced to take it until about 2 years before your first parole date, so by that time -- especially in Mr. Lile's case. He's been in prison for 15 years -- most inmates are going to be at that level 3, so while he was grandfathered in, most inmates, when they get eligible or are forced to take it are going to be at level 3. There has been no change in policy. The State is now not saying that you don't get from level 1 to level 2 unless you participate in SATP. The law still is, if you're at level 3, you're going to level 1, and you're going to go to maximum security, and you're going to stay there forever. Again, the reference I was making at the first is, the arsonist --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's -- this is a product of the -- they don't have the facility to give this course to everyone, so they say, when you're getting closer to release time, you get it, so most people who were in as sexual offenders don't have the opportunity."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILTANGER",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But your brief described a system where, suppose we had all sex offenders, they go in at level 1 unless they take the program. That's something that doesn't exist in the current world only because of a lack of resources, that Kansas can't give this program to all the people who would qualify, so it concentrates on sentence already."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILTANGER",
    "speech": "That is correct, and please understand, Your Honor, that that is only one possible solution that would allow the State to continue to run its SATP. Obviously, another solution, as set forth by the Tenth Circuit, would be immunity. Another thing, to follow the program that the Federal Government runs, make it voluntary. Extract no penalties, and punish no one if they don't want to participate in the program, or take away the admission of responsibility, or take away the need --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The second one is no solution. The State wants people to take it. They think it's important for the rehabilitation of the people and for the safety of society. They do want to exert some pressure for people to go into it. The question is whether this pressure is somehow unconstitutional when you deprive the person of nothing to which he's entitled, nothing to which he had any expectation of receiving when he goes into prison. He could have been kept at level 1 for his whole period there."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILTANGER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I agree with that. The one distinction I would make is, the State has set up a system by which prisoners understand that if they do certain things they get to levels. While there may not be a constitutional liberty interest in it, they do know that if they follow the rules they're going to get to this level. But as far as addressing your first point, immunity would be the result then. If you had to have everybody in the program, if there was no other option, then you would extend them immunity, or the other solution could be, if you wanted everyone in the program, don't make them admit guilt to their crime. Don't make them catalogue every offense that they've never been charged with. Don't then use a polygraph test to sit down and ferret out and make sure that you've got every single past crime. That would be one solution beyond simple immunity."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILTANGER",
    "speech": "Potentially, Your Honor. I mean, the State has not always required a written admission of responsibility. It's only been within the past 10 years that they've required that. But you're correct, the therapists apparently believe that you have to have an admission of responsibility. I'm not sure why it has to be a written statement where you fess everything up. turn on whether or not a written statement is required."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILTANGER",

I don't believe it's a majority of the States that do that. I wish I had a better answer. I do believe Kansas is the only State that requires all this additional ferreting out of additional information."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, if the -- the programs are important, I take it, really important, and they're thinking that this is a very important way to run them, I give them that, all right. Now, if I take your approach -- and I find this very difficult. I take your approach, and I try to distinguish between what's the add- on as a privilege and the subtraction as a penalty, now my concern would be, I'm now facing a nightmare of varying situations in prisons across the country, and varying efforts to say what's the status quo in respect to a particular prisoner, what is an add-on as opposed to a subtraction, and the arguments are infinite. Now, what could you say that would relieve me of that concern?"

  {
    "speaker": "WILTANGER",

That is the position that we mentioned in the brief, that there is -- that we feel there is a difference between a benefit and a punishment. But I also don't think that there will be a rash of litigation. The Supreme Court law, obviously, as you know, speaks to sanctions, speak to penalty, anything that makes your indication of your Fifth Amendment rights costly, and we've have that rule for quite sometime, and certainly there have been cases that have come down since then where you look at it and decide, well, is he being penalized, so again I'm -- I apologize if I'm sticking to a hypertechnical distinction, but I do believe that the law would not really complicate matters, and that there is not going to be a rash of litigation where --"

    "speaker": "WILTANGER",

    "speaker": "WILTANGER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I think that does a couple of things, and why we disagree with Sandin. One is, I think you're creating a new rule, whereas I think we already have a fine rule that works in the Fifth Amendment arena, and if we're concerned about applying a Fifth Amendment rule in the prison system --"

When you deprive someone of a job, he isn't entitled to that job. You are depriving him of some liberty that he, in fact, possessed. Your client has been deprived of no liberty to which he was entitled, not a single liberty to which he was entitled. He could have been kept in level 1 for his entire period in prison. He would have had no complaint at all, so I don't think it's parallel to the out-of- prison cases, so it seems to me we need a new rule for in- prison cases. We could have a rule that so long as you haven't been deprived of a liberty to which you're entitled, there has been no compulsion. That goes pretty far. We don't have to go that far. We could use a line that Sandin uses, so long as what's been done to you doesn't go below the normal expectation of prison life. I mean, if they said, you either enter this program or you're going to be in solitary for the rest of your 15 years, you know, that's beyond the normal expectation of prison life. But what your client has suffered is not that, it seems to me."

He's been moved in response to a proper indication of his Fifth Amendment rights, and he has brought a lawsuit against the State. He his actually following some of the dicta in Sandin. I don't think Sandin should be extended. I do think there is a potential for abuse. Why would Sandin, if you extend it, why would it necessarily be limited to the Fifth Amendment?

That's what they're doing here. And again the point I was trying to make earlier is, the punishment's more severe. The Court calls -- or, excuse me, the State calls this punishment. They call it punishment. When we're dealing with arsonists, when we're dealing with rapists, when we're dealing with somebody who steals something, they call that punishment, but they're unwilling to call that punishment here.

    "speaker": "WILTANGER",
    "speech": "Essentially, yes, that is correct. Again, that is not what we have in place here, but that is correct. That is correct. The Fifth Amendment's a bedrock principle. This Court says it's the mainstay of the criminal justice system, and there's no more powerful piece of evidence than someone's confession. They ask a lot of Mr. Lile and other sex offenders. They not only ask for the admission of guilt, they ask for everything, catalogue and give me everything you want, and despite what the State says, there really isn't a great deal of confidentiality. These records can be subpoenaed. They have to turn these records over if someone were to make an admission about a child sexual offense. Further, these inmates are forced to discuss this stuff in group therapy session. There's no confidentiality, and also to point out, the State has not appealed or contested that what it seeks is incriminating information. This information, the Fifth Amendment itself, is far too valuable that the State can go around and force people to give it up and to extract penalties and punishment for that."

McALLISTER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start, Justice O'Connor, by answering a question you raised. Can the State simply take away all the privileges? Absolutely not. We recognize at some point it becomes compulsive, that this Court has always treated the Fifth Amendment compulsion inquiry as contextual. We're simply arguing that in prison that's a very different context from being on the outside and losing a job or losing your law license. At some point a court could decide, if we took away everything from Mr. Lile, that maybe that would be compulsive, so we're not saying we can take away everything, but what we're saying is, what we're using here is mild in the way of incentives in a prison. We haven't taken away his right to spend money at the canteen, his right to have visitors, his right to earn money. We've limited them, but none of that has been taken away from him completely.

There is a line at which it becomes too much."

Why isn't the rehabilitation of sex offenders who, if unrehabilitated will go out in the community and repeat their crimes, just as important a penalogical reason, and why wouldn't it justify taking away all privileges? MR. McALLISTER: Because the text of the Fifth Amendment says no person shall be compelled, and the question is compulsion, and at some point, if we took away everything, or we make him work 20 hours a day or -- we could do things to him that I think the Court would have to say --"

It would be a vast shift in the way prisons are administered. So that's really a semantic game, and the key inquiry here is, are we compelling them, are we doing something sufficiently substantial to these inmates to override their will and really force them to make these admissions, again which are in a treatment context, not to law enforcement officials, confidentiality guidelines, we've never prosecuted someone for anything they've said in this program --"
