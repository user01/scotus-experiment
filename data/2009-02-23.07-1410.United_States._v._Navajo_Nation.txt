1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument first today in Case 07-1410, United States v. 5 Navajo Nation. 6 General Kneedler. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 GEN. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Six years ago this Court rejected the Navajo 12 Nation's claim for damages in connection with the same 13 action that is before the Court here, the Secretary's 14 approval of amendments to the tribe's mineral lease in 15 the mid-1980s. The Court held there that in order for 16 the United States to be held liable under the Tucker Act 17 or the Indian Tucker Act, the claimant must specify at 18 the threshold a specific rights-creating or 19 duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescription that 20 the government has allegedly violated. 21 The Court found no warrant in any relevant 22 statute or regulation to impose liability on the United 23 States. In particular, the Court concluded that the 24 approval of the royalty rates in the tribe's lease was 25 governed by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, or

1 IMLA. Looking at IMLA's framework, the Court held that 2 there was no, quote, "textual basis," close quote, in 3 any pertinent statutory or regulatory provision that 4 required the Secretary to insist that the tribe 5 negotiate for a higher rate. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it said 7 "pertinent or relevant," but surely that's limited to 8 the statutory provisions that we examined in the case. 9 GEN. KNEEDLER: But I think the way to look 10 at it is what the Court said, that it found no warrant 11 in any relevant statute or regulation, and it discussed 12 not just IMLA but several other statutes which -- which 13 did have to do with the economic -- excuse me -- the 14 economic terms of leases, but -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question -16 GEN. KNEEDLER: -- didn't govern. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question 18 presented, General Kneedler, was limited to IMLA, to the 19 Mineral Leasing Act. 20 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the government's 22 question presented. 23 GEN. KNEEDLER: Two things about that. The 24 government's question presented was that the Court could 25 not find the United States liable or -- was whether the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Court could find the United States liable without 2 finding a violation of IMLA. And therefore, the premise 3 of the question was, without finding a violation of 4 IMLA, the United States could not be liable, and the 5 Court found no violation of IMLA. 6 But beyond that, the tribe's principal 7 submission in this Court was that the United States had 8 control through a network of statutes, including the 9 ones they rely on here. But the Court also itself on 10 page 30 of its brief in that case identified the 11 relevant statute as being IMLA and the other two that 12 this Court discussed and the general introduction to the 13 Rehabilitation Act. 14 So I think the structure of the Court's 15 opinion, looking at the way the tribe serves it up, the 16 Court said there has to be a specific violation of a -17 of a statutory regulatory prescription. The Court found 18 that the relevant one was IMLA, and it found no 19 violation. And therefore -- and the Court also said the 20 tribe's claim, not simply arguments made in favor of the 21 claim, must fail. 22 But if the Court concludes that its prior 23 decision did not absolutely foreclose the litigation, we 24 think it's clear that the framework that this Court 25 announced in -- or reaffirmed in Navajo 1 itself does
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 foreclose the claim here. As I said, the Court 2 concluded that IMLA is the statute that governs the 3 approval of royalty terms in coal leases. 4 On remand, the Federal Circuit relied on two 5 other statutes addressing other subjects, the Surface 6 Mining Reclamation and Control Act, which has to do with 7 the regulation of environmental issues and matters that 8 may arise in connection with a coal lease, and the 9 Hopi-Navajo Rehabilitation Act of 1950, which set in 10 motion a general governmental program to rehabilitate 11 and improve the economic life of the Navajo and Hopi 12 Indians. 13 But neither of those statutes had anything 14 to do with the approval of the economic terms of coal 15 leases. That was governed by IMLA. So the fact that 16 the Federal Circuit on remand held the United States 17 liable on the basis of two statutes that have nothing to 18 do with coal leasing, minus the statute that did have 19 something to do with coal leasing, in our view shows how 20 far the Federal Circuit has strayed from this Court's 21 teachings. 22 But beyond that, we think it's a fortiori 23 that the court of appeals erred in its alternative 24 holding, which was that the United States could be held 25 liable on the basis of general common law principles.

1 The Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act provide that 2 the United States may be liable only for a violation of 3 an act of Congress or a regulation. And it was for that 4 reason that this Court stated in Navajo -- in the Navajo 5 1 case that there has to be a violation of a specific 6 statutory or regulatory provision. 7 Even as a general matter, under this Court's 8 jurisprudence, there is only a very limited role for 9 Federal common law, but that is especially so when what 10 we are talking about here is liability for damages under 11 a waiver of sovereign immunity, and the usual sovereign 12 immunity principles have to cast considerable doubt on 13 that. Only an act of Congress or a regulation adopted 14 pursuant to congressionally conferred authority can 15 provide for the payment of money out of the Federal 16 Treasury under our Constitution. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases in the 18 courts of appeals where Indian tribes litigate with the 19 Secretary and claim an abuse of discretion for the way 20 in which the Secretary performs the duties with respect 21 to Indian lands? 22 GEN. KNEEDLER: Under the Administrative 23 Procedure Act, there could be -- there could be claims 24 brought, but those would not be for money damages. 25 They're --
7

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I recognize that, but 2 I want to know, is there a body of law in the Federal 3 Circuit that generally recognizes that the -- that the 4 Secretary has a fiduciary obligation that's enforceable 5 as a matter of administrative law? 6 GEN. KNEEDLER: Not in the Federal Circuit, 7 to my knowledge, because -- because the Administrative 8 Procedure Act -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I meant all of the 10 circuits. 11 GEN. KNEEDLER: Yes. No -- in the -- under 12 the Administrative Procedure Act -- I'm not -- just like 13 any party could claim -- could challenge what was done 14 by the Department taking particular administrative 15 action. And I think there -- I think that was what -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what I was asking 17 was whether there was some doctrine that the -- that the 18 trustee -- that the Secretary acts in a capacity, a 19 fiduciary capacity as a trustee. If that doctrine were 20 out there, then that might be the basis for saying that 21 it's a sufficient foundation for a money damages. I was 22 just asking, is that doctrine there? 23 GEN. KNEEDLER: No, not -- not in the way 24 you put it. But there are cases that certainly talk 25 about this, that the Secretary has trust
8

1 responsibilities. But there are a lot of ways in which 2 that concept can be used. It can be used in a political 3 sense in that the United States Government, through 4 treaties or a general sense of moral responsibility, 5 should look out for the Indians, and in the day-to-day 6 administration of Indian affairs, to contemplate a trust 7 responsibility is simply to mean that the United States 8 has a special relationship and should deal in that 9 manner. 10 And under the Administrative Procedure Act, 11 if there is -- if there is an action the United States 12 takes under a statute that governs Indian affairs, that 13 would be -- that would be subject to judicial review 14 under the general principles, is it arbitrary and 15 capricious under normal principles, does substantial 16 evidence sustain the determination? 17 But, particularly in a suit for money 18 damages under the -- under the Tucker Act and where 19 Congress has said there has to be a violation of a 20 money-mandating statute or regulation, general common 21 law principles do not suffice. As I said, for money 22 damages, only Congress or an executive agency under -23 acting pursuant to congressional authority under the 24 Constitution can provide for the payment of -- of money 25 out of the Federal Treasury.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- this may be a 2 purely academic distinction, but you talked in terms of 3 liability. Are you suggesting that the trust principles 4 do not set a standard to which the Secretary is bound, 5 or simply that they don't constitute a waiver of 6 sovereign immunity? 7 GEN. KNEEDLER: I think it's really both. 8 The general trust principles, at least -- at least again 9 under Tucker Act jurisprudence, general trust principles 10 are not what establish the Secretary's duties. It's the 11 acts of Congress that impose duties on the Secretary in 12 this area as in any other, or regulations the Secretary 13 has prescribed under it. 14 Now under this Court's jurisprudence, the 15 Court has said that the notion of trust is relevant at 16 the second stage of the analysis. The first stage is 17 the threshold requirement that there be a specific 18 statute or regulation that imposes duties or rights. If 19 the Court finds that, then at the second stage, as this 20 Court has held in Mitchell 2 and indicated in Navajo as 21 well, that may be relevant to determine whether those 22 specific duty-imposing statutes in turn also impose 23 monetary liability on the United States for violation. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Under both IMLA and the 25 Rehabilitation Act, leases have to be approved by the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Secretary. Doesn't that impose a duty on the Secretary? 2 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, what the Court said in 3 Navajo specifically with respect to IMLA, the Secretary, 4 yes, does have to approve it, but the Court specifically 5 rejected the proposition that there was any basis for 6 liability stemming from the Secretary's approval of the 7 lease. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, under the 9 Rehabilitation Act, if it applied to this lease, what 10 would the Secretary's duty be? 11 GEN. KNEEDLER: Section 5 of the 12 Rehabilitation Act for approval of leases is essentially 13 the same as IMLA. It provides for the Secretary to 14 approve the lease. But, as this Court held in IMLA -15 or in Navajo 1, the theory of IMLA is not to have the 16 Secretary be responsible or to take the lead in leasing 17 tribal lands for coal purposes. It's the tribe, subject 18 to the approval, and the Court concluded it would be 19 inconsistent with that arrangement for the Secretary to 20 second-guess the determinations that the secretary had 21 made. And the Court -- the argument was made there and 22 expressly rejected that the Secretary was required to 23 insist that the tribe negotiate a higher amount when it 24 renegotiated the lease. 25 JUSTICE ALITO: The Secretary has to apply
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 some standard, presumably. What is it? 2 GEN. KNEEDLER: What -- what the secretary 3 has adopted -- has done is by regulation, is to say that 4 -- that there is a minimum that the tribe cannot go 5 below. At the time -- at the time of the renegotiation 6 of this lease in 1987, from 1984 to 1987, there was a 7 minimum of 10 percent or 10 cents per ton. The tribe 8 was getting 37.5 cents per ton. This lease was 9 renegotiated in connection with a clause in the lease 10 that allowed adjustments for reasonable rates, which is 11 not the same thing as maximizing the tribe's -- the 12 tribe's revenues, so the Secretary had a regulation at 13 the time of 10 cents per ton. The Secretary now has a 14 regulation that says the minimum royalty rate will be 15 12.5 percent, which, as Court pointed out in Navajo 1, 16 is the standard royalty rate for Federal and tribal 17 leases throughout the United States. 18 Now, what is significant, in further 19 response to your question, is that regulation states 20 that that minimum rate is 12.5 percent unless the 21 Secretary determines that a lower rate would be in the 22 best interest of the Indians. So the way this works 23 then, the way the Secretary has implemented it, it's 24 basically up to the tribe to negotiate something at or 25 above the minimum. If it's below the minimum that the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Secretary's prescribed, the Secretary has to make a 2 judgment that that going lower, maybe because of a 3 geological conditions or whatever, is in the best 4 interest of the Indians. And that is -- that is borne 5 out -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that in IMLA or is that 7 in the Rehabilitation Act? 8 GEN. KNEEDLER: That's in IMLA. That's an 9 IMLA regulation. The general regulations that implement 10 the Rehabilitation Act have a similar provision. They 11 don't talk about royalties, which I think is telling 12 because royalties have to do with coal leases. They 13 talk about -- they require it be a fair rental for 14 property, not a maximum rental but a fair rental. And 15 then it has the same sort of thing, that if it's going 16 to be below the fair market value it has to be in the 17 best interest of the Indians. 18 And I think it's instructive that I know 19 there's been an argument that this lease is governed by 20 -- by the Rehabilitation Act rather than IMLA, and 21 notwithstanding what this Court held in Navajo 1 six 22 years ago, but in 1999 when Secretary Babbitt, who 23 joined the brief arguing this is covered by the 24 Rehabilitation Act, approved the amendments to the lease 25 in 1999, he approved it under the IMLA regulations and
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 he specifically said that because the minimum royalty 2 rate is 12.5 percent -- he is quoting the applicable 3 regulation -- "I do not have to decide whether the 4 royalty rate is in the best interest of the Indians." 5 He went on to say: "But I think it is." 6 So secretary Babbitt's approval of those 7 amendments really explains the way the Secretary has 8 implemented the statutory scheme, and we think that's 9 certainly well within the Secretary's discretion under a 10 statute that did not impose any limitations. With 11 respect to the Rehabilitation Act, the general leasing 12 provision of that act, as we've explained in our brief, 13 does not apply to mineral leases. That continued to be 14 governed by IMLA after 1950. But even if it did, there 15 is nothing in section 5 that imposes any more specific 16 duties with respect to royalty terms or any other terms 17 than IMLA itself. Section 5 has to do with surface -18 leases for surface users, business purposes basically. 19 And that was put in there because at the time there was 20 no provision for long-term leases if somebody wanted to 21 bring a surface commercial venture onto a reservation. 22 But the last sentence of section 5 of the -23 of the act on page 171a of the petition appendix says 24 that: "Nothing contained in section 5 shall affect the 25 authority" -- "shall be construed to repeal or affect
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the authority under any other act of Congress." So 2 section -- and the other act of Congress here is IMLA. 3 I think it's also -- I think it's also 4 instructive to point out not only did this Court hold 5 the last time around that the lease was governed by 6 IMLA, that was the tribe's position in this case. Its 7 proposed findings of fact indeed in the Court of Federal 8 Claims, pages 524 and 525 of the joint appendix, said 9 the lease was governed by IMLA. 10 But the textual dispositive point is that 11 the lease couldn't have been entered into under the 12 Rehabilitation Act. The lease in this case provided 13 that the lease would be for a term of 10 years and then 14 subject to a further extension for as long as minerals 15 are produced in paying quantities. That precise 16 language is repeated in the lease, which shows that it 17 was under IMLA. 18 Under section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act, 19 the lease could only be for an initial term of 25 years 20 and then a further term of 25 more years. It wouldn't 21 have allowed for this sort of lease here and indeed, 22 because the initial lease term here was 10 years and 23 then could have only been 25 more years under the Rehab 24 Act, this lease would have had to expire in 1999, and 25 yet it was amended at that time and continues in effect
15

1 and mining continues under it. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: The other side says that 3 certain standard provisions in the IMLA leases did not 4 exist in this lease. Is that accurate? 5 GEN. KNEEDLER: No. Well, they said -- I 6 think -- the only thing I think they say along those 7 lines is that -- has to do with the form of the lease. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: With the forms? 9 GEN. KNEEDLER: The form on which the lease 10 is used. I think what they said is there were several 11 provisions that appear in regulations under general 12 statutes that are related to leases. One has to do with 13 the property can't be used for unlawful purposes, and 14 I'm forgetting what the second one was. But it wouldn't 15 be unusual that the Secretary might borrow or a tribe 16 might borrow provisions from other leases and put them 17 in this lease. 18 This is -- again, IMLA provides for 19 negotiation. So the parties are free to put in 20 particular provisions of lease. So that the fact that 21 there might be things that would parallel what were in 22 the other leases we don't think is really dispositive. 23 Also, the other significant thing is that 24 the lease itself incorporates or refers to by reference 25 the IMLA regulations. So even if somehow the lease were
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 thought to be governed by Section 5, even though that 2 wasn't what it was issued under, the IMLA regulations 3 would control, and this Court already held in Navajo 1 4 that those IMLA regulations, which are in the lease, do 5 not impose any -- did not impose any -- did not impose 6 any duty on the Secretary with respect to the approval, 7 approval of the lease. 8 I should also point out that when the -- we 9 cite this in our briefs, that at the time the lease 10 amendments were approved in 1987 the Solicitor's Office 11 did a legal review of the propriety of the lease 12 amendments and that legal review expressly says that the 13 lease was entered into under IMLA. 14 So I think the circumstances are really 15 overwhelming that it was entered into under IMLA and 16 that the Rehabilitation Act lease provision does not 17 have anything to do with this lease. And the more 18 general emanation from the Rehabilitation Act that the 19 tribe seeks to rely on here are too general and short. 20 The Rehabilitation Act was enacted in 1950 in 21 recognition that the plight of the Navajo and Hopi was 22 very serious, and Congress undertook to study resources 23 and put in the infrastructure and that sort of thing, 24 and part of it was to have programs -- excuse me -25 studies to determine what the tribe's coal resources
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 were, and that was done, and this lease grew out of 2 that. But that doesn't mean that it was in any way 3 governed by the Rehabilitation Act. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Kneedler, the 5 last time -- the last time around, we remanded for 6 further proceedings consistent with our opinion. Would 7 you advocate a different bottom line this time? 8 GEN. KNEEDLER: Yes. I would -- I would 9 suggest that this case be reversed. I mean this -- this 10 concerns a -- outright and with directions to dismiss 11 the complaint. This -- this controversy arose in the 12 mid-1980's. The litigation has been going on since 13 1993, and it's been -- this is now the second time that 14 it's been -- that it's been to this Court. 15 And we think in doing so that the -- that 16 the Court should reiterate the analytical framework that 17 it put forward in -- in its decision the last time 18 around so that there will be no mistaking the way these 19 cases are to be handled in the Federal circuit in the 20 future by requiring that the threshold, a -- as I said, 21 a specific statutory or regulatory provision that 22 imposes duties and not in particular looking at general 23 notions of common law that -- that might arise out of -24 out of some sort of -- some sort of factual control. 25 The last thing I wanted to say is that the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Federal circuit also relied on the Surface Mining 2 Reclamation and Control Act. And that -- and that, as I 3 said, has to do with environmental issues in connection 4 with -- with Indian leases. The Federal circuit relied 5 on a provision that says that the -- that the Secretary 6 should include in any Indian leases additional 7 provisions that were proposed by the tribe. But that's 8 additional provisions in addition to other environmental 9 provisions extending from the statute that had to be in 10 the lease. It was -- it was just quite a stretch for 11 the -- for the court to conclude that that somehow 12 controlled the economic terms of the leases. 13 If there are no further questions, I will 14 reserve the balance of my time. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 16 Mr. Phillips. 17 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 18 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 20 and may it please the Court: 21 I think I would like to start with Justice 22 Alito's question because he said: Doesn't Section 5 of 23 the Rehabilitation Act specifically require the 24 Secretary to approve this lease? And Mr. Kneedler 25 conceded that it does. And so then the question is:
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Doesn't that create some kind of a duty? And it seems 2 to me clearly it does, just as the Court I think 3 implicitly said in Navajo 1, the difference between 4 Navajo 1 and Navajo 2 being that this Court then went on 5 to examine IMLA, the Indian Mineral Leasing Act. 6 It concluded that IMLA very specifically for 7 the entirety of native Americans and for the entirety of 8 Indian mineral leasing had a preference to ensure that 9 the Indian tribes themselves would -- would attain a 10 certain self sufficiency. And it essentially advocated 11 the responsibility of having to deal with individual 12 negotiations and allowed it for the tribes to take over. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Phillips, I'm 14 looking at the last paragraph, and it says: We have no 15 warrant from any relevant statute or regulation, et 16 cetera. So it wasn't limited to IMLA. Do you think 17 that was just carelessness on the Court's part? 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, I would -- I would never 19 assume that, Justice Ginsburg. I -- I think -- I think 20 the operative term here is "relevant." And that is that 21 the Court for purposes of analyzing the question 22 presented and disposing of it evaluated not only IMLA 23 but the other two provisions that the -- that the 24 government and the Court felt needed to be disposed of 25 at that point.

1 The Court didn't address the alternative 2 arguments under either Macrow or the Rehabilitation Act. 3 To be sure, they were argued. But I -- I have seen many 4 instances in which alternative arguments were made, and 5 -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand your 7 answer. If you say that those were not relevant and, 8 therefore, they were not covered -9 MR. PHILLIPS: Not relevant to the question 10 presented, which is the proper interpretation of the -11 the Indian Mineral Leasing Act. And, indeed, if you 12 look at the other two provisions, the opinion of the 13 Court analyzing them through the -- through the prism of 14 the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, it says those don't add 15 to the Indian Mineral Leasing Act. 16 Our argument here is that Section 5 of the 17 Rehabilitation Act provides a wholly independent basis 18 on which there is a duty imposed, but that duty is then 19 implemented in the regulations that are identified in 20 the -- in the Secretary's -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: In the Rehabilitation Act, 22 the requirements for approval of lease, is -- is that 23 applicable to mineral leases? 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Is that applicable to mineral 25 leases?
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely, it's applicable 3 to mineral leases. The -- the language of the statute 4 is "business leases, including those for the development 5 of mineral resources." So clearly it applies to Indian 6 mineral leases, but -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Where is 8 the specific reference to mineral leases, mineral 9 resources? 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Mineral resources. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says "resources." 12 I don't remember it saying "mineral resources." 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, the development of the 14 "resources" for the Navajo and Hopi Indians. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a big 16 difference, don't you think? 17 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry. The development 18 for utilization of natural resources. 19 But the basic point there is, at least as I 20 read section 5, what it's saying is that it grants broad 21 leasing authority. The Solicitor General is absolutely 22 right about that. But that authority extends to certain 23 kinds of mineral leasing. 24 And that says -- and that's an authority and 25 it's important to recognize this. Because while it is
22
Alderson Reporting Company

1 true for the run-of-the-mill Native Americans who are -2 who are engaged in mineral leasing it may make sense to 3 say: Look, we -- we are going to take a hands-off 4 approach for the most part. We are going to set a 5 minimum ceiling or a minimum floor and above that you 6 negotiate as hard as you want. 7 But the -- but the Navajo were in a 8 fundamentally different position in 1950 when this 9 legislation was enacted. The -- the median education on 10 that -- on that reservation was less than one year of 11 education. 12 The resources were $400 per year annual 13 income. This was a tribe in horrible condition. And so 14 it would make perfect sense for Congress to say: Look, 15 for -- for most tribes we want to go ahead and have the 16 approval be based with the -- with the Secretary taking 17 a hands-off approach above a certain minimum, but when 18 you deal with the Navajo -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it your -- is it your 20 position that it would be -- that it -- it is not lawful 21 for coal on the Navajo Reservation to be leased under 22 IMLA, that the lease would have to be solely under 23 section 5 of the Rehabilitation -24 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think it would 25 have to be solely under it. I -- I think that's a -- a
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 false dichotomy. I don't think this is an either/or 2 proposition. I think there are parts of IMLA that can 3 reasonably be applied here, and -- and section 5 4 specifically says no authority from other statutes, 5 which would include IMLA, is meant to be superseded by 6 the passage of section 5. So I think there is a rule. 7 And I think that the lease -- if you read the 8 lease on its face -- Justice Scalia asked the question: 9 Does this lease conform to the form lease that you get 10 under IMLA? The answer is clearly not. 11 This is a mix and match between some 12 provisions, it seems to me, that clearly provides 13 additional protection for the Navajo and other 14 provisions that -15 JUSTICE ALITO: But the lease -- the lease 16 doesn't follow the -- the requirements of section 5 of 17 the Rehabilitation Act in -- in respect to its term. 18 But what is your -- is it your position that in entering 19 into a lease the tribe has the authority to decide that 20 we want this to be under IMLA; we want this to be under 21 the Rehabilitation Act? When it comes up to the 22 Secretary for approval, does the Secretary have the 23 authority to say, I'm going to approve this under IMLA; 24 I'm going to approve it under section 5? 25 MR. PHILLIPS: I think the Secretary has to
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 approve it under both of those provisions. It is just 2 that IMLA in this particular context would impose a 3 10-cent minimum over time. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about the 5 fact that the term of this lease would -- would not be 6 permitted under the Rehabilitation Act? 7 MR. PHILLIPS: I think it would be permitted 8 under the Rehabilitation Act because the last sentence 9 of section 5 specifically says that this is not meant to 10 limit any other authority provided under any other 11 statute. And since IMLA provides additional time and 12 durational protections for the tribes under these 13 circumstances, that provision would definitely allow you 14 to use IMLA's time limits rather than the Rehabilitation 15 Act. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Explain to me the -17 the relevant scope of IMLA and the Rehab Act. The -18 the argument that you made, that you just made, makes 19 perfect sense if the Rehab Act applies to some kinds of 20 -- of leases or contracts that the -- that the IMLA does 21 not. 22 And yet I -- I thought you were saying a 23 little bit earlier that the Rehab Act applies to all 24 mineral leasing, because that would be the development 25 of the natural resource. And if that is so, then there
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 seems to be a pretty clear conflict, even on your own 2 argument, between the term provisions in the Rehab Act 3 and the term provisions of IMLA with respect to -- to 4 mineral leases. How do -- how do we get out of that 5 problem for you? 6 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I think the -- the key 7 distinction is to look at the -- at who is being 8 regulated, and under the Rehabilitation act it's the 9 Navajo and the Hopi. And -- and Congress said, look, we 10 are going to take special care to protect and to try to 11 put them into a position where they can even just catch 12 up to other Native Americans. 13 And so it seems to me that there is -14 that's a special protection with a special duty, and 15 that duty is enforced through the 162 regulations. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's a special 17 protection and special duty that applies to every one of 18 the mineral leases, including this one, that the Navajo 19 may be involved in. 20 MR. PHILLIPS: Correct. 21 JUSTICE SOUTER: So I -- what -- maybe -22 maybe I missed the point, but would you go back to 23 justice Scalia's question: How is it that there is not 24 a conflict here between this lease and the Rehab Act? 25 MR. PHILLIPS: Because the last section
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 under section 5 says that, notwithstanding anything 2 else, this provision doesn't preclude -- doesn't -3 doesn't limit the authority that would otherwise exist. 4 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that, in effect -- but 5 that, in effect, is saying this -- this provision will 6 never apply to a mineral lease with the Navajo or the 7 Hopi. I mean, you are reading it right out of the act 8 with respect to these two tribes. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is all that the 10 Rehabilitation Act -- I'm sorry. 11 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, it's because the 12 provision applies to a lot of other leases, too. Are 13 you asking when the 20 or 10 and 10. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect -- my point is 15 with respect to every mineral lease of the Hopi and the 16 Navajo, you are saying the term provision never applies. 17 Am I correct -18 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I understand. Right. I 19 have the answer your question which is this provision in 20 section 5 applies not just to mineral lease, it applies 21 to all business site leasing. 22 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it only applies to 23 those two tribes. And there is something very, very 24 strange, it seems to me, in saying that the -- that the 25 kind of -- the saving sentence at the end of section 5
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 reads its very term limit provisions out of every -- out 2 of every possible application for mineral lease by these 3 two tribes. And that's what you are saying. 4 MR. PHILLIPS: But -- but -- but the 5 important distinction -- and I hope I can articulate 6 this -- is that section 5 applies beyond mineral leases. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: I realize that. 8 MR. PHILLIPS: So that all -- so the time 9 limitation of 10 years and 10 years, if you bring a 10 barber shop, you want to build a barber shop on those 11 lands, you want to lease the space in order to do that, 12 you would be subject to the section 5 time limitations, 13 unless for some reason there is another authorization 14 somewhere. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But that, in effect, 16 means that -- and I don't want to overdo your barber 17 shop analysis or example, but that, in effect, says -18 MR. PHILLIPS: I need a haircut. 19 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- on -- on trivial lease 20 contracts there are term limits, but on the ones that 21 really count, where the real money is, doesn't apply at 22 all. 23 MR. PHILLIPS: There is a -- way beyond that 24 there is an entire defense plant on the Navajo tribe -25 on the Navajo reservation right now that would obviously
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 be subject to precisely these same limitations. So it's 2 not just trivial, it's all business lease citing that is 3 covered why that. 4 So it seems to me not at all unreasonable to 5 think that Congress, in its -- in its very protective 6 effort here under section 5 would say, here are all the 7 leases that you are allowed to enter into. You have 8 broad leasing authority, we are going to protect you 9 against overreaching by restricting how long you can go, 10 but if there are other provisions of law that allow 11 these to be modified in a particular area, we will allow 12 those to be modified in that way. 13 And in this context, what that last sentence 14 would, in my mind, say is there is no reason to try 15 and -- to say that IMLA or the Rehabilitation Act. It 16 seems to me much more sensible to say that Congress 17 would have intended multiple protections for the Navajo. 18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume that, and I -19 I -- I think your argument is well taken. But assuming 20 that, don't we also have to assume that the stress in 21 IMLA on placing primary responsibility on the tribes, 22 not on the Secretary should, in fact, also be imported 23 to the application of the Rehab Act as you say it should 24 be applied. 25 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But you see I don't
29

1 think that's an authority. I would say -- I would not 2 read -3 JUSTICE SOUTER: What's not an authority? 4 MR. PHILLIPS: The notion that the Navajo 5 tribe would be in a position to better -- to better -6 to -- I'm sorry, to achieve self-sufficiency. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. You made a good 8 argument a few moments ago for the fact that it would 9 have been at least at one time inappropriate to thrust 10 that responsibility on the Navajo, but there was no 11 Navajo exception in IMLA. That responsibility was 12 thrust on the Navajo -13 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sure there isn't -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- and this Court 15 recognized that. 16 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But that's exactly 17 why the Navajo Rehabilitation Act of 1950 does modify 18 IMLA. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: With respect to that -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Expired -21 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry? 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the opinion in the 23 last time around not only contained the statement that I 24 read before, that is, any relevant statute, but in the 25 very beginning it says, "We hold the tribe's claim for
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 compensation from the federal government failed," and 2 there is a well known distinction between a claim at 3 issue and attributing to the Court that kind of 4 carelessness for saying that the claim is barred as 5 distinguished from an issue, the issue being IMLA. I 6 think the Court was conscious of that distinction when 7 it used the word that the claim failed, not just the 8 issue. 9 MR. PHILLIPS: Obviously, Justice Ginsburg, 10 you are in a much better position to judge what was 11 intended here. On the other hand, my experience with 12 the Court generally is that when you analyze a case, 13 that you analyze it in terms of the specific question 14 that is presented, and if you are posing to go beyond 15 the question presented, you say so expressly, not simply 16 by the use of the word "claim" or "argument." 17 So while I recognize that the Court -- that 18 the government has an argument to be made that has 19 pre-decided that, I think, frankly, one, the Court 20 didn't decide this issue; and two, the Court should 21 decide the question that was presented here as to the 22 scope of section 5, because it's obviously of 23 extraordinary importance to not only section 5 but also 24 to section 8 as well. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, the
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 government says that by the time this lease was 2 executed, the Rehabilitation Act was a dead letter. 3 That it was meant to stimulate economic activity on the 4 Navajo reservation, and there were funds appropriated 5 for that purpose and that all had been played out by the 6 time this lease was entered into. 7 Is there something wrong with that? 8 MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah, the government's wrong 9 about that. I believe -- the program itself is for the 10 overall rehabilitation of the Navajo and the Hopi. 11 There are a series of projects that the -- where the 12 statute says such programs shall include the following 13 projects. It doesn't say it's limited to the following 14 projects, and those projects have been set out over 15 time. 16 But the program itself is not limited that 17 way and more fundamentally, it is completely 18 inconsistent with that kind of time limitation on the 19 statute overall. Congress would have repealed certain 20 sections of this act, sections 9 and 10 after the 21 10-year period that expired if the statute didn't have 22 any continuing implication. 23 It also would have meant that the leasing 24 protections in section 5 had expired after 10 years, 25 which seems to me quite inconsistent with the overall
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 purpose here to accomplish that. So I think the 2 temporal argument doesn't get the government 3 particularly far. 4 I would like to take a second to talk about 5 sort what I think is an important distinction between 6 635 and other provisions, which is that 634(a) imposes a 7 duty that the Secretary's brief, I think, evidently sets 8 out, that duty means that you have to make sure there is 9 fair market value, that those are reasonable rates, and 10 that was not done. So that's the violation that took 11 place. 12 Then the question is, is there a 13 money-generating, money-mandating obligation imposed 14 here. And there it seems to be the distinction between 15 635(a), which said nothing about liability, and 635(b) 16 and (c), which expressly -- expressly excludes the 17 possibility of liability, suggests clearly why 635(a) 18 ought to be viewed by this Court as a sufficient -- as 19 creating a fair inference, is what the Court said in 20 Mitchell two, a fair inference under these particular 21 circumstances. 22 The other issue that we have put on the 23 table that the government didn't actually address in its 24 opening, although I have to suspect -25 JUSTICE BREYER: So you are saying that
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 635(a) creates an inference that 635(c) creates a 2 fiduciary duty? 3 MR. PHILLIPS: No, 635(a) creates the 4 fiduciary duties. The juxtaposition of (a) to (b) and 5 (c) demonstrates that that duty is a money-mandating or 6 rights-creating duty that's enforceable under the Indian 7 Tucker Act, Justice Breyer. 8 The other duty, it seems to me, that the 9 Secretary breached there is the duty embedded in section 10 8 of this statute, which requires him to make 11 disclosures as part of this program. And the one thing 12 that is absolutely clear that the Court of Federal 13 Claims -14 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the part that I'm 15 not getting. You are saying -- the question, I guess, 16 basically is, does the language of 635(a) that says with 17 the approval of the Secretary, the Indians can, among 18 other things, for business purposes lease the land. 19 Right? That's what it says? 20 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And then -21 JUSTICE BREYER: And that doesn't seem much 22 different from the IMLA, to tell you the truth, to me. 23 It doesn't seem different at all. But now you are 24 saying, no, it's really different because look at (b) 25 and (c), that's your basic argument?
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: I look at (b) and (c) and 3 it says -- when you lease something under (b) and (c) 4 which is not (a) -- (b) and (c) -- you have to have this 5 all supervision, and so forth, or it has to be at a fair 6 value, something like that; is that right? 7 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it doesn't -- it 8 doesn't -9 JUSTICE BREYER: (B) and (c) say that land is 10 owned in fee but, let's see -- what is -- sorry, I don't 11 want to delay you on this. I thought that (b) and (c), 12 you were saying, create an obligation -- create more of 13 a trust obligation. 14 MR. PHILLIPS: No, just to read (b) which 15 unfortunately isn't reproduced I don't think in any of 16 the papers, but it says notwithstanding any other 17 provision of law, land owned in fee simple by the Navajo 18 may be leased, sold or otherwise disposed of by the sole 19 authority of the tribal council in any manner that a 20 similar land in this State is situated may be leased, 21 sold or otherwise disposed of by other private land 22 owners, and the -- such disposition shall create no 23 liability on the part of the United States. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: So why does that -- why 25 does that mean that this Act creates a trust
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 relationship? 2 MR. PHILLIPS: No, that -- the -- the trust 3 relationship doesn't come out of the PNC; the money 4 creating component of it, it seems to me comes, out of 5 PNC. The trust relationship comes from the fact that 6 the entirety of the statute was enacted to implement the 7 treaties, that these are all lands that are held in 8 trust, and that -- and that there is a specific duty 9 embedded in (a) that requires that the Secretary approve 10 what is otherwise basically controlled as a trust 11 arrangement, and that is implemented through regulations 12 that require the Secretary to do this under a fair 13 market value standard. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, give me an -- an 15 instance in the statute that is in opposition brief of 16 the orange brief at page 5. Give me an example of why 17 the last clause "and such disposition shall create no 18 liability on the part of the United States," what 19 contingency was that directed to if not the one that is 20 before us? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's for the sale of 22 fee simple lands, so you are dealing with a very 23 different set of -- of circumstances. Which is talking 24 about -- it's aimed clearly at a different set of 25 properties that were being held and therefore they said,
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 when you engage in leases for that kind of property, 2 there is no liability. 3 JUSTICE SOUTER: But your -- your argument 4 is that simply because there isn't that kind of an 5 exclusion in (a), there must have been an intent to 6 permit liability. 7 MR. PHILLIPS: A fair inference, I think is 8 all I have to demonstrate -9 JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you, but now what of 10 course is at the back of my mind is I'm trying to see, 11 if this -- is this statute stronger for you than the 12 statute we already considered? And I start with some 13 suspicion, because I think if it is a stronger statute 14 for you, you would have argued it the last time. So I 15 wonder why you didn't. 16 MR. PHILLIPS: I wasn't here then. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: So somebody thought maybe 18 it was a weaker statute, so -- but I will put that 19 suspicion aside. 20 MR. PHILLIPS: Can I ask you -21 JUSTICE BREYER: So anyhow that's the 22 fundamental question in my mind. I look at the language 23 and so forth, but the language doesn't seem any stronger 24 for you, at least at first blush. 25 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. There's two -- there
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 are two answers; I was being facetious as to why we 2 didn't push this argument the last time. It was largely 3 because the Federal Circuit concluded the last time 4 based on IMLA alone that there was in fact a sufficient 5 right-creating provision. And therefore we depended -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So did you, Mr. Phillips. 7 Last time around you acknowledged that the Peabody lease 8 was governed only by IMLA. That -- those words were 9 from your brief last time around. 10 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know if those were 11 from the brief. I know there was a statement of 12 undisputed facts in the first round of litigation. But 13 there is no question in the Court -- if we are right, 14 that the Court remanded to -- from consideration 15 consistent with this. We then went down upon remand 16 from the Federal Circuit; we took additional discovery; 17 and we obtained the information that we got. And also, 18 remember, the United States' brief in the Ninth Circuit 19 specifically says that this was approved pursuant to the 20 Rehabilitation Act -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought -- you are 22 really saying that you were wrong in make that 23 concession. 24 MR. PHILLIPS: That was an overstatement, 25 there's no question. Based on what we knew at the time,
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 we thought it was in fact an IMLA lease, but in truth -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In -- IMLA -3 MR. PHILLIPS: -- is it's not IMLA, anyway. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is the statute 5 that seems most closely on point, because it's the only 6 one that talks about mineral leases exclusively. 7 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, but this is the only one 8 that deals specifically with the Navajo Reservation and 9 deals with leasing for business purposes for the 10 development of resources. And so while I -- I agree 11 with you in one sense, the other one has a -- some 12 superficial closeness here. It seems to me that the 13 closer one is actually the provision that deals with 14 this specific reservation and this specific type of a 15 lease arrangement. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you knew all of 17 that -- that's not -- that's not something you 18 discovered on remand. You knew all that before. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we -- we obtained 20 additional information, certainly, you know. We have 21 the Udall declaration that specifically said that when 22 he negotiated this lease he negotiated it as the 23 centerpiece of the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 24 1950. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that affidavit
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 was before or after our decision the first time around? 2 MR. PHILLIPS: It was after the first time 3 around. I mean, there is no question that if we had won 4 the first time around, we would have stood by that 5 statement, but having lost it -6 (Laughter.) 7 MR. PHILLIPS: -- there is a tendency to 8 focus the mind elsewhere, and we did. But the reality 9 is that if you look at the parties, the -- Secretary 10 Udall specifically says this was adopted pursuant to the 11 Rehabilitation Act. Peabody Coal Company in briefing in 12 the Arizona courts has specifically said that this was 13 approved under the Rehabilitation Act, and the United 14 States Government itself in briefing in other courts has 15 said that this was approved pursuant to the -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: You bring in Federal 17 officials to testify years after the fact as to what 18 basis they acted earlier? That's very strange to me. I 19 don't know what -- what motive Secretary Udall has today 20 that might induce him to say that. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Obviously -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: If there was some statement 23 at the time, I could understand it, but bringing him in 24 how many years after -- 40 years after? 25 MR. PHILLIPS: He has a good memory,
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Justice Scalia. 2 (Laughter.) 3 MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Scalia, I 4 understand that, but the -- the bottom line here is, the 5 question is, is this, you know -- is it absolutely clear 6 that this is exclusively an IMLA lease? And the answer 7 to that is there is a lot of evidence that suggests no. 8 It's not in the form of IMLA; there are a lot from other 9 statements that say yes, and more fundamentally it seems 10 to me is the Court should not view it as an either/or 11 proposition. It could be adopted under IMLA or it could 12 be adopted separately. So the section 8 argument -13 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought that your argument 14 earlier was that all leases of mineral rights on the 15 Navajo-Hopi land are governed by the Rehabilitation Act, 16 and it's not a factual question as to which statute 17 anybody chose at the time of the negotiation of the 18 lease. But recently, in the last few minutes, you seem 19 to be arguing that it was a factual issue that was -20 that was unearthed only through later discovery. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that it's 22 a factual question; it is that candidly, we obviously 23 focused more on IMLA because the Federal Circuit -24 first of all, the Court of Federal Claims in the first 25 go-around adopted IMLA as the test and just said you
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 lose because you don't have an IMLA lease here; and we 2 had argued here that it's not just an IMLA lease. Then 3 we went to the Federal Circuit and we won on the grounds 4 that it was an IMLA controlled error and we should 5 prevail on that basis. When it was sent back down and 6 we obviously didn't have IMLA available, since the 7 Federal Circuit specifically precluded us from any 8 further reliance on IMLA, we looked at the other 9 provisions; we tried to understand their context, and 10 then that -- all I'm trying to do is explain why it is 11 that we would suddenly focus more on the Navajo act, not 12 to say that you couldn't read the statute and say it 13 would necessarily apply in that circumstance. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't really my 15 question, because I've tried to erase from my mind any 16 suspicion about why you did or didn't argue it last 17 time; and looking at it straight afresh, I think when 18 the Court of Claims got this back, as any judge would, 19 the first thing they do is look at the words of the old 20 statute, look at the words of the new statute, and try 21 to figure out if the new statute that you cited is 22 somehow more supportive of your claim than the old one 23 was. 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So what have we got
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 here in that respect? What we seem to have is two later 2 provisions that say the government shall have no 3 liability when it enters into leases. I mean, maybe 4 that helps you, but at the moment, I am slightly 5 escaping it. And then I guess there is some regs that 6 were promulgated after the lease was entered into and 7 seem on their face to deal with other matters. Okay, 8 now, what am I missing? 9 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm not sure I understand the 10 last part about -11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well the regs you didn't 12 emphasize, so forget them. If you don't want to rely on 13 them we won't. 14 The -- but I've looked for everything I 15 could find that would support you on this basis -16 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and there you are, so I 18 want to you add something to explain -19 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I would go back to 20 Justice Alito's first question that was posed to Mr. 21 Kneedler, which was is this provision has a duty -22 because it has an approval requirement; and the answer 23 is yes, this Court in Navajo I looked further at IMLA, 24 at that specific statute, and concluded that that 25 statute overall had a very significant limitation
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 embedded in that duty; and the question is, is there 2 anything in the Rehabilitation Act that has that same 3 limitation? 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 5 MR. PHILLIPS: And my answer to that is no, 6 there is nothing in it; and contrary to the overall 7 intent of IMLA, which was to guarantee self-sufficiency, 8 the overall intent of this statute was to allow the 9 Navajo to come somewhere in the area of those standards. 10 In addition to that, I do think there are regulations 11 that do require the Secretary to invoke a fair market 12 value assessment of the rates that are embedded in this 13 lease, and that he did not -- he clearly did not do 14 that. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if you are 16 right about the duty-creating aspect, what -- talk a 17 little about the money-mandating aspect, the second 18 stage of the analysis under Navajo I. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think the key to 20 that is -- is sort of two-fold. One, I think when you 21 -- in the absence of some clear statement in this 22 statute akin to the one that existed in IMLA, that 23 reduces the duty of the United States, that the Court 24 ought to then simply examine this against the background 25 of the trust principles and say you have a duty; you
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 ought to exercise your duty consistent with your role as 2 a trustee; and you ought to -- you ought to be acting in 3 the best interests of the Navajo Nation. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before we find a 5 waiver of sovereign immunity opening up the Treasury of 6 the United States, we usually insist on something a 7 little more specific than general trust principles. 8 MR. PHILLIPS: And then the second -- I 9 mean, if you are not prepared to accept the general 10 trust principles, although, again, they go through the 11 context of a specific imposed duty that -- that 635(a) 12 has in the first instance. But even if you want to go 13 beyond that, then I go to 635(b) and (c), where Congress 14 clearly seems to have in mind the possibility of not 15 having liability imposed in certain circumstances and 16 yet left 635(a) there without a similar protection for 17 the United States, which, again, may not be the 18 compelled inference, but it certainly seems to me to 19 create a fair inference. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not how 21 the Secretary reads 635. Isn't he entitled to Chevron 22 deference? 23 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, unless you are saying 24 that -- I don't know what context Mr. Chief Justice was 25 talking about. I mean -- but to be sure, lawyers don't
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 want to read it that way because they are in litigation 2 right now. But I don't see anything in the statutory 3 scheme or in the regulatory scheme that would say that. 4 And certainly, if you go back and look at the 5 Secretary's brief, in their analysis of the regulatory 6 scheme, the -- let me see if I can find this -- page 25 7 to 26, where they point out that there was a gap where 8 -- where the Secretary did not exclude mineral leasing 9 from the 635 -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: What did Secretary Udall 11 think about this? 12 MR. PHILLIPS: He's fully on board, Justice 13 Scalia. 14 (Laughter.) 15 MR. PHILLIPS: It's not in the brief. 16 I'll just conclude with the section (a) 17 argument, which is to recognize that the Secretary did 18 owe a duty of candor and disclosure embedded in section 19 (a). That program did not end. That disclosure 20 responsibility did not end. What the measure of damages 21 for that breach of duty is a question that obviously is 22 still open on remand. But the notion that the Secretary 23 can behave the way the Secretary did in this case, which 24 is to know that he was not going to take personal 25 jurisdiction over the final decision, command that no

EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 15 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 16 GEN. KNEEDLER: First, Mr. Chief Justice, 17 with respect to the text of section 5, it doesn't -- it 18 doesn't by any means suggest that it covers mineral 19 leases. The pertinent phrase is that they -- that the 20 tribe or members of the tribe "may lease" -- "with the 21 approval of the Secretary, may lease for various 22 religious, recreational, or business purposes, including 23 the development" of utilization -- "or utilization of 24 natural resources in connection with the operations 25 under those leases." It's not a free-standing mineral

1 lease or resource lease provision. It says, "including" 2 and "in connection with operations under such leases," 3 referring back to business leases or the other things 4 there. So I think, on its face, it doesn't suggest it 5 covers mineral leases. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -7 GEN. KNEEDLER: But -8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it says "the 9 development or utilization of natural resources." 10 GEN. KNEEDLER: "In connection with 11 operations under such leases." And -- and what's above, 12 a recitation of things that don't include mineral 13 leases. It's educational, recreational, and business 14 leases. And as we explained, there are specific -15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why isn't it a 16 public purpose to develop Indian minerals? That 17 benefits the Indians and whole country. 18 GEN. KNEEDLER: It says "business" 19 purposes," and as such -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, it says "public." 21 GEN. KNEEDLER: "For public, religious" -22 "public" would be like for a school, if a State was 23 going to put a school on or something, but -- but the -24 but as we explain in our brief, there was a specific 25 reason why Congress enacted this. There was a gap in

1 the authority to lease for these types of purposes at 2 the time this was enacted. 3 JUSTICE SOUTER: And why didn't -4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, even if -- if I may 5 have just one minute, Justice Souter. 6 If you get revenue from the natural 7 resources, why isn't that a public, religious, 8 educational purpose? They get revenue from leasing. 9 GEN. KNEEDLER: The -- the example would be 10 -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just -- I just think you 12 give too cramped a reading to section 5. 13 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, the example would be, 14 if you -- for example, if you were going to use water -15 this is a Navajo reservation -- if you needed water for 16 a business and sink a well, you would be utilizing or 17 developing the natural resources in connection with a 18 surface lease. But -- but the last section of -- the 19 last sentence of section 5 says, "Nothing in this 20 section shall be construed to repeal or affect the 21 authority under other provisions." And it's the other 22 provision that is IMLA. The regulations -23 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I just supplement 24 Justice Kennedy's question? Why can't the development 25 of the mineral leases be regarded as an adjunct to a
49

1 business enterprise? 2 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well -3 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean business purposes. 4 I -5 GEN. KNEEDLER: I -- I suppose they could, 6 but in -- in the terminology, mineral leasing, as we 7 explain in our brief -- that the categories of leasing 8 that are -- have always been handled differently. 9 "Mineral leasing" is the term that is used for minerals. 10 Business, grazing, farming -- we explain this in our 11 brief, that those are different. The regulations that 12 were utilized to implement section 5 had never included 13 specific provisions for mineral leases. They have 14 always been under other -- other provisions. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do the regs specifically 16 address the scope of business purposes? 17 GEN. KNEEDLER: They -- they -- not beyond 18 basically repeating them, but the -- but they, for 19 example, talk about rental value, which is not the way 20 you describe mineral leases, which are -- which are 21 royalties, not rental value. 22 If I could also address the argument about 23 sections (b) and (c), sections (b) and (c) of this Act 24 provide -- first of all, were enacted after section (a), 25 so I don't think much of an inference could be drawn.

1 But there are situations -- special types of conveyances 2 that the tribe was going to make: One was for fee land 3 that it was -- that it was transferring. There would be 4 no reason to think the United States should be liable 5 for that, for what it did with the tribe did with its 6 own fee land, and Congress wanted to make sure of that. 7 The other was that the tribe could convey trust land to 8 municipalities and that sort of thing, and what the 9 statute says thereafter the United States won't be 10 liable. The United States was just making sure it was 11 washing its hands of it. 12 Under section (a), we aren't saying that 13 there could be no lease under which it could conceivably 14 be for a business purpose in which the United States 15 could be liable. If there was a regulation establishing 16 a minimum floor and the lease terms went below that, 17 then that might be a circumstance in which liability 18 could be imposed. 19 But otherwise, Justice Breyer is completely 20 correct: This statute on its face imposes no more of a 21 duty on the Secretary with respect to the approval of 22 whatever leases are covered than IMLA imposed on the 23 Secretary with with respect to -- with respect to 24 mineral leases. 25 And -- and another important point is, as
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this Court pointed out in the Cotton Petroleum and 2 Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, the IMLA was enacted to 3 bring uniformity to mineral leasing. And the notion 4 that Congress would have implicitly wanted to 5 specifically carve the Navajo and Hopi out of that 6 general authorization and that preexisting set of 7 regulations and cover it by -- by a provision like this 8 we think is just not consistent with the way Congress 9 has dealt with mineral leases over the -- over the 10 years. 11 I also just wanted to come back to this idea 12 of -- of imposing liability on the basis of the common 13 law, because the example of what the Federal Circuit did 14 in this case, with all respect to that court, we think 15 strayed so far from what this Court laid down in Navajo 16 I, that it's important for this Court, however it thinks 17 it disposed of this case before, to make clear that 18 liability cannot be imposed unless, as this Court said 19 in Navajo, there is -- there is a specific 20 rights-creating or duty-imposing language in the statute 21 itself. The theory that has been adopted in some lower 22 courts -- Federal circuit court decisions, which you can 23 look at -- a hodgepodge of statutes, one dealing with 24 environmental concerns, one dealing with rights-of-way, 25 one dealing with this -- add them all up and say the
52

1 United States has control and, therefore, out of that 2 sort of bucket of statutes, you can impose trust 3 responsibilities. That's fundamentally inconsistent 4 with the Tucker Act, which requires that the liability 5 be based on the statutes themselves, and you have to 6 look at each statute and each regulation that governs 7 the United States in Indian affairs in the same way, 8 under the Tucker Act, you would look at the -9 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Kneedler -10 GEN. KNEEDLER: -- United States elsewhere 11 to decide whether it was -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask one question? I 13 probably should have asked earlier. But there is no 14 dispute as the case comes to us. I know the government 15 has taken the position that there was no breach of 16 trust. But do we -- we do have to decide it on the 17 assumption that there was a breach of trust that caused 18 all this damage? 19 GEN. KNEEDLER: No, no. I think that's not 20 at all correct. With respect to the approval of the 21 lease terms in 1987 -- under a provision that provided 22 for "reasonable" lease adjustments, the Secretary 23 approved leases negotiated by the tribe at 12.5 percent. 24 The tribe entered into two other leases at the very same 25 time, although not the subject of this case, for 12.5
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 percent. That's the standard royalty rate. And the 2 tribe got other benefits from this as a package. With 3 respect to the arguments about what the Secretary did on 4 -- on appeal, it's even clearer that all this 5 information about the Secretary meeting with Peabody's 6 lobbyist, it was before the Court before, and the Court 7 found no violation of any statute or regulation. But 8 it's even clearer on remand, as we point out on page 22 9 of our reply brief, that the tribe was fully aware that 10 the Secretary was not going to -- had -- had said the 11 appeal was not going to be acted on and had sent the 12 parties back to negotiations. In fact, when Chairman 13 Zah of the tribe opened the negotiations on August 30 of 14 1985, he said, "It appears that the Secretary wants us 15 to take another shot at negotiating the lease." He knew 16 what -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure that's 18 responsive to justice Stevens's question. I mean, you 19 are arguing the merits, but those haven't been decided. 20 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, what the -- what the 21 Court of Federal Claims said along those lines was a 22 legal conclusion, not a factual conclusion. And the -23 the facts as described are really what they were before 24 when the Court found no violation. 25 And -- and as we say, it's clear factually
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 on remand that the tribe knew. But again, that was just 2 -- it's not a factual determination that has to be taken 3 as true. For one thing, it was summary judgment, not 4 factual findings. But it does -- it was just a legal 5 conclusion. And at that, it was the sort of legal 6 conclusion drawn from general notions of fiduciary 7 responsibility, nothing that has been channeled or 8 embodied or codified in a statute or regulation. 9 And we think to unleash the law to regulate 10 the day-to-day operations of a vast agency, like the 11 Interior Department, which has to operate by statutes 12 and regulations would be -- under Vermont Yankee and 13 this Court's other jurisprudence, would be -- would be 14 unwarranted for the courts to do and especially in a 15 waiver of sovereign immunity under the -- under the 16 Tucker Act to impose damages liability for the violation 17 of a procedural regulation. And, of course, the Court 18 pointed out the last time that there was no prohibition 19 against ex parte contracts for this sort of informal 20 adjudication, as there isn't across -- across the board 21 for government -- government activities. 22 If there are no further questions -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, general, 24 the case is submitted. 25 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the
