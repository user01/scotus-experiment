1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:18 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument this morning in Case 08-310, Polar Tankers v. 5 City of Valdez. 6 Mr. Rothfeld. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice 10 and may it please the Court: 11 The Valdez vessel tax violates the 12 Constitution's Tonnage Clause because it operates as a 13 charge on a privilege of trading in the port of Valdez, 14 and that tax is apportioned in a way that is guaranteed 15 to tax extraterritorial values and values that do not 16 have a connection to the city. That violates the Due 17 Process and Commerce Clauses. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not often that we 19 have disagreements as to the basic facts. The red brief 20 says that the tax in question constitutes 11 percent of 21 the tax base, and you talk about that in the reply 22 brief. Can you spend just a little bit of time at the 23 outset telling us your views of this tax? And although 24 it's the Respondent's statement and not yours, do you 25 think 11 percent of the tax base means 11 percent of

1 what's collected under this tax or under all taxes 2 imposed by City of Valdez? 3 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that it means 4 all taxes that are imposed not only by the City of 5 Valdez, but they are including taxes imposed by the 6 State of Alaska that are collected by the City of 7 Valdez. The -8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In which case, that seems 9 really quite irrelevant. 10 MR. ROTHFELD: That is our position. We 11 think that's absolutely right. I think it is useful to 12 focus on the nature of this tax. It is a tax that is 13 directed exclusively at vessels and not on all vessels. 14 It's -- by exempting small boats and all boats that are 15 engaged in commercial fishing and all boats that dock 16 exclusively at city-owned harbors. This is a tax, a 17 property -- it's calls a property tax, but it's a tax 18 that falls only on vessels and is directed at those 19 vessels, that -20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, some -- some of those 21 vessels, I take it, are taxed under other statutes. Is 22 that correct? 23 MR. ROTHFELD: I think -- I think not. I 24 think that -- so far as Valdez is concerned, the vessels 25 we are talking about are subject simply to this property

1 tax. 2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you take 3 the position -- let's say that if the State of Alaska 4 taxed all the other property you had mentioned except 5 for the tankers and the city taxed the tankers, that 6 that would by definition be discriminatory tax and/or on 7 some other basis violate the Tonnage Clause? 8 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that would be 9 quite a different situation than what we have here. 10 Here, the city -11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the reason I raised 12 it was that -- in -- in your response to my first 13 question, you said, well, you didn't think the city was 14 taxing these other -- these other pieces of property, 15 and I'm -- I'm not sure why that is significant. 16 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there are -- there's a 17 huge universe of personal property that could be taxed 18 in the City of Valdez. Valdez has the authority to tax 19 all of this property except for a discrete category of 20 oil and gas property that is subject to taxation by the 21 State. So Valdez can tax all the ordinary kinds of 22 personal property -- movable property, personalty -23 that any jurisdiction can tax. They can tax cars and 24 trucks and moving vans and refrigerators and jewelry. 25 Of all those innumerable things that they could tax,

1 they have chosen to tax a single item. They have chosen 2 to tax vessels and, as I said, not all vessels. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you -- you want us 4 to ignore the -- the State tax. Do you really want us 5 to do that? I mean, it would be the easiest thing in 6 the world for the State of Alaska, instead of imposing 7 it at the State level, to authorize the municipality to 8 do it. I don't want this case to come back here for a 9 second time. 10 MR. ROTHFELD: But -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now -- now that the 12 municipality is imposing the taxes that the State used 13 to impose, don't you think you have to count both of 14 them? 15 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I don't think so. The 16 State of Alaska treats oil and gas property as -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are going to get a 18 fragile judgment if -- if we go on those grounds. All 19 it takes is a modification of the -- of the legislation. 20 MR. ROTHFELD: Not so, Your Honor, because 21 State of Alaska takes very seriously it's stewardship of 22 oil and gas property. That is something of tremendous 23 fiscal importance to the State of Alaska. I think that 24 there is little practical risk that the State is going 25 to assign the right to tax that property.

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: How about the risk in the 2 other direction, that the State will simply take over 3 this tax and remit the proceeds to the city? Would the 4 result on your view be the same if it did that? 5 MR. ROTHFELD: The result in my view would 6 be the same, but that would be a different and more 7 difficult case. Here, focus on what Valdez is doing: 8 It is -- it has the authority, as I said, to tax the 9 universe of personalty in the City of Valdez. It has 10 chosen to tax only particular types of vessels that are 11 used in the export of oil. Imagine, though -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are other vessels, 13 too. It's the -- it's the oil tankers, and there are a 14 few other vessels that were included? 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Including a -- a cruise 16 ship is covered. I -17 MR. ROTHFELD: There is -- there is one 18 cruise ship, Your Honor, that was caught up in the net 19 in the first year the tax was imposed. Otherwise the 20 tax falls exclusively on what vessels that are involved 21 in the export of oil -- principally tankers, also 22 service vessels. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does that -- why 24 does that matter? I mean, do you concede that if this 25 tax were in some sense nondiscriminatory, you would

1 lose? 2 MR. ROTHFELD: No, I think that -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why are we having 4 all this talk about -- in other words, you think if 5 there was a tonnage tax applicable to everything -- you 6 know, your pickup truck holds two tons; it has got to 7 pay a certain amount or whatever. Then do you lose or 8 win? 9 MR. ROTHFELD: If a -- if a tonnage tax -10 look at what the tonnage tax was initially designed to 11 do. The Framers chose the term "duty of tonnage" 12 because at the time -- the time this clause was it was 13 written in the late 18th century, tonnage was the 14 ordinary way of valuing the value of a ship and the 15 ordinary way of imposing tax on a ship. 16 If -- if the City of Valdez were to impose a 17 property tax measured by tonnage on everything -- on 18 vans and trucks and refrigerators and ships -- that 19 would be a difficult case for us. But, obviously, it 20 hasn't done that. It has not imposed a tonnage tax or 21 and it has not imposed a property tax on any other type 22 of property except particular types of vessels. 23 I think you apply the duck test: It looks 24 like a duck -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you're --
8

1 MR. ROTHFELD: -- it quacks like a duck -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. I think you're 3 giving up an awful lot. I mean, what if the Framers -4 couldn't they be have been more concerned about making 5 sure that there is a free flow of commerce, that ships 6 go, and the fact that everything is taxed would be less 7 of a concern to them? But you're -- you're willing to 8 say that if it's nondiscriminatory, even if you would 9 call it a "tonnage tax," you lose? 10 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I was using a 11 response to the previous question, and actually they 12 were imposing a property tax and they were measuring it 13 in an unusual sort of way. And the Court has said that 14 if there's a generally applicable property tax which 15 happens to fall on vessels, the reality of that tax is 16 that it is a tax on property and not a tax on vessels. 17 But here we have quite the opposite. Here 18 we have tax that falls only on vessels as cargo -19 vessels. And you're quite right: The Framers were 20 concerned with the free movement of commerce. The 21 Tonnage Clause was designed to close the loophole that 22 was thought to be left by the Import-Export Clause, 23 which bars the taxation of imports and exports. Taxing 24 vessels would be a way of circumventing that. 25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's -- let's assume that

1 you're -- that a given tanker came into the harbor at 2 Valdez on one occasion and one occasion only. Would the 3 City of Valdez, under its own statutes, by the terms of 4 its own ordinance, tax that ship? 5 MR. ROTHFELD: It would, indeed, because the 6 city in its code creating the tax conclusively presumed 7 that a vessel was subject to the tax so long as it takes 8 on cargo worth a million dollars over the course of a 9 year. Oil tankers -10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me -- let me just 11 change the question then. If -- if it came in and sort 12 of took half a tankful that didn't reach the point of a 13 million dollars' value, there would be no tax then. Is 14 that correct? 15 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, it would have to take a 16 lot less than half a tankful. I think -17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Whatever it would take to 18 get it under the minimum. 19 MR. ROTHFELD: Yes. If -- if it were not -20 if it visited the port of Valdez once and took on less 21 than a million dollars and never came back to the port 22 of Valdez -23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Under the old 24 tonnage laws, wouldn't that ship in the 18th century 25 have been taxed?

1 MR. ROTHFELD: I think that they -2 jurisdictions impose all kinds of different variations 3 of tonnage duties. And as the Court -4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the -- the point that 5 I am getting to is -- and I'd -- I'd like you to address 6 this -- one of the arguments on the other side is that 7 one reason this should not be treated as a tonnage tax 8 is that it relies upon the concept of a tax situs. And 9 the -- the implication is that not every ship that comes 10 into the harbor is going to be subject to the tax; 11 whereas, under the old tonnage laws, any ship that came 12 in would be. And what is -- what is your response to 13 that argument? 14 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, two responses. First, 15 I think it is not the case that under the old tonnage 16 laws necessarily every ship was subject to tax. Ships 17 could be subject depending upon how -- how large they 18 were, and some ships could be exempted. So I think it's 19 not implicit in -- in the nature of a tonnage duty that 20 it applies to every ship that -- that enters the harbor. 21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where do we -- where do we 22 look to find this out? 23 MR. ROTHFELD: One would have to look at the 24 practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. And some of 25 the Court's decisions --

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know of any source 2 that we could look at to support the proposition that 3 you just made? 4 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I can't point you to any 5 authority directly addressing the point, but I can point 6 you to the general treatment of what a tonnage duty is. 7 I mean, it's a duty which is imposed on vessels on the 8 basis of tonnage. It -- it does not have to be imposed 9 on every vessel that enters the harbor. But I think 10 probably the more important response to your question is 11 the reality of this tax. 12 Valdez knew what it was doing. It wanted to 13 target -- it was commendably candid in saying what it 14 was doing. It wanted to target the vessels that were 15 engaged in the transport of oil. It knows how big oil 16 tankers are. It knows that the tankers are always full. 17 When they come in, they take a full load of oil. That's 18 -- that is the whole point of -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't -- you 20 don't suggest that it matters, right? You -- you have 21 talked to some extent in the briefs about the bad -22 evil motive. 23 MR. ROTHFELD: No, I -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you are not 25 going to suggest that the same tax could be valid or

1 invalid depending on why it was enacted. 2 MR. ROTHFELD: No, I -- I don't, but I -3 JUSTICE BREYER: May I ask one other 4 question before you leave this, which is where Justice 5 Kennedy started? Suppose a State says: In our State, 6 we want to tax all oil and gas property, and here's how 7 we do it. We assess the value of all oil and gas 8 property, ships and everything else included. Then we 9 impose a tax of 20 mills per dollar of assessed value, 10 something like that, on all of it. 11 Now, the State will collect all of it, and 12 we make one exception. We define which property the 13 State will directly get the money from, and then the 14 city can do the rest, if it wants. Now, here's what we 15 do with the State money. We give it to the city. So if 16 the city wants to, it can put the same tax on that 17 little bit of property left over, which is a subcategory 18 of oil and gas property. And by the way, the name of 19 that little bit of property left over is called "a 20 ship." 21 Now, is that a tonnage tax, and is that what 22 Alaska has done here? 23 MR. ROTHFELD: If I understand the example, 24 that -- that might be a tonnage tax, depending upon the 25 --

1 JUSTICE BREYER: I described to you the 2 entire tax. We know no more about it. 3 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if -- if it's a tax on 4 oil and gas property, and that is the definition of the 5 tax and it happens to fall on vessels as part of the -6 JUSTICE BREYER: The way it does is just as 7 I said. And maybe I was -- it was too much for you to 8 take in. So the point is that it's a tax on oil and gas 9 property. That's Code section 1. Code section 2 is 10 defined subcategories -- (a), (b), (c), (d, (e), (f) -11 all of that. Code 3 says (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e). 12 The -- the State government collects and remits it to 13 the city. (G), the city can assess the same tax if it 14 wishes. It doesn't have to -- and keep the money. (G) 15 is ships. 16 And the reason I have asked that question is 17 I read something from a -- Alaska Department of Economic 18 and Community Development which suggested to me that 19 that is Alaska's tax. I might have that wrong. I just 20 read a sentence or two, and maybe I am wrong that that 21 is Alaska's tax, and -22 MR. ROTHFELD: Yes, and -23 JUSTICE BREYER: But if it's Alaska's tax -24 MR.

1 It's a -- it's a tax on all oil and gas property, and 2 all they do is they let the city collect some of that if 3 they want, and they collect the rest of it and give it 4 to the city. 5 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, what's -- what's wrong 6 with what's going on here and -- and I think this is an 7 answer to your question -- the City of Valdez has the 8 authority to tax an entire -- as I said, the entire 9 universe of personalty. And -- and as -- as you 10 described it, the City of Valdez also can impose a tax, 11 although it doesn't have to, on -- on vessels. And the 12 city has chosen to single out vessels out of all the 13 types of property that it could tax, and it imposes a 14 tax on them called a property tax. 15 The reality of it is that it's a tax on 16 vessels. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'd like to know is: 18 Do you think what I said was a misdescription? What's 19 worrying me about this aspect of this case is a possible 20 need to send it back to find out what Alaska's tax 21 system is. Now -- now, if what I just said is a -- is a 22 correct description approximately and if the other side 23 thinks it is, too, then at least I -- I know how to go 24 about deciding it. And if I don't, I don't know quite 25 what to do.

1 MR. ROTHFELD: My -- my understanding of how 2 the tax system works is that this -- this is a State 3 level tax. Alaska determines what are subject to tax, 4 determines the items of property that are subject to 5 tax. It determines which of these vessels are subject 6 to -- to the Alaska tax. It then allows the City of 7 Valdez to collect the tax and to use the tax, but it is 8 a tax imposed by law by the State of Alaska. 9 Valdez has no discretion to tax things that 10 are not oil and gas property, that are not taxed by the 11 -- by -- subject to the tax at the State level by the 12 State. 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: As you understand it, with 14 reference to the tax base referred to in the red brief 15 at page 14 where it says it's 11 percent of the tax 16 base, is that tax base all city-imposed? 17 MR. ROTHFELD: No. My -- my understanding 18 of what they are referring to is that this is -- Alaska 19 tax oil and gas property, including the Alaska oil 20 pipeline and the oil terminal in the City of Valdez, 21 which are enormously valuable pieces of property. So I 22 think that -- that we are sort of talking apples and 23 oranges here. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was your answer to the 25 Chief Justice that if there is a tonnage tax imposed on

ROTHFELD: If it's a -- a literal duty 4 imposed on the -- the cubic capacity of the ship, it -5 it's difficult to see how that could really be imposed 6 in terms -- on every other item of property. I suppose 7 if the -- if the -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's my -- it's my 9 hypothetical. I made it up. 10 (Laughter.) 11 MR.

I would say -- I would not say it's necessarily 22 okay. That would be a different kind of situation than 23 we have here. Here we have the purest case of what's -24 of -- of a tax which is focused exclusively on vessels. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there's some --

ROTHFELD: Well -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many days. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. How many days it 7 remains in port. 8 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there are two of -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which means, the argument 10 could go that this is obviously a -- a tax for the use 11 of the port. And that's exactly what the Tonnage Clause 12 was directed against, preventing Philadelphia and New 13 York from taxing the consumers in New Jersey by imposing 14 taxes on ships that bring in goods. 15 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I agree entirely with 16 that. The -- the effect of this tax is to tax 17 essentially the charge for trading in the Port of 18 Valdez, and that is exactly what the Framers -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you don't dispute 20 that in light of the benefits provided by Valdez to the 21 shipowners, that they could be a legitimate tax on these 22 vessels? 23 MR. ROTHFELD: That is -- that is absolutely 24 right. There -- there -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So could you describe
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 what tax authority you think Valdez has? 2 MR. ROTHFELD: There are two ways that 3 Valdez could go about taxing these vessels. It could 4 impose a user fee, and the Court has recognized in its 5 Tonnage Clause decisions that even a -- a tax on cubic 6 capacity, a tax on weight, would be fine if that is a 7 user fee which is designed to provide -- pay for 8 services that are provided specifically to vessels 9 roughly equivalent to the value of the services 10 provided. So that is one way Valdez could do it. 11 A second way they could do it is to impose a 12 nondiscriminatory property tax. If they imposed a tax 13 on the citizenry of Valdez affecting some broad array of 14 personal property, that would impose the kind of 15 political constraints that would discourage, you know, 16 abusive export of the city's tax burden, which is just 17 what the Framers -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How much property -- you 19 said if they -- if they taxed all moveables, that would 20 be okay. Could they have some exemptions and still -21 MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it may -- I -- I 22 suppose the test would be if it's predominantly focused 23 on vessels, that would be unconstitutional. This case 24 doesn't provide an opportunity to -- to explore exactly 25 how far that goes because this is, as I say, the purest
19

1 case of a tax, property tax, all the property tax, which 2 applies only to vessels. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you don't think a daily 4 -- a daily charge on vessels for remaining in port 5 violates the Tonnage Clause? 6 MR. ROTHFELD: It would violate the Tonnage 7 Clause. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this anything else than 9 that? 10 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I agree with you, 11 Justice Scalia, that however ports, States, or cities go 12 about trying to impose a tax on vessels for the -- I'm 13 calling it the privilege of trading in the port, as 14 distinct from the user fee I discussed with 15 Justice Ginsburg, that would be an unconstitutional 16 tonnage duty.

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Rothfeld, can I ask 2 you a question, just focusing on the Tonnage Clause, not 3 the elements of discrimination? If you assume that the 4 Tonnage Clause was designed to protect New Jersey from 5 being exploited by New York and perhaps other States 6 because they don't have their own ports, why does that 7 rationale have any application to this case, because the 8 only State ships oil out of Alaska is Alaska? So there 9 is no other State like New Jersey who could be harmed by 10 the Tonnage Clause. 11 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if the recipients of 12 the property are -- Valdez is taking it -- this is 13 really -14 JUSTICE STEVENS: What State is being 15 discriminated against in the scenario we have before us 16 today? 17 MR.

The -- the danger that -21 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you are saying it's an 22 unduly onerous burden on the oil companies and their 23 tankers, and they only ship oil out of Alaska. 24 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the concern that the 25 Framers had in putting the Tonnage Clause in the

1 Constitution, as with the Import-Export Clause, was that 2 States with favorable port facilities were going to be 3 imposing burdens by taking advantage of their favorable 4 geography to impose burdens that are going to be felt by 5 the other States. That is exactly what Valdez has done. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not felt by the other 7 States, felt by the consumers in other States. 8 Ultimately, it's not going to be the oil companies that 9 pay this tax; it's going to be purchasers of oil. 10 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's right. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: All of whom are going to be 12 outside of Alaska, since this oil is leaving Alaska, 13 right? 14 MR.

ROTHFELD: That -- that's right. And I 11 don't -- I hope I didn't -12 JUSTICE SOUTER: So a value tax is going to 13 run into the same problem -14 MR. ROTHFELD: That's right. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- as a tonnage tax. 16 MR. ROTHFELD: That's right. And as for the 17 Chief Justice's question, application to moving vans or 18 cargo planes, the Court did not consider that because 19 this is the purest case. It is within the plain terms 20 of the Tonnage Clause, the historical application of the 21 Tonnage Clause. It's the clear intent of the Framers in 22 writing the Tonnage Clause. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: If the amount of the tax 24 were measured by the number of sailors who were going to 25 come ashore and the number of days they would be ashore,

1 and a small port city wanted to recover the costs that 2 they impose on municipal services, would that be -3 would that be subject to the same flaw that you see 4 here? 5 MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it would, although it 6 might be possible for the city to impose some type of 7 user fee calibrated in that direction. The Court's 8 cases refer to -- the tonnage principle applies to the 9 number of passengers that the ship may carry or the 10 number of crew members on the ship. If -- if it's not a 11 proxy for particular expenses that are imposed on the 12 jurisdiction, as this concededly is not, that was not 13 what the -- Valdez intent in passing this tax, then it 14 would be problematic under the Tonnage Clause. 15 But I say again we have here the clearest, 16 easiest case under the Tonnage Clause. It's a -- it is 17 a tax that is designed exclusively of vessels that trade 18 in the harbor. 19 On the apportionment question -- and I don't 20 want to give short shrift to that, because the Valdez 21 tax is apportioned in a way that is guaranteed to impose 22 a tax on values that are not present in the 23 jurisdiction -- Polar's tankers spend only a small part 24 of the year in Valdez. They spend the rest of the time 25 on the high seas or in other ports either unloading oil
25

1 or in dry dock. And, therefore, everybody agrees the 2 tax has to be apportioned. 3 The ordinary way and the way that this Court 4 has approved the apportionment of a tax on physical 5 property -- physical property is straightforward. You 6 would put in the numerator of the tax the number of days 7 with the number of miles they spent in or number of 8 miles traveled in the taxing jurisdiction; you put in 9 the denominator 365, the total number of miles traveled 10 everywhere. You multiply that fraction times the value 11 of the property. 12 And so, for example, if I have a 13 transcontinental passenger train moving from New York to 14 California that spends 20 percent of its time in 15 New York, New York could tax 20 percent of the value of 16 the train. 17 That is not how Valdez does it. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- the train 19 is going to be some place throughout its trip, unlike 20 the ship that's going to be on the high seas. 21 MR. ROTHFELD: That's right. But the -- the 22 Valdez theory does not depend upon the taxation, the 23 taxability of a ship somewhere else. Valdez is simply 24 saying that we are entitled to tax, you know, not on the 25 basis of physical presence in this jurisdiction at all.

1 We are entitled to tax on some concept of where 2 productive commercial activity takes place. 3 And so it does not apportion on the basis of 4 amount of time spent in the jurisdiction over the course 5 of the year, which is the approach that the Court 6 ordinarily has used. The Valdez approach is precisely 7 the equivalent of New York saying, in my 8 transcontinental train example, we are going to take 9 into account only time spent in New York and Los Angeles 10 loading and unloading passengers, and we are going to 11 discount all of the rest of the year, all the rest of 12 the time that the train has spent moving the passengers 13 from place to place. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who can tax for the time 15 on the high seas? 16 MR. ROTHFELD: This Court has held in the 17 Central Railroad case that the taxing authority goes to 18 the domicile. That for time -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the domicile here is 20 Texas. Is that right? 21 MR. ROTHFELD: The commercial domicile is 22 Texas. The corporation is incorporated in Delaware. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In either case, no ships 24 berth in either Delaware or Texas. Is that right? 25 MR. ROTHFELD: These ships do not -- the

1 ships berth in Texas. The ship do not -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the home port might 3 have had in the old days the notion that's really where 4 the vessel is berthed. But, nowadays, Delaware has very 5 little to do with where the vessels are berthing and 6 where they are being serviced? 7 MR. ROTHFELD: If I may, Your Honor, I'll -8 I'll answer that question and sit down to reserve a 9 little bit of time. You are right as to the physical 10 location of the ship, but the -- the jurisdiction, the 11 authority of a non-domicile to tax has always been 12 constrained by -- under the Due Process Clause -- by the 13 physical location of the property. 14 And so, the fact that the property may or 15 may not be subject to tax somewhere else does not give 16 Valdez additional authority to tax property that's not 17 present there. 18 Now, the Court has said that the domicile, 19 whether or not the property is present, is providing 20 benefits to the owner of the property, and it's those 21 benefits that justify the imposition of the tax for 22 periods when it is not in any tax situs subject to tax 23 by anybody else. 24 And if I may, Your Honor, I will reserve. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

1 Mr. Olson. 2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 3 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 4 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 5 please the Court: 6 In the Wheeling case, this Court said it is 7 too well settled to question the taxes upon vessels 8 based upon their value as property do not violate the 9 Tonnage Clause. In fact, no ad valorem property tax has 10 ever been held to violate the Tonnage Clause. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it says "vessels of 12 all kinds are liable to taxation as property in the same 13 manner as other personal property." 14 MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Kennedy, precisely 15 in the same manner as other ad valorem property taxes. 16 Now let me answer the question that both you and Justice 17 Breyer particularly addressed, which was the oil and -18 and gas tax imposed with respect to much of the property 19 in Valdez. Valdez taxes homes, it taxes oil and gas 20 property, it taxes barges, it taxes cruises, it taxes 21 all sorts of things just like every other jurisdiction 22 does. The oil and gas tax that you ask about, 23 Justice Kennedy, and you did, too, Justice Breyer, is 24 imposed -- and there is no need to remand this case to 25 address this. It's in Section 43.56 of the Alaska Code.

1 The State of Alaska imposes an oil and gas tax on 2 property used in the oil and gas extraction, 3 transportation, et cetera, business, but it also 4 authorizes a city under Section 43.56 and 29.45 -- the 5 City of Valdez may impose that tax as well. It's two 6 mils, it's just like every other tax that is imposed in 7 Valdez. These are taxes imposed on the same basis. If 8 the city imposes the tax, which the City of Valdez does, 9 then the tax by the State -- that tax paid to Valdez is 10 a direct credit, dollar for dollar credit, for the tax 11 that would otherwise have to go to the State. 12 So, in the first place, I think would it 13 make no difference as suggested by your question, 14 Justice Breyer, whether it was the State or the city 15 that imposed the tax. The constitutional provision 16 refers to states. States divide up their taxing 17 authorities in various different ways. The fact is that 18 the State of Alaska through the City of Valdez imposes a 19 tax on lots of different things. 20 This oil and gas tax that we are talking 21 about consists of 60 to 70 percent of the revenue base 22 of taxation for the City of Valdez. The -- the ship 23 tax, the tax on the -- that actually applies to vessels 24 which include the tankers, include barges, include a 25 cruise ship, includes just Alaska ships and -- and

OLSON: They don't have to pay this tax, 7 Justice Scalia, but they pay other taxes. There is tax 8 on -- on the weight of fish and there is tax on the 9 value of fish and there's tax -- there's -- fees, they 10 use a different dock and they pay taxes there, to. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your answer it seems 12 to me does put the issue squarely before us in the terms 13 that the Petitioner has presented, that is to say, sure, 14 suppose you tax the vessel and you tax trailers and 15 small vessels and a lot of other things, but as to all 16 of the latter category, you have -- you have an 17 exemption. So the -- the only people that effectively 18 pay the tax are the tankers. 19 MR. OLSON: No. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I thought that that 21 was the way the case was presented. 22 MR. OLSON: No. Well, that is not correct, 23 if I understood your -- your statement correctly.

OLSON: The tax -- cities may impose 12 taxes as real property or -- or personal property, 13 Justice Scalia. Some states will tax mobile homes. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, the question is what 15 is imposed here? My understanding from the yellow 16 book -- do you agree the yellow brief is accurate in its 17 factual descriptions, perhaps not in its conclusions 18 that it draws? 19 MR. OLSON: No, Justice Kennedy. I have -20 I've given you -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: See, we have a problem 22 with the facts here. But my understanding of the case, 23 and please correct me if I am wrong, is that sure, 24 Valdez has tax authority and tax statutes which would 25 cover a considerable amount of personal property on an

And as I read the 11 case, it said if you are going to tax property, you can 12 include vessels. This statute, and I think the Alaska 13 Supreme Court treated it discretely, is a tax on one 14 kind of property only, these vessels. I don't know of 15 any other property tax that is confined to just one type 16 of property. Is there another? Is there a comparable 17 tax that is focused on a single category of property? 18 MR. OLSON: There -- well, I -- I think what 19 my point here with respect to this, Justice Ginsburg, is 20 I don't know the answer specifically to that question, 21 but we are looking at what the bundle of taxes that a 22 community or a state imposes on property used that 23 imposes a burden on the community. Property is taxed 24 for the purpose, so that the property owner will bear 25 the burden of the governmental services that a city has

1 to impose. It -- there is no constitutional provision 2 that I am aware of that says that you have to have it 3 all in one statute, collected -- and there is no 4 discrimination -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you can't -- you can't 6 make vessels bear the overall burden of municipal 7 governance. You can make them bear the burden of the 8 services provided to them in harbor. But you cannot 9 make them the instrument of funding all other municipal 10 services. That's what the Tonnage Clause means. 11 MR. OLSON: Well, I disagree in part with 12 what you said, with respect, Justice Scalia; these 13 shelves pay 11 percent -- vessels pay 11 percent of the 14 revenue base for the city; 11 percent. This is a city 15 of 4,500 people. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How do you define revenue 17 base? 18 MR. OLSON: This is the amount of tax 19 collected by the City of Valdez with respect to the ad 20 valorem taxes in the city, including ships, mobile 21 homes, cranes, barges, appliances, real property, and so 22 forth. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are counting the state 24 tax as well, right? 25 MR.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are counting the state 2 tax on oil equipment? 3 MR. OLSON: I am -- I am saying to you that 4 the State imposes a tax but the State specifically 5 allows valid to impose that very tax. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: That makes matters worse. 7 MR. OLSON: Valdez imposes that tax as a 8 part of its total taxation package. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's suppose I accept just 10 what Justice Ginsburg said, and said it's a hopeless 11 morass if we look at all taxes. Let's look at this tax. 12 This tax you call an ad valorem tax on personal 13 property levied by Valdez, and then on page 11 of your 14 brief you say that's not just on ships, it's also on 15 mobile homes, trailers, recreational vehicles, and 16 various types of personal property defined under State 17 law as oil and gas property, motor vehicle, machinery, 18 supplies and maintenance equipment. 19 They come back and they say, as to your 20 mobile homes, trailers and recreational vehicles, all 21 that's happening there is either you have exempted them 22 or they are fixed in place, and they are like real 23 property and that's what you are doing. As to the other 24 things, you do not impose a tax on those other things. 25 Rather, the State imposes a tax on those other things.

1 And it may be that you help the State do it by providing 2 them with the assessment, and it may be even that you 3 could do it, but you haven't; and therefore, the only 4 thing you have imposed this tax on are the ships. 5 Now I think I have that argument right. If 6 I do, what's the answer to it? 7 MR. OLSON: The answer is -8 JUSTICE BREYER: If I don't, what's the 9 right argument? 10 MR.

It doesn't seem to me that it ought to make any 21 difference from the Tonnage Clause standpoint whether 22 it's a tax imposed by the State or a subdivision of the 23 State, but this provision specifically says a 24 municipality may levy and collect taxes on taxable 25 property, taxable under AS 43. That's the one. The

1 State does impose this tax but it also allows the city 2 to impose it. 3 This city does impose it. And when it is 4 paid, that is a credit against what might otherwise be 5 owed to the State.

It's 9 still a State tax and they are the collection agent, and 10 it's a -- a credit against what they owe for their 11 collections, right? 12 MR.

They have -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- do you -- do 12 you contest the point that was made in the reply brief 13 that back at the end of the 18th century, tonnage was 14 considered a proxy for value, that it was the customary 15 mode of measuring the value of a ship? 16 MR. OLSON: I do contest that, 17 Justice Ginsburg. The only citation for that is Justice 18 Miller. Justice Miller is cited for that in a lecture 19 that he gave after he left the Court. He was on the 20 court from 1862 to 1890. He joined the Court in the -21 in the Inman case, the Wheeling case, the Parkersburg 22 case, and here's the quote from the Inman -- from the 23 Clyde Mallory case in 1935, which is quoting the Inman 24 case from during that period of time. "At the time the 25 Constitution was adopted, 'tonnage' was a

In the Wheeling case, when it said -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is -- for a 5 commercial vessel, is a rough calculation of how much 6 it's worth. 7 MR. OLSON: It is not -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: The more cargo you can 9 carry, the more valuable the commercial ship. 10 MR. OLSON: That is not correct, 11 Justice Scalia, and it's -- and it's not correct in this 12 case. Experts put an assessment on these ships based 13 upon their replacement value. It may have -- one factor 14 may be how -- how the ship is constructed, whether it 15 has a double hull. These have to be Jones Act-compliant 16 ships. The newer ones are more valuable. If they move 17 faster, they're more valuable. If they're more 18 efficient, they have more value. One of these ships in 19 this case is valued 10 times more as -- higher value -20 than a ship that carries more capacity because it's 21 newer. 22 JUSTICE SOUTER: But all you're saying -23 MR. OLSON: And -24 JUSTICE SOUTER: All you're saying is that 25 there are other factors that -- that preclude using

1 tonnage simply as a single crude measure. But isn't it 2 fair to say that, other things being equal -- the engine 3 capacity, the hull construction, et cetera -- the 4 tonnage is a rough measurement of the value of the ship, 5 for just the reason that Justice Scalia gave? It 6 determines the amount of cargo the ship can carry, and 7 what it can charge for it, and that is capitalized into 8 the value of the ship. Isn't that true? 9 MR. OLSON: Well, if -- if everything else 10 was equal, the bigger, the more capacity, the more 11 valuable the vessel might be, that's true. But that -12 that is not the case. Different ships are different 13 sizes. They are made out of different materials. They 14 have different structural capabilities -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So as long as you are 16 taxing on the basis of the value of the ship, then you 17 have no Tonnage Clause problem. Is that your -- the 18 Tonnage Clause was a specific type of measure, and if 19 you're taxing based on the assessed value of the 20 property, it isn't a Tonnage Clause. Is that your -21 MR.

1 written, the Constitution did not intend to take away 2 the power from the States to impose taxes. The 3 provision on the import-export prohibition on the States 4 and Tonnage Clause was an instrument to protect 5 commerce. It wasn't an instrument to reduce the power 6 of States to impose taxes. The baseline is States have 7 the power to impose taxes unless there's an explicit -8 and the court has said narrow -- limitation on that tax 9 power in the Constitution. 10 Now, what this Court has said over and over 11 again, Justice Breyer -- it hasn't had a chance to deal 12 with portholes -- but it has had a chance to deal with 13 most of these various earlier cases in the -- in the 14 1860s and '70s had to do with tax on tonnage. And there 15 was one case where New Orleans levied a tax just for the 16 entry and departure of the ship, and the Court said, 17 well, that's -- that's a tax on the ship as a -- as a 18 commercial instrument of commerce, and that would be 19 covered also. But nothing else has been covered. 20 And the Court has gone out of its way to say 21 that communities, States, are entitled to tax people 22 that possess property within their jurisdiction because 23 of -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if you -25 if you are right that any type of ad valorem tax is

1 okay, well, then why in the world would the Framers have 2 adopted a prohibition on a tonnage tax, if you could 3 just say it's a tax on value, which is going to have the 4 same impact on commerce? 5 MR. OLSON: Because -- because, if you are 6 taxing -- I think that the Court had reasons for the 7 conclusion it came to. What I'm saying is not what I've 8 invented; it's what the Court has said repeatedly, that 9 because property may be taxed as property because the 10 users and owners of property are the source of revenue 11 for the communities -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, putting aside 13 what the Court has said, I'm looking at what the Framers 14 have said. What good does a tonnage tax prohibition do 15 -16 MR. OLSON: It does -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if you are right? 18 MR. OLSON: It -- if it's -- if it's a State 19 using a tax on a vessel qua vessel as an instrument to 20 limit commerce, that is something that the Framers did 21 not want to do. They -- they prohibited taxes -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: It offended them 23 aesthetically? 24 (Laughter.) 25 MR. OLSON: No, because -- for --

OLSON: What the Framers were concerned 7 about and what I was trying to say in response to the 8 Chief Justice's question is that there was a limitation 9 on the states' power to tax imports or exports because 10 of the fact that that would put the states on the coast 11 at an advantage and they would pass those burdens on to 12 the inland states. The Tonnage Clause was put there as 13 a specific provision to implement and -- to prevent the 14 circumvention of the export/import prohibition. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Olson -16 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I suppose you could -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- let me ask you something 18 about -- about discrimination. Let's assume that I 19 think it is relevant whether the tax is a discriminatory 20 tax, property tax just levied on -- on ships or not. 21 If that is my position, why should I count 22 as establishing nondiscrimination the fact that Alaska 23 or Valdez is also taxing -- most of its other property 24 tax revenue comes from taxing oil equipment, right? And 25 the burden of all of that tax, just like the burden of

1 this vessel tax, is paid by people in New Jersey. I 2 mean, you know, that -3 MR. OLSON: You can -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's getting somebody else 5 to bear the burden of your taxation. 6 MR. OLSON: If do it would be -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Taxing that equipment 8 raises the price of oil, almost all of which the oil 9 goes out of Alaska and is paid for by people in other 10 states. Why should I count that property tax as proving 11 that either the State of Alaska or Valdez is not being 12 discriminatory? Just because it -- it can't possibly 13 violate the -- the Tonnage Clause doesn't mean that it 14 isn't as much discriminatory against other states. 15 MR. OLSON: That then might -- that might be 16 a Due Process Clause problem -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I -18 MR. OLSON: But it wouldn't be a Tonnage 19 Clause problem. I would submit, Justice Scalia, you 20 would be very upset at the -- at Silicon Valley because 21 the property tax imposed on Silicon Valley gets all put 22 on those chips that we used in all of these computers, 23 and everybody else in the country is using those 24 computers, so the property that is taxed in that 25 community is the property that creates the value of that

1 community. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if -- if California 3 taxed vessels, I would not allow California to come in 4 and say, oh, we are just subjecting them to the same tax 5 that our own citizens are subjected to. 6 MR. OLSON: And Justice Scalia -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't let them point 8 to the Silicon Valley tax. 9 MR. OLSON: You would -- you would, I 10 submit, then, say that vessels are exempt from property 11 tax. 12 JUSTICE SOUTER: That may be the only way 13 they can accomplish what they want to. Because as the 14 Chief Justice's question suggested a moment ago, if in 15 the 18th century the port of Boston said, "We are not 16 going to charge tonnage anymore. We are simply going to 17 tax on the value of the ship," that is going to have 18 exactly the same effect that a tonnage tax would have. 19 So maybe exemption is the only way it can be done. 20 MR. OLSON: Well, it's going to require an 21 amendment to the Constitution because what the Framers 22 talked about was a Tonnage Clause, and they were talking 23 about -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we have said -25 MR. OLSON: -- and they did not exempt --

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, we -- we have 2 said it's not just tonnage. It said that the clause 3 bars states, we said, from imposing a charge even if not 4 measured by a vessel's tonnage, for the privilege of 5 entering, trading in or lying in a port. So we have 6 ruled out the position that it's got to be an 7 old-fashioned tonnage charge, and can't be based on the 8 assessed value of the property. 9 MR. OLSON: Well, I guess I have to resort 10 to the fact that every time this Court has considered 11 it, or at least in almost every case, the Court has gone 12 out of its way to say, they were not intending to 13 prohibit states from taxing the value of property, if 14 it's an ad valorem tax. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but in all of 16 those cases the vessels were being taxed as one item of 17 property in a general moveable property, personal 18 property tax. I asked you before, I think, is there any 19 other tax like this, that -- an ad valorem tax that is 20 applied to one single category of property? 21 MR. OLSON: If this -- this is an ad valorem 22 tax, it has various different statutes and ordinances 23 that it comes from, but there's ad valorem taxes in 24 Valdez across the board for all kinds of property. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This statute deals with
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 one category of property. Is there another statute like 2 this one? 3 MR. OLSON: Well, there -- no. This 4 statute is -- every other statute in the same manner 5 imposes taxes on property based upon their value. This 6 was a separate ordinance that decided to remove an 7 exemption that had existed for 27 years -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the other, the 9 State taxes were no part of the Alaska Supreme Court's 10 decision in this case. 11 MR. OLSON: Well, I think what we are 12 talking about is whether or not this community can 13 impose a tax on the people that own property in this 14 community. There's no denial that there is a property 15 tax situs here. The average length of the time in port 16 of these ships was 45 days. The entire fleet has a tax 17 situs in Valdez. So this property, like other property 18 in the same manner, is being taxed by the City of 19 Valdez. 20 The Wheeling case was a case a little bit 21 like this in the sense that it was West Virginia that 22 passed a statute that allowed Wheeling to impose the tax 23 on steam ships. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And on what else? In 25 that -- in that tax that was before the port. What else

1 did Wheeling tax? 2 MR. OLSON: The only thing that the Court 3 talked about because it was -- like this it was an 4 as-applied case, the taxpayer was wanting a refund from 5 the taxes and the taxpayer owned steam ships that -6 that went back and forth from Wheeling. And the Court 7 talked about the fact that this wasn't a Tonnage Clause, 8 this was a state-authorized municipal 9 JUSTICE BREYER: What about the Greer? You 10 haven't mentioned that. Greer in Norris v. City of 11 Boston. Where he says the -- you know what it says; 12 it's on the front page of their brief. All right. That 13 seemed to me to say, don't interpret the Tonnage Clause 14 to apply to tonnage. Interpret it, same thing as if it 15 was mass, it's mariners, power of the steam engine, 16 number of passengers, the master or owner of the 17 vessel -- all those fall within the Tonnage Clause. 18 That's what the paragraph seems to say. 19 MR. OLSON: And what -- what the thrust of 20 the overall bulk of the cases including the language by 21 this Court repeatedly is that property taxation based 22 upon the value of property, not imposing a value -- not 23 imposing a tax on the ship. There are various ways I 24 suppose one could say that every time a ship enters a 25 harbor without developing a tax situs -- I think Justice

1 Alito's question focused on that -- this is not -2 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a -3 MR. OLSON: You don't get charged a fee for 4 entering the port. Or one of those cases when -5 imposes a tax because -- it called it a wharfage tax, 6 but you didn't have to touch the wharf to pay the tax. 7 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a 8 question that I don't' think has come up, but I just 9 wondered if anybody has argued this. The duty of 10 tonnage, it seems to me, might refer to the cargo rather 11 than the ship. So if the ship made ten voyages it might 12 have ten times the tonnage of another vessel of exactly 13 the same value. Has anybody argued that that's what the 14 Tonnage Clause refers to? 15 MR. OLSON: I think -- I think you're 16 correct, Justice Stevens, that what the Framers were 17 concerned about was a substitute for -- export or import 18 tax by taxing what was in the ship, and that tonnage 19 referred to that, but it wasn't the value of the vessel 20 itself because the Court -- the Framers wouldn't have 21 wanted to take away the power of the states to tax 22 commercial activity using property in their communities 23 in the same manner that they taxed other property. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's all it applied 25 to, then the wharfage tax would have been perfectly

1 okay. You can't say that was -2 MR. OLSON: The wharfage tax -- the wharfage 3 tax has been upheld by this Court frequently. The only 4 reason why it was struck down in that case is that you 5 didn't have to put into the wharf. So the Court knew it 6 wasn't really a wharfage tax, but if it was really a 7 wharfage tax, the Court has upheld it. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 9 Mr. Rothfeld, you have three minutes 10 remaining. 11 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD 12 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 13 MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor. A 14 couple of quick points. First on this confusing 15 question of what the State of Alaska does in the nature 16 of its tax. Mr. Olson began by -- by saying the State 17 of Alaska imposes this tax through the City of Valdez. 18 That is right. It is a tax imposed by the State of 19 Alaska that is collected by the City of Valdez. If the 20 city did not collect the tax, it would go directly to 21 the State of Alaska. It is an Alaska tax. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where does 23 the money go? If the City of Valdez collects it, where 24 does it go? 25 MR. ROTHFELD: If the city collects it, it
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 keeps it, but it has been authorized to do that by the 2 State. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then I think 4 we ought to regard it as a city tax, not a State tax. 5 MR. ROTHFELD: Uh -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They collect it; 7 they keep it; that sounds like a city tax. 8 MR. ROTHFELD: But it -- it is imposed by 9 the State. The State decides decide what subject it 10 has. It identifies the property that -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose the 12 State can regulate what cities and municipalities and 13 counties can do throughout the State. That doesn't make 14 everything those cities and counties do the actions of 15 the State. 16 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's true, but this 17 particular tax is a tax that is imposed by the State at 18 the State level. It -- it's notable that Valdez has 19 never before, until we reached this Court, said that 20 this is a -- that it is taxing oil and gas property. 21 The property is subject to tax by the State. The State 22 authorizes Valdez to collect the tax, but it is imposed 23 by the tax -- the city -- the State determines which 24 items are subject to tax. So this is out of Valdez's 25 discretion. Valdez chose to tax only particular types
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of personal property, and that is vessels. 2 Second, on the question of what the Tonnage 3 Clause was designed to do and -- and the Wheeling case, 4 Wheeling says that a property tax is okay when the tax 5 is imposed on vessels the same as other property owned 6 by its citizens. That is not what is going on here. 7 Contemporaneous understanding of the rule at the time 8 was that taxes that singled out vessels were 9 unconstitutional. We cite authority for this 10 proposition in our reply brief. 11 To -- to address Justice Ginsburg's question 12 as to whether there were other taxes like this, we have 13 not found any other tax anywhere that has been imposed 14 singling out vessels as -- for -- for property taxation. 15 Either now or in the past, we have not found any case 16 addressing that, not only not in this Court, but in any 17 other court. 18 And then finally -19 JUSTICE SOUTER: What about the -- the 20 broader tax situation at the -- at the -- in -- in 1789? 21 Did -- did ports have sources of -- or exercise the 22 authority at that time to tax property generally, e.g., 23 real estate in the city to support the activities of the 24 ports, or were they dependent solely upon things like 25 import-export taxes, et cetera?
57

1 MR. ROTHFELD: My -- my understanding is 2 that real estate certainly was subject to tax and that 3 ports would have the authority to tax other types of 4 property. Vessels were set aside as a particular item 5 by the Tonnage Clause. 6 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so that the argument 7 they are taxing other things, therefore it's okay to tax 8 this, would have been an argument just as potent in the 9 18th century or impotent, as the case may be, as it is 10 now? 11 MR. ROTHFELD: That's right. 12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 13 MR. ROTHFELD: And so setting aside vessels 14 in a -- in a unique category when other things could be 15 taxed would have been problematic -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- under your 17 view, how is a city supposed to impose a property tax on 18 a vessel? 19 MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it should impose a tax 20 by imposing a tax on personal property generally. And 21 if it does, it would fall on vessels as items of 22 personal property. It -- it is significant -- well, if 23 I may, Your Honor, just to finish, what Valdez has -- it 24 could have taxed all of that types of -- or it could 25 have taxed particular types of it. But it has seized on
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 only one particular type of personal property to be 2 subject to taxation. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you think 4 we should resolve the tax by seeing how generally 5 applicable property taxes are in Valdez? 6 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I think it's an easy 7 case when, as in this situation, there is only one item 8 of property that is taxed, and that's a vessel. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your -10 your brother suggests that other items of property are 11 taxed under other provisions of the tax ordinance. 12 MR. ROTHFELD: Again, Valdez does not. The 13 State does. Valdez does not. And so I think that there 14 is no need for the Court to go beyond and decide how 15 broadly applicable -- as I suggested earlier, our test 16 would be predominantly on vessels it is 17 unconstitutional, and that clearly is the case here. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 The case is submitted. 20 MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor. 21 (Whereupon, at 11:20 a.m., the case in the 22 above-entitled case was submitted.) 23 24 25
