 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 first this morning in No. 02-371, Virginia v. Kevin Lamont
 5 Hicks.
 6 Mr. Hurd.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. HURD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 10 the Court:
 11 Before this trespass policy took effect, the
 12 families in Whitcomb Court lived in the middle of an open-
 13 air drug market. Surely those who must rent from public
 14 housing ought not be required by the law to live in
 15 greater danger from criminals than those who rent from 16 private landlords. And yet, that is the consequence of
 17 the decision below and its mistaken application of the
 18 First Amendment.
 19 This defendant is a common trespasser, not
 20 engaged in any expressive activity. The court below
 21 struck down the trespass policy only by indulging in an
 22 extravagant expansion of the overbreadth doctrine.
 23 QUESTION: Well, was -- was the State applying
 24 some State law notion of standing, because certainly
 25 Virginia can have different rules for standing than the

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Federal court might have.
 2 MR. HURD: There is absolutely no indication in
 3 the record, Your Honor, that the State supreme court was
 4 doing anything other than applying what it thought was
 5 this Court's overbreadth jurisprudence.
 6 QUESTION: Well, but on -- on the matter of
 7 standing, would we necessarily assume they were applying
 8 some Federal standard?
 9 MR. HURD: Your Honor, you don't need to assume
 10 that in this case. They -- they discuss the question of
 11 standing in their opinion, and they referred to this
 12 Court and this Court's traditional rule and the
 13 overbreadth rule, never suggesting for a moment that they
 14 thought Virginia might have a more generous rule of
 15 standing than this Court has required.
 16 QUESTION: Did they cite our cases?
 17 QUESTION: There's -- there's no --
 18 MR. HURD: They did.
 19 QUESTION: There's no citation of any Virginia
 20 case in the opinion, is there?
 21 MR. HURD: There is no citation when discussing
 22 the -- the standing issue, the overbreadth issue at all. 
 23 That's correct, Your Honor.
 24 They -- they cite this Court's cases, and this
 25 is found joint appendix page 159. It says the Supreme

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Court -- and I'm quoting now from the second complete
 2 paragraph -- the Supreme Court has held that in the
 3 context of a First Amendment challenge, a litigant may
 4 challenge government action granting government officials
 5 standardless discretion even if that government action as
 6 applied to the litigant is constitutionally permissible.
 7 They then cite this Court's decision in Los
 8 Angeles Police Department. They then go on to cite this
 9 Court's decision in Ferber and in Broadrick and in Gooding
 10 v. Wilson and in Dombrowski and in Thornhill, never
 11 suggesting for a moment that Virginia has a more generous
 12 notion of overbreadth standing --
 13 QUESTION: But if we were to hold for you on
 14 that ground, the Virginia Supreme Court would be free to
 15 say on remand, would it not, that it has decided to take a 16 more generous view of standing?
 17 MR. HURD: It certainly could do that, Your
 18 Honor. The Virginia Supreme Court has historically
 19 adhered very closely in its interpretation of the State
 20 constitutional standards to the standards laid down by
 21 this Court under the Federal Constitution.
 22 QUESTION: But when we're not talking about
 23 substantive law, why is that really an -- an issue for us?
 24 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor --
 25 QUESTION: They can do what they want. It's

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 their courts.
 2 MR. HURD: Your Honor, they -- they believe they
 3 are required by this Court's jurisprudence to grant --
 4 QUESTION: Well, but they didn't say that here. 
 5 I mean, they didn't say the Supreme Court requires this
 6 and our standing doctrine would be narrower, but we feel
 7 we must. I mean, we -- we just don't know.
 8 MR. HURD: Your Honor, I believe we -- we do
 9 know based on the portions of the record I read. They
 10 relied solely upon this Court's overbreadth standing
 11 jurisprudence.
 12 QUESTION: Well, they -- they did with respect
 13 to -- to substantive law -- the substantive doctrine
 14 overbreadth. But at no point did they say, we would not
 15 entertain this matter if it were brought under State law, 16 but we are required to do so by the Supreme Court's
 17 substantive doctrine.
 18 MR. HURD: Your Honor, I -- I think of the --
 19 the recently decided case of Virginia v. Black cross
 20 burning where in that case the criminal defendant raised
 21 claims under both Federal and State law. It decided it
 22 under the Federal. It did not decide it under the State.
 23 QUESTION: Mr. Hurd, that's not the issue
 24 anyway, is it, whether they would have had a narrower
 25 interpretation under State law?

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HURD: No, Your Honor --
 2 QUESTION: The issue is whether -- whether they
 3 adopted a broader interpretation under State law than
 4 Federal law would require.
 5 MR. HURD: That's --
 6 QUESTION: Isn't that the issue?
 7 MR. HURD: That's correct, Your Honor.
 8 QUESTION: There's no indication that they were
 9 adopting a broader interpretation than Federal law
 10 requires.
 11 MR. HURD: That is correct. A -- a State may
 12 well be able to adopt a broader interpretation of standing
 13 than this Court requires, but it cannot adopt a narrower
 14 interpretation. It cannot disregard this Court's
 15 direction that you give overbreadth standing according to 16 the Federal constitutional standards, according to this
 17 Court's standards. There's nothing in the record to
 18 suggest at all that it was adopting a broader
 19 interpretation. It said that this Court -- I'm
 20 paraphrasing, of course. But it says this Court's
 21 standing rule -- its traditional standing rules do not
 22 apply in these overbreadth cases, and then it cites this
 23 Court's decisions.
 24 QUESTION: And if they were correct about what
 25 our standing rules are, they would have to follow those

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 standing rules, wouldn't they? They could not apply a
 2 narrower --
 3 MR. HURD: That's --
 4 QUESTION: -- basis for standing, could they?
 5 MR. HURD: That is absolutely correct, Your
 6 Honor. The State supreme court has no discretion to
 7 disregard this Court's application of the First Amendment
 8 through its overbreadth doctrine. Here, what happened --
 9 QUESTION: If they -- if they were wrong in
 10 interpreting our cases, they still could have done exactly
 11 what they did.
 12 MR. HURD: They could have, Your Honor, but
 13 there's no indication that they did.
 14 QUESTION: They didn't say so.
 15 MR. HURD: They didn't say so.
 16 QUESTION: So if we sent it back and then they
 17 said so, then we'd have to take the case and decide
 18 whether they're right or wrong on the merits.
 19 MR. HURD: That's correct, Your Honor.
 20 QUESTION: Yes. I'm not sure why we -- why it's
 21 called standing. That's where I'm basically mixed up in
 22 this case. The person has nothing to do with speech, the
 23 particular defendant. It's sort of like a person who has
 24 a gun under a gun statute that forbids it. And he wants
 25 to say that this law is unconstitutional because it might

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 apply to people who were petitioning, and if it did, it
 2 wouldn't do it right. It might apply to people who were
 3 speaking. It might apply to speech, just as the gun law
 4 might apply to people who have a gun in a theater in a
 5 part of a play. And he wants to say that this law is
 6 unconstitutional as applied to him because of that problem
 7 with it. And in the gun case, it would be apparent that
 8 the law wouldn't be unconstitutional as applied to him
 9 because in most of its applications, it would be
 10 constitutional and he has nothing to do with speech.
 11 And now you want to say, that's true here, too.
 12 MR. HURD: Absolutely, Your Honor.
 13 QUESTION: Well, why aren't you and he arguing
 14 on the merits of a constitutional matter, whether this
 15 statute is or is not unconstitutional because of the 16 possibility that it could be badly applied in a free
 17 speech area that isn't this one?
 18 MR. HURD: Well --
 19 QUESTION: Why isn't that the merits? Why is it
 20 standing?
 21 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, there are a number
 22 of problems with -- with Mr. Hicks' case, one of which is
 23 exactly the one you described. We think that there are
 24 several aspects of that. We think one aspect of standing.
 25 We think another aspect is that this Court's practice has

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 been not to allow overbreadth challenges to be brought in
 2 cases where it was not a -- a speech-related statute or a
 3 statute governing something closely related to speech.
 4 QUESTION: Mr. Hurd, we don't normally decide
 5 whether a statute is constitutional in the abstract, do
 6 we? I thought we normally decided whether someone has
 7 been unconstitutionally convicted. We don't go around
 8 bashing statutes in their totality. We say this person
 9 was unconstitutionally convicted.
 10 MR. HURD: That's correct, Your Honor. And --
 11 and certainly --
 12 QUESTION: And that's why it's -- it's a
 13 question of third-party standing whether you can say I was
 14 unconstitutionally convicted because if you applied this
 15 statute to somebody else, he would be unconstitutionally 16 convicted.
 17 MR. HURD: It -- that is certainly our argument,
 18 Your Honor. Standing is one problem with Mr. Hicks' case.
 19 But even if he had standing, there's a problem
 20 here of not meeting the requirement that alleged
 21 overbreadth be substantial. In fact, the State supreme
 22 court didn't address this prong of the overbreadth
 23 doctrine at all. And it's clear, we believe, that even if
 24 there were some possible unconstitutional application of
 25 this policy, that the overbreadth would not be

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 substantial. The legitimate sweep of this policy is very
 2 broad. It sweeps up those who come to Whitcomb Court to
 3 deal drugs and batter women and damage property and steal
 4 and intimidate and try to make this property their turf.
 5 QUESTION: I didn't think it was limited to
 6 those people. I thought it was a total ban on people
 7 coming in without permission.
 8 MR. HURD: Your Honor, that is -- that is not
 9 exactly the -- what the policy says. The --
 10 QUESTION: Well, what does the policy ban?
 11 MR. HURD: The policy is --
 12 QUESTION: It doesn't just ban drug dealers,
 13 does it?
 14 MR. HURD: No, Your Honor, but in terms of -- of
 15 the legitimate sweep, if we tried to contrast the 16 legitimate sweep of the policy --
 17 QUESTION: Well, I -- let's say it's legitimate
 18 to keep all the drug dealers and all the armed robbers
 19 out, but -- but how many other people does it keep out? 
 20 That's what I was curious about.
 21 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, we believe that the
 22 risk that any legitimate speaker will be chilled is -- is
 23 very small. In fact, you know, the policy was developed
 24 to chase away the ne'er-do-wells I have described, and if
 25 we're unable to remove the criminals, it would not be safe

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 for people to come and engage in speech.
 2 QUESTION: But doesn't the no trespassing sign
 3 apply to everybody? It doesn't just apply to ne'er-do-
 4 wells, does it?
 5 MR. HURD: Your Honor, it -- it does not apply
 6 to -- just to ne'er-do-wells, and the problem is how do
 7 you know until you actually catch them in the act of
 8 dealing drugs?
 9 QUESTION: Well, it applies to -- it does not
 10 apply to someone who is coming to see someone in the
 11 housing development, as I understand it.
 12 MR. HURD: That's correct, Your Honor. The --
 13 the policy is explained by Gloria Rogers, the housing
 14 manager, on page 32 of the joint appendix. There's a
 15 question and an answer at the bottom. 
 If a nonresident -16 question -- if a nonresident is seen on privatized public
 17 housing property and he cannot demonstrate that he is
 18 either visiting a lawfully residing resident or conducting
 19 legitimate business, is he an authorized -- an
 20 unauthorized person?
 21 QUESTION: Which, as far as the text of the
 22 ordinance is concerned, legitimate business could include
 23 pamphleting.
 24 MR. HURD: It -- it certainly could, Your Honor.
 25 QUESTION: As far as the text is concerned.

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HURD: Absolutely. Absolutely. It all
 2 could be included under the concept of visiting residents,
 3 going door to door to visit them and hand them material.
 4 QUESTION: If -- if we agree --
 5 QUESTION: It wasn't the interpretation by one
 6 of the administrators that leafleting was not ipso facto
 7 legitimate businessing, or pamphleting or whatever. Isn't
 8 that right?
 9 MR. HURD: Your Honor, we would characterize
 10 that not so much as an interpretation of the written
 11 policy as an addendum --
 12 QUESTION: An addendum.
 13 MR. HURD: -- an addendum to it which requires
 14 the demonstration of legitimate purpose, which is
 15 discussed in the policy, which would require that 16 demonstration be made to the housing manager to show that
 17 the leafleting is legitimate. That --
 18 QUESTION: Suppose -- and suppose I -- the --
 19 the Court were to agree with you that the speech analysis,
 20 particularly the overbreadth analysis here, was wrong. 
 21 Does the case then go back to the Supreme Court of
 22 Virginia in a posture where Mr. Hicks has the opportunity
 23 to challenge the ordinance as being unconstitutional for
 24 other reasons apart from the First Amendment? It's vague. 
 25 It inhibits his right of -- of movement. These are

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 streets that are the functional equivalent of a public,
 2 whatever. Does he have all of those issues preserved to
 3 him on remand?
 4 MR. HURD: Your Honor, he certainly has this --
 5 this due process right to wander issue preserved. There's
 6 a question that the State supreme court did not address,
 7 which is whether these streets and sidewalks are a
 8 traditional public forum or a nonpublic forum. And he has
 9 certainly asserted the right to -- to be there -- the
 10 right to --
 11 QUESTION: And in the context of that, to say
 12 that the ordinance is vague for other reasons.
 13 MR. HURD: That would be a substantive due
 14 process challenge there. He also has raised below a -- a
 15 vagueness challenge. 
 It's a little different than the one 16 he raises here. But he would have that available to him
 17 as well. So that the -- the only -- Your Honor, the --
 18 the only argument he raised below in the State supreme
 19 court that would -- that would not be available to him
 20 upon remand would be the one decided by this Court. And
 21 all the other issues he pressed below before the State
 22 supreme court he could press again.
 23 QUESTION: Mr. Hurd --
 24 QUESTION: Mr. Hurd, could we go back just to
 25 Justice Stevens' question for a minute? And I -- I just

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 want to -- I want you to comment on the significance of
 2 the -- of the -- the notice that you set out on page 5 of
 3 your brief. The notice says: no trespassing, private
 4 property, you are now entering private property and
 5 streets, et cetera. That sounds to me as though it -- it
 6 means, as -- as a no trespassing sign normally would, that
 7 if you are not a -- the landowner or a licensee of the
 8 landowner specifically, you're not supposed to enter.
 9 Then it goes on to say, unauthorized persons,
 10 which I take it anybody who is not authorized to enter,
 11 will be subject to arrest and prosecution. So in answer
 12 to Justice Stevens' question, if -- if that notice, which
 13 is posted all over the -- the area, is a statement of
 14 policy, I assume it is excluding everybody --
 15 MR. HURD: 
 No, Your Honor, it's not. 16 QUESTION: -- who is not a resident.
 17 And -- and it then goes on to say that following
 18 some review for what may or may not be authority, people
 19 coming in can be arrested and prosecuted.
 20 MR. HURD: No, Your Honor. The -- the policy is
 21 not intended to convey the idea --
 22 QUESTION: No, but is that what this says? If
 23 we -- if we stick simply to the notices that you've put
 24 up, isn't that, in effect, the burden of the notices that
 25 you've put up?

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HURD: No, Your Honor, I do not believe
 2 that's the case. I believe that -- that the phrase
 3 unauthorized persons calls into question, well, who -- who
 4 is authorized and --
 5 QUESTION: Well, but before we get to that, it
 6 says, no trespassing. And doesn't that normally mean that
 7 if you are not the landowner or a licensee, you're
 8 trespassing?
 9 MR. HURD: Your Honor, in the context of a
 10 private apartment complex, it would not mean that. A
 11 private apartment complex or a public apartment complex
 12 where a tenant has a leasehold interest has the right to
 13 invite people to come to that premises without having to
 14 have the landlord grant permission.
 15 QUESTION: 
 Is it the signs that are under 16 challenge here, or is it the ordinance?
 17 MR. HURD: It is -- it is not the signs.
 18 QUESTION: It -- it may well be that the
 19 ordinance is constitutional but the signs aren't.
 20 MR. HURD: It is -- it is the policy --
 21 QUESTION: That's possible.
 22 MR. HURD: It is the policy that is -- that is
 23 challenged, not -- not the signs.
 24 QUESTION: But are you taking the position that
 25 the policy and the signs are different in their content?

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HURD: We're taking the position they must
 2 be read together, Your Honor.
 3 QUESTION: If you read them separately, are they
 4 different?
 5 MR. HURD: A -- a person might be able to read
 6 the sign in isolation and believe that they had to get
 7 some permission to come in advance, but the people who
 8 come to the -- to this housing complex and do so
 9 legitimately typically receive invitations from the
 10 residents. So they understand. The residents understand
 11 what the policy is.
 12 QUESTION: Mr. Hurd, that's a curiosity about
 13 this case, the fact background of it that perhaps you can
 14 clarify. You keep saying legitimate visitor. This man's
 15 mother and his child and the mother of his child all live 16 in this project, and one would think that he would
 17 certainly have a basis to visit his family.
 18 MR. HURD: Your Honor, two -- two points on
 19 that. The -- the first point is had he not been barred,
 20 certainly coming to visit his family would be a legitimate
 21 purpose. But once he is barred -- and he was -- he was
 22 barred under this --
 23 QUESTION: And we don't know why.
 24 MR. HURD: Well, the -- the record suggests on
 25 page 60 that there may have been some domestic violence in

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the background. We do not know the specific facts of
 2 that. But we do know that that is referred to by Gloria
 3 Rogers on page 60 of the joint appendix. There's also a
 4 reference on that same page to giving out false
 5 information about addresses he allegedly lived at in the
 6 premises. He did plead guilty twice to trespassing and
 7 was convicted of damaging property.
 8 He does not challenge the particular reasons why
 9 he was barred, and if he wants to deliver diapers, he
 10 should have thought about that before his misconduct
 11 earned him this barment notice and he thereby forfeited
 12 his right to return.
 13 Besides, Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, there's
 14 no evidence anyone saw any diapers or that he was there on
 15 such an errand other than what he said. 
 And when he asked 16 Gloria Rogers to let him back on the property, he never
 17 mentioned visiting the child or the child's mother.
 18 QUESTION: It's not disputed that his -- that
 19 they live in the project.
 20 MR. HURD: They do, and had he not engaged in
 21 misconduct, the situation never would have arisen. But it
 22 certainly cannot --
 23 QUESTION: Maybe they want him out too. We
 24 don't really know that either, do we?
 25 MR. HURD: We -- we do not, Your Honor. We do

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 not. The -- there was no testimony at trial from the
 2 mother that she had asked him to come or that he had
 3 brought her diapers or -- or any of that. We have no idea
 4 whether he is welcome there or not.
 5 But the -- the point I want to make is that
 6 surely it cannot be the law that a desire to visit one's
 7 mother or one's girlfriend trumps a barment notice
 8 regardless of how bad the individual's prior conduct may
 9 have been. He did not challenge that barment notice by
 10 saying, well, it wasn't bad enough. What we do know in
 11 the record is that it was pretty bad: two prior instances
 12 of trespass, damaging property, and so forth.
 13 In sum -- I see my time is -- is running out. 
 14 I'd like to reserve some of it.
 15 In sum, we have families here living in 16 desperate circumstances, marijuana for sale on Bethel
 17 Street, crack cocaine on Ambrose, heroin over on Deforrest
 18 Street. The overbreadth doctrine was designed to remedy
 19 situations where a challenged statute chills the rights of
 20 others not before the court. Here it's not this trespass
 21 policy that chills the right of free speech, but the
 22 dangerous conditions at Whitcomb Court that the policy was
 23 designed to alleviate.
 24 We ask that the judgment below be vacated.
 25 Thank you.

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hurd. And you wish to
 2 reserve the rest of your time?
 3 MR. HURD: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.
 4 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.
 5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
 6 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
 7 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
 8 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
 9 may it please the Court:
 10 What makes this case distinctive as a First
 11 Amendment case is the presence of a general law not
 12 directed at speech at all but directed at conduct that's
 13 under challenge and the absence of any expressive activity
 14 whatsoever by the person seeking to raise the overbreadth
 15 challenge.
 16 This Court's cases have entertained overbreadth
 17 challenges as a means of alleviating the chill of First
 18 Amendment rights of persons who are not before the Court,
 19 but the Court has never entertained overbreadth when the
 20 consequence of doing so would be to invalidate a general
 21 law that's primarily aimed at conduct and when the person
 22 who's raising the challenge did nothing to engage in
 23 speech or any expressive activity at all.
 24 The costs of an overbreadth challenge, this
 25 Court has recognized, are high because they prohibit the

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Government from enforcing a law against conduct that is
 2 not constitutionally protected. But those costs are
 3 magnified when the law under challenge is not merely a law
 4 that directs --
 5 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, assume -- I know it's
 6 not quite clear, but assume for the moment that Virginia
 7 had clearly -- Virginia Supreme Court clearly said we're
 8 going to allow standing as a matter of State law, but --
 9 even though it wouldn't be allowed as a matter of Federal
 10 law, and the case then came to us in that posture. Would
 11 we then have authority to decide the overbreadth issue?
 12 MR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure that this Court
 13 would, Justice Stevens. It would then be in a posture
 14 more analogous to the J.H. Munson case that was before the
 15 Court in which the Court considered and Your Honor's 16 separate opinion addressed the question of whether, when
 17 there was an independent State overbreadth analysis, could
 18 an aggrieved State official then bring the case to this
 19 Court.
 20 What is clear on the current record is that the
 21 Virginia Supreme Court cited and relied on --
 22 QUESTION: No. I understand that. But I'm just
 23 -- I'm just wondering if it went back and they said, well,
 24 that's true, but it was a matter of Virginia law. We
 25 think we'll entertain a stand, and then they decide on

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Federal grounds that it violates the First Amendment. 
 2 Then my question is, could we review that holding, and if
 3 -- if we reviewed it in that?
 4 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the question there would be
 5 whether the State was sufficiently aggrieved so as to have
 6 standing under the principles announced --
 7 QUESTION: Some of our loyalty oath cases -- I
 8 forget if it was Adler or Doremus. Doremus was First
 9 Amendment -- allowed us to relax our standing rules in
 10 order to reach a substantive constitutional issue cited by
 11 the State court.
 12 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the most relevant case is
 13 probably the Asarco decision in which the Court concluded
 14 that once the State court binds the State officials to a
 15 particular ruling, that there may be the requisite case or 16 controversy to allow this Court to decide --
 17 QUESTION: There's -- there's also --
 18 QUESTION: The same party can have standing to
 19 appeal.
 20 MR. DREEBEN: That's right. And --
 21 QUESTION: There's also a question, isn't there,
 22 Mr. Dreeben, of whether this overbreadth doctrine is
 23 essentially a part of the First Amendment or a part of the
 24 standing doctrine?
 25 MR. DREEBEN: Well, it has two aspects, Mr.

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Chief Justice. One aspect of it does relate to whether
 2 there is a case or controversy, and there clearly has to
 3 be a developed enough case or controversy to allow Article
 4 III to be invoked for this Court to announce First
 5 Amendment principles at all. And part of the overbreadth
 6 doctrine responds to those concerns.
 7 But another aspect of the overbreadth doctrine
 8 is purely prudential, and this Court has adopted those
 9 limits as a matter of -- of prudential principles to avoid
 10 the premature adjudication of hypothetical and abstract
 11 First Amendment questions.
 12 QUESTION: But it clearly relates to the
 13 doctrine of standing, doesn't it, which doctrine says that
 14 you normally do not have standing to raise the objections
 15 of other people? 
 You only have standing to raise 16 objections to your own treatment, not to the treatment of
 17 others, right?
 18 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct. I wouldn't
 19 dispute --
 20 QUESTION: And overbreadth changes that. It
 21 says in this one area, you can object to the treatment of
 22 other people.
 23 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think overbreadth is -- is
 24 an application of a more general principle that this
 25 Court has adopted on -- in various circumstances to allow

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 a party who's before the Court and who is aggrieved to
 2 raise the rights of others. For example, in Batson
 3 challenges, the Court allows criminal defendants to raise
 4 the rights of the excluded jurors.
 5 This is an example of third party standing
 6 designed to implement First Amendment norms, but the
 7 Court has recognized that the costs of invalidating a law,
 8 when the person before the Court doesn't have
 9 constitutionally protected conduct, are high, and those
 10 costs are higher when what's being invalidated is not
 11 merely a law aimed at speech, but a law aimed at access,
 12 general conduct, as is this law.
 13 QUESTION: But the irony of what you're saying
 14 is that the Virginia -- Virginia Supreme Court might
 15 undertake that cost, invalidate a Virginia statute on 16 Federal grounds that we think are wrong and we couldn't do
 17 anything about it.
 18 MR. DREEBEN: That is probably true unless the
 19 Court applies the Asarco principle to allow an aggrieved
 20 State official to bring the case here because its own
 21 supreme court has interfered with the implementation of
 22 Federal law --
 23 QUESTION: See, but that's -- that's the
 24 problem. I mean, this is exactly -- that's why I'm mixed
 25 up about the standing part versus the merits. It seems to

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 me if it's a traditional question of standing, there --
 2 there are a group of people who are trespassing who have
 3 nothing to do with speech. And then there's some other
 4 hypothetical people that might have to do with speech. 
 5 And the question is can these people who have nothing to
 6 do with speech invalidate the statute because of the way
 7 it applies to some other people? Now, in the First
 8 Amendment area, we have normally let people do that, but
 9 in other areas not.
 10 All right. So suppose the answer is not. You
 11 can't. That's their problem. Let them raise it.
 12 Now, Virginia says, we want to let any taxpayer
 13 raise it. If it were purely standing, any taxpayer could
 14 raise it, but then what? I would have said that the first
 15 holding would have meant it is not unconstitutional under 16 the Federal Constitution to convict this person. And --
 17 and now, under -- under the guise of standing, they're
 18 going to come back and say, oh, no, it is unconstitutional
 19 because we let this person raise the rights of some
 20 others. That's where I'm confused.
 21 MR. DREEBEN: I think the answer to this paradox
 22 is that the State court can adopt much broader principles
 23 of law with respect to standing than this Court would
 24 impose, and it can administer them even when it's
 25 adjudicating Federal light -- rights. For example, a

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 State could allow a purely advisory opinion to be issued
 2 by its State supreme court challenging this law by any
 3 citizen.
 4 QUESTION: Well, fine, let them challenge it.
 5 QUESTION: Okay. Does --
 6 QUESTION: But if you're right, no matter how
 7 much they challenge it, the simple fact is, if you're
 8 right, it doesn't violate the Federal Constitution to
 9 convict this person.
 10 MR. DREEBEN: That's true.
 11 QUESTION: So what's raising it going to get
 12 him?
 13 MR. DREEBEN: Well, that -- that is an
 14 adjudication of the -- of the overbreadth challenge on the
 15 merits. 
 It would be a determination that there is not 16 sufficient real and substantial overbreadth to invalidate
 17 this law, and we do think that that is a correct analysis
 18 and would suffice to reject the Virginia Supreme Court's
 19 holding in this case.
 20 QUESTION: Okay, but you're -- I think you're
 21 saying that -- that under Asarco, they can challenge the
 22 substantiality point, but they wouldn't necessarily be
 23 able to challenge the standing point which gets this
 24 particular defendant in a position to raise the issue in
 25 the first place. Is that right?

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: It's not exactly right, Justice
 2 Souter, because I think this is an area analogous to the
 3 Court's rules in criminal cases under Michigan v. Long
 4 where the Court has to decide, does this opinion rest on a
 5 question of Federal law or does it rest on a question of
 6 State law? And in Michigan v. Long, the Court adopted a
 7 presumption that if what a State court does is cite and
 8 rely on Federal precedents, we will presume that it did
 9 what it did because it thought it was compelled to by the
 10 force of this Court's decisions.
 11 QUESTION: We certainly -- that certainly
 12 applies when you're talking about substantive law whether
 13 it -- it would be an extension of that to apply it to
 14 standing.
 15 MR. DREEBEN: 
 I think it would only be a modest 16 extension because in this case the court did not
 17 separately analyze the questions of standing as such from
 18 whether respondent could bring an overbreadth challenge,
 19 and the question wasn't posed with a --
 20 QUESTION: Why -- why isn't that a question of
 21 standing by definition?
 22 MR. DREEBEN: It -- what it --
 23 QUESTION: Overbreadth is an exception to
 24 standing, and -- and so why is it anything but a standing
 25 issue? Substantiality of overbreadth is -- is a

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 substantive issue, but -- you see my --
 2 MR. DREEBEN: Let me -- let me explain it this
 3 way, Justice Souter. If this Court said the First
 4 Amendment overbreadth doctrine requires that State courts
 5 entertain overbreadth claims like this one even when it's
 6 a general law and even when the party before the court has
 7 been convicted of conduct that doesn't involve speech,
 8 then State courts would be required to follow that rule
 9 and could not adopt a different standing principle that
 10 was narrower and that would exclude respondent.
 11 And our reading of the Virginia Supreme Court's
 12 opinion is that Virginia either thought or assumed that it
 13 was required by this Court's cases to entertain an
 14 overbreadth challenge. The proper response, if the Court
 15 agrees that it's not the State court's obligation to 16 entertain this overbreadth challenge, would be to vacate
 17 the judgment, announce the correct First Amendment
 18 principles, and remand the case to the Virginia Supreme
 19 Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
 20 QUESTION: But that would -- that would
 21 basically be applying something like Michigan v. Long
 22 rather than Asarco, right?
 23 MR. DREEBEN: In this case, it certainly would
 24 because the State court hasn't relied on a clearly
 25 insufficient case or controversy in order to adjudicate

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Federal rights. There is, in fact, a case or controversy
 2 here. The respondent has been convicted of a criminal
 3 offense, and he is challenging the law under which he was
 4 convicted. So this case does not fall outside of the case
 5 or controversy requirement even measured by Article III
 6 standards.
 7 QUESTION: If we follow that course, we wouldn't
 8 get to the substantive overbreadth, right? We would
 9 just --
 10 MR. DREEBEN: That -- that is correct, Justice
 11 Ginsburg.
 12 Thank you.
 13 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.
 14 Mr. Benjamin, we'll hear from you.
 15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN D. BENJAMIN 16 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 17 MR. BENJAMIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 18 please the Court:
 19 In 1997, Richmond took a neighborhood and by
 20 ordinance, deed, and a police authorization, made it so
 21 that a person could not walk down the street or the
 22 sidewalk unless he could prove to the police that he was
 23 authorized to do so. The policy that the city implemented
 24 was of such breadth that it included the public, residents
 25 and nonresidents alike of this community, that it included

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 innocent people doing lawful things, and it included
 2 protected conduct, such as the distribution of literature.
 3 QUESTION: Are you suggesting that these streets
 4 were still as if they belonged to the City of Richmond
 5 after they were deeded to the housing authority?
 6 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor.
 7 QUESTION: Why is that?
 8 MR. BENJAMIN: They were still public. They
 9 were still public streets, regardless of the transfer --
 10 QUESTION: Why -- you know, clearly the city
 11 intended that they no longer be public streets. Why did
 12 that intention fail?
 13 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, for the same reason
 14 when Congress ruled -- or -- or passed a law saying that
 15 the sidewalks around this building were no longer to be 16 used, for the same reason. The intent didn't matter. The
 17 character and the use and the form didn't change at all,
 18 and those were the criteria that mattered.
 19 QUESTION: That wasn't a law making those
 20 private sidewalks. 
 21 What -- what about the streets to and from the
 22 entry to the Governor's mansion in Richmond? Are they
 23 public streets too?
 24 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, they are, Your Honor.
 25 QUESTION: They are.

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, sir.
 2 QUESTION: You can't exclude the public from --
 3 from marching right up to the Governor's front door?
 4 MR. BENJAMIN: You can exclude the public from
 5 the gate. There's a gate.
 6 QUESTION: From the gate, but there's a street
 7 that goes right from the gate right up, you know, circular
 8 driveway, right up to the Governor's front door. That's a
 9 public street.
 10 MR. BENJAMIN: That is not a public street, Your
 11 Honor.
 12 QUESTION: Of course, it's not a public street.
 13 (Laughter.)
 14 QUESTION: So it's --
 15 QUESTION: 
 So -- so there can be streets owned 16 by the State of Virginia or the City of Richmond that are
 17 not public streets.
 18 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, sir.
 19 QUESTION: And the only issue is whether this is
 20 one of them.
 21 MR. BENJAMIN: Well, that street, Your Honor, I
 22 would call a driveway. That's what it is. 
 23 (Laughter.)
 24 QUESTION: Well, the residents of this housing
 25 project would call these streets their -- their driveways,

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the -- the access to their particular apartments.
 2 MR. BENJAMIN: I disagree with you.
 3 QUESTION: Well, there are a lot of streets in
 4 Cambridge which are called private ways, and nobody knows
 5 what that means.
 6 (Laughter.)
 7 MR. BENJAMIN: And that, Your Honor --
 8 QUESTION: A lot of stuff in Cambridge that
 9 nobody understands.
 10 (Laughter.)
 11 QUESTION: Well, they have some original alleys
 12 in the District that are comparable I think.
 13 MR. BENJAMIN: That's true too, but you know, I
 14 have never, Your Honor, heard anyone with a grievance say
 15 let's take it to the alley. 
 It's always, let's take it to 16 the street because --
 17 QUESTION: Well, I -- I take -- I take it there
 18 are any number of -- of difficult and important issues
 19 here. One is the character of these streets. We don't
 20 know very much about it in the record. The other is
 21 whether, even if they are streets with some special
 22 status, whether Ms. Rogers is the one who has the right to
 23 say who can come and who can go. This is Ms. Rogers'
 24 neighborhood in a very interesting way.
 25 (Laughter.)

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: But I -- I take it that all of those
 2 issues are open for you to argue if we were to agree with
 3 the State that the Supreme Court of Virginia was simply
 4 wrong in its First Amendment analysis on overbreadth, and
 5 you would have all of those arguments to confront and to
 6 see if you can prevail on if we remand it to the Supreme
 7 Court of Virginia.
 8 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, that's correct. 
 9 However, those same issues, of course, were before the
 10 Virginia Supreme Court. The -- the State, the petitioner,
 11 did not even challenge standing until the State sought
 12 cert at this Court.
 13 The question presented concerning the closest
 14 issue to standing was whether Mr. Hicks was untimely in
 15 his challenge to the barment-trespass policy. The State
 16 in all of the State courts argued that Mr. Hicks should
 17 have challenged his barment in some civil proceeding, and
 18 that's the question presented on page 97 of the joint
 19 appendix and that was what the Virginia Supreme Court
 20 dealt with, it having been the only issue presented to
 21 them on this at page 158.
 22 QUESTION: It doesn't have to argue it if they
 23 decide it. We -- we will review a question that is either
 24 argued or decided by the State court. There's no doubt
 25 that the Virginia Supreme Court decided the standing

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 question, decided the overbreadth question, and you're
 2 saying that we cannot review that decision because he was
 3 not the one that initiated the -- the matter? That's just
 4 not what our law says.
 5 MR. BENJAMIN: I don't know, Your Honor, if it
 6 is true to say that the Virginia court necessarily decided
 7 the standing order, it not -- the standing issue, it not
 8 having been raised. But --
 9 QUESTION: They had a whole long discussion of
 10 overbreadth. I mean --
 11 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, sir.
 12 QUESTION: What do you think that was about?
 13 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor, that was on the
 14 merits. When the Virginia Supreme Court discussed the
 15 merits, they discussed whether there was overbreadth and 16 whether it was substantially overbroad.
 17 QUESTION: But they didn't decide that
 18 overbreadth was an issue. They just went ahead and
 19 decided if overbreadth had been an issue, this is how the
 20 issue would be resolved. Certainly they decided that
 21 overbreadth -- that is, the standing doctrine of
 22 overbreadth -- was applicable to this case.
 23 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, I disagree with you. 
 24 I don't think they decided that and I don't think it
 25 was --

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Then why did they go into the
 2 discussion of whether this was overbroad? They must have
 3 thought it relevant.
 4 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, because it -- it was
 5 the -- the immediate issue that confronted them. They
 6 were confronted with a policy that was unconstitutional in
 7 so many fundamental respects.
 8 QUESTION: But they dealt with only one. Mr.
 9 Hurd said, yes, your question of public forum or not would
 10 be open, your due process vagueness argument would be
 11 open. What wouldn't be open, if we ruled against you on
 12 this First Amendment overbreadth thing, is -- that's all.
 13 Everything else -- the Virginia Supreme Court said this is
 14 what we're deciding and we're not getting to -- they
 15 deliberately said we're not getting to public forum. 16 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, if the Virginia
 17 Supreme Court did implicitly decide the standing issue,
 18 then it was a right that it had to accept this -- this
 19 case which was, as the Government concedes, and the
 20 petitioner, a case and controversy. Mr. Hicks was
 21 convicted, and he did raise all of these constitutional
 22 issues in defense of his conviction. And if the Virginia
 23 Supreme Court implicitly reached the standing question,
 24 then as a matter of State law and State rights, it was
 25 entitled to do that.

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Mr. Benjamin, certainly the
 2 dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court of Virginia talked
 3 about overbreadth. I mean, the -- the one -- I'm just
 4 reading a sentence here from appendix page: Thus, I
 5 conclude that the defendant may only challenge the
 6 trespass policy as it was applied to him. Now, that --
 7 that is overbreadth.
 8 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor.
 9 QUESTION: So what is the answer then to the
 10 overbreadth question? That is, the first question
 11 presented in the petition for certiorari, which we
 12 granted, asks, as I read it, the question of whether a
 13 person who does not engage in expressive conduct at all
 14 can ask the court and can succeed in having the court
 15 strike down a statute as applied to him for the reason 16 that it might be unconstitutional as applied to other
 17 people engaged in expressive conduct.
 18 The example would be, favoring their side, that
 19 you have a gun statute. Any person who possesses a gun is
 20 -- goes to jail, and the defendant says, well, I did
 21 possess a gun and I was trying to rob a bank, but maybe
 22 this statute would be applied to a person in a play, in
 23 which case it would be too broad. And they say it's like
 24 that absurd example.
 25 All right. Now, why isn't it close enough to

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the absurd example? They're also arguing that this is a
 2 statute that deals with drugs. It deals with ordinary
 3 trespass. Very few of these people want to pamphlet or
 4 engage in expressive conduct. A handful might, but if
 5 they do, let's consider it, when this statute is applied
 6 to them, which it never has been in their view.
 7 Now, what's your response?
 8 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, my response is that
 9 in the ordinary case, such as some of your hypotheticals
 10 suggest, it would become instantly apparent that the
 11 robber, although claiming that the statute or the policy
 12 is overbroad -- it would become instantly apparent that he
 13 had no basis whatsoever to bring this motion. If he even
 14 got to a hearing, there would be an immediate failure of
 15 proof, but it wouldn't get to a hearing because there 16 would be a motion to quash the motion for lack of --
 17 QUESTION: There happened to be -- I didn't give
 18 you the whole statute. There were seven other
 19 constitutional errors in it, but I didn't mention them
 20 because they could be raised on remand.
 21 (Laughter.)
 22 QUESTION: So it's -- that -- that I'm trying to
 23 make this --
 24 MR. BENJAMIN: In this policy I counted eight
 25 constitutional errors.

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 In this case, Mr. Hicks' conduct was expressive. 
 2 Mr. Hicks meets Virginia's own test because he was going
 3 to see his children, and there is no expressive action --
 4 QUESTION: You know, I -- I think it's a mistake
 5 to put too much onto the First Amendment. The police
 6 officer stops me unlawfully and I say, I was on the way
 7 home to talk to my wife. I mean, this -- this -- it tends
 8 to trivialize the First Amendment if you put so much on
 9 it. You have some very important substantive issues here
 10 about the right of freedom of movement to use the streets
 11 and so forth, and it seems to me that for the -- for you
 12 to rest the case, A, on the First Amendment, B, under what
 13 is a very questionable application of the overbreadth
 14 doctrine. It -- it is not the right way to proceed in
 15 this case.
 16 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, I understand your
 17 question, and Mr. Hicks at the inception was not outraged
 18 about free speech and First Amendment issues. He was
 19 outraged about the fact that he had been banned for
 20 apparently nothing more, as the en banc Virginia court
 21 found, going back to see his family repeatedly. He was
 22 upset and challenged the very barment proceeding and the
 23 -- the entire policy.
 24 QUESTION: May I just stop you there as a matter
 25 of accuracy? We don't know why he was debarred, but we do

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 know that one of the charges was destruction of property. 
 2 We don't know what property that was. So it's -- I think
 3 you're painting a somewhat false picture to suggest that
 4 this was a loving father who was simply going to visit his
 5 children.
 6 MR. BENJAMIN: The en banc court at page 125,
 7 footnote --
 8 QUESTION: Is this the court of appeals?
 9 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor.
 10 QUESTION: Not the supreme court.
 11 MR. BENJAMIN: Not the supreme court, had found,
 12 Your Honor, that the -- the charge of damaging property
 13 had nothing to do with his barment, and there was nothing
 14 in the record or in the evidence suggesting otherwise.
 15 The testimony at page 60 of the joint appendix 16 does not permit the inference urged by the petitioner. 
 17 The inference at most urged -- that you could draw from
 18 page 60, the testimony there is that the police quite
 19 often saw Mr. Hicks in the development and he gave them an
 20 address, and then Ms. Rogers would confirm that he did not
 21 live there.
 22 QUESTION: Well, if you're going appeal to page
 23 60, you're just out of the frying pan into the -- into the
 24 fire. Yes, it -- it doesn't mention destruction of
 25 property, but it does mention domestic violence.

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, what Gloria Rogers is
 2 doing in that instance, although she has been asked the
 3 specific question, how did Kevin Hicks come to be barred,
 4 she begins, as she does, giving a general answer in how
 5 people get barred. And in the -- she began with that.
 6 Then she went to Mr. Hicks' case, and then she went back
 7 to one of her own reasons of domestic violence.
 8 QUESTION: No. She's answering the question,
 9 please tell the court how he came -- how has he come and
 10 have you banned him from the property. Yes. All right. 
 11 Please tell the court how that came about. And she said,
 12 number one -- she gave two reasons. When the police see a
 13 person in the development and they say they live
 14 someplace, they confirm with the office, and Kevin Hicks
 15 gave a false address. 
 Secondly, because of the domestic 16 violence in the development. I -- I take that to be a
 17 response to the question that was asked. So, you know, to
 18 the extent we know anything about why he was banned, it
 19 was either because he destroyed property or because he
 20 participated in domestic violence.
 21 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor. We had sought
 22 discovery of the reasons that he was banned, and counsel
 23 at page 1312 and 13 had said that counsel needed to
 24 demonstrate why Mr. Hicks was barred. But RRHA counsel,
 25 the housing authority counsel, objected that the reason

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 why Mr. Hicks was banned was irrelevant because being a
 2 private property owner, the position was, they could ban
 3 anyone at any time for any reason.
 4 QUESTION: Okay, Mr. Benjamin, I'm going to ask
 5 you to assume that I at least do not accept the view that
 6 the record shows that your client was there for an
 7 expressive purpose that ought to be recognized by the --
 8 by the First Amendment. I don't ask you to stipulate that
 9 he was banned because he was a criminal. I will simply
 10 assume that he is in some middle ground, that he is not
 11 there for expressive purposes. Assume we don't know why
 12 he's there.
 13 What's your -- your answer basically to the
 14 question put to you by Justice Breyer? Why is it
 15 necessary, in order to protect the First Amendment, to 16 allow a person in that position to -- to raise this kind
 17 of -- of issue with respect, say, to leafleters or people
 18 who are there for expressive purposes? Why do we need to
 19 recognize this?
 20 MR. BENJAMIN: Because, Your Honor, as you --
 21 this very exchange illustrates how unworkable that very
 22 test would be because reasonable people will disagree over
 23 whether any given conduct is in fact expressive. If the
 24 very fact that Mr. Hicks --
 25 QUESTION: Well, you're changing my hypo. I

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 mean, I -- I said let's assume that we don't have a
 2 predicate for saying this person's conduct is expressive. 
 3 I will grant you that there are always going to be points
 4 on the margin in which we say, well, was he there for
 5 speech or wasn't he. Assume he wasn't. What -- what is
 6 the -- what is the best argument for recognizing his right
 7 to raise a First Amendment claim?
 8 MR. BENJAMIN: Because the whole reason for the
 9 exception is the importance of First Amendment rights and
 10 values. To impose this sort of a test would defeat the
 11 purpose and -- and the value, the opportunity for society
 12 to deal with laws that sweep this broadly and infringe
 13 upon and violate people's --
 14 QUESTION: Why -- why don't you have an adequate
 15 basis to deal with them under the vagueness doctrine, for 16 example, that is open to you on remand, even if you lose
 17 here? Why do we have to turn this into a First Amendment
 18 issue?
 19 MR. BENJAMIN: Because I think the Virginia
 20 Supreme Court, when it saw the entirety of this policy,
 21 including not just the First Amendment issues, but the
 22 vagueness that permeates this policy -- I think that the
 23 Virginia Supreme Court decided, from a conservative
 24 approach, that it would deal with the most to it -- the
 25 most obvious deficiency and that is the complete

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 unfettered discretion that -- that Gloria Rogers, the
 2 housing manager, had, that every single police officer
 3 had, and deal with it then while the policy was before it,
 4 instead of going on and settling other questions, instead
 5 of requiring that challenges --
 6 QUESTION: But what you just said goes right to
 7 vagueness, that you have an administrator who says, I'm
 8 queen. I'll let you in or I won't let you in. I don't
 9 see why you need the First Amendment hook to challenge
 10 that point.
 11 MR. BENJAMIN: Mr. Hicks didn't need the First
 12 Amendment. His issue from the very beginning began with
 13 the -- the vagueness that permeates this, but it -- he --
 14 QUESTION: But -- but maybe it's not your fault,
 15 but that's what the Supreme Court of Virginia said, and in 16 the course of doing so, it arguably -- and there's a very
 17 serious concern that it misapplied Thornhill.
 18 QUESTION: Mr. Benjamin, I don't want to put
 19 words in your mouth -- excuse me. I'm sorry. I didn't --
 20 I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is this what
 21 you're trying to say, that if the statute is so overbroad
 22 it would be unconstitutional if the person has standing to
 23 challenge it? It doesn't matter whether he is -- his
 24 disability is -- is because it's not a First Amendment
 25 issue at all or whether he's engaged in First Amendment

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 conduct which is perfectly prohibitable as to him. In
 2 either event, it doesn't matter why he can't challenge it
 3 as long as his -- as the statute itself is overbroad. Is
 4 that what your position is?
 5 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor, that is.
 6 QUESTION: All right. Then --
 7 (Laughter.)
 8 QUESTION: That's -- is there a -- is there a
 9 risk here? And I'm not asking it from one point of view
 10 or another. I don't know. But if we accepted that, there
 11 are trespass laws all over the country. And -- and would
 12 -- I don't know what they all say, but people who are
 13 convicted of ordinary trespass -- and a lot of them apply
 14 to public property, et cetera -- could then come in and
 15 say, look, these trespass laws, even though they've never 16 been applied to stop expression -- except in my case, but
 17 I'm assuming it's not expression in my case. Assume it's
 18 not. We have to set them all aside because they might be
 19 applied to expression in -- in a way that's
 20 unconstitutional. If I accepted the proposition that
 21 you've just accepted, have I got myself in that box?
 22 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, I'm afraid I lost you
 23 somewhat during --
 24 QUESTION: Well, in other words, if I take the
 25 proposition you've just accepted as your argument, am I

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 then allowing people who trespass -- nothing to do with
 2 expression -- to start attacking all the trespass laws on
 3 the ground that if applied in the expression area, they
 4 would be unconstitutional? And they haven't been applied
 5 in that area.
 6 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor.
 7 QUESTION: In other words -- I would be --
 8 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor.
 9 QUESTION: I would be accepting that.
 10 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes. And that -- that -- but
 11 it's not much of a risk.
 12 QUESTION: Because?
 13 MR. BENJAMIN: Because those challenges would
 14 fail almost immediately because it -- I know of no other
 15 case where the trespass law has applied so pervasively to 16 the entire streets and sidewalks of a community. 
 17 QUESTION: But trespass on public property --
 18 there could be all kinds of situations, Federal buildings
 19 and dozens of them, where in fact it's really applied
 20 against people who are breaking in who have no business
 21 there, and they just don't apply it or it never has come
 22 up whether they would apply it were somebody interested in
 23 a demonstration.
 24 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor, but the system
 25 can easily deal with frivolous motions because of the

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 requirements already built into the requirement. 
 2 Overbreadth must not only exist and be articulable, it
 3 must be substantial. And the system could deal with that,
 4 with sanctions if necessary.
 5 In this case it wasn't enough for a citizen to
 6 have, in fact, a legitimate purpose to use the sidewalk. 
 7 He had to be able to demonstrate that he had a legitimate
 8 purpose. The legitimate purpose was by reference solely
 9 to the subjective standards of any particular police
 10 officer or Gloria Rogers, the housing manager. There was
 11 no housing authority handbook of what constitutes
 12 legitimate business. There was no clear meaning as to
 13 what legitimate meant. Left unsaid would be whether
 14 someone could go onto these streets and sidewalks if their
 15 business was to argue and have it out with someone or to 16 go meet with abortion activists. All we know from this
 17 policy is that before you can use these sidewalks, you
 18 must be engaged in a legitimate -- whatever that means --
 19 business or social reason, which by its own terms --
 20 QUESTION: Those are all vagueness -- those are
 21 all vagueness points. They -- they really don't go to the
 22 -- right? You're making the vagueness argument now. 
 23 MR. BENJAMIN: I am --
 24 QUESTION: You -- you would have us rule on a
 25 vagueness ground as well, wouldn't you? 

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BENJAMIN: I would, but --
 2 QUESTION: I'd sort of like to separate the
 3 arguments that are going to vagueness and those that are
 4 going to overbreadth. The ones you're making now don't go
 5 to overbreadth, it seems to me. 
 6 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, you can't separate
 7 vagueness and overbreadth, and this argument goes directly
 8 to the heart of First Amendment. 
 9 QUESTION: Well, our cases have certainly
 10 separated vagueness from overbreadth.
 11 MR. BENJAMIN: I think that this Court has used
 12 the terms vagueness and overbreadth interchangeably and --
 13 QUESTION: Well, let's -- let's assume that
 14 we're up to the challenge. 
 15 (Laughter.) 
 16 QUESTION: It -- it seems to me that there are
 17 some very important vagueness arguments in -- in the -- in
 18 the classical sense of that term that your client can and
 19 should make, and they're unrelated to the speech point. 
 20 They're completely unrelated to it. They can play back in
 21 the speech context just as well, but -- but the Supreme
 22 Court of Virginia thought about this just in the speech
 23 context, and that's our concern. 
 24 MR. BENJAMIN: I submit, Your Honor, that the
 25 Virginia Supreme Court was taken and impressed by the

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 First Amendment implications that are produced by the
 2 vagueness. If you must have a legitimate business or
 3 social purpose -- and by those terms what's excluded as a
 4 legitimate purpose are lawful purposes like wandering or
 5 jogging because that's not a -- a business or social
 6 purpose, but also protected purposes such as distributing
 7 fliers, literature, or holding religious meetings. That
 8 does not -- that kind of conduct at least arguably does
 9 not fall within the rubric of business or social --
 10 QUESTION: No, but isn't it true -- but isn't
 11 the problem with your argument this: It is one thing to
 12 say that a statute that ostensibly addresses speech is
 13 likely to have a serious overbreadth problem if it is very
 14 vague in the way it does it, but it is a very different
 15 thing to say that a statute that does not ostensibly 16 address speech, that addresses conduct, walking across a
 17 line, becomes an overbreadth -- presents an overbreadth
 18 problem simply because somebody who crosses that line
 19 might want to talk. And you're arguing on the basis of
 20 cases in the first category, speech with vague
 21 limitations, to tell us that we ought to -- that we ought
 22 to consider everything in the second category a speech
 23 case. Isn't that the -- the difficulty of your argument? 
 24 MR. BENJAMIN: It is not, Your Honor, because
 25 this policy targeted streets in the first place, streets

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 and sidewalks, which are -- a principal purpose of which
 2 is for expressive activity. The policy itself was called
 3 the street privatization program. 
 4 QUESTION: Well, that --
 5 QUESTION: But the --
 6 QUESTION: Mr. Benjamin, it may not be
 7 immediately before us, but it seems to me it is the heart
 8 of your case. You are essentially saying that a public
 9 authority cannot create, for people who live in projects,
 10 a gated community. The people who live outside projects
 11 can have streets, everything just like this, but
 12 government can't create it for poor people. Is that --
 13 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, they -- they can't --
 14 the Government can't do it by simply saying that the
 15 streets are private and simply putting up signs because -16 QUESTION: Okay. If you're right on that, we
 17 don't have to get to the speech issue. If you're wrong on
 18 that, you have the problem that I just presented to you,
 19 don't you? 
 20 MR. BENJAMIN: I don't understand. 
 21 QUESTION: If -- look, if -- if you're right
 22 that the Government cannot, in their words, privatize the
 23 streets, then that's the end of the case. Your guy can't
 24 be prosecuted for trespass in this instance, and that's
 25 the end of the issue here. If it turns out, on the other

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 hand, that the Government can indeed do what it purported
 2 to do here, then it seems to me your argument suffers from
 3 the problem that I raised. You're saying that even in a
 4 case in which the statute doesn't address speech but
 5 addresses conduct, crossing a property line, there is a
 6 speech implication and every one of those trespass cases
 7 becomes a First Amendment overbreadth case. Isn't --
 8 isn't that correct?
 9 MR. BENJAMIN: I agree that the challenge can be
 10 made if counsel sees fit to do so, but of course, he's
 11 bound by the State's ethical requirements. And the -- the
 12 issue won't be there in most cases. There is no policy
 13 that is going to be as vague and overbroad, so pervasive
 14 in its effect on First Amendment freedoms as well as --
 15 QUESTION: 
 You're saying when it gets very, 16 very, very, very, very vague that's when it becomes a -- a
 17 First Amendment problem even though it -- the statute
 18 doesn't address speech. Is that basically it? 
 19 MR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, yes.
 20 QUESTION: How could we administer that?
 21 MR. BENJAMIN: It's not -- what you administer
 22 is what has always been administered, the requirement of a
 23 finding of substantial overbreadth.
 24 QUESTION: Do we -- do we have any -- any
 25 overbreadth cases that -- that would support that? I

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 mean, our overbreadth cases start with -- with a speech
 2 claim and says, well, maybe you can stop my speech, but
 3 you can't stop his. Do -- do you have any authority
 4 for --
 5 MR. BENJAMIN: I don't think that in Chicago v.
 6 Morales that there was any claim that the petitioners in
 7 that case were involved in expressive activity.
 8 QUESTION: I thought they wanted to have a
 9 parade or a -- a --
 10 MR. BENJAMIN: That was --
 11 QUESTION: -- an assembly of some sort.
 12 MR. BENJAMIN: I think, Your Honor, that was in
 13 Forsyth County. 
 14 QUESTION: Oh. 
 15 MR. BENJAMIN: 
 We have cases such as Watchtower, 16 for example, where admittedly in Watchtower, Jehovah's
 17 Witnesses were engaging in expressive activity, but there
 18 was nothing about the facts of that case or the ordinance
 19 that suggested that anyone in nonexpressive activity would
 20 not have been able to raise the substantial overbreadth
 21 challenge. If it had been Girls Scouts, for example. 
 22 QUESTION: No. I think that was a First
 23 Amendment. What about Morales? What -- what did Morales
 24 involve?
 25 MR. BENJAMIN: That involved the Chicago anti-

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 loitering statute. 
 2 QUESTION: Street corner assembly.
 3 MR. BENJAMIN: Right. In a police -- a two-
 4 part test, the police --
 5 QUESTION: Their -- their right to gather and
 6 assemble. I -- that's sort of First Amendment stuff,
 7 isn't it?
 8 MR. BENJAMIN: I don't know that this Court
 9 reached it on that point. It -- the Court did reach
 10 overbreadth, but didn't decide on overbreadth because the
 11 statute -- see, the ordinance explicitly by its terms did
 12 not reach First Amendment freedoms or protected activity
 13 because you had to be doing something with no apparent
 14 purpose.
 15 QUESTION: 
 No, but the thing that the person 16 wanted to do was to -- was to gather with his buddies on
 17 the street corner. 
 18 MR. BENJAMIN: Under that ordinance, it wasn't
 19 illegal. That didn't violate the ordinance because that
 20 was an apparent --
 21 QUESTION: Yes, it did, and one of them was a
 22 gang member. 
 23 MR. BENJAMIN: It did not because if he wanted
 24 to do it for an apparent purpose of expressive activity,
 25 then it didn't violate, and so that was not a problem. 

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 In this case we have the extraordinary situation
 2 that a person must have government permission, police
 3 permission to walk a street, to use a sidewalk, and his
 4 right to do this depends entirely upon the completely
 5 unfettered discretion of the police and a government
 6 official. If someone wants to go onto that sidewalk and
 7 pass out literature, they must get permission. They must
 8 get Gloria Rogers' permission, and she can give that
 9 permission or deny that permission in accordance with
 10 whatever criteria she uses at any given moment.
 11 The First Amendment problems with this case are
 12 substantial and pervasive. The Virginia Supreme Court saw
 13 that and dealt with it while it was there, seeing nothing
 14 redeemable about this policy whatsoever. 
 15 QUESTION: 
 Thank you, Mr. Benjamin. 16 Mr. Hurd, your time is expiring even as we
 17 speak. 
 18 (Laughter.) 
 19 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So the case is
 20 submitted. 
 21 MR. HURD: Thank you, Your Honor. 
 22 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the
 23 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
