5 Mr. Clement.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

7 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES

8 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

9 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11 When the government acts to remove government-

12 imposed burdens on religious exercise, it does not violate

13 the Establishment Clause. Rather, as this Court put the

14 point in Zorach against Clauson, when the government eases

15 those kind of burdens, it follows the best of our

16 traditions.

17 The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized

18 Persons Act, or RLUIPA, eases government burdens on

19 restrictions by having institutions and prison officials

20 examine burdens on religious exercise and remove

21 unjustified, substantial burdens.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But, you know, when

23 you say it eases burdens, it doesn't just ease burdens

24 imposed by the Federal Government. It eases burdens

25 imposed by State governments.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Mr. Chief

2 Justice, but I think that -- that that doesn't make any

3 substantial difference, in part, I think because if you

4 think about certainly this application of RLUIPA, it's

5 Spending Clause legislation. And spending legislation

6 often takes the form of giving the States an incentive to

7 take action on their own. And in this sense, I think you

8 can understand this legislation as giving the States an

9 opportunity to remove their own burdens on religious

10 exercise. And that's precisely how it works in practice.

11 The relevant action that a State takes is State action in

12 removing its own burdens, not Federal action imposed on

13 the States.

14 And I think that's consistent with the analysis

15 of this Court in the Dole case where the Federal

16 Government, on the assumption of this Court, didn't have

17 the direct power under the 21st Amendment to raise the

18 drinking age, but it could give the option to the States

19 to exercise their power to do it. So I do think in the

20 end, the burdens that are removed here are attributable to

21 the State of Ohio, not to the Federal Government.

22 It is also true that the standard that's imposed

23 by RLUIPA is a more exacting standard than that imposed by

24 the Federal Constitution itself. But I don't think

25 providing for greater accommodation of religious exercise

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 than the Federal Constitution creates an Establishment

2 Clause problem.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But in -- in the City

4 of Boerne, didn't we say that Congress couldn't come in

5 and simply rewrite some part of the Constitution to make

6 it read differently than we had?

7 MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, but

8 I don't think this case poses the same problems as City of

9 Boerne. First of all, this really isn't an effort to

10 rewrite a rule of decision for all cases the way that RFRA

11 was. Congress in this legislation targeted two areas

12 where there were particular problems with respect to

13 religious exercise, and in those contexts, it addressed a

14 different standard.

15 Now, as I say, that standard is higher, but so

16 are the standards of over half of the States which also

17 apply a heightened scrutiny test either as a matter of

18 State constitutional law or State law.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, RFRA didn't involve a --

20 a limitation to situations in which Federal funds were

21 involved, and as I understand this statute does.

22 MR. CLEMENT: That is also true. I mean, there

23 -- there is -- to be sure there is --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: More than also. I -- that

25 seems to me the principal difference between this and

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 RFRA.

2 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I take your point, Justice

3 Scalia. I would -- I would clarify that there is the

4 potential for applications to the statute under the

5 Commerce Clause. We don't think that's really

6 appropriately presented here. We also think that with

7 respect to State prisons in all their applications, they

8 will be Spending Clause applications.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- what you're saying

10 is academic because the statute doesn't require a Federal

11 spending hook. It says it has the other commerce peg. I

12 take it you -- you gave a pragmatic answer to that, that

13 every State in fact gets Federal funds for their prison

14 systems.

15 MR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice Ginsburg,

16 and I think the fact that there may be more than one hook

17 for this legislation in certain applications shouldn't

18 make any constitutional difference. And I think here it

19 is Spending Clause legislation as it applies to the State

20 of Ohio. I think that's conceded. They -- they take

21 issue with whether it's valid.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Clement, it seems to

23 me the Spending Clause aspect cuts in the other direction,

24 if we're just focusing on the Establishment Clause. The

25 fact that Federal money is involved, why does that make

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 your burden any less in defending the -- the statute under

2 the Establishment Clause?

3 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I don't

4 think the fact that there's money involved makes it harder

5 or easier from a Spending Clause perspective. I think

6 from the perspective of why this case is different from

7 Boerne, the fact that it's Spending Clause and Commerce

8 Clause and not section 5 legislation makes a big

9 difference. But I certainly don't want to leave you with

10 the impression that there's anything constitutionally

11 problematic because there's Federal money involved

12 because, of course, this Court has upheld Federal Spending

13 Clause legislation in religion areas in cases like

14 Zobrest, Mergens, Agostini, Mitchell against Helms.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you -- do you think the

16 Establishment Clause issue in this case would be the same

17 as the Establishment Clause issue in City of Boerne if we

18 -- if the Court had reached the Establishment Clause issue

19 in that case?

20 MR. CLEMENT: No, I don't, Justice Stevens. Or

21 another way of answering that is I would say that even

22 though you thought there was an Establishment Clause

23 problem in the City of Boerne case, I don't think you need

24 to find one here. And part of that is because this is

25 more targeted legislation, and it particularly deals, as

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- as it comes to this Court in this application, with the

2 exercise of religion in prisons. And I think that's an

3 area like the military where the Government is necessarily

4 going to be involved with religion in a way that it

5 otherwise wouldn't be.

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And yet, it -- it provides an

7 unusual framework or incentive, if you will, in the prison

8 context to get religion. If you can find some religious

9 group that espouses drinking beer every day or other

10 alcoholic beverages or taking certain amounts of marijuana

11 or no telling what or having certain clothing or other

12 things that would alter the conditions of the prison

13 environment, there's a real incentive here to get

14 religion.

15 (Laughter.)

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And the --

17 MR. CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor --

18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Federal Government seems

19 to be trying to provide those incentives. Is that a

20 problem?

21 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't

22 think upon analysis it is, and I think there's a couple of

23 reasons why that's so.

24 First of all, this is not an absolute

25 entitlement to get your religious beer at 5:00 p.m. every

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 day. It is a balancing test, and I think things like

2 getting beer every day, getting marijuana inside prison

3 walls would not satisfy the test.

4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the -- the language of

5 the statute is pretty strong: unless the government

6 demonstrates that the imposition is the least restrictive

7 means and in furtherance of a compelling legislative

8 interest. It puts quite a burden on the State.

9 MR. CLEMENT: Well, it does, Justice O'Connor,

10 but just to take a step back, I mean, applying that same

11 standard in the Smith case, you yourself thought that a

12 general law banning marijuana use outside or -- or peyote

13 use outside --

14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, I think it was.

15 MR. CLEMENT: -- peyote outside of prison would

16 be justified even under that standard. I would think, a

17 fortiori, it would be justified within prison walls.

18 I want to make another point about the

19 incentives, though, which I think is important. Every

20 State in the Union provides some degree of accommodation

21 for religion, and in many States it's majoritarian

22 religions that are accommodated. Now, if there's going to

23 be some incentive to engage in religiosity in prison in

24 order to take advantage of things offered for religion

25 that aren't available for something else, at least RLUIPA

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 has the virtue of making sure that all religions are

2 accommodated neutrally. So if there's any incentive, it's

3 an incentive for religion over irreligion as opposed to

4 between sects -- sects of religions, and I think that's

5 the way you would have without RLUIPA involved.

6 The other point I want to make is although there

7 may be some extravagant claims of certain religions that

8 would seem quite enticing, much religious exercise in many

9 of the reported cases involve things that I don't think

10 people are necessarily lining up to do. I mean, there are

11 a number of lower court cases dealing with the

12 availability of kosher food, and in prison what that means

13 as a practical matter, is generally you are going to get

14 cold food rather than hot food. And I don't think --

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about garb that is said

16 to be associated with the religion but also is used as a

17 cue for gang membership? Let's say a beard. This

18 religion requires me to wear a beard.

19 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think --

20 and we cite a few cases in footnote 2 of our reply brief

21 that suggest that in dealing with legitimate concerns

22 about using prison -- religious symbols or other religious

23 items as a gang signifier or a gang identifier, that the

24 -- that there have been cases where the courts, even

25 applying the heightened standard or RLUIPA or RFRA, have

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 deferred to the government officials.

2 I also think, though, it's worth noting how the

3 Federal Government and the Bureau of Prisons has dealt

4 with the concern that religious medallions, as opposed to

5 beards, would be used for gang identification or gang

6 signification. Ohio, I take it, takes the position that

7 if you have a medallion that could be used for those

8 purposes, you can't have it within prison walls at all.

9 The Bureau of Prisons, by contrast, takes the position

10 that you can have the medallion, but you have to wear it

11 inside your shirt. So it can't be used for prison

12 signification purposes or gang identification purposes.

13 And I think that shows the kind of reasonable

14 accommodation that RLUIPA or RFRA, as it applies to the

15 Federal Bureau of Prisons --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what about a religion

17 that it's a genuine tenet of the religion that the races

18 are to be separated and the person says, the accommodation

19 I want is never to be celled with someone who is not of my

20 race?

21 MR. CLEMENT: I think in a case like that -- I

22 mean, obviously, this Court's recent decision in Johnson

23 would suggest that -- that the prison officials are in a

24 difficult position there and I think they could not accede

25 to that request. And I think complying with the Equal

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Protection Clause in that context would itself be a

2 compelling interest under the statute. And I think this

3 Court in Widmar against Vincent, for example, suggested

4 that avoiding Establishment Clause problems is a

5 sufficient compelling interest. I would think equally

6 avoiding the Equal Protection Clause violation in that

7 context would also be a compelling interest, and I don't

8 think there would be a least restrictive alternative. And

9 so I think that the statute -- there would be no statutory

10 violation in refusing that particular accommodation.

11 I think there -- these show that there are ways

12 to administer this statute in a way that's respectful of

13 the decisions of local prison officials but also does make

14 sure that they have a degree of sensitivity to these

15 claims for religious exercise.

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it -- does the statute

17 require the prison officials to evaluate the bona fides of

18 the particular religion that's espoused? Isn't one of the

19 groups here a Satanist group? So the religion -- the bona

20 fides of the group have to be reviewed by the prison

21 authorities.

22 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, no more so

23 than under the Free -- the Free Exercise Clause itself. I

24 mean -- and as this case, of course, comes to this Court,

25 the substantiality of the religious beliefs and that they

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 are actually held by these individuals has been stipulated

2 to.

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: We don't have to decide it

4 here, but it's looming. And when it goes back, if it

5 does, that will have to be resolved in this and in every

6 case.

7 MR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice O'Connor,

8 but that's true under the Free Exercise Clause as well.

9 So even the Sixth Circuit, that obviously had some

10 problems with the statute, understood that on that score

11 there's no more entanglement with religion under RLUIPA

12 than there is under the Free Exercise Clause itself.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Haven't we said in at

14 least one of our cases that the government can't favor

15 religion over irreligion?

16 MR. CLEMENT: That's right, Mr. Chief Justice,

17 but this Court has been clear in the context of

18 legislative accommodations of religion in particular to

19 make clear that that preference of religion over

20 irreligion doesn't mean that the government cannot provide

21 legislative accommodations of religion without providing

22 benefits for secular organizations as well. That was the

23 clear holding of this Court in Amos.

24 And I think that although this Court has

25 expressed concerns about religious accommodations when

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there's no guarantee that the religious accommodation will

2 be provided to other sects -- take, for example, the

3 Kiryas Joel case. This Court has been quite clear that

4 there is not a constitutional problem in favoring religion

5 over irreligion in providing legislative accommodations

6 for religion.

7 And as I said, in -- in Zorach against Clauson,

8 this Court noted that that's not just the absence of a

9 constitutional problem, but there's really a

10 constitutional virtue in the legislature acting to

11 accommodate religion. The Court made basically the same

12 point in Smith in saying that even though the Free

13 Exercise Clause did not require the special accommodation

14 or exemption for peyote, the legislatures could do so and

15 in doing so, they would be furthering constitutional

16 values.

17 If I could say a few words about the Spending

18 Clause claim that is brought by Ohio in this case. They

19 suggest that there's a difficulty with this legislation

20 under the Spending Clause. Now, the court below --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Is that before us on

22 the questions presented?

23 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it is not in the

24 questions presented themselves, I don't think, but I think

25 it would be fairly open to this Court to reach it because

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it would be an alternative ground to support the judgment

2 below. That said, this Court doesn't have to reach it and

3 its practice in recent cases has been when there's one

4 constitutional claim that is -- that the Court has ruled

5 on below, it doesn't necessarily reach the other -- the

6 other constitutional claims. The Court did that in cases

7 like Oakland Cannabis and the Pierce County case.

8 And we would urge the same course here because,

9 although the courts have divided on this Establishment

10 Clause issue, the courts have not divided on the Spending

11 Clause issue. All the courts that have reached it have

12 upheld it as valid Spending Clause legislation.

13 And I think that reflects the fact that there is

14 a clear nexus here between the Federal funds and the

15 Federal conditions that are being imposed. If the Federal

16 Government is going to provide money, over $1 million to

17 Ohio, to have prisoner meals, then certainly the Federal

18 Government can insist that kosher meals are among the

19 available options. And so too if the -- if the Federal

20 Government is going to provide monies for Ohio to build

21 prisons, they can ensure that those prisons are safe and

22 are operated consistent with Federal policy such that

23 there's not discrimination on the basis of race or

24 religion.

25 The last issue in the case, of course, is the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Commerce Clause issue, and on that issue, no court below

2 reached the issue. And we think this Court's recent

3 admonition in the Sabri case that facial challenges are

4 best when infrequent, applies with particular force here

5 because --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't understand,

7 Mr. Clement, how your second point strengthens your first

8 point. That is to say, if we disagree with your first

9 point, namely that the institutionalized persons

10 provisions are consistent with the Establishment Clause,

11 we think that they contradict the Establishment Clause,

12 they couldn't possibly be saved by your second point. Can

13 you require as a -- as a condition of -- under the

14 Spending Clause that a State violate the Establishment

15 Clause?

16 MR. CLEMENT: No, of course not, Justice Scalia,

17 and I must have misspoke. My point is they raise three

18 arguments that are all alternative arguments to support

19 the judgment below. My burden is to defeat all three of

20 them to show -- if the Court reaches them. So I have to

21 show that there's no Establishment Clause violation, which

22 we -- we've certainly made that argument in the brief and

23 here today, and that there's no Spending Clause violation,

24 and that there's no Commerce Clause violation.

25 The -- in this case the Commerce Clause claim

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 has a completely abstract quality, and indeed, the only

2 temptation to reach the issue at all would be that the --

3 since RLUIPA has a jurisdictional element, the resolution

4 of the Commerce Clause is so clear that it might be

5 tempting to reach it. But I think the better course would

6 be for this Court to allow that issue to be sorted out in

7 the --in the lower courts.

8 If there are no further questions, I would

9 reserve time for rebuttal.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.

11 Clement.

12 Mr. Goldberger, we'll hear from you.

13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID GOLDBERGER

14 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15 MR. GOLDBERGER: Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist,

16 and may it please the Court:

17 This case comes before the Court on a motion to

18 dismiss, and the facts, the underlying facts, involving

19 the motion to dismiss are in dispute, and it's a serious

20 dispute. And those should be reserved for -- for the

21 court below, in particular the claims that our clients'

22 religions are affiliated with gang activities, but there

23 are serious disputes about that. There is a Wicca

24 chaplain that's been hired by the Department of

25 Corrections in Wisconsin. Two of my former students, who

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 are upstanding members of the bar in every respect, are

2 Asatrus, so that these are matters that should be

3 preserved for the court below.

4 This Court has made -- asked many questions

5 about the accommodation of religion, and the suggestion

6 is, well, isn't there favoritism? Doesn't it encourage

7 favoritism one way or the other? But the answer to each

8 of those questions is the same with respect to the current

9 accommodations already provided by the Ohio Department of

10 Corrections with respect to mainstream religions, and in

11 fact, we believe on remand, we will be able to show that

12 there is a preference for accommodating mainstream

13 religions as opposed to non-mainstream religions.

14 Similarly, there has -- there are -- there have

15 been questions by this Court that -- that the standard

16 imposed on the State of Ohio by RLUIPA is this

17 particularly difficult or tortuous standard. In fact,

18 under State law in Humphrey v. Lane, which is cited in our

19 brief, the State of Ohio Supreme Court has already imposed

20 a similar standard with regard to the religious

21 accommodation claims of prison guards.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is Satanism a non-mainstream

23 religion?

24 MR. GOLDBERGER: With all due respect, Your

25 Honor, I understand that there is some uncomfortable

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 feeling about the nature of my clients' religion. As the

2 Court will note in a -- a footnote in our brief, it has

3 been reported in the press that there is an adherent in

4 the Royal Navy of Satanism, and the Royal Navy has agreed

5 that if he's killed in the line of duty that there will be

6 religious rights at the end consistent with his religion

7 and, in fact, it amounts to a recognition of his religion.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does this have to do with

9 it? The Royal Navy you say?

10 MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, I --

11 (Laughter.)

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Our Royal Navy?

13 (Laughter.)

14 MR. GOLDBERGER: The answer is yes then. It is

15 a non-mainstream religion.

16 And I think that it's important for us to assure

17 that religious groups of all stripes are -- are

18 accommodated in the -- in the context --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: To what extent? And I asked

20 the -- the racist -- the religion that says God wanted the

21 races to be separated and the accommodation is do not cell

22 me with someone of another race.

23 MR. GOLDBERGER: I believe that there is -- it

24 -- the statute is pretty clear that if there is a -- if

25 it's compelling or requiring the State of Ohio to engage

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in an unconstitutional activity -- and that would be a

2 segregation of the races -- that there's a compelling

3 justification -- or a compelling governmental interest in

4 not complying with the statute or saying that the statute

5 does not apply under these circumstances.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about racist literature

7 but it's under the aegis of a religious organization? And

8 that -- suppose the prison does not permit, say, a member

9 of the Aryan Nation to get that racist literature -- to

10 get racist literature but --

11 MR. GOLDBERGER: To the extent that there is

12 bona fide religious literature that is racist, there are

13 -- we believe that the Constitution permits Congress or

14 any legislative body to accommodate religion in isolation

15 from other religious right --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, when you --

17 MR. GOLDBERGER: -- fundamental rights.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: When you use the term

19 bona fide, you're introducing a new kind of factor. Do

20 courts evaluate the bona fides of someone claiming a

21 religion?

22 MR. GOLDBERGER: I believe they -- as a matter

23 of course, prison officials have to determine whether

24 there's a good faith request for religious accommodation

25 or whether the person is trying to seek something under --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 as a ruse.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it we've done that in

3 the conscientious objector cases, United States v. Seeger

4 and Gillette.

5 MR. GOLDBERGER: That's correct.

6 But to let me finish my -- my answer to Justice

7 Ginsburg, if -- if this Court is of the view -- or members

8 of this Court are of the view that it would be content

9 discrimination, for example, although we believe that you

10 can accommodate one fundamental right separately from the

11 other fundamental rights, then of course, if there were a

12 First Amendment violation, that too would be a compelling

13 governmental interest in justifying refusal to apply

14 RLUIPA. So that there is no serious problem here. And in

15 fact, there is no reported case that any racist literature

16 has ever been permitted in -- into the prisons that we've

17 been able to find.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the content

19 discrimination, I take it, would be raised by someone who

20 wants to get this for political or psychological

21 reasons --

22 MR. GOLDBERGER: That's --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you would say, I'm not

24 challenging the right of the -- as a member of this

25 religious sect. I just say, me too.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, as I say, to the extent

2 that that's right, if there were content discrimination

3 along those lines and -- and the Court said that there

4 could not be -- it was the Court's view that it could not

5 be accommodated for religion only, then of course the --

6 then there would be a compelling governmental interest in

7 avoiding content discrimination. In terms of whether or

8 not there's a compelling justification of dealing with

9 inflammatory literature, I don't think that's in dispute

10 in this case.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I take it

12 underlying Justice Ginsburg's question is -- is the

13 concern that this accommodation is unequal because there

14 are other First Amendment rights that are not given the --

15 that are not given the same precedence.

16 MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, first of all --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that was at least an

18 underlying concern of her question, and I think it's a

19 legitimate concern.

20 MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, as -- as I read Amos,

21 Amos says that the accommodation of religion need not

22 come --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but in Amos, the Court

24 was just -- the -- the government was just saying that one

25 of its own statutes could be accommodated. This is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 something different.

2 MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, it's not -- I'm not sure

3 that it's different for constitutional purposes, that if

4 there is a differential accommodation which the Court

5 concludes violates the First Amendment rights of someone

6 else because there's content discrimination, I'm not --

7 there is no reason to treat the source of the

8 accommodation as dispositive. It's whether -- it is the

9 presence of the accommodation and whether it's broad

10 enough or narrow enough.

11 On the other hand, the -- we -- we do want to

12 make clear that there are numerous accommodations that

13 involve First Amendment rights that do not overlap with --

14 with religious exercise or accommodation of religious

15 exercise. To the extent that there is political

16 gatherings, they're not entitled under the First Amendment

17 to the -- they're not accommodated in the same way that

18 religious congregations in prison are accommodated. And

19 this Court so far has found there to be no constitutional

20 violation for that distinction. And to the extent that

21 there's a compelling governmental interest, there is

22 little doubt that the -- that the prison officials can

23 simply say no. This -- we will not accommodate it. We're

24 not required to accommodate it under the statute.

25 The -- it is important to note, that the --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 these same accommodations are routinely granted to

2 mainstream religions and that they do not shift burdens to

3 third parties. There's been substantial argument that

4 there is a substantial shifting of burdens to third

5 parties. In fact, where third party claims have been made

6 by the State of Ohio was that basically that the cost of

7 security is increased because now it takes more -- or the

8 cost of prison administration is increased because it

9 takes more time to take care of these claims and requests

10 for accommodation than there would be if they didn't have

11 to attend to these --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm sorry. You've lost

13 me. I don't know what you mean about shifting burdens to

14 third parties. What --

15 MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, the argument is that

16 when, for example, a religious accommodation forces -- and

17 -- and -- the third parties to chip in, as they had to do

18 in Caldor, for example, private third parties, that that

19 renders the accommodation unconstitutional. And the State

20 has been arguing that the lifting of burdens on the

21 religious exercise of our clients makes it harder for

22 their prison guards --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.

24 Goldberger.

25 Mr. Cole, we'll hear from you.

1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

2 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3 MR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

4 the Court:

5 In prison's unique environment, RLUIPA violates

6 the Constitution. It directly and impermissibly advances

7 religion and it would have to be -- have to be --

8 perceived by objective observers as endorsement.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this -- this

10 question because it -- it -- I think it goes to the -- the

11 heart of what I think is the problem in this case. If we

12 are going to recognize a sphere of accommodation, which we

13 have done previously, I think we have to recognize that

14 the -- that the object of accommodating and the effect of

15 accommodating is, in one sense, to benefit -- I mean, in

16 an obvious sense, is to benefit religion. By recognizing

17 a sphere of accommodation, in effect, I think the Court

18 has said there is a sphere in which religion can be

19 benefitted that does not rise necessarily to the level of

20 government proselytization or -- or government

21 endorsement. And it seems to me that the argument that

22 you're making is that if the government endorses at all,

23 it's immediately in -- in the -- the realm of

24 establishment. Am I -- am I missing something in your

25 argument?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. COLE: Well, I think you are, Your Honor,

2 and if our brief came across that way, I -- I think it

3 overstates the line that we're asking this Court to draw.

4 The Court has recognized, in talking about accommodations,

5 that of course accommodations by their very nature benefit

6 religion. That's part of an accommodation and could be

7 said to have the effect. But the Court has said then we

8 must draw lines. That is, the Court has recognized that

9 you can't just say, oh, it's an accommodation which means

10 that's fine, it's always going to be fine if it's an

11 accommodation. In fact, Justice O'Connor said we need to

12 draw lines because otherwise everything will just become,

13 oh, that's an accommodation.

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. And -- and why is

15 the line violated here?

16 MR. COLE: The line is violated here, Your

17 Honor, because of the unique incentives and burdens that

18 arise in the prison context.

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what the statute

20 appears to be doing is to try to go back to the pre-

21 Employment Division v. Smith case standard under the Free

22 Exercise Clause, which did allow for accommodation of

23 religion. And that appears to be what this statute is

24 designed to do.

25 MR. COLE: But in -- in prison's unique

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 environment, Your Honor, where there are so many

2 deprivations of liberty and then to say the one -- one way

3 you can get out from under the thumb of all these prison

4 regulations is to claim religion, and that's going to give

5 you a powerful weapon not again to --

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But -- but before Employment

7 Division v. Smith, wouldn't we have had the same question

8 arise in the prison context, and we would have dealt with

9 it under the then-standards.

10 MR. COLE: But -- but the Court has -- has

11 always articulated that the rules -- well, in Turner and

12 O'Lone, the Court articulated that the rules are different

13 in prison, citing to the intractable problems of prison

14 administration and the -- and the problems of

15 subjecting --

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But had the Court ever said

17 that the Free Exercise Clause couldn't be applied in the

18 prison context?

19 MR. COLE: No, Your Honor. Going -- going back

20 to the Beto case, the Court said free exercise applies in

21 prison, but in O'Lone, the Court said it applies in prison

22 but the standard what we're going to use is one that's

23 very similar to -- to rational basis.

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Then I think you're

25 saying that in order to exceed what free exercise requires

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in a prison necessarily forces you into establishment.

2 And I think you're saying the reason it does so is that

3 there are so many incentives on the part of prisoners to

4 claim religion, that that's the only way you can sort of

5 keep the genie in the bottle. Isn't that the -- the

6 essence of your argument?

7 MR. COLE: We're not asking for that bright line

8 rule, Your Honor. It could well be the case that

9 providing kosher meals, for instance, whether that's

10 required by the Free Exercise Clause or not, it might go

11 marginally beyond what free exercise requires. That's an

12 accommodation that would be perfectly legitimate. But to

13 have a rule that says anytime you bring any request of any

14 kind for an accommodation from any rule, it's going to be

15 treated differently and better because it's religion --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- but -- but that is

17 not what the rule says. Number one, as -- as your brother

18 on the other side pointed out, there's got to be some

19 determination made as a threshold matter as to whether

20 this is even a religious claim or -- or whether it's just

21 gaming the system. So there's nothing automatic.

22 Number two, if there are, as -- as there

23 frequently will be, in the prison context important

24 governmental interests which can only be served by denying

25 the -- the request, the request can be denied. And it

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 seems to me that if these are not sufficient recognitions

2 of the -- of the prison context, then I don't know what

3 kind of a rule we can have that would satisfy you except

4 to say if it isn't absolutely required by free exercise,

5 it is establishment.

6 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I don't think we

7 need to go that far. I -- I think we could look at given

8 types of accommodations and say if a legislative

9 determination is made that this type of accommodation with

10 respect to this type of request is appropriate, based on a

11 balancing of all the factors to consider in that

12 particular case --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you --

14 MR. COLE: -- that might not slide --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: You mean specific

16 accommodations like you can have kosher foods, you can

17 wear a religious medal, you can have a tattoo? I mean,

18 you're -- you're asking the legislature to be that

19 specific.

20 MR. COLE: Well, a narrow, targeted -- I guess

21 the point is, Your Honor, a narrow, targeted accommodation

22 would be different in our view than this broad, wonder bus

23 approach to accommodation.

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it would also be rather a

25 discriminatory one, wouldn't it? I mean, one -- one point

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that we have got to be concerned about, whether we're

2 dealing with accommodation or whether we're dealing with

3 -- with flat-out establishment, is distinction among

4 religions. And I think you're saying if they do

5 distinguish among religions, we don't have this problem,

6 but I think that lands you from the frying pan into the

7 fire.

8 MR. COLE: No, Your Honor, I -- I don't believe

9 so because I think if, for instance, the legislature said,

10 you -- you shall, absent some compelling need, provide

11 prisoners with a diet that meets their religious

12 requirements, that would not discriminate among religions.

13 It would be narrowly tailored to some perceived problem

14 that might exist.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: A guy comes along in a

16 different religion and says, we're omnivorous, but we got

17 to -- we got to wear medals. No statute that says medals

18 are okay. It -- it -- you know, I realize the level of

19 generality in your example is higher. The -- the

20 discrimination is not quite so blatant, but it's a pretty

21 tough job to come up with -- would be a tough job to come

22 up with statutes without picking and choosing among

23 religious demands.

24 MR. COLE: And, Your Honor, we believe that in

25 prison's unique environment, to the extent you go beyond

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the Free Exercise Clause, it raises special problems and

2 special concerns that need to be dealt with --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why can't they --

4 MR. COLE: -- on a case by case basis.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: But why can't they be dealt

6 with under the statute as it is written, saying that if

7 you -- if it is a bona fide request, and you, the prison,

8 determine that in fact you -- you have a compelling State

9 interest that cannot be served in any other way, you can

10 say no? Why is that insufficient and -- and why does that

11 -- why is that, therefore, the reason that -- that jumps

12 us into an Establishment Clause violation every time?

13 MR. COLE: It's insufficient, Your Honor,

14 because it doesn't change the underlying fact that the

15 request itself, whatever the ultimate outcome on the

16 request is, the request itself gets treated differently

17 and better merely because it's religious. This is a --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you saying that --

19 that a statute is unconstitutional to recognize a

20 prisoner's right to free exercise unless it also has a --

21 a kind of a litany of sections recognizing speech rights,

22 recognizing privacy rights, et cetera?

23 MR. COLE: No, Your Honor. I'm -- I'm not

24 suggesting that.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then it's got to single out

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 religion.

2 MR. COLE: And -- and as the Court noted in

3 Amos, these type of statutes are necessarily going to

4 single out religion, but that doesn't shield them from

5 Establishment Clause scrutiny just because they take the

6 form of being directed at religion and providing a benefit

7 that's -- that's labeled as an accommodation.

8 I mean, for instance, Congress could say, look,

9 we think it's difficult for State prisoners to practice

10 their religious beliefs when they can't go to church. So

11 absent some compelling State interest and least

12 restrictive alternatives, the prisons need to arrange to

13 release prisoners once a week to go to the church or

14 synagogue of their choice. Well, that would provide an

15 awfully powerful incentive inside prison walls for

16 prisoners to -- to claim religion.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure it woul --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: So maybe that's --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if you did it under the

20 statute, you would clearly have a reason for saying no.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cole, are you sure that

22 this statute doesn't go beyond pre-Smith -- our pre-Smith

23 law? I'm not aware that our pre-Smith law would have

24 defined religious exercise as broadly as this statute

25 defines it. I guess this is something Mr. Clement ought

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to speak to as well. It says, the term religious exercise

2 includes any exercise of religion whether or not compelled

3 by or central to a system of religious belief.

4 MR. COLE: Thank you, Your Honor. That is --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did our prior Smith cases go

6 that far? I'm not aware that --

7 MR. COLE: No, they did not, Your Honor, and I

8 think that's an important as well, that once someone has

9 an -- a bona fide religion and -- and prison officials can

10 challenge whether this is in fact a religious set of

11 beliefs. But if they have a religious set of beliefs and

12 if they are sincere, then you can't challenge this

13 particular request as not being mandated by the religion.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't even have to say my

15 -- my religion requires me not to eat this food. They

16 just say, you know, I'm --

17 MR. COLE: For religious reasons, I would prefer

18 to do this.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: What is your argument in

21 response to Justice Souter? You said it is not the

22 following. It is not that the State has to list, along

23 with these religious matters, the Second Amendment, the

24 First Amendment, et cetera. It's not that. You then seem

25 to say that the argument is that a person who files a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 piece of paper and claims to be religious, that they have

2 to consider it, and it's impelled only by religion. I

3 suppose the same thing is true of a church that applies

4 for a tax exemption. So I don't think that you could say

5 that automatically that fact that they're going to give

6 the church a tax exemption or that they're going to give

7 the religious person some special consideration, that that

8 in and of itself violates the Establishment Clause. Very

9 well. What does?

10 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I wish I could draw

11 a brighter line rule --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: No. But I just need to know

13 where you're going --

14 MR. COLE: Your Honor --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: -- generally. I don't need a

16 bright line rule. I'm just trying to find out what it is

17 about this that violates the clause if it isn't the first

18 thing or the second thing that I mentioned.

19 MR. COLE: It's the magnitude by which Congress

20 has enhanced the religious right. That is, we compare

21 what the Constitution requires State prison officials to

22 do and we say, how far has Congress moved the ball.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Now, in respect to that,

24 we have two points. One was Justice O'Connor's I think,

25 which is that Congress is not enlarging it, but for my

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 second qualification, beyond what it would have been if

2 Smith had never been decided. And the second is Justice

3 Scalia's point, which is but there is one respect in which

4 Congress did enlarge it, namely, that the right doesn't

5 have -- the belief doesn't have to be central. It could

6 be -- well, he just read that.

7 So is your whole argument then pinned on that

8 latter point? And if it is not, again, what is it?

9 MR. COLE: Well, our argument is pinned on this

10 Court's decisions in Turner and O'Lone, which we see as

11 establishing the baseline for what type -- for what the

12 Constitution requires in terms of free exercise in prison,

13 and then we use that baseline and compare the standard

14 imposed there to the standard Congress is seeking to

15 impose through RLUIPA and compare the magnitude of the

16 two, understanding, as this Court has said in Lemon, that

17 lines of demarcation are difficult to perceive. It's

18 difficult to say exactly where that line should be.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying if Turner had

20 come up prior to Smith, the Court would have said that

21 Turner trumps pre-Smith law, and you don't have to follow

22 pre-Smith law in the prison.

23 MR. COLE: I -- I believe so, Your Honor, given

24 prison's unique environment.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. COLE: I believe Turner and O'Lone are

2 prison cases that talk about what the Constitution means

3 in prison, understanding that in prison there need to be

4 changes to what we would otherwise see as the inmates'

5 constitutional rights if they were not in prison.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I -- I understand the

7 argument now, which has been helpful. Very well.

8 From the prison's point of view, why is it so

9 burdensome since you would have thought security is a

10 compelling interest, prison administration is a compelling

11 interest, so that really all we have to do is think about

12 this and look to see whether there isn't some reasonable

13 way of accommodating the request?

14 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I think that the

15 burdens in the prison environment are twofold. First,

16 RLUIPA forces prison officials to change the balance they

17 would otherwise strike between safety and accommodation,

18 and by changing that balance, changing the margin of

19 safety, if you will, they're now imposing risks on the

20 other inmates that are in prison. And these aren't

21 merely --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think you may

23 exaggerate what it takes to establish a compelling State

24 interest. I mean, we -- this -- this Court held in the --

25 in the pre-Smith days that it was a compelling State

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 interest to -- to prevent members of the Air Force from

2 wearing yarmulkes. I mean, if that's a compelling State

3 interest, I think it's pretty easy to get most anything

4 declared a -- a compelling State interest under this

5 statute, don't you think?

6 MR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor. And compelling

7 State interest doesn't present a problem to the State of

8 Ohio or to the other States that are operating under this

9 statute. What it -- what presents the problem is the

10 least restrictive alternative part of that which subjects

11 State prison officials in their day-to-day judgments

12 regarding prison operations to a strict scrutiny analysis

13 on the back end.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that goes beyond pre-Smith

15 too, doesn't it? Least restrictive alternative.

16 MR. COLE: The -- the least restrictive

17 alternative, which is what puts the teeth in RLUIPA and

18 what's -- what creates the problem --

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: We now have some experience

20 in the Federal system where the same standards apply under

21 RFRA. And you are positing this terrible disturbance of

22 prison administration in the -- what is it -- 6 years that

23 -- that RFRA has been in force for Federal prisons. Have

24 there been -- has there been this terrible disruption?

25 Have there been -- have the accommodations required so

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 much of the prison administrators?

2 MR. COLE: Well, the United States claims no,

3 Your Honor, of course. But when we look back at the

4 experience of the States with RFRA, before it was declared

5 unconstitutional, we presented substantial evidence in the

6 -- in the joint appendix with regard to the way in which

7 there was an explosion of demands for accommodations by

8 prisoners from previously unheard of religions. There was

9 an expansion -- an explosion of claims of conversion

10 within --

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but now that some of

12 that has gotten sorted out through the experience of the

13 Bureau of Prisons on the Federal side, one would expect

14 there would be less of those far-out claims. The -- you

15 would expect when a statute is new, that there might be

16 some claims that we would recognize as frivolous after

17 there's been experience under it.

18 MR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor, but the

19 difficulty that doesn't seem to go away with the least

20 restrictive alternative test is -- is the possibility, as

21 this Court noted in Turner, that every judgment every day

22 is subject to some court somewhere finding that there was

23 a less restrictive way of achieving the goal. And -- and

24 we see that --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: This is true. Now there you're

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in the dilemma. I mean, you're putting yourself there in

2 the same position that virtually every official is in in

3 the United States but for judges who have -- who have to

4 worry about the court of appeals. But anyway, the --

5 the --

6 (Laughter.)

7 JUSTICE BREYER: You see -- now, the answer to

8 that argument in your case, you're in a vice. They put

9 you in a -- in a kind of pincers because where you have a

10 good argument, they say, well, that doesn't violate the

11 statute, and where your claim is weak, they say, well, it

12 shouldn't be a -- it should violate the statute. And the

13 difficulty with being in pincers like that is you can't

14 win. And the virtue of it is you shouldn't win. All

15 right. So -- so how do you get out of this -- of the --

16 of that kind of an argument?

17 MR. COLE: Well, that's not particularly

18 encouraging, Your Honor, but --

19 (Laughter.)

20 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but -- your point.

21 MR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor. And -- and I guess

22 all I can do is go back and compare the accommodation if

23 that's what this is that's at issue here with that that

24 was at issue in Amos to say these employers don't need to

25 comply with this one Federal statute and this one set of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 obligations. And I asked, well, okay, so an employer. Is

2 that going to make IBM switch from being a computer

3 manufacturer to being a religious services provider

4 because, boy, if we do that, we can get out from

5 underneath title VII's nondiscrimination mandate? I don't

6 think so.

7 But if I look in prison and I say, what is going

8 to be the effect on the ground with respect to people

9 claiming religion or converting to religion if I tell them

10 there's going to be a different regulatory regime that

11 applies to you --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why hasn't that been the

13 effect on the Federal ground.

14 MR. COLE: Your Honor, I -- I don't know that it

15 hasn't. I mean, I'm -- I'm surprised in a sense to hear

16 that claim because in brief period in which RFRA did apply

17 to State prisons, there was an explosion of these demands.

18 And -- and I would direct the Court to, I believe it's,

19 204, 210, 211, and 212 in the joint appendix to see some

20 of the ways in which there's been this impact. I'd

21 also --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'll -- I'll grant you that,

23 but it seems to -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg responded to

24 that by saying that these things get sorted out. At the

25 beginning you get all sorts of loony claims. As time goes

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 by, you get fewer of them. And -- and if -- if they

2 weren't getting few of them, I would have expected the

3 United States to make a different representation.

4 MR. COLE: Your Honor, I don't know that the

5 fact that -- that strict scrutiny might become -- what

6 that means, what that's going to require. And arguably,

7 this is a slightly different strict scrutiny than other

8 strict scrutinies because of some of the legislative

9 history, to the extent one -- one wants to look at that.

10 And -- and that's, I guess, the problem. As we

11 flesh that out, during that entire time, we're saying it's

12 all right to burden other inmates in prisons. It's all

13 right to burden prison officials. It's all right for

14 Congress not to burden Federal prison officials, but for

15 Congress to burden State prison officials with this new

16 set of obligations.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I don't know what that's

18 got to -- you know, you may or may not have an argument

19 there, but I don't know what it's got to do with the

20 meaning of the Establishment Clause.

21 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, the --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: And they're not burdening you

23 anyway -- anyway. Just don't take the money.

24 MR. COLE: Well --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It comes with the money.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. COLE: I'm --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want the burden?

3 Don't take the money. I mean, they -- they do that all

4 the time.

5 MR. COLE: I'm not sure I agree with that, Your

6 Honor, for -- for a couple of reasons. First, this also

7 purports to be Commerce Clause legislation, in which case

8 it would be a mandate upon the States whether --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: What we have before us in this

10 case is -- is a case covered by the -- the Spending

11 Clause. So we don't have to grapple with the Commerce

12 Clause for now.

13 MR. COLE: But -- but secondly, Your Honor, with

14 respect to the Spending Clause issue, this Court has said

15 in Dole that there needs to be relatedness between the

16 spending, that if there's going to be strings attached,

17 they actually have to be attached to the Federal money in

18 some meaningful way. And here, Congress is relying on

19 spending, most of which has absolutely nothing to do --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But the Sixth Circuit

21 didn't pass on the Spending -- Spending Clause issue.

22 MR. COLE: No, they did not, Your Honor, but

23 we --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: And it isn't raised by

25 your opponent's petition.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. COLE: That's -- that's true, Your Honor,

2 but it is available to the Court as an alternate ground of

3 affirmance of -- of the decision below.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes, if we're looking

5 for that.

6 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was one question

8 brought up about Ohio's own practice. But you -- you say

9 we have no obligation to relieve burdens. If we did, we

10 would violate the Establishment Clause. The point was

11 made that Ohio pays for chaplains, but it doesn't pay for,

12 say, psychologists to come in for agnostics. So aren't

13 you right there violating the Establishment Clause on your

14 own theory?

15 MR. COLE: I don't believe so, Your Honor,

16 because our theory isn't that anytime you go beyond what

17 free exercise requires, you're immediately into an

18 Establishment Clause violation. We recognize that there

19 is a play in the joints. And providing chaplains, given

20 the -- the rich history and tradition of doing so in

21 prisons, seems to fall very comfortably within that play

22 in the joints.

23 The question is when have we gone too far. When

24 has our accommodation slid over, as the dissent put it in

25 Texas Monthly, into a -- or an impermissible incentive to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 practice religion?

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Mr.

3 Cole? I am troubled also, as you point out, about the

4 least restrictive language in the statute. But as I try

5 and apply it to this particular case, weren't most of the

6 allegations that the petitioners made is that they were

7 treated differently from other mainstream religions and

8 that the accommodation would have been, well, treat them

9 the same, which would have been the least restrictive

10 alternative? It wouldn't have created all the problems

11 you describe. And they say they don't -- can't have group

12 meetings. They -- if they were treated exactly the same,

13 would that -- that would satisfy the least restrictive

14 alternative part of the statute, wouldn't it? And why

15 would that be such a burden?

16 MR. COLE: Your Honor, first, I'm not sure that

17 their claim is that, oh, we're being treated differently

18 and worse. Their claim was we want to get together for

19 congregate religious services or, in Mr. Hampton's case --

20 he was a Wicca -- he wanted certain objects, including a

21 quartz crystal that he would be able to keep in his cell.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Don't mainstream religion

23 adherents have certain objects they'd like to keep in

24 their cell?

25 MR. COLE: They -- they may well, Your Honor,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and -- and the point is in each of those cases, prison

2 officials look at the object and say what's the potential

3 for harm here. Should we let them have it in their cell?

4 There's a -- there's a practice in Ohio prisons of --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: The mainstream person, if

6 there's a potential for harm, they wouldn't let them keep

7 it in the -- in the cell, would they?

8 MR. COLE: That's right, Your Honor.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: And in other words, is it

10 really -- although the language in the statute seems to go

11 farther, is there anything really at stake here beyond

12 saying treat us the same as you treat mainstream --

13 members of mainstream religions?

14 MR. COLE: Absolutely, Your Honor. Absolutely.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: And what is the best example

16 of that?

17 MR. COLE: There's a -- a request for a prisoner

18 who wants the grooming regulations changed with respect to

19 him. He's a prisoner who's got a history of contraband

20 violations. He's involved in a -- in a prison betting

21 pool and carries -- tries to carry betting slips and

22 secret them on his person. And so if he could violate the

23 grooming regulations, the concern is he might use that to

24 hide contraband. There are prisoners that want to wear

25 their hair in a certain way to signify gang affiliation,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and instead, they claim, well, I need this for religious

2 purposes, but what's really going on is they want to

3 signify gang affiliation.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you want us to say that --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me that would

6 be a compelling interest to say you can't do that.

7 MR. COLE: Your Honor, again, I'm -- I'm sure

8 there's a compelling interest. The question is the least

9 restrictive alternative. Are we going to be able to meet

10 every Federal judges' view of is this the least

11 restrictive way we could go about achieving this

12 compelling interest? There's no doubt that prison

13 security is going to be recognized as a compelling State

14 interest, but the difficulty is the least restrictive

15 alternative test.

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I suppose you're

17 saying you want us to make the holding that -- one of the

18 holdings you'd be satisfied with is that while some

19 accommodation is -- is appropriate, this is extreme

20 accommodation. What's your best case for that?

21 I -- I just can't remember a case in which we've

22 tried to ask whether every form a request for

23 accommodation has to be acknowledged. Is -- is this the

24 only case that you've come across?

25 MR. COLE: Frankly, Your Honor, other than RFRA,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it's the only time Congress has gone this far. And so to

2 say that there's a lack of case law on this is more to

3 suggest that there's been settled understandings that we

4 can't go this far rather than --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess what I'm asking

6 is what's the closest analogy you can --

7 MR. COLE: In our brief we -- we looked at Lee

8 v. Weisman in what the Court called subtle and indirect

9 coercion to religion when it was merely standing for a --

10 a invocation during graduation once a year. And we

11 contrast that with what's going on here and the constant

12 pressure day after day, if you want this set of benefits,

13 get religion.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: What about the American Indian

15 who didn't -- or was it -- I think it was an American

16 Indian. But -- who didn't want to be known -- it was a

17 woman and she didn't want to known as a number. She

18 wanted a name. That was a religious basis. And Social

19 Security -- I think the Court hold -- didn't have to give

20 her that.

21 MR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: So that to me stood for the

23 proposition that administrative considerations play an

24 important role in deciding whether you've hit upon the

25 least restrictive alternative. And as long as that was

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the law, then you're okay. And that was a Supreme Court

2 case I think. I may be misremembering.

3 MR. COLE: Again, Your Honor, it's not that we

4 couldn't potentially win these cases under least

5 restrictive alternative. The question is by changing the

6 standard to that, changing the standard to one in which

7 these prison officials -- I mean, Congress is, in a sense,

8 asking Federal judges to sit as overseers of religious

9 life in the prisons across the 50 States. And given what

10 this Court said in Turner, given what this Court said in

11 O'Lone about the intractable problems that prison

12 officials face, it just seems an inappropriate task and

13 one that, if motivated with the desire of increasing

14 religiosity in prison, seems to cross the Establishment --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're asking us --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is it -- why is it worse

17 for -- for judges to be overseers of religious life in

18 prison than it is for wardens to be overseers of religious

19 life in prison? I mean, somebody has to say what the

20 lines are, what will -- what will be accommodated and what

21 won't.

22 MR. COLE: Right, and it's --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that someone is going to be

24 a government official. I have no reason to believe that

25 wardens are -- are better at it than judges except with

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 respect to, you know, security and administrative

2 convenience, which we will honor under this statute.

3 MR. COLE: Except, Your Honor, this Court noted

4 in Turner, I believe it was, that the need for judicial

5 deference is particularly strong when you're dealing with

6 situations that create ripple effects in prison. And it's

7 difficult for Federal judges to know. They don't have

8 prison management experience. They don't have 20 years on

9 the ground like most prison wardens do to say this -- this

10 accommodation will work and this one won't.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I think that means that

12 they will give great deference to what the -- what the

13 wardens of the prisons say is a compelling interest of --

14 of the penal system.

15 MR. COLE: If they will, it's not in the face of

16 the statute, Your Honor. I mean, it's not in the face of

17 the statute. It says compelling State interest and least

18 restrictive alternative.

19 I would just like to note --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you -- can you give me an

21 example? Because most of the things I think of is either

22 you can have kosher food or you cannot. Either you can

23 wear a yarmulke or you're not. There's not other --

24 another alternative. Most of these things are yes and no.

25 What is the case where, well, you can't have this but

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 we'll give you something lesser?

2 MR. COLE: Well, I believe Mr. Clement noted

3 that -- that there was a case that held that, okay, you

4 can't wear the medallion on the outside of your shirt, you

5 can wear it on the inside of your shirt. So that would be

6 a less restrictive alternative for not allowing you to use

7 the medallion, I guess, as a gang identifier. Now, it

8 doesn't really deal with the problem that as soon as the

9 guard is not looking, again it can be pulled outside the

10 shirt and can be used as a gang identifier.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe if the warden

12 says that, the court would say, fine, you don't have to

13 accommodate.

14 MR. COLE: Maybe, Your Honor, but -- but the

15 question is, is it permissible for Congress to create

16 incentives for prisoners to say, yes, I'm religious

17 because I want these other benefits? Can Congress really

18 say, boy, we'd like you to be religious, and the way we're

19 going to provide that incentive is by giving you a better

20 shot at getting out from the rules in prison? It's not a

21 guaranteed shot from getting out, but it's a better shot

22 at getting out from the rules that apply to everybody else

23 in prison and to get that, you have to become religious.

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Better shot than -- better shot

25 than what? Better shot than the -- than the Free Exercise

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Clause alone would allow?

2 MR. COLE: Better shot than --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: And aren't you arguing that in

4 the prison context, once you get beyond the free exercise

5 line, you are into establishment?

6 MR. COLE: Well, and Your Honor, I was not

7 careful there. I should say much better shot. I mean,

8 again, it's this point that --

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But how do we administer

10 it? How does anyone administer that -- that kind of a

11 test?

12 MR. COLE: I --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: It can -- it can be better but

14 not much better?

15 MR. COLE: I think by comparing to what's gone

16 before. In fact, the Court has adopted a version of that

17 approach already. In Caldor, the Court said if it's

18 unqualified and imposes a burden on others, that's going

19 to violate the Establishment Clause.

20 I see my time is up, Your Honor.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: It is. Thank you, Mr.

22 Cole.

23 MR. COLE: Thank you.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Clement, you have

25 4 minutes remaining.

1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

2 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES

3 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

4 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

5 Just a few points in rebuttal.

6 First of all, I'd like to note the anomaly that

7 much of the argument of General Cole would be an argument

8 for why the State constitutional provision that gives

9 higher protection for freedom of conscience in Ohio is

10 itself unconstitutional.

11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why don't you address the

12 ways in which this act goes beyond our former free

13 exercise --

14 MR. CLEMENT: I'd be happy to do that, Justice

15 O'Connor. I think that there's been an exaggeration of

16 how far it goes beyond. Now, I want to be clear about one

17 thing, which is this Court, even before Smith and O'Lone,

18 said that there was going to be deference to prison

19 officials and a Turner standard would apply. So to the

20 extent that there's a little less deference here than

21 under the O'Lone standard, that is a modification.

22 The centrality requirement, though, is not

23 something that can be charged to RLUIPA or to RFRA because

24 even before the Smith case, this Court in Ling and

25 Hernandez was moving away from centrality and --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Also not compelled -- not

2 compelled -- by religion. You just say, you know, I -- I

3 want to give up everything except candy for Lent, and the

4 -- the prison has to accommodate you. Right?

5 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not compelled. I -- you

7 know, I could do something else. But I had thought that

8 our prior religion cases did -- did, indeed, require some

9 religious compulsion than just I -- you know, I'd like to

10 do this as a religious matter.

11 MR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, I don't think this

12 Court has ever in its accommodations cases held that the

13 government can only accommodate those things that are

14 central. I don't know for sure, but I rather doubt that

15 employing co-religionists in a gymnasium is central to the

16 practice of any faith. Yet, in Amos, this Court upheld

17 that as a valid accommodation.

18 And I do think the centrality requirement --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- the LDS.

20 MR. CLEMENT: What's that?

21 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I said you may

22 underestimate the LDS.

23 (Laughter.)

24 MR. CLEMENT: I may, Mr. Chief Justice. But

25 again -- but -- but to the extent I do, I think those are

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 questions that are best to be kept out of the courts,

2 which is why even before Smith this Court moved away from

3 centrality. It's why even Justice O'Connor, who otherwise

4 was in disagreement in Smith, also agreed that we should

5 get rid of the centrality requirement.

6 And if you look at some of the cases that are

7 actually decided under RLUIPA, the cases involve things

8 like Muslim prayer oil and they -- the cases -- the

9 Seventh Circuit, for example, allows it. Now, we don't

10 want the courts getting into --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess you're right. I think

12 I was thinking of free exercise cases rather than

13 establishment cases.

14 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I -- I think that's right,

15 and I think there is not that centrality requirement for

16 accommodations.

17 I do want to make the point, though, that --

18 that Ohio already, under its State constitution, has this

19 heightened review with a lot of these, you know, least

20 restrictive alternative tests and the like. Nobody thinks

21 Ohio's constitution violates the Federal Constitution.

22 That's true even though Ohio applies it in the prison

23 context, at least when it's a claim by a guard rather than

24 an inmate. That -- those are the facts of Humphrey

25 against Lane.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 It's also true that many of Ohio's arguments

2 would suggest their own accommodations of some religions

3 would give too much of an incentive for religious exercise

4 and the like. And I think that's a defect as well.

5 I don't think -- and I agree with Justice Souter

6 in this regard -- that narrower accommodations actually

7 raise more constitutional problems than broader

8 accommodations. I think that this Court, for example, in

9 Caldor dealt with an accommodation that was at a fairly

10 high level of generality, but yet this Court said and

11 Justice O'Connor emphasized in her concurrence, well,

12 that's a preference for Sabbatarian religions. And I

13 think you avoid that with this kind of across-the-board

14 test.

15 Justice Kennedy, you made a point about whether

16 this is extreme in the degree that it accommodates

17 religion, but it's certainly no more extreme than the --

18 than the laws and constitutions of 26 States, which across

19 the board apply this heightened scrutiny to all manner of

20 State actions. So in that sense, the fact that it

21 accommodates religion kind of wholesale with a broader

22 standard, as opposed to retail, I don't think is a

23 constitutional defect.

24 The last point I wanted to make is on the racist

25 literature hypothetical, and I think it is in large

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 measure just a hypothetical. As footnote 2 in our brief

2 points out, prisons have been generally successful in

3 keeping racist literature out even when it's supported as

4 a claim for religious-based racist literature. The only

5 cases that I've come across where that hasn't prevailed is

6 when the -- the prison's own policy had exceptions in it

7 that made very little sense.

8 And in this case, for example, if you look at

9 joint appendix page 118, there's an allegation that with

10 -- with one piece of literature that was described as

11 racist, that some prisoners were allowed to have it while

12 others were not allowed to have that same kind of

13 literature. Now, I don't know whether those claims are in

14 fact true, but that's the kind of claim that should be

15 able to go forward in a case like this.

16 With all respect, I think the Sixth Circuit here

17 made a mistake, ignored this Court's precedents, and

18 should be reversed.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.

20 Clement.

21 The case is submitted.

22 (Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the

23 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
