3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 next this morning in Case 09-996, Walker v. Martin.

5 Mr. Marshall.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD MARSHALL

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8 MR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 Charles Martin never adequately explained

11 why he waited more than 5 years to present additional

12 claims to the California Supreme Court. As such, it was

13 no surprise that these claims were rejected as untimely.

14 California employs a habeas corpus timeliness rule that

15 merely requires reasonable diligence and disclosure.

16 The rule is adequate under this Court's longstanding

17 precedents, and the Ninth Circuit's decision to the

18 contrary should be reversed.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about the

20 charge that, yes, we can agree with you that in general

21 5 years seems like a long time, but we have a brief from

22 the Habeas Corpus Resource Center that says that in the

23 5- to 6-year delay category, 62 percent are dismissed on

24 the merits, and that you can't tell; sometimes they do

25 it on the merits, sometimes they do it as time-barred,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and there's no rationale to when they do one or the

4

2 other.

3 MR. MARSHALL: Three brief responses, Your

4 Honor. The first is that to measure summary denials,

5 you can't tell from a summary denial ruling what the

6 court was thinking about the time of delay.

7 The second point is that delay in California

8 is only half the equation. In California, there is the

9 substantial delay and then there's also the

10 justification portion. So persons who operate under

11 substantial delay still have an opportunity to justify

12 that delay and gain the desired review.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was the third?

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would they have to -

15 would they have to justify the delay first? I thought

16 there was something about, well, if the time question is

17 more difficult and the merits are easy, there's no

18 merit, so we just decide this.

19 MR. MARSHALL: California's policy is to

20 take a first look at a habeas petition and determine

21 whether it is -- has a prima facie case or whether

22 procedural bars are apparent. A court that's denying a

23 case on the merits isn't necessarily saying the matter

24 was timely, and courts should be permitted to reach

25 whatever is the most judicially efficient method of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1 resolving such a question without it being held against 2 them. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So basically you're 4 taking the position or you're conceding that the 5 California courts are not consistent in their 6 application of the timeliness rule? 7 MR. MARSHALL: No - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your brief doesn't even 9 try to defend that position. Are you conceding that 10 there is inconsistent application of the rule? 11 MR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor. 12 The point that we're making is that when you 13 look at a rule, whether you apply it or not -- or 14 whether you impose it or not doesn't mean you're not 15 applying the rule. For example, when trial courts 16 review matters under the Fourth Amendment, a decision 17 not to exclude the evidence doesn't mean they didn't 18 apply the Fourth Amendment. 19 In this case, if the trial court -- or if 20 the reviewing court looks at the length of delay, and 21 then they may look at the justification to determine 22 that the delay was justified. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- I might be 24 speaking for her, but I thought that the Habeas Corpus 25 Resource Center brief showed that the court, the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 California court, did reach some cases where an

6

2 explanation had not been proffered. And so it can't be

3 just a simple rule, that if you don't proffer an

4 explanation, you won't get heard. So what's the next

5 step in that? Why do they reach some and not others?

6 MR. MARSHALL: The California Supreme Court,

7 if a case is patently meritless and perhaps the

8 procedural question of timeliness is more complex -

9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could it be complex

10 when there's no justification offered?

11 MR. MARSHALL: The question of how long it

12 was -

13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they pointed to a

14 certain number of cases that were 5 years or above in

15 delay where no justification was offered, and in some

16 they reached the merits and in others they applied a

17 procedural bar. So how is that consistent?

18 MR. MARSHALL: Well, the State court has

19 discretion to determine on the -- on procedural grounds

20 or on the merits -

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there some Federal rule

22 that says you have to apply a procedural ground before

23 you decide the merits?

24 MR. MARSHALL: There is not. There's a -

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's up to California

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 which of the two it wants to use.

7

2 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in California, if it

4 just says "denied," then the presumption is it's denied

5 on the merits; is that it?

6 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, a lack of a

7 prima facie case.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and if -- so if

9 it's going to be denied on time bar grounds, there has

10 to be something to indicate that it's for that reason?

11 Otherwise we assume it's on the merits?

12 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct. Typically,

13 the citation is to Clark and Robbins, just as it was in

14 this case.

15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do we know that

16 the California court just thinks that the Federal

17 question is too hard and it doesn't want to reach it?

18 It may be meritorious. How do we know they're not

19 applying the decision to reach the merits on an

20 arbitrary and capricious basis or one that seeks to

21 avoid hard Federal questions?

22 MR. MARSHALL: First is this Court has never

23 taken the position, when measuring adequacy, of assuming

24 that the rule is inadequate. The starting position that

25 this Court has always taken when looking at the adequacy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1 of a State rule is to look for evidence to see that - 2 if it can be shown to be inadequate. And I posit that 3 there's no evidence in this case that has been presented 4 to show that the State court is using their rules as a 5 pretext of any kind. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it arbitrary and 7 capricious for a court to take the ground of least 8 resistance, to decide the case on the easiest issue 9 that's presented? Is that arbitrary and capricious? 10 MR. MARSHALL: I posit that it's not. This 11 Court endorsed in Lambrix that it's all right for courts 12 to address procedural default after Teague if that's a 13 more judicially efficient method of handling the matter. 14 Strickland cases permit addressing either prong, 15 whichever is easier under the circumstances. 16 And so the State courts ought to be 17 permitted to address habeas corpuses on whatever the 18 easiest, most judicially efficient basis is without 19 being forced to answer a timeliness question if a case 20 is patently meritless. And there should be no finding 21 of inconsistency about that. 22 And, more importantly, summary denials, as 23 we're discussing here, don't afford any notice to 24 litigants of what the State's procedures are or what 25 they're thin king, because you have to guess. You have
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
9 1 to guess at how long the delay was, you have to guess at 2 whether there was any justification offered. So summary 3 denials do not assist the inquiry. And this Court has 4 never endorsed using summary denials in its adequacy 5 measure. This Court has always looked to published 6 State cases that explicate the rule. 7 This Court is looking to see whether the 8 rule has been pronounced by the State for a certain 9 amount of time, and then all of a sudden the litigant 10 that's receiving the imposition of the rule receives a 11 rule that was unexpected, either because the rule was 12 changed or because the rule was novel. Nothing like 13 that has happened here. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The phrase is "substantial 15 delay." Are there factors other than temporal factors 16 that go into whether or not the delay is substantial; 17 that is to say, the prisoner had difficulty contacting 18 his counsel and so forth? Is that what the court looks 19 at - 20 MR. MARSHALL: Those are - 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when it looks at 22 "substantial"? And is there -- are there California 23 cases that tell us what the -- how do we define 24 "substantial"? 25 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor, to both.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 The kind of circumstances you're describing 2 are exactly the kind of circumstances which makes 3 California's rule fair, because it considers how long it 4 takes a litigant to find his claim, get it prepared, and 5 get it into court. 6 And there are, in fact, concrete examples. 7 The Robbins case specifically provided that a 5-month 8 window from the discovery of triggering facts to the 9 presentation of the -- of the claim was a reasonable 10 amount of time. By contrast, the Stankewitz case 11 provided that 18 months of delay from the discovery of a 12 declaration was substantial and had to be justified. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: When does the State think 14 that Mr. Martin's claim became untimely? 15 MR. MARSHALL: Certainly he hasn't given any 16 reason why he didn't present his additional claims at 17 the time of his earlier habeas corpus challenges. 18 Mr. Martin went through a full round of superior court, 19 court of appeal, and supreme court challenges, and then 20 waited some additional years and has never explained why 21 he didn't include these additional claims in those 22 earlier challenges. 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think it - 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's supposed to be filed 25 within 60 days. I don't -- this is along the same lines
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 as Justice Kagan's question. Suppose there's the first 2 round of habeas, and then he waits 60 days and files the 3 new claim. Would that be substantial? 4 Because you're indicating that failure to 5 include it in the first review is a factor to be weighed 6 against him. And I think that's what the Justice is 7 inquiring about. 8 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, it does -- it does weigh 9 against. And it's a rule of reasonableness, and it's a 10 discretion-based rule. And he would have to offer, 11 well, why didn't he include those claims earlier? And 12 if he had a good - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and what -- isn't that 14 a separate rule? I mean, no matter how soon, if he does 15 it a week after, doesn't California have a rule that you 16 can't come back with another habeas with material that 17 you could have produced in the -- in the former habeas? 18 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: So time -- time has nothing 20 to do with that. It's just a separate -- a separate 21 bar. 22 MR. MARSHALL: California has articulated 23 that successive petitions are a type of delayed 24 petition. But you're right, there is a difference in 25 California between successive petitions and delayed
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1 petitions, and the ruling here is that he was delayed 2 substantially. 3 I was just addressing the point about when 4 they might have been timely had they been presented 5 earlier, and it appears that in the earlier -- he didn't 6 get a timeliness ruling in his earlier challenges. So 7 it appears that he could have raised them then and did 8 not. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if we can take out the 10 second and successive aspect of this and just focus on 11 the timeliness, when does the State think that this - 12 that these claims were -- became untimely? 13 MR. MARSHALL: It's a rule of reasonableness 14 and diligence that's circumstantially based, and - 15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you have the 16 circumstances here, so -- so under those circumstances, 17 when did the claims become untimely? 18 MR. MARSHALL: In the Robbins case, it 19 explains that you have -- a 5-month span from discovery 20 of the claims to presentation of the claims would be 21 reasonable. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The claims here - 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: The 5 months would be 24 reasonable. So is a year unreasonable? Is 5 months the 25 outer bounds, you know, assuming you don't have a good
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 reason? I understand that if you have a good reason, 2 that can lengthen it. But suppose you don't have a good 3 reason. When does the State think, okay, that's too 4 late? 5 MR. MARSHALL: There isn't -- there isn't a 6 defined time line. But our position is that a defined 7 time line is not a necessity for adequacy. This Court 8 has endorsed reasons of -- rules of reasonableness and 9 diligence. For example, in the Federal prisoner context 10 in Johnson v. United States, this Court said diligence 11 in discovery, while it isn't exact, is good enough. 12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I'm -- I'm trying to 13 get to even around, not -- not exact. My standard is 14 not exact. It's just around. Around what? Around 6 15 months, around 3 years, around someplace in the middle? 16 MR. MARSHALL: The position of the State is 17 that Robbins has indicated that 5 months is reasonable, 18 18 months is definitely too long, and that there is a 19 discretion-based determination in the middle. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: What if it's filed within 6 21 months and it's -- it's rejected as untimely, and the 22 petitioner wants to try to demonstrate that this 23 represents a grave departure from the way these are 24 normally handled by the California Supreme Court? Is 25 there any way for the petitioner to do that?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 MR. MARSHALL: He would point to the 2 published authority and argue that his case was outside 3 of the parameters of what the State had done in the 4 past. However, our position is that, since California's 5 ruling is adequate, that there would be no evidence of 6 such available to this particular litigant. A 7 hypothetical litigant might be able to proffer that 8 prior cases had treated claims differently. 9 And the other problem with California is 10 that it would require two exact same litigants, and it's 11 very rare for two exact same litigants to have the exact 12 same claims, the exact same bases for their delay, filed 13 in exactly the same amount of delay. So true comparison 14 is difficult. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think 5 years is too 16 long, though? 17 MR. MARSHALL: Yes. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- this was taken 20 over by California from capital cases, but in the 21 capital case context, there -- they have a 90-day 22 presumption of timeliness. And when they extended the 23 capital framework to non-capital cases, they left out 24 the presumption that within 90 days is timely. Was 25 there reason for that?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 MR. MARSHALL: Respectfully, I must 2 disagree. It actually is the other way around. The 3 capital case policies took the timeliness rule -- took 4 the general timeliness rule for themselves and added the 5 presumption. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there reason for and 7 then saying, well, in the capital context, we're going 8 to make it clear that 90 days -- 90 days is timely. Why 9 didn't they add that to the original rule? 10 MR. MARSHALL: To the other litigant rule? 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 12 MR. MARSHALL: They, I think, felt that the 13 rule was adequate the way it was, that a 14 circumstantially based rule, a reasonableness-based 15 rule, was sufficient to guide the conduct of litigants 16 to tell them what they needed to do to present their 17 case. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why would it be 19 different in the capital context? What was the reason 20 for adding the 90 days there? 21 MR. MARSHALL: Capital cases are 22 significantly more complex, the punishments are -- are 23 more significant, and so additional scrutiny might be 24 warranted in those contexts. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- I'm a little bit
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 confused by your response to Justice Scalia. I thought 2 from your brief that you were positing that there was no 3 claim of inconsistent application of a rule that could 4 ever survive. 5 Let's assume for the sake of argument the 6 following hypothetical, and probably not far off the 7 mark. Litigants who don't know the law, who claim 8 they're not educated in it, say that they have just 9 learned about a new California case that gives them a 10 ground to challenge their prior sentence. And the 11 litigants learn about the case anywhere between 3 and 6 12 months of the issuance of the case by the supreme court. 13 A dozen litigants apply for this discretionary review, 14 and half of them are granted review and half are not. 15 Half of them get a correction of the sentence and half 16 of them don't. There is no difference between them 17 that's discernible. They each just claim ignorance. 18 Is that a case where someone would be out of 19 luck, and why, for a claim of inconsistent application? 20 MR. MARSHALL: I didn't follow the 21 hypothetical. Was -- were some of the hypothetical 22 individuals getting time-barred? 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Getting time-barred. 24 Some are time-barred; some - 25 MR. MARSHALL: And some of the individuals
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 were getting relief?

17

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.

3 MR. MARSHALL: And is there yet a third set

4 of people who are getting -

5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Some -- all of them

6 are within that small framework of 3 to 6 months from

7 the time the supreme court decision was issued. They

8 all claimed they just learned of it and filed

9 immediately, and some are getting relief and some are

10 not.

11 Is that an inconsistent application that

12 would be cognizable under your view of the rule as it

13 should be?

14 MR. MARSHALL: That sounds inconsistent to

15 me, Your Honor. However -

16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It does. So the

17 question -

18 MR. MARSHALL: But such a thing would not

19 occur in California.

20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What?

21 MR. MARSHALL: Such a thing would not occur

22 in California.

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the issue.

24 MR. MARSHALL: A meritorious -

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is: What rule do

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you want us to impose and how does that rule capture

18

2 that case?

3 MR. MARSHALL: There's a specific exception

4 for timeliness in California to preclude fundamental

5 miscarriages of justice. And anybody that had a

6 meritorious United States -

7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not answering my

8 question.

9 MR. MARSHALL: I misunderstood it.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. No. Why do you

11 concede that it would be bad? Can't the State, if it

12 wishes, give grace to people who did apply late, but

13 because the case is so meritorious or for any other

14 reason? The issue is whether those people who filed 5

15 years later and knew that it was very late, whether

16 they're entitled to have their cases heard, not whether

17 the -- the State allows somebody who filed 6 years

18 earlier to have it heard. How does that do any

19 injustice to the person who knew that 5 years was, you

20 know, you're likely to be denied?

21 MR. MARSHALL: I absolutely agree, Your

22 Honor. The basis for my earlier comments was the -- I

23 believe the hypothetical was 3 to 6 months, which was a

24 much shorter period of time.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see why the State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1 has to be consistent in it. If -- as a matter of grace, 2 it can -- it can allow some people, so long as the 3 people who are denied had every reason to believe that 4 they were coming in too late, and 5 years is coming in 5 too late. 6 MR. MARSHALL: Just as occurred in this 7 case, I absolutely agree, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it doesn't answer 9 why inconsistent application among similarly situated 10 individuals should not provide an avenue of relief. 11 MR. MARSHALL: This Court has never 12 reversed - 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Five years is different. 14 I'm talking about treatment of similarly situated 15 individuals differently. 16 MR. MARSHALL: First, this Court has only 17 looked at the treatment of this individual, not 18 disparate treatment of prior individuals. The -- the 19 rule exists for - 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, I don't disagree 21 with you. So that the question I have for your 22 adversary is whether or not he can point to any case 23 where a litigant who proffered an -- something that was 24 evident on the trial record and on the appellate record 25 was ever granted a merits review after 5 years. Because
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
20 1 I don't see them proffering any case that shows that. 2 But -- and I think that may be your argument. 3 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, exactly. That no one - 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I -- I'm not -- I 5 don't understand your answer, then. You have -- let me 6 just adapt what Justice Sotomayor said. You have -- a 7 case, a Supreme Court case is decided. And you have 8 10 -- 10 habeas petitioners in California who file on 9 exactly the same day. And five of them, if you were to 10 get to the merits of their claim under this new decision 11 of this Court, five of them would be entitled to relief, 12 five of them would not be entitled to relief on the 13 merits. And the California Supreme Court holds that the 14 five who would be entitled to relief are procedurally 15 barred and the five who were not entitled to relief on 16 the merits are not, and they are rejected on the merits. 17 Now, would that be an adequate State ground? 18 MR. MARSHALL: Well, I'm not sure. It 19 doesn't happen in California that way. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I know - 21 MR. MARSHALL: All right. I'm sorry. 22 JUSTICE ALITO: -- and I'm not suggesting 23 that it would. But if it were to happen, would that be 24 adequate? 25 MR. MARSHALL: It doesn't sound like it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 would be adequate under this Court's prior tests.

21

2 JUSTICE ALITO: So fair notice is not the

3 only requirement.

4 MR. MARSHALL: This Court has also required

5 legitimate State interests, and this Court has used the

6 legitimate State interests context, like, for example,

7 in Smith v. Texas, where this Court has declared a

8 particular kind of violation was a constitutional

9 violation and the Court exercised its discretion not to

10 reach the violation, this Court found that the State had

11 no legitimate State interest in such a ruling.

12 Our point is that -

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but the cases that

14 you're using in which we insisted upon adequacy in the

15 sense of equal treatment of equal people are cases in

16 which the effect of the State decision was to exclude

17 the matter from Federal -- from Federal supervision.

18 The matter could not come before the Federal courts.

19 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is something quite

21 different. This is applying a time limit. I don't see

22 why we have to apply the same rule and -- and look into

23 the -- whether it's not discretionary. I mean, to say

24 it's discretionary always means that sometimes similar

25 cases may be treated differently.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor, exactly. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't know why you - 3 you concede that -- that we take an adequacy rule that's 4 used for one purpose and should apply it to a totally 5 different situation. 6 MR. MARSHALL: It was the meritorious nature 7 of the claims. And in California, meritorious claims 8 don't receive the time bar because there's exceptions 9 that take those into consideration. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: But none of this is -- is a 11 device as is used in the cases that -- that you are 12 referring to that go into adequacy, a device to exclude 13 the Federal courts from the case. That's -- that's not 14 what's going on here, is it? 15 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: I guess if the situation 17 were such that a lawyer who is representing a client and 18 has to figure out has there been too much delay or not, 19 suppose he looked into the situation thoroughly and he 20 said, gee, I just have no idea, because half the cases 21 come out one way and half of them come out the other 22 way. Could he then go to the California Supreme Court 23 and say, Court, look what you have been doing? And 24 would the court then grant a hearing on that and 25 possibly correct it?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1 MR. MARSHALL: Well, in California, there's 2 no such evidence, but I suppose that the lawyer could - 3 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you're 4 saying there is no such evidence. 5 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct. In fact - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I suspected 7 reading this. But if there were such evidence is there 8 a route in California that they could deal with it? 9 MR. MARSHALL: Certainly. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not a question 12 of adequacy, is it? It's a question of notice. 13 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Adequacy of notice, because 15 no notice might be an inadequate notice. 16 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: And if it's absolutely 18 divided 50/50, you have no notice. You don't know what 19 will happen. And it isn't a rule to say, oh, this is 20 our rule, you don't know what will happen. 21 MR. MARSHALL: Within an area of discretion, 22 like, for example, the finding of whether a piece of 23 evidence was hearsay, if the court down the hall finds 24 the evidence should be excluded and the court in the 25 next room says it should be admissible, that isn't
Alderson Reporting Company

1 necessarily an abuse of -

24

2 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you, we are in

3 hypothetical, never-never land so far. But it's

4 possible your opponents will convince us it's real land

5 and not never-never land.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And for it to be

7 real -- just so I understand -- for it to be real, you

8 have to have a defense counsel, a client comes to him

9 with a non-frivolous Federal habeas claim, and the

10 defense counsel says, I can't tell whether we're going

11 to be barred by this time rule or not. Some courts,

12 looks like we will; some don't. So -- what?

13 Of course he's going to file the Federal

14 habeas and see if it's determined to be adequate or

15 inadequate, correct?

16 MR. MARSHALL: California's rule is

17 perfectly suited to such a scenario. All that litigant

18 has to do is explain why they didn't bring the claim

19 sooner, either from late discovery or some other

20 impediment, and the substantial delay can be justified

21 with exactly those sorts of circumstances.

22 JUSTICE KAGAN: What happens if a -- a

23 person in this position is trying to investigate

24 multiple claims at once, and some of them are ready to

25 be put before the court and others are not? How does he

Official
25 1 know, look, I really better get in there right now and 2 put whatever I have before the court? Or, look, I have 3 a little bit more time in order to investigate some of 4 my claims further? How does he make that determination? 5 MR. MARSHALL: The Gallego case specifically 6 speaks to that exact circumstance and provides that if 7 you have a good faith basis in investigating further 8 triggering facts, you may withhold the claims that 9 you've already presented -- or prepared, to prevent 10 piecemeal presentation. And that's a perfectly 11 acceptable explanation in California. 12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why is it, Mr. Marshall, 13 that the -- the California courts have not been a little 14 bit more transparent about what the presumptive time 15 limits are? You know, look, it's around a year unless 16 have you a good reason. You know, at least we're taking 17 3 years off the table. 18 I mean, why don't we have decisions like 19 that from the California courts that would -- would help 20 folks here? 21 MR. MARSHALL: Well, other than the Robbins 22 decision, which speaks of 5 months as being reasonable, 23 the court has tried to maintain a discretion-based, 24 circumstantially driven analysis in which they take 25 different litigants into consideration. One litigant

26 1 may be in a maximum security prison and only gets to go 2 to the library once a month. Another litigant may be in 3 a minimum security prison; he can go to the library 4 every day. Those two litigants are going to be 5 different and should be treated differently. 6 And if I might reserve the remainder of my 7 time. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 9 Mr. Bigelow. 10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. BIGELOW 11 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 12 MR. BIGELOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and if it 13 please the Court: 14 The adequacy inquiry is framed by asking 15 whether the State rule in question is firmly established 16 and regularly followed. At its core is the prevention 17 of State courts from declining to enforce Federal rights 18 and to maintain Federal authority over the protection of 19 constitutional rights in the Supremacy Clause. In its 20 brief at page 7, the State would seem to agree that a 21 rule is inadequate unless earlier decisions of the State 22 court are at least consistent. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but what did you 24 present below, or what has Habeas Corpus Resource Center 25 presented? A case with a 5-year delay where the claimed
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 errors are apparent on the trial record and the

27

2 appellate record, and no justification for the delay is

3 proffered. Those are the three seminal facts that go to

4 the requirements of Robbins and the other supreme

5 court -- other California Supreme Court cases.

6 Do you have one case that's similar where

7 the court went to the merits?

8 MR. BIGELOW: Sanders was a 5-year case

9 that's cited in my brief. Jones was -

10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Was that someone

11 who made a claim based on the trial and appellate record

12 with no justification?

13 MR. BIGELOW: I'll speak to justification in

14 just a moment, if I may.

15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh.

16 MR. BIGELOW: And Jones was an 8-year case.

17 The amicus brief, the Resource Center, cited Cooper,

18 Duke, and Hardiman. Cooper was a 5-year case. Those

19 were both IAC claims which appear to -- with respect to

20 the Sanders and the Jones case, I cannot -- I do not

21 know specifically what the claim was as I stand here,

22 and I apologize for that. But let us look at

23 justification for just a moment. The justification

24 offered in those cases was that the habeas petitioner

25 was ignorant and had no counsel. Now, I will represent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1 to you that, in the State of California, 99.9 percent of 2 the lawyers -- the lawyers -- 99 percent of the 3 petitioners who file aren't represented by counsel and 4 aren't lawyers themselves, and I will represent further 5 that probably 98 percent, 99 percent have no more than a 6 12th grade education. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: These cases that you cite, 8 before you go any further -- are they cases in which the 9 California Supreme Court came out with an opinion saying 10 that 6 years was okay? Or are they just cases where, 11 without an opinion, the California Supreme Court went to 12 the merits? 13 MR. BIGELOW: They are -- well, in the 14 Sanders case and in the Jones case, there were -- I 15 believe that they were decisions in -- they were 16 decisions. These cases predated the Clark/Robbins 17 situation. In the Cooper case and the Duke case, those 18 cases - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what do you mean 20 they were decisions, written opinions or just went to 21 the merits and decided the merits? Did they say 22 anything about the delay question? 23 MR. BIGELOW: They did say something about 24 the delay question in at least two of the cases, well, 25 at least in one of the cases, the Mitchell case, which
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 was a 2-year delay. They said 2 years is unreasonable, 2 but I didn't cite those. And I cannot speak to - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the other side says 4 that, unless there is an opinion, the reason they may 5 have gone to the merits is it was just a lot easier. 6 MR. BIGELOW: No - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't have to worry 8 about it. 9 MR. BIGELOW: To that extent, it -- it's my 10 recollection they went to the merits. They're not 11 silent denials, and they don't cite Clark/Robbins 12 because they predated Clark/Robbins. With respect to 13 the Cooper case and Duke case, those I believe were 14 silent denials. Now -- and that's the interesting thing 15 about California. We are presuming -- we are presuming 16 and this Court has reached that presumption -- that they 17 are merit denials when they are silent, but we really 18 don't know - 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a puzzle to 20 me. I mean, Justice Scalia's question was courts all 21 the time -- they -- you used see all the time they don't 22 decide an issue of whether it's filed too late because 23 it's the simplest thing just to decide the merits. It's 24 the same result. And sometimes they don't do that. But 25 that happens often in a district court on appeal and
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 triple in a supreme court which has hundreds or

30

2 thousands of questions for review. So how do we know

3 that that simple practice, which I've never heard of as

4 attacked as unconstitutional -- how do we know that that

5 isn't what's going on?

6 MR. BIGELOW: Well, in -- in any given year

7 recently, in recent history at least, there are about

8 800 truly silent denials, no explanation. Now, the

9 State says we can't consider them because they mean

10 nothing. From our perspective, they have to mean

11 something, and they have to count because we don't have

12 the information that the litigant in this matter is -

13 doesn't have the same kind of resources, for example,

14 that the State does.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but that's -

16 they -- what's your point? Eight hundred are silent.

17 What does that show?

18 MR. BIGELOW: That they have got to count in

19 the adequacy -- in the consistency application, they've

20 got to count against the Petitioner.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Why?

22 MR. BIGELOW: Because the Petitioner is the

23 one who has the resources and has the opportunity -

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, but then you

25 can make any claim against him. I mean, what I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 wonder -- maybe this is where I'm leading -- the

31

2 California Supreme Court is not the only court in

3 California where people file for habeas petitions, is

4 it?

5 MR. BIGELOW: No. The appellate court -

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. So why, if there's

7 inconsistency in this rule, wouldn't somebody go look at

8 the decisions of the appellate courts which write their

9 reasons down, and then you would know whether it is

10 being decided -- applied inconsistently or not

11 inconsistently. Why look at a blank wall? Why not look

12 at people who write opinions? And then you'll find out.

13 MR. BIGELOW: Not all -- not all habeas

14 petitions in California are filed in lower courts.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: No, of course not. But is

16 your claim -- are you conceding, or are you conceding,

17 are you denying, are you just saying nothing about

18 whether the practice in this rule, applying the rule of

19 substantial unexcused delay, disqualifies you for -

20 that's the rule, isn't it?

21 MR. BIGELOW: That's the rule.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Are you saying

23 it is being applied consistently or inconsistently or

24 you do not know -

25 MR. BIGELOW: It is being applied --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in all courts below the 2 California Supreme Court? 3 MR. BIGELOW: In all courts below, I do not 4 know, but - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: So you don't know. So what 6 you've come -- what you've done your research on are 7 questions that cannot be answered due to the fact that a 8 supreme court normally doesn't say why when it denies 9 something, but you haven't looked into the research that 10 is readily obtainable, which is these are courts that 11 write opinions. Is that -- have I gotten that 12 correctly? 13 MR. BIGELOW: That's - 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Because if that's 15 correct - 16 MR. BIGELOW: That would be a correct 17 statement. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then I don't 19 see why you didn't because it would be so easy, if 20 you're right, to show this from the lower courts, but of 21 course if you're wrong, it wouldn't be easy, then a 22 blank wall is better than nothing. 23 Now, what can you say that will disabuse me 24 of the notion that I just expressed? 25 MR. BIGELOW: The -- the lower appellate
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 courts -- there are six -- there are six district -

33

2 district courts. There are six appellate districts, I

3 guess, within the State -- within the State of

4 California and who knows how many superior courts. For

5 a petitioner to examine the holdings, the rulings in

6 each of those districts would be virtually impossible.

7 The only one -- for a petitioner who is in prison, who

8 is unrepresented by counsel, and let's not forget that

9 non-capital habeas petitioners, and this is a

10 non-capital habeas petitioner, is not represented by

11 counsel.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But some are -

13 there's a thing called sampling techniques, and sampling

14 techniques are designed to limit the burden. I'm not

15 saying it wouldn't be burdensome, but you have examined

16 thousands of cases. And so I'm back to my original

17 question. And statisticians, many of whom would like to

18 help you perhaps you could find some, could do this for

19 you, I think.

20 MR. BIGELOW: Amicus did it with respect to

21 the California Supreme Court.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: The wrong court. And

23 amicus did it from the time that -- that the case was

24 filed, while the rule is you start the period of running

25 from the case it was reasonably -- the person should

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1 reasonably have known his issue, which isn't the same 2 time as the time his case was decided against him. So, 3 yes. 4 MR. BIGELOW: Well, that's an excellent 5 point the Court makes. And it is that -- nobody in this 6 room, nobody in this room can tell this -- this litigant 7 when his petition was filed late. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true. 9 MR. BIGELOW: And so - 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but everybody 11 -- everybody in this room can tell him that he is 12 obligated to file the petition as promptly as the 13 circumstances allow. He has complete notice of that. 14 And if he wants to go and do the research and say, well, 15 here's one where they let it in after 5 months, but 16 here's one where they didn't leave it in after 9 months, 17 and he sits here and decides so I'm going to wait 9 18 months and put my money on that court -- that -- that is 19 not a scenario that's likely to happen, right? 20 MR. BIGELOW: That -- that -- it is not a 21 scenario that is likely to happen, but the construct 22 that the Court has -- "as promptly as circumstances 23 would allow" shows up in a footnote in a capital case. 24 It -- that - 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 challenging that as the State rule, are you?

35

2 MR. BIGELOW: That is the -- that's the

3 State rule that they proffer.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

5 MR. BIGELOW: That is the rule that the

6 State proffers. And what I'm suggesting is that that

7 rule is so vague and unknown, in the context at least of

8 the habeas litigation, no one understands what that rule

9 means. How prompt is prompt?

10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Bigelow, is that

11 right? I take your point that nobody can say exactly

12 when Mr. Martin's claims became untimely, but 5 years is

13 untimely, isn't it?

14 MR. BIGELOW: Five years is not untimely

15 if -

16 JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, if there's a very

17 good reason, but 5 years without an explanation is -

18 why is that a hard question?

19 MR. BIGELOW: Even with an explanation, 5

20 years is not beyond the pale of cases that have been

21 previously decided and with respect to similarly

22 situated litigants. Other cases in California -- and

23 don't forget, please, that the -- the Habeas Corpus

24 Research Center took only a small sample of a single day

25 and that was the day that Martin's decision came down.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they didn't look 2 at possible justifications at all, correct? 3 MR. BIGELOW: There was no justification 4 with respect to Mr. Martin's petition, that's correct. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I'm not 6 asking about Mr. Martin's. 7 MR. BIGELOW: Oh, I'm sorry. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This -- the analysis 9 that the amicus undertook simply looked at the 10 chronological time. They did not consider the fact 11 that, for example, somebody with 3 years might have had 12 an explanation; somebody with 1 year might have not had 13 any. And they may view those cases as different cases. 14 MR. BIGELOW: I -- I would disagree. I 15 think that they did, in fact, look at explanations for 16 delay, and a curious thing that they did find, which is 17 in their brief, is that even though -- cases which - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how did they 19 look -- did they look for explanations for delay when 20 you had the one-sentence denial? 21 MR. BIGELOW: I think the short answer to 22 that is yes, but they also looked at silent denials as 23 well. So they found that where there was no explanation 24 for delay, more of those cases were decided actually on 25 the merits than cases that did offer a delay. So
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 there's a -- a gross inconsistency, a gross

37

2 inconsistency between the need for justification of

3 delay.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how much range

6 are you willing to give the State? Do they have 3

7 months' range? I mean, if you come in and say, well,

8 here they were filed in 9 months and they were allowed,

9 and here they were filed in 6 months and they weren't

10 allowed.

11 Is that a problem under our consistency

12 requirement?

13 MR. BIGELOW: It wouldn't be a problem.

14 That would be a discretionary rule if there were

15 guidelines; if there were guidelines -

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it says -

17 MR. BIGELOW: -- some kind of guidelines -

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says "as promptly

19 as the circumstances allow." And then they go back and

20 say there is a 3-range, a 3-month range.

21 MR. BIGELOW: Oh, if they went back, with

22 decisional law, decided the range?

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You do the same sort

24 of research you've done here, and you find out that -

25 that there's a 3-month range. Sometimes -- I mean,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
38 1 there are cases and you can show a lot where they are 2 allowed at 9 months, and then you find cases that are 3 not allowed under 6 months. 4 MR. BIGELOW: I would be in a lot more 5 tenuous position arguing this case if there was some 6 guidance to litigants with respect to what does 7 constitute a reasonable time period within which to 8 file. What - 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And suppose -- suppose 10 California had a rule that said that you have to file 11 within 1 year of the finality of the conviction, absent 12 good cause for the delay. If that were the rule that 13 California had, your client certainly would be untimely 14 and you wouldn't have a leg to stand on, right? 15 MR. BIGELOW: If that were the rule, the 16 petition would have been filed timely. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would - 18 MR. BIGELOW: That's my answer. Had that - 19 that is my answer to that question. Had that time 20 period been known, the petition would have been filed 21 timely. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if there is a 23 requirement of prompt -- as promptly as circumstances 24 permit, wouldn't a person know that 5 years is not as 25 prompt as circumstances permitted?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 MR. BIGELOW: There has -- my answer is no, 2 because in California there are no guidelines. That 3 came in the Clark decision, which was 1993, and nothing 4 has been decided in the State of California to define, 5 to clarify, to narrow what constitutes "promptly." What 6 constitutes "promptly." 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why was this petition not 8 filed for 5 years? 9 MR. BIGELOW: I'm sorry. 10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why -- why was this petition 11 not filed for 5 years? 12 MR. BIGELOW: The record is -- does not 13 speak to that point specifically. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But didn't this come 15 about because it was returned? This was not -- I'm 16 thinking about -- he didn't -- he didn't make any claim 17 that he was -- he was diligent. 18 MR. BIGELOW: I'm sorry. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He didn't make any claim 20 that he was diligent in filing it 5 years late. 21 MR. BIGELOW: There were no claims made 22 excusing the -- excusing the filing at that time period. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume that -- that 24 California had just adopted this -- this rule that 25 habeas petitions have to be filed as promptly as
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1 circumstances permit. They've just brand-new adopted 2 it, and you're the lawyer for somebody who says, you 3 know, I think I'm going to wait 5 years. 4 Don't you think that even if there were no 5 California law on the subject, you would know that his 6 habeas claim is going to be denied? 7 MR. BIGELOW: If this were a - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really need case law 9 to tell you that 5 years is not as promptly as 10 circumstances permit when you -- when you have no 11 justification? 12 MR. BIGELOW: Decisional law is what our 13 system is all about, Your Honor. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so you can't have a 15 first case? 16 MR. BIGELOW: No, I think you can. I think 17 you can have a first case so long as -- so long as the 18 standard itself is not so vague - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay. 20 MR. BIGELOW: -- that reasonable -- that 21 reasonable men are able -- so long as reasonable men are 22 able to understand the standard. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think reasonable men 24 differ about 5 years? 25 MR. BIGELOW: Well --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bigelow, isn't this 2 similar to the rule that governed Federal habeas review 3 prior to AEDPA? 4 MR. BIGELOW: Well - 5 JUSTICE KAGAN: A similar kind of delay 6 standard, whatever "delay" means. 7 MR. BIGELOW: No, if I recall, the standard 8 was prejudicial delay. If I recall correctly. And 9 prejudicial delay, if I'm correct, is a quantifiable 10 standard. It is a standard that had, over the years, 11 come to be understood. There was a -- a shared 12 expectation with what prejudice encompassed. And so 13 yes, it's similar, but it's not exact. It's not the 14 standard in California. 15 And if I may, California clearly understands 16 that case law can offer guidance to litigants. In In re 17 Harris, a case cited by -- by both of us, by both 18 parties, the State of California was concerned about the 19 Walterus rule, which is another procedural bar. And it 20 went on to -- it acknowledged that it wasn't clear at 21 that time, and it went on to explain what the Walterus 22 rule was all about and why it was needed. 23 In another case, more recently, the State of 24 California -- a case not cited, the Kelly case; it's a 25 2006 case -- the California Supreme Court directed its
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 lower courts over which it supervises to provide greater 2 detail in their analysis of Wende briefs, which is the 3 State's alternative to the Anders brief, in order to 4 provide guidance to litigants, to provide guidance to 5 justices, and to -- to provide guidance to the Federal 6 courts who may be called upon to determine procedural 7 bars. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, I understand 9 that you'd have a much stronger case if you were dealing 10 with a judge-made rule about timeliness, if the courts, 11 on their own authority, said, look, we're not going to 12 look at things that are filed 4 years late because that 13 prejudices the State, it prejudices us, et cetera. 14 But here you have something different. You 15 have a rule, right? An established rule: promptly as 16 the circumstances allow. 17 MR. BIGELOW: Judge-made. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Judge-made, but it's 19 been around for a long time. This isn't a new rule 20 that's just coming in. 21 MR. BIGELOW: So a rule in a footnote in a 22 capital case. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me get 24 back. I tried to -- when you made that point earlier, I 25 wanted to follow up on it. Your claim is not that you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1 don't know or defendants in California don't know that 2 the rule is "as promptly as the circumstances allow," do 3 you? 4 MR. BIGELOW: No. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I thought you 6 had fair notice of that rule. 7 MR. BIGELOW: Yes. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 9 MR. BIGELOW: Just not the parameters of the 10 rule. And the parameters of the rule, the guidelines 11 which guide judges, which guide litigants, is just 12 simply not there in California, either with respect to 13 that rule or with respect to substantial delay. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't your argument that the 15 California timeliness rule was never an adequate rule, 16 never can proceed, never can bar consideration of a 17 Federal claim? 18 MR. BIGELOW: The -- had the -- never. Had 19 the rule been applied even-handedly, had the rule been 20 applied consistently, it would certainly be more 21 adequate. However, and getting back to Justice Scalia's 22 point, it has never been fairly defined, so it does not 23 clearly - 24 JUSTICE ALITO: What if Mr. Walker had 25 waited 20 years; would it still be inadequate as to him?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 MR. BIGELOW: In -- that's not -- that's not 2 this case. The rule hasn't been -- the rule has not 3 been thoroughly set out, at -- at least the guidelines 4 haven't been set, and it might be - 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why can't you take 6 the brackets of -- what was it, 5 months is reasonable 7 time; 18 months is not a reasonable time? Mr. Martin 8 falls outside of the 18 months. 9 MR. BIGELOW: Certainly, one -- one could do 10 that, but that hasn't been established as the brackets, 11 and it is, after all, California's rule. And it is 12 California that -- which needs to make that 13 determination. Now, it's -- it's not as if California 14 hadn't actually tried to do that. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was a 16 decision that said 18 months is too long. 17 MR. BIGELOW: Not a decision that said that. 18 These were extrapolated -- no, I beg your pardon. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a decision that 20 said 18 months is too long. 21 MR. BIGELOW: There was a decision that said 22 a 16-month period, but that was pre-Clark. That was a 23 pre-Clark decision that actually did say 16 months after 24 all is not a particularly long period of time. And 25 another decision -- I beg your -- I beg the Court's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 pardon -- another decision said that 2 years wasn't a 2 particularly long period of time. 3 But those are -- those are pre-Clark 4 decisions, if you will, and this case is relying upon - 5 or the State, rather, is relying on what has come after 6 -- after Clark with respect to its "as promptly as the 7 circumstances should allow." 8 But the other point that I would like to 9 make, it's not as if the State of California doesn't 10 understand the need for a finite period of time to 11 provide guidance to -- to all parties. In -- in 12 Saffold, the State requested this Court presume a filing 13 period. I think it was -- I want to say 60 days. More 14 recently in Chavez, a filing period was requested to be 15 presumed, again by the State. 16 And both occasions, this -- this Court 17 declined because it isn't this Court's prerogative to 18 set rules for the State. What this Court did do is it 19 certified the question to the State of California, or 20 they asked the Ninth Circuit at least to certify the 21 question to the State of California. The Ninth Circuit 22 did exactly as this Court asked it to do and certified 23 the question, and the State of California said: We're 24 not going to tell you what a timeliness period is. 25 Now, that does not help pro se litigants

BIGELOW: That's the problem. That's 20 the problem. The test that is applied without 21 guidelines, without any kind of guidelines. Judicial 22 discretion -- judicial discretion is informed 23 discretion; it is not discretion -- it's -- it's 24 judgment pursuant to known guidelines. It is not a 25 judgment issued pursuant to inclination.

47 1 And the concern is that with this kind of 2 amorphous standard, inconsistent and arbitrary 3 application is impossible to enforce. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's like having rules; 5 when you have rules and say 60 days or 90 days, you find 6 impossible cases that you should have heard because it 7 was the 91st day or it was the 92nd day, and then you 8 give the people equitable discretion to depart from it, 9 and pretty soon you get litigation over that. I mean, 10 there's no perfect system. 11 MR. BIGELOW: Discretion to depart from a 12 rule that has been violated is one thing. Here, there 13 is no quantifiable or known parameters within which 14 discretion - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is the solution for 16 California to say, if you delay more than a year from 17 when you should have known, you're barred except we'll 18 excuse it for any number of reasons? 19 MR. BIGELOW: Certainly, and - 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be a 21 regularly and consistently applied rule in your mind? 22 MR. BIGELOW: Well - 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be enough? 24 MR. BIGELOW: It -- it wouldn't necessarily 25 be consistently applied until we're down the road and we

48 1 learn how consistently it has, in fact, been applied, 2 but certainly it would be -- it would be an appropriate 3 rule. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: You may be -- you'd better 5 be careful about what you wish for because I am not sure 6 that the kind of system that's being proposed is going 7 to be better for habeas applicants than the one that 8 California now has. We really don't know that, do we? 9 MR. BIGELOW: We -- if -- if we collectively 10 screamed and yelled when AEDPA passed with its 1-year 11 statute of limitations, we've learned to live with it, 12 and we meet the deadlines because we know what the 13 deadlines are. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And pro se litigants who 15 don't know deadlines generally are going to live with 16 knowing that -- what? 17 MR. BIGELOW: They've got a better chance of 18 -- they've got a better chance of meeting deadlines if 19 they know what those deadlines are, and there's nothing 20 to take -- there is nothing to take the flexibility from 21 the California Supreme Court if there is a deadline. 22 But the - 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about -- that's 24 why I go back to the lower courts. If there really is a 25 problem here, why wouldn't the bar look into how well

49 1 this practice is working in the lower courts and find 2 out, well, what is the practice? How do they use it? 3 Do we want more flexibility? Do we want more definite 4 rules? That's -- I agree that you put your finger on a 5 problem, an important problem. I'm not at all certain 6 that the one system is better or required or compulsory. 7 MR. BIGELOW: The red light is going to go 8 on in an about a minute. Let me answer it this way: 9 The most powerful court probably in the world requested 10 clarification of the rule and didn't get it. I don't 11 know who else is going to. 12 Unless there are other questions - 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 14 Mr. Marshall, you have 4 minutes remaining. 15 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD MARSHALL 16 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 17 MR. MARSHALL: This Court has explained, in 18 Dugger v. Adams, that a handful of inconsistent cases do 19 not undermine the adequacy inquiry, and unless the 20 inconsistency becomes so profound that it undermines 21 fair notice, it should not matter that there are some 22 different rulings that can be shown. There's no reason 23 to think that a rule that has a bright deadline and then 24 takes into considerations after the deadline is somehow 25 preferable to a rule that takes into considerations
