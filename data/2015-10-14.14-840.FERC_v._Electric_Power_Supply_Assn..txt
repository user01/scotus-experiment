3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 next in Case 14840, the Federal Energy Regulatory

5 Commission v. The Electric Power Supply Association and

6 the consolidated case.

7             General Verrilli.

8         ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. DONALD B. VERRILLI

9            ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONER

10             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and

11 may it please the Court:

12             The Federal Power Act expressly authorizes

13 FERC to regulate the process that sets wholesale rates

14 for electricity, and that is exactly what FERC's

15 wholesale demand response rules do.

16             Demand response is a resource that is bid

17 into the wholesale auction, and the wholesale market

18 operators that run those actions rely on the bids to

19 balance wholesale supply and demand, to set wholesale

20 rates, and they particularly rely on those bids in

21 periods of peak demand to avoid price spikes and to

22 avoid blackouts and brownouts.

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If there were a student in

24 Economics I, it seems to me that he would conclude and

25 his professor would conclude that wholesale affects

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1 retail, retail affects wholesale, they're interlinked, 2 which means you win the case, except that the statute 3 makes the distinction.  We have to make a distinction. 4 Can you tell us what the distinction is that marks the 5 end of the Federal power and the beginning of local 6 power? 7             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So I  I have several 8 answers to that, Justice Kennedy. 9             First, we completely agree that what  any 10 action that FERC takes at the wholesale level in some 11 sense is going to affect the retail market.  All things 12 equal, if FERC sets  FERC will set a higher wholesale 13 rate, there is going to be a higher retail price.  But 14 that can't be a basis  those kinds of effects can't be 15 a basis, for denying FERC's jurisdiction. 16             And the case I would particularly point Your 17 Honor to is the Mississippi Power case.  Now, there was 18 a case in which what FERC did was conclude that a 19 utility could recover at wholesale its investment in a 20 nuclear power plant.  And what the Court held in 21 Mississippi Power was that that had the effect of 22 denying the State regulator the ability to deny that 23 utility recovery of those costs in the retail rates, 24 even though under State law they would have been 25 imprudent costs and not recoverable.  That was a very
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 direct effect on the exercise of State regulatory

6

2 jurisdiction, which you do not have here, by the way, so

3 I think a fortiori, this is certainly permissible under

4 the rationale of Mississippi Power.

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I find that a pretty fuzzy

6 line, "very direct effect."  I  it seems to me that

7 there is a distinction between affecting retail rates,

8 which, as Justice Kennedy has pointed out, always

9 happens, and using  using effect upon retail rates as

10 a means of regulating wholesale rates.  And the argument

11 here is that that is what has occurred, that

12 effectively, FERC has raised the retail price during

13 peak hours because somebody who wants to purchase at

14 retail during peak hours not only pays  you know, has

15 to forgo the benefit that that person would otherwise

16 get from FERC's program.  That raises the price at

17 retail, and that is the means of achieving what FERC

18 wants to achieve.

19             Yes, FERC has the  has the power to

20 regulate wholesale rates.  But  but, the argument is,

21 not through the fiddling around with retail rates, which

22 is what is asserted is happening here.

23             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So  I think three

24 points to be made in response to that argument, Justice

25 Scalia.  First, the  the authority that's exclusively

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 reserved to States by Section 824(b) of  of the

7

2 Federal Power Act is the authority over retail sales.

3 Every retail sale that occurs in the regime in the  in

4 FERC's  under FERC's wholesale demand response regime

5 is a retail sale that will occur at the rate that the

6 State regulator has set, and under the terms and

7 conditions that the State regulator has set, every

8 single sale that occurs that is true about.

9             Second, what they have said is that this

10 changes the effective rate.  But what I would say in

11 response to that, Your Honor, is that if I go out and

12 buy a Ferrari for $100,000, everybody thinks that the

13 price of the Ferrari is $100,000.  Nobody thinks that

14 the price of the Ferrari is actually $107,000 because

15 I'm foregoing the $7,000 tax credit I can get if I

16 bought an electric car.  The rate is what it is.  It's

17 $100,000.  And here, the rate is what it is.

18             And third, the point I would make, it seems

19 to me, it's a very odd argument to say that what FERC's

20 rules do here is increase the retail price.  What FERC's

21 rules do is drive the retail price down by driving the

22 wholesale price down by very considerable amounts in

23 peak periods.  This is  this is a system that results

24 in lower rates for retail consumption.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, yes, ultimately, but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1 the question is whether that is achieved by the means of
 2 directly managing retail rates.  And you say this does
 3 not.  What if FERC 
 4             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Those 
 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:   had sufficient funds
 6 available that it could pay people to not purchase
 7 electricity during peak hours?  It just said, you know,
 8 we'll give you so much per day not to use more than X
 9 amount of electricity during peak hours.  Would that 
 10 would that be within FERC's powers? 11             GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think that would be a 12 harder case than this one because all of the conduct 13 that FERC regulates here occurs in the wholesale market. 14 All of it.  The  this is about what bids can be 15 accepted into the wholesale market, what  16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It  it's the difference 17 between turning over money to these retail purchasers 18 and simply depriving retail purchasers of a benefit that 19 they could otherwise obtain in the wholesale market. 20             GENERAL VERRILLI:  I  I think this is a 21 more straightforward case, because all of the conduct 22 that FERC regulates occurs in the wholesale market, all 23 of the actors are regulated in their role in the 24 wholesale market, and FERC's purpose in this situation 25 is to achieve lower wholesale rates and to allow and to

1 prevent  allow wholesale operators to prevent

9

2 blackouts and brownouts in their 

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's still based

4 on direct price regulation of the retail rate.  It may

5 be the same point as your Ferrari hypothetical, but

6 if  if FERC is basically standing outside McDonald's

7 and saying, we'll give you $5 not to go in, and the

8 price of the hamburger is $3, somebody goes up there,

9 there  the price of a hamburger is actually, I think

10 most economists would say, $8, because they give up the

11 $5, they've still got to pay the $3.

12             And your answer is, there's no impact on

13 what the States can do, because they can still say, no,

14 the price of the hamburger should be $2, or it should be

15 $4.  The point is that  that FERC is directly

16 affecting the retail price.

17             GENERAL VERRILLI:  And I guess there's an

18 additional point to be made in response to that, Your

19 Honor, is that  the  here, of course, what FERC is

20 doing is saying, here are the rules by which the

21 wholesale market is going to operate, and if you come

22 into the wholesale market, these are the rules that will

23 apply to you.

24             But ultimately it remains up to the States

25 because FERC takes State law as it finds it here,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 whether citizens of the State can go into the wholesale 2 market.  They can only go into the wholesale market if 3 FERC  if States agree that they can go into the 4 wholesale market.  So it's very difficult to see that  5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That  that's interesting. 6 If FERC has this power, how can it strip itself of this 7 power by saying, we will not do this if the States don't 8 want us to do it? 9             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think FERC 10 certainly has that authority in the course of deciding 11 what's a just and reasonable practice.  And, in fact, I 12 believe that that's what the Court held in New York v. 13 FERC with respect to FERC's decision not to regulate 14 the  the bundled element of transmission there because 15 it was concerned about jurisdictional overlaps.  And 16 there FERC didn't exercise its regulatory authority at 17 all.  And so it's a fortiori  18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's quite different. 19 That's quite different from saying we're going to 20 exercise it unless you, the States, veto it.  I don't 21 know that if  if FERC really has that power.  I don't 22 know how it can confer a veto upon the States. 23             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, it seems to me, 24 Your Honor, that that's not an argument that goes to 25 FERC's jurisdiction.  That may be an argument, although
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 no one has made it in this case, that if FERC believes 2 that this practice is  that this practice is required 3 to have a just and reasonable wholesale rate, that  4 that FERC can't then let States opt out. 5             But, again, that seems to me to be a merits 6 issue, not a jurisdictional issue.  And  and again, I 7 think it's  it's just incorrect under this Court's 8 holding in FERC v.  9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I think it's goes to 10 whether FERC really thinks that it's meddling in  in 11 retail rates. 12             GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, Your Honor  I know 13  14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what it goes to in 15 my mind.  I think it's an acknowledgment by FERC that, 16 in fact, you know, we are mucking around in an area 17 that's the State's area.  And if the States don't want 18 us to do it, we won't do it. 19             GENERAL VERRILLI:  I appreciate that, that 20 Your Honor dissented in New York v. FERC on a ground 21 very much like that.  But the Court held that that was a 22 legitimate exercise of FERC's authority to decide what 23 just and reasonable practices were, to take that 24 jurisdictional overlap into account.  And that's all 25 FERC has done here.  It seems to me quite clear that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that is, under the logic of New York v. FERC,

12

2 permissible exercise of  of FERC's authority.

3             And so in a situation, it seems to me, in

4 which what you've got is FERC taking State law as it

5 finds it, you really can't say that this is a

6 impermissible interference or a power grab or any

7 intrusion into State authority because the States

8 ultimately make the decision.

9             I  in fact, I think the Federalism

10 argument is upside down here.  This is a situation in

11 which what you have is a FERC rule that really is a

12 strong version of cooperative Federalism.

13             What FERC is saying here is that this is

14 policy that we think works, we think brings about

15 billions of dollars in consumer benefits by lowering

16 wholesale rates.

17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it fair to say that

18 FERC is luring retail customers into the wholesale

19 market?  And if that 

20             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, well, my friend

21 has  my friend has used that term, but I think 

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if that  and if 

23 if  well, if that were true, would that not be a 

24 a  a serious problem for the government?

25             GENERAL VERRILLI:  It's wrong as a matter of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 history  as a matter of history.  It's wrong as a

13

2 matter of law.  This  this idea of wholesale demand

3 response was not FERC's idea.  FERC didn't impose it on

4 the market, Justice Kennedy.  This is a practice that

5 grew up organically out of the private actions of market

6 participants once the wholesale markets were

7 deregulated.  It's exactly the kind of innovative

8 private market conduct that you would hope that

9 deregulation would bring about.  And the  the private

10 actors, the wholesale market operators, brought that

11 idea to FERC as early as 1999.

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  One of the briefs, by the

13 way, says that you had no authority to deregulate it.

14 You know, we had a case involving the Federal

15 Communications Commission which wanted to dispense the

16 filing of tariffs on the part of everybody, I think,

17 except AT&T.  And we held that the statute requires the

18 agency to regulate rates and required filed rates.

19 Isn't that a problem here too?

20             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So I'm very familiar with

21 that case, Your Honor.

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I'm sure you are.

23             GENERAL VERRILLI:  And this case is

24 completely different.  And in  in fact, I think, you

25 know, when 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, I like deregulated 2 markets.  But the  the problem is, do you have the 3 authority to do it? 4             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Sure.  I think that 5 the  that bridge was crossed in New York v. FERC.  It 6 seems to me in New York v. FERC held that that  that 7 that deregulation, that deregulatory impulse was within 8 the authority of FERC, and that there's nothing in the 9 statutory text that precludes it.  And I do think that's 10 a key point here, that what we're talking about here at 11 the end of the day is FERC's authority, which this  12 which comes down to what the statute says. 13             And what the statute says, in Section 14 824(e), is that FERC has authority over practices that 15 affect rates in  wholesale rates.  And there's just no 16 doubt given that all of the practices FERC is regulating 17 occur in the wholesale auction.  They're all embedded in 18 the wholesale auction. 19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If we're  if 20 we're  obviously, that's true.  But it's just as 21 obvious, it seems to me, that you have to have some sort 22 of limiting principle, otherwise FERC can do whatever it 23 wants.  So what is the limiting principle that you would 24 suggest to us? 25             GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think  I think the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 limiting principle has worked quite well in D.C. Circuit 2 for years now is that the effects have to be direct. 3 And it's a limiting principle akin to the kind of 4 limiting principle  common sense limiting principle 5 that the Court has used in the ERISA preemption 6 contracts with respect to relating to. 7             And with respect to direct effects, what I 8 would say is when you  what you're talking about is 9 regulation of conduct that occurs in the auction itself, 10 participation in the auction, the rates that are 11 charge  that are  the  the bids, the nature of 12 bids that can be accepted at the auction, the use of 13 those bids to balance wholesale supply and demand, 14 payment of the bidders at a rate that FERC prescribes, 15 and recoupment of that payment in the wholesale market, 16 all in the wholesale market that you've got as direct an 17 effect as you can have. 18             And we're quite comfortable with the Court 19 drawing a line that would exclude the kinds of 20 examples  the hypotheticals that the D.C. Circuit came 21 up regulating steel, regulating  regulating inputs 22 into electric generation.  We don't think FERC's 23 authority goes anywhere near that far. 24             It  but when you're talking about conduct 25 that occurs in the wholesale auction in the wholesale
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 market, it's just at the core of the practices affecting 2 jurisdiction that the statute  3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That isn't the  that 4 isn't the central conduct here.  The central conduct is 5 the refusal to buy power during peak hours.  That occurs 6 in the retail market.  So why is that a direct effect? 7 What  what you're  what you're telling people is, if 8 you agree not to buy power at retail during certain 9 hours, we're going to pay you.  I  that seems to me an 10 indirect effect, not a direct effect. 11             GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, the  what the 12 conduct  that  that's  that is  it is an 13 indirect effect of the conduct that FERC regulates by 14 market participants, the wholesale market operators and 15 the  and the participants in the wholesale auction. 16 But that's an effect.  The conduct that FERC regulates 17 all occurs in that auction.  It creates that incentive, 18 yes it does.  But all of the conduct is in that auction. 19 It's clearly within the text of 824(e)(a).  And there is 20 no text that unambiguously  21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  General, I believe that 22 there is  I understood the retailers are not telling 23 the  the selling generators:  "I'm not going to use 24 it."  It is the people buying from the wholesalers, 25 which are a different entity from the retailers, who are
Alderson Reporting Company

2             GENERAL VERRILLI:  That  that  that's

3 correct, Justice Sotomayor.  And if I  I would like to

4 make one point and then reserve the balance of my time,

5 if I could.

6             And the one point is this:  There is no

7 statutory text that unambiguously denies FERC this

8 authority that it's exercising here over this wholesale

9 conduct.  And given that, Chevron requires that the

10 Court uphold FERC's authority here.

15           ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONERS

16             MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

17 and may it please the Court:

18             Justice Kennedy, I think I'd like to start

19 with the first question you asked, which is what  what

20 do we learn essentially from Economics 101.  And  but

21 I think the way that you have to think about it is in

22 terms of the actual market that operates in this

23 particular case, which is a wholesale market.

24             It's not a market that covers the entire

25 United States.  It covers less than half the States.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
18 1 But it is an important market that was created in order 2 to create a basis for competition. 3             And up to this point, up prior to the demand 4 response initiative that was not adopted by FERC, but 5 was, in fact, pushed by my clients and those we 6 represent in private business, what we were trying to do 7 was to create a demandside component to that wholesale 8 market.  Because trying to regulate exclusively or 9 trying to  to deal exclusively with the supply side 10 wouldn't work, or it's not as effective as it could be, 11 or certainly wouldn't necessarily guarantee you just and 12 reasonable rates. 13             And so tariffs were filed in order to 14 provide a basis for putting in the demand side.  And the 15 reason why this is a direct effect on the  on the 16 wholesale rates is because it's an absolute onetoone 17 relationship. 18             If I put in a unit of  of or reduce a unit 19 of demand, I don't need as much supply, and that affects 20 the price directly.  And that's the direct relationship 21 that derives from the economic principles. 22             And  and to my mind, the entirety of  of 23 the Federal Power Act, in 201, 204, 205, asks you in the 24 first instance to look at the wholesale market that 25 exists.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1             And then once you do that, then is this  2 you know, it's not:  Does it affect the retail rate? 3 Clearly it will.  The question is:  Did what FERC do 4 here in the order directly affect the wholesale rate? 5 And on that score, it seems to me there's no question. 6             Then the issue becomes what  7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  I think moving 8 directly to control retail prices, subsidizing certain 9 retail purchases, that also would directly affect the 10 wholesale rate.  And  and does that mean FERC is 11 authorized to do that? 12             MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't know that it would 13 directly affect the wholesale rate in nearly as 14 exquisite a fashion as the regulation in this case, 15 because again, you're talking about the exact same 16 transactions going on in affecting supply and demand. 17 Nothing can affect the wholesale rates that way. 18             If I make an effort to manipulate the retail 19 rates, maybe eventually it will affect the wholesale 20 rates, but it will do it in ways that are very indirect 21 as we explained in our reply brief.  It may go up; they 22 may go down.  It's impossible to know. 23             There's no way to doubt that if I reduce 24 supply, that that will in  or if I  yeah.  If I 25 reduce supply, that will cause the  the rates, the

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't mean to jumped

3 forward too  too quickly to, really, the second

4 question, did FERC comply with its obligation to explain

5 the  the reason for its change, but it  it does seem

6 to me that  that they come close together.

7             FERC's argument is essentially circular.

8 It  it says, well, the market forces will  will work

9 this out, but we define the market.  That seems to me

10 circular.

11             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean  I don't know

12 that we define the market.  We've allowed the market to

13 be created.

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, there are two

15 parts to this argument:  One is jurisdiction; the other

16 is whether 

17             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  No, I understand

18 that.  But the question is what price will allow this 

19 will  will promote this market, to create incentives

20 to allow you to have enough on the supply side  on the

21 demand side, I'm sorry  in order to make this

22 meaningful?

23             And what the FERC said was, when we had

24 experience with one of the regional transmission

25 operations, what happened when they reduced the price?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1 The amount of the demand response dropped precipitously. 2             And as a consequence of that, based on that 3 experience, we now have enough evidence by which to say, 4 wait a second, we need to go back and raise the price in 5 order to bring in more of the demand response, in order 6 to ensure that there is a reasonable balance between the 7 supply and the  and the demand.  But all of that's in 8 the wholesale market. 9             This  this doesn't come close to violating 10 the principle of Louisiana Power where this Court said, 11 what is the retail authority that is preserved to the 12 State?  And that's to set the rates for retail sales. 13             The State  14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The problem is  15             MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   that what FERC is 17 doing basically leaves the States with the pure 18 formality of setting the rate that is going to be 19 directly affected by what FERC is doing. 20             In my hypothetical, if you remember, I mean, 21 they get to say how much the hamburger costs once you 22 get in the store, but FERC can respond to it directly by 23 setting the price to encourage you not to enter the 24 store. 25             If I  if  if$5  we'll give you $5 not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 to enter, and a burger is $3, if it's  the State gets 2 to say, no, no, we want it to be $2, and then FERC just 3 says, all right, we'll give you $6 not to enter. 4             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But that all assumes 5 that what  what FERC is trying to do here is to, in 6 fact, directly regulate the rates.  That's not  that 7 was never the intention behind this exercise. 8             The intention here is to try to 9 manipulate  not to manipulate, but to control  10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It may not be  11             MR. PHILLIPS:   the wholesale rates in a 12 way that would not  13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It may not be the 14 intention, but it's the mechanism. 15             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But  but the 16 statute  17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you say, oh, well, we 18 didn't mean this, but we're doing it. 19             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I  you know, ONEOK 20 sort of says what you intend, what you  what your 21 intent is and what's directed at actually controls in 22 some ways this area, but we're talking about a situation 23 of concurrent jurisdiction between the State and the 24 Federal government in this particular context. 25             And so the fact that there are going to be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1 effects on the retail rates doesn't deprive FERC, which 2 ultimately is the supreme authority here, as long as it 3 operates within the sphere of adopting  of dealing 4 with a practice, regulating a practice that will in fact 5 affect the wholesale rates.  And that's precisely what 6 it has tried to do in this particular context. 7             And  and, Justice Kennedy, I don't think 8 there's a problem with respect to the way the rates were 9 set, because again, if you do it in the  in this very 10 sort of fundamental Economics 101 approach, which 11 Dr. Khan is the one who  who was the primary proponent 12 of it, said, look, if you're  if you're taking out 13 demand, if you're  if you're reducing demand, that 14 affects supply directly, and therefore, you should 15 compensate them exactly the same. 16             And FERC looked at that and said, you know, 17 that makes perfect sense to us.  That's an appropriate 18 way to go.  That will  you know. 19             That's not a  that's not luring people; 20 that's just providing a basis upon which there will be 21 enough of a market in order to allow the wholesale side 22 of the  of the grid system to operate in an efficient 23 way.  Not only to reduce the wholesale prices, which is 24 important, but even more fundamentally, Your Honor, to 25 protect the reliability of the grid.
Alderson Reporting Company

24 1             That was what prompted, frankly, the initial 2 effort to deal with this entire demand response issue, 3 was to figure out what are we going to do about 4 brownouts?  What are we going to do about blackouts? 5 How are we going to be able to  because we can't do it 6 if we just do it on the  on the  on the generation 7 side. 8             We need to reduce the demand in order to 9 ensure that in response to these kinds of crises, there 10 is an answer. 11             This is the answer.  Commission has operated 12 exactly the way it ought to have under these 13 circumstances. 14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why  why  why aren't 15 all the companies in agreement with you?  Why are there 16 some  some private companies on the other side? 17             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, most of the private 18 companies on the other side generate electricity and 19 would prefer not to manipulate the supply side because 20 they're  they're  I mean, manipulate the demand side 21 because they like to have all of the supply side going 22 to as far as you can take it. 23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they're not all 24 generators I don't think. 25             MR. PHILLIPS:  They're pretty  I mean,
Alderson Reporting Company

25 1 there's a substantial number of them.  I mean, the vast 2 majority of them on the other side are  are 3 generators, Your Honor. 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, maybe your 5 colleague can  can answer it. 6             MR. PHILLIPS:  I'll let him count up his 7 amicus briefs, if he  if he wishes. 8             And  and the last thing I guess I would 9 say is  is I agree with General Verrilli's point, that 10 if at  at all  if all else fails, this is clearly a 11 question  these are both questions that are  in 12 which the Commission deserves deference.  It deserves 13 deference on the question of the scope of its 14 jurisdiction, and it assuredly deserves deference, 15 Justice Kennedy, in deciding as between locational 16 marginal price and locational marginal price minus G or 17 minus G plus A, or however you would go about that. 18             If there's any issue upon which this Court 19 ought to say the Commission gets a  gets more than a 20 thumb on the scale, it would be that issue. 21             If there are no further questions, Your 22 Honor.

1             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

26

2               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3             MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

4 please the Court:

5             I don't usually start in this Court by

6 telling you who I represent, but I think I better do it

7 here, which is I represent not just EPSA, which is a

8 group of power generators, but a number of other 

9 other organizations.

10             So the vast majority of the people that I

11 represent are loadserving entities who are not

12 exclusively on the supply side.  They're actually the

13 regulated public utilities that actually could provide

14 demand response in a wholesale, meaningful level by

15 working, as they have since long before FERC got in this

16 business, to work with retail customers and their State

17 regulators to provide for reduced retail demand at peak

18 time.  So that's who I represent.

19             Now what I'd like to start, beyond telling

20 you who I represent, is with the notion of what FERC was

21 trying to do here, which was to reduce retail demand by

22 providing payments to retail customers on an otherwise

23 wholesale market in an effort to change the effective

24 price for retail sales.

25             Now, that sure sounds like something that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 belongs to the States.  So the answer you hear 

27

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where is that 

3             MR. CLEMENT:   from the general 

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where is that in 

5 written anywhere that that was their goal?  That's how

6 you've characterized that goal.  But what I've heard

7 them say is, we're trying to lower the price of

8 wholesale to a more just amount.  That's what's in

9 anything I've seen written.  You've recharacterized it.

10             MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think it's just a

11 characterization battle ultimately.  But even if you

12 want to stipulate that they are trying to reduce retail

13 demand for the best of wholesale reasons, it's still 

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They're not in the

15 retail market.

16             MR. CLEMENT:  What?  I'm sorry?

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They're  they're

18 generators selling to intermediaries.  The

19 intermediaries are the ones who are in the market with

20 the retailers.

21             MR. CLEMENT:  That's not correct, Justice

22 Sotomayor.  It's crystal clear, and I don't think the

23 Solicitor General will contradict me in his rebuttal,

24 that what FERC does uniquely in this context is invite

25 retail customers, directly large retail customers 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true.  That is true. 2 That  3             MR. CLEMENT:   directly on the wholesale 4 exchange. 5             JUSTICE BREYER:  That is true.  What you say 6 is true.  Every reduction in demand for a unit of retail 7 electricity is ipso facto a demand for a reduction of a 8 unit of wholesale electricity, and vice versa.  So it's 9 hardly surprising that anything they do in the wholesale 10 market that adds to demand will add to demand in retail, 11 and vice versa. 12             But I thought that their motivation here is 13 the following:  On the 4th of August at 4:00 p.m., 14 people turn on electricity for airconditioning.  That's 15 the peak hour.  The industry, leaving reserves out of 16 this as a fixed matter, has to supply that.  So if there 17 are not enough generators at 4:00 p.m. on August the 18 4th, they have to build one. 19             And to build an additional generator  I 20 don't know what gas costs now, but let's imagine it's 21 $500,000, and that will be passed on in the wholesale 22 price, and then probably, though the States are free to 23 do what they want, in the retail price. 24             So FERC thinks I have another way of doing 25 this.  For only $400,000, I can be sure that on the 4th
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 of August at 4:00 p.m., the demand is not great enough 2 to spend the 500, and so we group the people who will 3 promise to fulfill their airconditioning at other 4 times. 5             That way, the price of wholesale electricity 6 falls.  And, therefore, we satisfy all demand at a lower 7 price.  We are interested in wholesale.  We are 8 interested in how to satisfy peak wholesale demand.  And 9 we have worked out a way to do it cheaper.  Of course it 10 affects retail prices, so does everything we do in 11 respect to wholesale prices.  End of the matter. 12             So I accept your characterization, but I do 13 not see any law that prevents them from raising or 14 lowering wholesale price despite the fact that that 15 affects retail price. 16             MR. CLEMENT:  And I certainly wouldn't be 17 here suggesting that anything that happens in the 18 wholesale market that affects retail price is somehow 19 verboten to FERC.  But I am here to say that when you 20 regulate wholesale prices, essentially as Justice Scalia 21 suggested, through the retail market, that that crosses 22 a very important boundary in the Federal Power Act.  And 23 with all due respect to your question, your approach to 24 this would make perfect sense if FERC were the only 25 regulator on this scene, but 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE BREYER:  It didn't affect  it

30

2 didn't try  what it said was, we have a group of

3 people who will put customers together, and those

4 customers will, in fact, cut demand at 4:00 p.m. on

5 August 4th.  As I say, that affects retail price; so

6 does everything.

7             MR. CLEMENT:  But  but 

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  And  and what is the

9 difference here  and that's what you want to get at,

10 so I'm letting you do it 

11             MR. CLEMENT:  I  I 

12             JUSTICE BREYER:   the difference here and

13 what I just said?  Everything.

14             MR. CLEMENT:  The difference here is that

15 the customers they're targeting are retail customers,

16 and the very fact  and this is what I  where I

17 really wanted to go, which is, I think the Solicitor

18 General goes a long way to conceding that this really is

19 going at retail  the retail market and the retail

20 level of demand matters, and he will concede that we're

21 changing  they're changing the effective price of

22 retail electricity.

23             The only  the saving grace for them is,

24 ah, but we're limiting ourselves to the wholesale

25 market, and we're the wholesale regulator.  So why

Alderson Reporting Company

1 shouldn't we do it?

Official

31

2             Here's the problem:  These retail customers

3 don't belong on the wholesale market.  Whether you think

4 they were lured in or you think they walked in the door,

5 it doesn't matter.  They are on a market where they

6 don't belong.  The fact that they are regulating in this

7 context and this context alone, retail customers

8 directly, is a profound signal that they've overstepped

9 their jurisdictional bounds.

10             And I think the way you can understand why

11 the fact that they're on the wholesale market is not a

12 complete answer is to consider the following scenario,

13 which doesn't seem all that farfetched, which is to say

14 a large retail consumer of electricity, let's call it

15 WalMart, decides, you know what, I like the prices on

16 the wholesale market better, and I buy more electricity

17 than a lot of loadserving entities in small

18 jurisdictions.  So I'm going to walk on to the wholesale

19 market run by an ITO or an ITO, and I'm going to buy

20 electricity for my own consumption at a better price.

21             If they did that, I don't think there is any

22 question that that would be a retail sale that could

23 only be regulated by the States.  And if that actually

24 happened, then the RTOs and ISOs would have to make a

25 choice.  They would either open themselves up to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 regulation simultaneously by FERC and the States for

32

2 that retail transaction, or they would do what I think

3 they probably would do, which is, one regulator is

4 plenty.

5             We're just going to say that WalMart can't

6 come on to our market and buy retail gas directly from a

7 generator.  And that's the world we live in.  WalMart

8 can't walk on that market and buy 

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's the  what's

10 the horror here of concurrent jurisdiction?  You seem to

11 posit that this is horrible, but if, in fact, it's

12 lowering prices, WalMart sees it as a lowering of

13 prices, I  hard to think of why States would say no,

14 but some of them have.  But I'm not sure what the

15 problem is with concurrent jurisdiction.

16             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Your Honor, I'm not

17 sure, ultimately, that my burden is to show that this is

18 horrible as opposed to ultra vires.  But let me try to

19 explain to you why concurrent jurisdiction is an anomaly

20 in the context of the Federal Power Act.  I mean, this

21 Court, on numerous occasions, has said that although

22 you  sometimes it's hard to divide the lines.  Once

23 you do, generally the Federal government operates in its

24 exclusive sphere of the wholesale market, and the States

25 regulate in  exclusively in the retail market.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they all  each of 2 them affect each other. 3             MR. CLEMENT:  But here's the problem  4 yeah, normally they stay away from each other and each 5 other's customers. 6             Another thing that is a complete anomaly 7 that FERC has created here that, as far as I'm aware, 8 exists nowhere else in the energy world, is you actually 9 have the Federal government and the Federal regulators 10 and the State regulators bidding against each other for 11 the same customers to reduce their same retail demand. 12             And the other side has made a very big deal 13 that none of the States raised a jurisdictional 14 objection before FERC itself.  But there were a number 15 of States, Ohio, Illinois, and all of the States that 16 are participants in the MISO, one of the ISOs.  And what 17 they told FERC is, by all means, do not set the 18 compensation level at LMP, because that's too high.  And 19 by setting it so high, what you are going to do is 20 you're going to crowd out our own efforts at dealing 21 with demand response.  Because we love demand response. 22 We want demand response.  But we don't want to pay twice 23 as much as the market really should pay for demand 24 response.  And if you're out there offering our same 25 retail customers the ability to get demand response paid
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1 at huge LMP levels, then we're going to be crowded out. 2             Now, the only response that FERC can offer 3 to that is, well, then just optout, come on, you know. 4             First of all, that's the third anomaly here, 5 because there's no other area of regulatory authority 6 where FERC allows States to optout.  And if you think 7 about what they're opting out and compare it to their 8 legal theory, it doesn't work.  I mean, since when is 9 FERC all of a sudden enthusiastic about State 10 experimentations with practices that directly affect 11 wholesale rates? 12             In every other context where they actually 13 have jurisdiction, wholesale rates, transmission, not 14 only would they not allow State optouts, but they would 15 say it's going to lead to discrimination in a way that 16 would be unjust and unreasonable. 17             So the optout option here, though, doesn't 18 work for another reason, which is it's worse for the 19 States that most want to provide for demand response. 20 Because what they're being told is, all right, you have 21 a subset of your customers who are actually interested 22 in demand response.  And if you want to optout, what 23 you have to tell your customers who are interested in 24 demand response is we're actually going to pass a 25 regulation that restricts you, and you can't go into the
Alderson Reporting Company

1 Federal market and get a better rate 

35

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  I guess if you're 

3             MR. CLEMENT:   you're going to have to

4 take a lousier rate.

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  If you're right, then I

6 guess the FERC could not direct the grid approvals in a

7 way that would, in fact, prevent certain retail

8 customers from buying electricity at certain times.  I

9 guess that FERC could not, in fact, allow large

10 consumers of electricity to buy at wholesale, because

11 that would take the retail customers away from the

12 jurisdiction of the State.

13             I guess that FERC could not, in fact, insist

14 upon a marginal capacity being generated from natural

15 gas instead of from other things, because that will

16 affect the price of natural gas, will affect the

17 wholesale rate, thereby raising the retail rate, thereby

18 stealing customers away from, let's say, Ohio, where it

19 goes up, and forcing them to go to Texas.

20             I mean, I have not been surprised that I

21 have found no case in which FERC ever tried to do

22 anything roughly comparable or even by the roughest

23 analogy that would say that they cannot do this for the

24 reason you suggest.

25             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Your Honor, there is a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 lot in that question, but let me just respond 

36

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, all there were meant to

3 be was three examples, and I don't know how good they

4 are, but they come to mind.

5             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, with all due respect, a

6 couple of them aren't that great because 

7             (Laughter.)

8             MR. CLEMENT:   because you seem to suggest

9 that if you can't do this, well, then FERC can't

10 essentially tell generation resources that we don't want

11 any more coal generation; we only want natural gas.

12 And, of course, they can't do that because the Federal

13 Power Act reserved the plenary authority of regeneration

14 to the States.

15             You also suggested if they can't do that,

16 then they can't allow WalMart to helpfully walk into

17 the wholesale market and buy at retail.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  I was grasping your point,

19 which I hadn't grasped previously.  And your point seems

20 to be that the problem here is the way they are reducing

21 the demand, and therefore, the cost of wholesale

22 electricity, is by taking a  groups of people and

23 preventing them from buying electricity at all at

24 certain times, which, of course, affects their buying

25 retail.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
37 1             Isn't that basically your point?  And if it 2 is, I was trying to think with that argument.  That's  3 that's why I said that you can skip the whole thing if 4 you want. 5             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, here  here's a way 6 of  of trying to harmonize that, which is I think that 7 the line that the Federal Power Act divides  draws is 8 between retail sales and wholesale sales.  And I believe 9 that this is impermissibly on the retail side of the 10 line. 11             I think my friends on the other side 12 ultimately think that the difference isn't between 13 retail and wholesale but is between sales and nonsales, 14 because they appear to concede my WalMart example in 15 the retail world.  Which is to say, on page 39 of the 16 SG's brief, I think they pretty much concede that 17 WalMart cannot walk on to a wholesale market and 18 purchase gas at retail without coming into the scope of 19 the State regulators. 20             I think they also concede that, if the 21 government's interest here was not to suppress retail 22 demand but to increase it, they thought, you know, if we 23 could just sort of boost retail demand a little bit, 24 we'd get a whole bunch of these new green resources 25 online and it would actually make, you know, everything

2             So we want to increase retail demand.  So

3 here's what we're going to do:  We're going to have

4 either directly or through the wholesale operators 

5 we're going to pay a bonus to people who increase their

6 retail purchases.

7             That, I believe, my friends on the other

8 side say, well, no FERC couldn't do that because that

9 would affect a fullyconsummated sale.

10             So their position seems to be although we

11 can pay  we can't pay incentive payments to increase

12 retail demand, we can pay incentive payments to reduce

13 retail demand.

14             Two observations about that:  One is, why in

15 the world would that make sense?  I mean, why in the

16 world would  would Congress have divided the authority

17 here in a way that allows the Federal government to

18 suppress retail demand but not increase retail demand?

19             The second thing that I want to say about

20 that anomaly, though, is the line between sales and

21 nonsales can't be the right line because it  if it is,

22 then not only can they do what Justice Scalia suggested,

23 which is have FERC pay a direct bounty not to purchase.

24 And I was actually quite surprised by the Solicitor

25 General's answer to that.  And he  and he didn't fully

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 complete the answer.  He said that would be a harder

39

2 case, but he didn't ultimately say how that would be

3 answered.

4             I think he has to say that, if FERC sort of

5 cut out the wholesale operators and just said, we got a

6 new appropriation, and every retail customer that

7 reduces their retail consumption gets a $200 check from

8 FERC, that has to be consistent with their position that

9 FERC can do it because it doesn't interfere with a fully

10 consummated sale.

11             But we're still  if they're right, then

12 what FERC can do tomorrow is solve this problem much

13 more directly.  They can say, retail customers, you

14 cannot buy at peak times.  You simply can't.  We're not

15 going to allow it.  Because that's going to reduce

16 the  the  the wholesale demand.  It's going to avoid

17 brownouts.  It's going to take all the pressure off our

18 grid.  So that's it.  No more purchases on August 4th.

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And they're not regulating

20 the rate of sales.

21             MR. CLEMENT:  They're not regulating the

22 rate of sales.  So, you know, never mind.  Or  or 

23 or the rate of sales is  is either zero or infinity

24 because you can't do it.

25             But any way you think about it, that has to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 be the implication of their theory that there is a

40

2 categorical difference between 

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  They have to be reasonable

4 in what they do under Chevron.  It's a broadlyphrased

5 statute.  What they have to do is reasonable.

6             And so really the question is:  Is what

7 they're doing here unreasonable?

8             MR. CLEMENT:  Well 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  And  and I  and we're

10 not electricity regulators; they are.  It's pretty tough

11 and technical.

12             And  and so that's why I  I've been

13 trying to figure out just what it is about this thing

14 that, in your view, makes it unreasonable.

15             MR. CLEMENT:  And what is unreasonable is

16 that, before you get to a Chevron question, certainly

17 before you get to an arbitrary and capricious question,

18 you have to have jurisdiction for FERC to do this.

19             And the basic division of authority in

20 201(b) of the Federal Power Act is that the Federal

21 government gets sales for resales and the States get all

22 other sales.

23             And I think it's important to recognize that

24 you really have to wrestle upfront with the 201(b)

25 question because the other side loves to talk about 205

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 and 206 in the practices affecting language.  But the 2 problem with that is that 201(b) specifically says that 3 the provisions of this subchapter, which include 205 and 4 206, shall apply to sales for wholesales and shall not 5 apply to all other sales. 6             So you don't get to 205 and 206 if what is 7 being regulated front and center is a retail sale of 8 electricity. 9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement  10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And at some point of  I 11 want you just to assume that there is jurisdiction, but 12 to discuss your point that section  that Rule 745, 13 particularly, was arbitrary and capricious, I assume, 14 because adequate reasons or no reasons were given.  Or 15 maybe there's some other point.  But at some point 16 before your time runs out. 17             MR. CLEMENT:  I  I  I will definitely do 18 that, Your Honor.  I don't know if you had a question 19 that goes to jurisdiction that you want to talk  I 20 mean  21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you mind, Justice 22 Kennedy, if I  23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, of course. 24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes? 25             I mean, I take it that the  the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 implications of your argument is that FERC can't do

42

2 anything with respect to demand response; is that right?

3             MR. CLEMENT:  No, that's not right.  My

4 position is that FERC can't do anything with demand

5 response with retail customers.  They can do demand

6 response, true wholesale demand response, which they

7 were actually doing before they went down this route and

8 around, you know, the  the two  early 2000s.

9             And the way that wholesale demand response

10 works is the way you sort of naturally think it would

11 work, which is through a participant in the wholesale

12 market, namely through the loadserving entities who are

13 mostly my clients.

14             Because the way you can sort of do this is

15 you work cooperatively with the States and the LSEs, and

16 you encourage them, as Congress suggested in 1252(e) of

17 the  of the National Policy Act or the Energy Policy

18 Act.  You encourage them to do all sorts of things to

19 reduce their demand, and then there's just less demand

20 bid in to the auction in the first place.  And so supply

21 meets demand at a much lower level.

22             Just for completeness sake, you can also

23 have wholesale participants participate in a

24 demand/response program in the forwardcapacity markets,

25 where, again, it would be the LSEs.  And what they would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 do is say, we're going to  we're going to  three

43

2 years hence, we're going to reduce our compensation 

3 or our  our consumption by this level, and we're going

4 to do it on the local level.

5             And just to further complete that thought,

6 you know, it's  it's nice to talk that FERC has been

7 doing this since 2000, but the States have been doing

8 this long before that, at least since the 1980s.

9             And there is a brief for other respondents

10 that I don't represent, the Midwest loadserving

11 entities.  And it's worth a  it's a short brief, but

12 it's worth a quick read because what they say is, look,

13 we've been doing this at the State level since 1984.

14 We're a local utility.  We work with our local

15 regulator.  Because we have plenary authority over the

16 retail market, we can deal with demand response in all

17 sorts of ways that FERC could never imagine.  And we can

18 do things like basically go in and get a local customer

19 to agree with us to change the way  their thermostat.

20 We can go in, send somebody in, put different hardware

21 in there, and then, based on a reduction in their retail

22 rates, we can get them to agree that basically, on a hot

23 day in the summer, we get to take over your thermostat.

24 And we directly impose demand response through that.

25             And that's the kind of thing that States

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 have been doing since the '80s.  And that's the kind of 2 things that are going to be crowded out by this 3 onesizefitsall rule with the high LMP 4 compensation recipe. 5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And so this sort of 6 practice, though  so I'll just narrow the question  7 where it's retail actors who are bidding into a 8 wholesale market. 9             MR. CLEMENT:  Right. 10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I take it that there, there 11 would be a regulatory gap.  In other words, FERC can't 12 do anything nor can the States do anything. 13             MR. CLEMENT:  I  there is not a  a 14 regulatory gap.  I don't think FERC can do anything. 15 And I would answer it by reference to my WalMart hypo 16 going in to buy. 17             If WalMart went in to buy  so if a retail 18 customer on the buy side sort of walks into a wholesale 19 market  it's not that lightning strikes and they can't 20 do it.  It's that it's a retail transaction.  So if 21 anybody can regulate it, it's the States. 22             So there's not a regulatory gap.  In theory, 23 a State could regulate the transaction even though it 24 takes place on an otherwise wholesale market. 25             I think as a practical matter  I don't
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 want to  as a practical matter, I don't think the ISOs 2 and the RTOs want to be regulated by both FERC and the 3 States.  So I think what they would do is, ah, if the 4 price of having a retail customer on our otherwise 5 wholesale market is we get State regulation on top of 6 Federal regulation, then we're going to bar the door to 7 the retail customer. 8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe you can turn 9 to the question Justice Kennedy asked you to address. 10             MR. CLEMENT:  I  I  I would be delighted 11 to. 12             If I could say one last thing about 13 jurisdiction, which is simply I  I do think, though, 14 that the premise of the other side's argument is that 15 the sky will fall if you don't have this precise type of 16 retail customer on wholesale market demand response. 17 And there, I think, it's worth taking a look at the 18 Southern company's brief, because they operate in a part 19 of the country that doesn't have an RTO or an ISO. 20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It  it is an odd result, 21 given this Energy Policy Act which made it so clear that 22 Congress liked demand response that it wanted FERC to 23 lower barriers to demand response, to then say, well, 24 FERC has no jurisdiction to do exactly what the policy 25 that Congress articulated is.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1             MR. CLEMENT:  But the problem with that way 2 of looking it, Justice Kagan, with all due respect, is I 3 think it looks only at 1252(f), which is the one 4 reference to what FERC's supposed to do, and it ignores 5 1252(e) where Congress recognized that the States are 6 the primary actors here. 7             And the point I was making about the 8 Southern company brief is operating in an area without 9 ISOs, without RTOs, so without FERC, they actually have 10 a greater level of demand response than other parts of 11 the country that have the Federal rule. 12             So to bring us to the arbitrary and 13 capriciousness question, I think, Justice Kennedy, the 14 way I think about it is that we have both procedural 15 objections and substantive objections. 16             The procedural objections are essentially 17 that there are all sorts of objections to using LMP as 18 the price to provide compensation. 19             That wasn't just my clients.  That was also 20 the States that I alluded to who were worried that this 21 high level of compensation would crowd out their effort. 22             It was a particularly poignant comment from 23 the  the  some of the ITOs and RTOs who design 24 these  run these wholesale markets. 25             And the ones that I thought were most
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 persuasive in some respects was the operators of the

47

2 MISO, the midwestern one, because at FERC's direction,

3 they basically spent two years trying to come up with 

4 get all the stakeholders in a room and come up with a

5 formulation  a compensation formula that worked.  And

6 what they came up with was essentially LMP minus G.

7             And after having spent two years with all

8 the stakeholders coming up with LMP minus G, they were

9 then told by the Federal government at a late breaking

10 hour that there was a onesizefitsall solution, and it

11 was LMP.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, wait a minute.

13 That's the classic choice that we give agencies.  They

14 had expert testimony, Dr. Khan, who was undisputed to be

15 a leading expert in this field, say the opposite.  I

16 mean, how do we choose to go into the weeds of something

17 as technical as that 

18             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   when that's been

20 entrusted to the agency?

21             MR. CLEMENT:  Surely it has.  But the reason

22 I started with the procedural way of coming at this is

23 the D.C. Circuit has lots of arbitrary and capricious

24 cases, and they are quite comfortable in saying that, in

25 circumstances like this, you didn't respond adequately

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to the comments that were put before you.

48

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would you tell me which

3 one?  I mean, I looked through everything that the

4 dissenter said, and there is at least one or two or

5 three paragraphs in the FEC's report on this that

6 directly explains why they chose a different route.

7             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, there is certainly 

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The  the  the court

9 below didn't give us one comment by the dissenter that

10 wasn't addressed by something said in the report.

11             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I can give you an

12 example, Justice Sotomayor, if it will help, which is

13 that Chairman Mueller in his dissent  Commissioner

14 Mueller in his dissent actually used a hypothetical that

15 is very similar to the hypothetical discussed in our

16 brief and the SG's brief about a factory and how if 

17 if you have full LMP, a factory will essentially reduce

18 its production at time periods where it's economically

19 inefficient for them to do so.

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And they  and they

21 recognized that, and what did they say?

22             MR. CLEMENT:  They  they had no 

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Only when it's

24 economically feasible will we pay this price.

25             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, the way I read the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 the way I read the record, Your Honor, is that there was 2 no response to that hypothetical, just as there was no 3 response in the SG's  4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The response was where it 5 doesn't work, we won't use it, which I didn't find a 6 very satisfactory response.  Isn't that essentially what 7 they said? 8             MR. CLEMENT:  I'm not even sure they  they 9 said that much, but I don't think they really grappled 10 with it. 11             And to whatever extent they  12             JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought that the response 13 was what Justice Sotomayor, and the way  I wouldn't 14 characterize it that way, but it's called the "net 15 benefits test."  And the net benefits test means this is 16 not a one size fits all. 17             And then in the order, at paragraph 17, 18, 18 page 67, they go through a bunch of methodologies, and 19 they  I mean, they say, we're picking this one. 20             And the reason that they pick this one, I 21 guess, is they think it's  if you try a G thing, that 22 also is a problem administratively. 23             Okay.  Now, I'll just read those.  Is there 24 anything else you're going to tell me that  I'll read 25 them and see what they say, right?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  Well, I would  I

50

2 would  I would encourage you to look at the FTC

3 comments, the Joint Appendix page 281, the comments of

4 the States.

5             I mean, I would think that when you have

6 another coordinate part of the federal government come

7 in and say, you are picking the wrong compensation level

8 and it will be affirmatively inefficient and will crowd

9 out other uses for demand response, that you'd at least

10 owe them something more of an explanation than grouping

11 them in a footnote with every other commentator you got

12 and say, we're not persuaded by that.

13             There is, though, I think  and I would 

14 actually, you know, I  I didn't think I would come up

15 here talking about net benefits test, but I actually

16 would 

17             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll read  Cicchetti that

18 writes about that in the brief, doesn't he?

19             MR. CLEMENT:  Yes.  Yes.

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  And so I think that's the

21 best brief to read on that.

22             MR. CLEMENT:  Yes.

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  Right?  Okay.

24             MR. CLEMENT:  And  and  and what I would

25 say beyond that about the net benefits test is here's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1 another way in which the  the compensation formula is 2 what I would call substantively arbitrary and 3 capricious. 4             The whole formula is built on the idea that 5 there is an  an equivalence between less demand and 6 more actual supply of energy.  But of course, when you 7 get to the nittygritty of it, it turns out that's not 8 true, because the great thing about actual supply of 9 energy is that other wholesale  real wholesale 10 customers buy it, and then the market clears naturally. 11             But when you start getting a thirdparty in 12 there, a retail customer who really doesn't belong there 13 and start saying, we're going to pay you money, but that 14 money doesn't actually result in load that  a 15 loadserving entity pays for, that creates a deficit in 16 the wholesale account. 17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is one way to think about 18 that is that the  FERC's argument is circular.  It 19 says, well, the market will take care of this, but we 20 define the market. 21             MR. CLEMENT:  Yes.  And yet, it's  the 22 market really can't take care of it because the market's 23 designed to simply get a bunch of wholesale sellers and 24 a bunch of wholesale buyers together, and the price of 25 the sales and the price of the purchases equal each

1 other out, and everybody goes home happy.

52

2             But when you invite retail customers on and

3 say, guess what, we're going to pay you not to buy, that

4 creates a market imbalance.

5             The FERC euphemistically refers to this is

6 the billing unit effect.  And then they have to solve

7 that by making adjustments to the market clearing price.

8 And then to make sure they don't go too far down, they

9 apply the net benefits test, which is not only

10 mindbogglingly complex, but FERC itself recognizes that

11 it's imperfect.

12             The last thing I want to say, though, about

13 sort of the substantive unreasonableness about this is

14 there is a more fundamental problem here, and it's  I

15 think the economist's brief on our side gets at this

16 very well, which is at the end of the day, if FERC gets

17 to do this on the wholesale markets, what is being

18 purchased is not energy, actual energy that's been

19 bought and then sold.  What is being sold is an option

20 to buy electricity at a subsidized retail rate.

21             And in any other market  I mean, think of

22 a stock where I have an option to buy it at 20 and the

23 market price is 40.  Lots and lots of people are going

24 to offer me 20, 19 for that option because I have a

25 valuable right to buy something at a belowmarket price.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
53 1             But nobody is going to offer me 40 for the 2 option to buy at 20 just because the market price is at 3 40.  But that is exactly what FERC has done by setting 4 the compensation rate at LMP. 5             And they made mincemeat out of poor 6 Dr. Kahn, because what Dr. Kahn really says is that the 7 market signal that the customer ought to get is LMP. 8 But the market signal they get is LMP if it accounts for 9 avoided costs. 10             If you take the avoided costs out of the 11 question, then you get LMP plus the retail costs. 12             And of course, another irony here is the 13 distortion is greatest in those markets where the States 14 have done exactly what FERC would like, which is adopt 15 retail price  real time pricing, because then the 16 retail price is LMP. 17             And so what is the compensation rate for 18 demand response providers?  It's twice LMP. 19             JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought  you don't 20 have  I mean, I thought that he  frankly the net 21 benefits test was meant to dealt with  deal with this 22 problem. 23             I will read Kahn's testimony, I promise.  I 24 will read Cicchetti, and I will read Hogan too.  Okay? 25             MR. CLEMENT:  Please read  please read

54 1 Dr. Hogan as well, because I really do think he has the 2 better of this argument. 3             Now, you would say, generally, well, couple 4 of expert economists, just let FERC decide.  But I do 5 think in this case they have strayed beyond the bounds 6 of arbitrary and capriciousness, Justice Kennedy. 7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I  I take it you're 8 asking us not to make the judgment as to which was right 9 and which was wrong, but that  but that FERC did not 10 address it by giving specificenough reasons. 11             MR.

But I  but I don't want to suggest 13 that it's just purely procedural because I don't think 14 these are things they can fix. 15             And of course, we hope that you don't even 16 get to that question because you find they don't have 17 jurisdiction. 18             Thank you. 19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 20 Five minutes, General. 21     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN.

55 1 text, my friend pointed to Section 824(b), which you can 2 find at 1(a) of the appendix to our brief. 3             What it says is not that FERC shall have 4 jurisdiction over sales of electricity at wholesale.  It 5 says the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to 6 sales of electricity at wholesale. 7             One of those provisions is 824(e)(a), which 8 says FERC shall have jurisdiction over practices 9 affecting wholesale rates. 10             So we're within the plain terms of the 11 statute, and there is no statutory text that plainly 12 forecloses FERC's exercise of jurisdiction.  And my 13 friend, in 30 minutes, didn't even try to identify one. 14             So in terms of applying Chevron, there's no 15 doubt that  that FERC's interpretation has to be 16 upheld. 17             With respect to the WalMart example that my 18 friend identifies, I think it shows why his argument 19 about hermeticallysealedoff retail and wholesale 20 spheres really has nothing to do with the real world. 21             In the real world today, large customers can 22 buy directly.  They can do it through contract, and they 23 can also go into the wholesale market auctions and buy, 24 if their States permit it, and that does happen in the 25 real world.

1             And this is really no different because

56

2 demand response entities that want to come in and

3 participate can only do so if their State law allows

4 them to do so.  So it's no different than what's been

5 going on in the real world for quite a long time.

6             Third, with respect to the loadserving

7 entities, the  the utilities, my friend says, well,

8 don't worry about it; they'll do all the demand

9 response.  It will work great.

10             FERC addressed that.  It addressed it

11 directly.  It found that loadserving entities don't

12 have sufficient incentives to engage in demand response.

13 And it's obvious why they don't, because they

14 cannibalize their own profits.  The higher cost they

15 have, the higher their rate of return profits are going

16 to be generated.  They will do it under commands from

17 State regulatory agencies to do it, but they'll do it

18 grudgingly.  And what FERC said is you want people to

19 come in who have a real profit motive to do it, and

20 that'll incent the LSEs to get in there and try to get a

21 piece of the action rather than letting it go to

22 somebody else.

23             But FERC addressed that issue specifically.

24             Now, the idea that demand response can't

25 work, the Statelevel demand response, retail demand

57 1 response can't work where wholesale demand response is 2 operating, you know, again, the real world just 3 contradicts that.  We have 24 States in which this is 4 going on.  And if this were a problem, you'd expect to 5 see in this administrative proceeding some evidence that 6 it was a problem, and there is zero evidence.  You look 7 at all these briefs; there isn't a citation to anything 8 in the administrative record that suggests that the 9 Federal and State programs can't work in harmony.  And 10 FERC made a finding that they can work in harmony. 11             Now, with respect  just one point on 12 arbitrary and capricious, and I'd like to sum up. 13             I think if you're going to look at one thing 14 in terms of the concern you've raised, Justice Kennedy, 15 I would look at page 223 of the Appendix to the 16 petition  of our petition, and what you will see right 17 there is FERC directly identifying the problem that my 18 friend spent the last few minutes of his argument on, 19 and then going on to say  and then going on to explain 20 in great detail for several pages why that critique is 21 wrong, and citing in particular the paragraph of 22 Dr. Khan's declaration where Dr. Khan is responding to 23 the specific critiques that my friend made. 24             So it  it certainly meets the threshold 25 test of  of  of an adequate explanation for a

2             Now, if I could sum up, I think this is what

3 this case comes down to.

4             On one side of the scale, you've got a

5 practice that saves billion  that has saved billions

6 of dollars in wholesale costs and will save billions of

7 dollars, and it's an effective tool against blackouts

8 and brownouts, and that nobody has shown in the real

9 world does any harm.

10             You have a statutory provision that gives

11 FERC specific authority to regulate this practice.

12             You have no statutory provision precluding

13 it.

14             You have Chevron in case there's any doubt.

15             And you  and you have, really, a strong

16 cooperative Federalism program here in which States have

17 the  States are masters of their own fate.  Whether 

18 whether customers in a State participate or not is up to

19 the State.  If the State thinks this is not a good

20 policy, the State can say it doesn't operate in our

21 State.

22             On the other side of the scale, what you've

23 got is an argument that all those benefits have to be

24 extinguished, and  and no argument in the record that

25 there was any harm from this program.  You have no clear

59 1 statutory text for bidding FERC from engaging in this 2 regulatory practice. 3             And my friend used the phrase "one size fits 4 all."  Well, I  I suggest that really what we've got 5 here on the other side is a faux Federalism argument. 6 Their argument is the one size fits all. 7             There are lots of States out there that want 8 their consumers, want their citizens to participate in 9 this because they think it's good policy and it's 10 completely harmonious with their regulation.  But what 11 my friend's argument does is wipe that out and say, no, 12 it's one size fits all, and then what's  and that one 13 size that fits all is that nobody can participate, not 14 even the 24 States that want to do it. 15             Thank you. 16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General. 17             The case is submitted. 18             (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the 19 aboveentitled matter was submitted.) 20 21 22 23 24 25
