 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 next in No. 02-1016, Lee Till v. SCS Credit Corporation.
 5 Ms. Harper.
 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA J. HARPER
 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 8 MS. HARPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 9 please the Court:
 10 Deferred payments under section
 11 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) must equal the present value of the
 12 collateral. Historically present value has been an
 13 objective concept equalling the real interest rate and
 14 inflation, which is the time value of money. 15 The Seventh Circuit has redefined this concept
 16 in a manner that seriously disrupts two fundamental
 17 principles of chapter 13, that being the equal treatment
 18 of creditors similarly situated and the debtor's
 19 rehabilitation, the debtor's access to chapter 13.
 20 QUESTION: When you say traditionally it's been
 21 understood to mean real interest rate plus time value of
 22 money, it means real interest rate for the particular
 23 lender. Isn't -- I mean, the -- the interest rate that is
 24 given to different lenders is not always the same.
 25 MS. HARPER: Under chapter 13, you're simply

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 trying to value the money. It's not particular to a
 2 specific creditor because you're just trying to equate the
 3 amount of money over time to a particular amount of the
 4 allowed secured claim.
 5 QUESTION: Well, that's right, but the interest
 6 rate that I have to pay when I buy a house with a very
 7 small down payment is much higher than the interest I have
 8 to pay if I make a much larger down payment.
 9 MS. HARPER: That's --
 10 QUESTION: And the interest I have to pay, if I
 11 make, you know, over $200,000 a year is less than I would
 12 get if I have a lower income. So you can't just speak of
 13 a fair interest rate in the abstract as though it's a --
 14 it -- it's a platonic number floating out there. It
 15 certainly depends upon the solvency and -- and the record
 16 of payment of the person paying the interest. Isn't that
 17 right? I --
 18 MS. HARPER: You're -- you're talking about
 19 interest in the open market, though, which is not what
 20 we're talking about here. We're -- we're talking more
 21 about --
 22 QUESTION: I'm surprised to hear you saying this
 23 because I thought your brief acknowledged that even after
 24 you begin with the -- with a discount rate, you know, the
 25 -- the Fed's discount rate -- I thought your briefs

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 acknowledged that the bankruptcy court could add to that a
 2 -- a surcharge depending upon the riskiness of the chapter
 3 13 debtor.
 4 MS. HARPER: That --
 5 QUESTION: You didn't acknowledge that? I
 6 thought your brief acknowledged that. I'm -- you -- you
 7 really want to use the discount rate, period, and nothing
 8 -- nothing tagged on top of it.
 9 MS. HARPER: I was going to get to that, but in
 10 certain circumstances an additional risk factor may be
 11 required, but it is our position that there are many other
 12 statutory elements under -- provisions under chapter 13
 13 that cover the types of risks that would normally be
 14 included in a contract, for instance. 
 15 QUESTION: Well, I -- I think the same thing
 16 that's bothering Justice Scalia, or that prompted his
 17 question in any event, is -- is troubling me. When I -- I
 18 read the briefs, I -- I thought that the coerced loan
 19 approach, which you object to, did have certain
 20 deficiencies, because you had to have testimony what the
 21 interest rate is, you have to conform it to the particular
 22 transaction, it's hard to administer. I frankly don't see
 23 how yours is much different because you add a premium to
 24 the prime rate. What is that premium going to be? Why
 25 shouldn't it depend on the transaction? Why shouldn't it

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 depend on the risk of default? Why doesn't your approach
 2 have all of the same problems as the coerced loan
 3 approach?
 4 MS. HARPER: Because you need to limit the
 5 purpose of that premium. Most risk elements are
 6 encompassed within other sections of chapter 13 because
 7 your normal risk of deterioration of the collateral, for
 8 instance -- that's adequate protection. So you don't have
 9 to add on for that. You don't have -- the risk of default
 10 is covered by the fact that there is a wage assignment in
 11 effect. 
 12 I'm saying that in certain instances --
 13 QUESTION: Well, but if that was true, you could
 14 bring up the same thing when you're cross-examining the 15 expert on the coerced loan approach and say, well, we
 16 don't want 21 percent because there's a wage assignment. 
 17 It's the same answer.
 18 MS. HARPER: No. The 21 percent, such as the 21
 19 percent that was in this record, there was no support for
 20 at all. The creditor did not show any basis for --
 21 QUESTION: It showed what the creditor had been
 22 getting before, and that, I thought, was the argument,
 23 that in -- out of chapter 17 -- 13, in chapter 13 our
 24 contract rate was 21 percent, and that represents what it
 25 would cost this borrower if he were today to take those

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 funds, get the same funds. It would cost him 21 percent
 2 because he's a high-risk borrower. That's -- that's the
 3 theory. But you're saying that that is a wrong theory, as
 4 Judge Rovner said in her opinion, but it's -- it's not
 5 because it's more difficult to apply than some other
 6 theory.
 7 MS. HARPER: Well --
 8 QUESTION: I think you're -- you're saying that
 9 that's a wrong approach, and maybe you'll say why.
 10 MS. HARPER: Yes. It's the wrong approach
 11 because the only thing that the creditor is entitled to
 12 protection for under 1325 is the value of the collateral. 
 13 In that 21 percent contract rate, first of all, on the
 14 record in this case the expert couldn't even say what it 15 consisted of. But in your typical contract rate of
 16 interest, you're going to have transaction charges. 
 17 You're going to have the risk of default, which has
 18 already occurred here, the risk of bankruptcy default, for
 19 instance. That risk has already occurred here. The
 20 creditor has already been compensated for that.
 21 QUESTION: You think that makes this a better --
 22 a better borrower? It -- it makes it a safer loan when
 23 you're -- when you're -- you're owed money by somebody who
 24 has already been through bankruptcy once? You think
 25 you're in better shape? 

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. HARPER: In many --
 2 QUESTION: Gee, that's -- that's a novel
 3 approach.
 4 MS. HARPER: In many respects, it is safer
 5 because here you're talking about a subprime lender who
 6 did enter into a contract where it assumed a great amount
 7 of risk, but now the debtor's debt structure, his payment
 8 obligations have been modified by the chapter 13.
 9 QUESTION: So you think a lender has two
 10 different loan candidates in front of him, one he thinks
 11 is going to go through bankruptcy and the other he thinks
 12 is not, so he's going to give the loan to the first one?
 13 MS. HARPER: I think that --
 14 QUESTION: 
 That's -- that's very difficult for 15 me to assume.
 16 MS. HARPER: -- a lender may charge additional
 17 interest if -- under State law if the lender has
 18 indication that the debtor may go through bankruptcy, but
 19 normally in the subprime market, that's all factored in
 20 because most subprime candidates are candidates for
 21 possible bankruptcy in the future.
 22 QUESTION: Is it a fact that most chapter 13
 23 bankrupts don't make it to the end of the program?
 24 MS. HARPER: Well --
 25 QUESTION: In fact, the vast majority fail. 

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. HARPER: That's not necessarily true when
 2 you talk --
 3 QUESTION: I thought we had statistics on that.
 4 MS. HARPER: The problem is most of the
 5 statistics focus on the default rate just from the filing,
 6 the number of filings. They don't focus on the default
 7 rate after the chapter 13 has been confirmed because there
 8 are many -- the case by that point has been reviewed by
 9 the court and it's determined to have been feasible. The
 10 debtor by that point has been making payments for a
 11 substantial period. 
 12 QUESTION: Are there statistics on that kind of
 13 cases that you're describing now?
 14 MS. HARPER: There -- I have found limited
 15 statistics. One study that I found said that 63 percent
 16 of the chapter 13's completed successfully after they
 17 reached the point of confirmation. So there is suggestion
 18 that after the point of confirmation, the success rate
 19 gets much higher, which only makes sense because a lot of
 20 times --
 21 QUESTION: It's still not a very good risk. I
 22 mean, you --
 23 MS. HARPER: Well --
 24 QUESTION: -- you lend money to somebody. Your
 25 chances of getting it back are 2 out of 3?

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. HARPER: The subprime lender's risk in the
 2 open market is not good either. So --
 3 QUESTION: Well, I think it's better than 2 out
 4 of 3.
 5 MS. HARPER: It's five times higher than the
 6 prime market.
 7 QUESTION: Let -- let me ask you a -- the -- the
 8 way I see these two approaches. I'm assuming that -- that
 9 you're -- you're willing to allow over the prime rate some
 10 addition which the -- the courts that -- that follow your
 11 -- your favored approach do allow for risk factor. So
 12 under your theory, you take the prime rate, and then it is
 13 up to the bankruptcy judge to assess what the risk is,
 14 something that I think judges are probably not very well 15 qualified to do.
 16 You know when -- when you pick the prime rate,
 17 that that's not the market rate. It obviously isn't. So
 18 it's well below the market rate. I mean, here you had a
 19 21 percent loan and you're going to take what? I don't
 20 know. A prime rate of 8 percent at most? You know it's
 21 wrong. And then the bankruptcy judge has to make it
 22 right. Okay? 
 23 Under the other approach, you take the market
 24 rate, the rate that was actually adopted between these --
 25 these two people operating in a free market. Now, it --

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 it may be -- may be high, it may be low. You don't know
 2 for sure that it's either one. It's -- it's -- it may be
 3 accurate. It is not surely inaccurate the way picking the
 4 prime is. And then the adjustment to be made by the
 5 bankruptcy judge is much less. If there are some special
 6 factors that show a lesser risk now than there was when
 7 the loan was originally made, he might take them into
 8 account. 
 9 Now, as I see it, the less discretion that is
 10 left to the bankruptcy judge and the more weight that is
 11 given to the -- to the real forces of the operating
 12 market, the better off we are. I -- I don't think that
 13 bankruptcy judges are very good risk calculators.
 14 MS. HARPER: 
 That totally eliminates the fact 15 that a chapter 13 has been filed and that there are
 16 certain minimal requirements for chapter 13 confirmation. 
 17 A -- and the problem is that market rate, the way these
 18 courts have defined it -- has come to mean anything and
 19 everything. We're talking about two different market
 20 rates here. 
 21 QUESTION: I'm talking about using the rate of
 22 the loan that was actually made.
 23 MS. HARPER: But there is nothing in the statute
 24 that requires the creditor to be compensated for all of
 25 those items that were included in the pre-petition

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 contract.
 2 QUESTION: No, but he has to be given the
 3 current value of his security and the current value of his
 4 security, which is not going to be received 20 years from
 5 now or 5 years from now, depends upon how much of a credit
 6 risk there is that that money will actually be paid.
 7 MS. HARPER: How could the -- how could you
 8 possibly contract in advance for the present value of this
 9 particular allowed secured claim, $4,000? That amount
 10 wasn't even known when the contract rate was established. 
 11 The contract rate was based upon particular
 12 characteristics of the creditor and the debtor and many --
 13 QUESTION: In -- in an open market. And if the
 14 debtor could have gotten -- it's a very competitive 15 market, as I understand it. And if the debtor could have
 16 gotten a lower rate elsewhere, he presumably would have.
 17 MS. HARPER: That's --
 18 QUESTION: I'm just saying that that's -- that
 19 that's a reasonable starting point. Now, if there has to
 20 be an adjustment because market rates have gone down since
 21 then, that minor adjustment can be made, but that's going
 22 to be much less of an adjustment than you're going to have
 23 to leave to the bankruptcy judge if you begin with the
 24 prime rate which you know is wrong. You know that nobody
 25 would have made this -- this car loan at the prime rate.

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. HARPER: That's not the question. The
 2 question is not what someone would make a new loan for
 3 because an allowed secured claim in chapter 13 is a claim. 
 4 It's not a loan. Once the bankruptcy is filed --
 5 QUESTION: Let me ask you this -- this piece of
 6 it. The -- Justice Scalia said to give this kind of you-
 7 pick-it discretion to the bankruptcy judge is a worrisome
 8 thing, but all of the cases that take this approach, the
 9 Treasury bill approach or the prime, seem to have a rather
 10 narrow range for that risk factor. They go from 1 percent
 11 to 3 percent, and none of them go over 3 percent. Where
 12 did they -- where did that range -- who invented that
 13 range that 3 percent would be the ceiling?
 14 MS. HARPER: That's a good question. I believe
 15 that it just results from the fact that in your typical
 16 chapter 13, you don't have a lot of special risk that has
 17 to be compensated for because you usually have the fixed
 18 asset, there's no hazard -- hazardous use, you've got a
 19 wage assignment. You -- substantial risk might result,
 20 for instance, in a chapter 13 if you had a balloon
 21 payment. 
 22 QUESTION: A what payment? 
 23 MS. HARPER: A balloon payment instead of
 24 periodic weekly payments, which is usually what you have
 25 in a chapter 13.

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: As I understand it, your expert in
 2 this case, your economist, testified that the prime rate
 3 was 8 percent and that in his view a reasonable risk
 4 premium would be 1.5. But he conceded under cross-
 5 examination that he was unfamiliar with the relevant rates
 6 of default or costs of servicing loans in the subprime
 7 market, which --
 8 MS. HARPER: That's --
 9 QUESTION: -- to my mind is conceding that he
 10 has no basis for picking 1.5 percent. 
 11 MS. HARPER: That 1.5 in that case was actually
 12 a local bankruptcy rule. But that same expert also
 13 testified that prime already includes 2 percent which
 14 could not be accounted for except for risk and transaction 15 fees.
 16 QUESTION: The risk -- the risk of a prime
 17 borrower, of a fat cat borrower. 
 18 MS. HARPER: But, again, we're not talking about
 19 borrowing on a new loan in a chapter 13. The -- we're
 20 talking about modification to an old loan, an existing
 21 loan. 1322(b)(2) allows you to modify that contract. So
 22 we're not looking at what this debtor would have to pay in
 23 the open market were it not for the chapter 13. That's
 24 not the proper inquiry.
 25 If there are no further questions, I would

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 reserve the remainder of my time. 
 2 QUESTION: Very well, Ms. Harper.
 3 Mr. Salmons, we'll hear from you.
 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS
 5 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
 6 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
 7 MR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
 8 may it please the Court:
 9 The court of appeals here held that the
 10 bankruptcy courts are required to presume that the pre-
 11 bankruptcy contract rate of interest, which varies from
 12 creditor to creditor and could range anywhere from 0 to 40
 13 percent or more in some jurisdictions, is the appropriate
 14 discount rate to use in calculating the present value of 15 plan payments under section 1325. Now, that approach is
 16 mistaken, we submit, for three principal reasons.
 17 First, it violates the core bankruptcy principle
 18 of equality of distribution for similarly situated
 19 creditors. Under the court of appeals' approach, two
 20 creditors could make car loans to the same debtor that
 21 resulted in allowed secured claims of equal value, and yet
 22 one would receive thousands more in plan payments solely
 23 because the other made its car loan at a time when the
 24 debtor's financial troubles had not yet become obvious.
 25 QUESTION: Is that right? I just want to be

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 sure I understand the -- the point. I thought if you had
 2 that differential before the bankruptcy judge, it's a --
 3 the original is a presumptive risk, and the judge could
 4 then resolve it by maybe compromising between the two.
 5 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, this is an important
 6 point because I think there is some misconception about
 7 what the court of appeals held in this case, and I think
 8 that's due in part to the fact that respondents, at least
 9 as I read their position, are not really defending the
 10 approach taken by the court of appeals. The court of
 11 appeals did not adopt a presumption in favor of the pre-
 12 bankruptcy contract rate because it thought that that
 13 represented accurately the relevant market, if you will,
 14 for the risks of -- and benefits and protections that 15 exist under the Bankruptcy Code.
 16 In fact, under the court of appeals' approach,
 17 the risk of nonpayment is really irrelevant. What the
 18 court of appeals says is that because the -- the creditor
 19 is denied use of funds for the period of the payment plan,
 20 that it therefore is entitled to whatever rate it would
 21 have gone out and funded a new loan at if it had been
 22 allowed to foreclose and reinvest the proceeds. Now --
 23 QUESTION: I agree with you, and -- and the
 24 respondent is not defending that approach, but rather the
 25 approach that you use the rate of the -- of the original

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 loan as the starting point, and then adjust it as
 2 necessary.
 3 MR. SALMONS: That's correct, and I just want to
 4 emphasize, though, that -- that the adjustment that the
 5 court of appeals would make is not one I think that
 6 anybody before the Court now would defend because the
 7 court of appeals would adjust only if you could prove that
 8 the -- a particular secured creditor is now making loans
 9 at some other rate and there's no reason to think why that
 10 has anything to do with what the present value of plan
 11 payments would be under 1325. And -- and the problem --
 12 QUESTION: So, but you're saying -- but you're
 13 saying that under the respondent's view, that -- that the
 14 creditors would be treated differently? 
 15 MR. SALMONS: If respondent's view is that you
 16 should have a presumption in favor of the pre-bankruptcy
 17 contract rate, then that would be the result. What's not
 18 clear to me is whether it's actually respondent's view
 19 that you should have a presumption in favor of the
 20 subprime contract rate or the highest contract rate
 21 allowed by State law because it's important to remember
 22 that pre-bankruptcy contract rates are going to vary. You
 23 could have a 0 percent lender. You could have a prime
 24 lender, and you could have a subprime lender. And there's
 25 no reason to think that any one of those necessarily

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 captures the unique mix of risks and benefits and
 2 protections that exist under the Bankruptcy Code.
 3 QUESTION: Where do you get the principle that
 4 all secured creditors have to be treated equally? Where
 5 does -- where does that appear? 
 6 MR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, on -- I would
 7 refer you to page 19 --
 8 QUESTION: I'm sure it's true of all unsecured
 9 creditors. I -- I don't know why --
 10 QUESTION: Page 19 of what? 
 11 MR. SALMONS: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I would
 12 refer you to page 19 of the Government's brief where we
 13 refer to two cases by this Court, Bigeur v. the IRS and --
 14 and Union Bank v. Wolas, that stand for the principle that 15 -- that embody the notion that equality of distribution
 16 among creditors is a central policy of the Bankruptcy
 17 Code. That's this Court's language. 
 18 QUESTION: Similarly situated creditors.
 19 MR. SALMONS: To be sure, Your Honor. 
 20 QUESTION: Not secured versus unsecured.
 21 MR. SALMONS: That's why I gave the example that
 22 I did of two creditors that extend car loans and the only
 23 difference between them -- they have the exact same
 24 allowed value under the code for their claim. The only
 25 difference between them is that one made its loan 2 years

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 prior to bankruptcy when the -- when the debtor's credit
 2 history was not quite as bad and the other made it 2 weeks
 3 before bankruptcy when the only rate the debtor could get
 4 is --
 5 QUESTION: Well, why isn't that a valid
 6 distinction? 
 7 MR. SALMONS: Because, Your Honor, from the
 8 standpoint of section 1325(a)(5), the relevant inquiry is
 9 what is the present value of the promised future payments
 10 from the debtor. All creditors are now facing the exact
 11 same situation, and I think respondent concedes this. And
 12 those are the risks of inflation, the time value of money,
 13 and the risk that particular payments may not be made
 14 under a plan. And there's no reason to think --
 15 QUESTION: Well, and the risk --
 16 MR. SALMONS: -- that those are different for
 17 creditors --
 18 QUESTION: The risk of the security will just
 19 disappear too, you know, be totally devalued.
 20 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I don't think that's
 21 embodied in section 1325(a)(5). If anything, that's
 22 captured in the higher replacement value standard for the
 23 valuing of the underlying claim that this Court adopted in
 24 Rash. And I would add that -- that one reason to think
 25 why the discount rate here doesn't need to go too far in

1 taking risks of nonpayment into account is that this Court
 2 in Rash adopted the underlying value here, replacement
 3 value, that's typically significantly higher than what
 4 the --
 5 QUESTION: What has that to do with it? I don't
 6 see what that has to do with it at all. 
 7 MR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, what --
 8 QUESTION: I mean, the reason I say that is I
 9 thought we were following a statute, and what the statute
 10 tells us is that the value of what they receive has to
 11 equal $4,000. They receive a set of promises to pay so
 12 much a month and the right to repossess if those promises
 13 are not kept. Now, that's what the statute tells us to
 14 do. So let's do it. 
 What do we care how they arrived at 15 the $4,000?
 16 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, my only point is that
 17 this Court in Rash noted that the higher replacement --
 18 QUESTION: Whatever it said in Rash, reading the
 19 statute, unless they actually contradicted that, doesn't
 20 the statute say what I just said? So the problem in the
 21 case is how do we value the stream of payments plus the
 22 repossession value?
 23 MR. SALMONS: I think --
 24 QUESTION: I would have thought that that kind
 25 of thing is something bankruptcy judges are paid to make

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 judgments about all the time.
 2 MR. SALMONS: Well, I -- I generally agree with
 3 -- with Your Honor's statement. What -- what I would add,
 4 though, is that the dispute in this case is not -- I mean,
 5 it's undisputed that inflation and the time value of money
 6 have to be taken into account under -- under the discount
 7 rate. The only question is whether you have to take into
 8 account the risks of nonpayment. We submit that there --
 9 QUESTION: Of course, you do. Of course, you
 10 do. There is a risk of nonpayment and anything that
 11 didn't take that into account would not be equating the
 12 property with the $4,000. 
 13 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, if -- if this Court
 14 believes that risks of nonpayment need to be taken into 15 account, then we submit that the best way to do that is to
 16 start with a market indicator such as the prime rate that
 17 captures the time value of money and the risk of inflation
 18 and then -- then allow -- and -- and some risk of
 19 nonpayment, and then allow the bankruptcy court, which --
 20 which, by the way, has just made a determination under
 21 1325(a)(6) about the likelihood that -- that the payments
 22 will be made. And it has made --
 23 QUESTION: Start with a figure that you know for
 24 sure is wrong. You know for sure that this person who got
 25 a 21 percent car loan because he was a bad credit risk was

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 never going to get the prime rate of 8 percent. 
 2 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor --
 3 QUESTION: Why begin with -- with something --
 4 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the answer to your
 5 question --
 6 QUESTION: -- that you know is going to be
 7 abysmally low except for the fact that it will mean less
 8 money for the secured creditors and more money for the
 9 unsecured creditors, among whom is often numbered the
 10 United States? 
 11 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor -- Your Honor, the
 12 answer to your question --
 13 (Laughter.) 
 14 MR. SALMONS: 
 The answer to your question is 15 because there is no rate you can find that -- that
 16 precisely reflects the unique mix of risks and benefits
 17 and protections that are available under the Bankruptcy
 18 Code. And so by definition, everyone here is talking
 19 about a proxy in some form or another. 
 20 Now, what the prime rate does do is is it
 21 accurately captures the time value of money and inflation. 
 22 Now, we submit that the bankruptcy court, which has just
 23 examined the plan -- it has made a determination. In
 24 fact, it has found that the payments -- that the debtor
 25 will be able to make the payments under the plan -- that

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 bankruptcy court is in the best position to make a
 2 determination about plan-specific risks of nonpayment if
 3 those risks are going to be included. And that's a much
 4 more efficient system than forcing the bankruptcy court to
 5 go out and try and find some -- some elusive market that
 6 -- that would serve as a proxy for that determination.
 7 QUESTION: Well, you could ask them to just look
 8 at the contract rate and, if need be, make some adjustment
 9 to that because of the fact that they won't have to --
 10 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor --
 11 QUESTION: -- go through the collection process.
 12 MR. SALMONS: -- the difficulty with the
 13 contract rate approach is that it varies from creditor to
 14 creditor, and there really is no reason to think that -15 that either secured creditors, or unsecured creditors for
 16 that matter, for purposes of -- of this case, should be
 17 treated differently. They all face the exact same risks
 18 of nonpayment, the exact same problems of inflation and
 19 time value of money. They are similarly situated. 
 20 QUESTION: In this case, as I understand it,
 21 this lender always charged 21 percent. It didn't differ
 22 from -- from lender -- borrower to borrower. Every one of
 23 them was charged 21 percent. That was the market.
 24 MR. SALMONS: And -- and another secured
 25 creditor may have made a loan prior to that at a prime

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 rate to the same debtor, and it always charges the prime
 2 rate, neither of which is particularly relevant to the
 3 question of what's the value of the promised payments
 4 under the plan. 
 5 QUESTION: But if the second one was so stupid
 6 as to do that, why should he be protected? 
 7 MR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, it's not a
 8 matter of stupidity. It's a matter of the fact that a
 9 debtor's position changes over time and that what may be a
 10 good rate 2 years out from bankruptcy and that is still
 11 owed would not be the rate you'd give immediately before
 12 bankruptcy. And it may not be the relevant risks of
 13 nonpayment that exist under bankruptcy.
 14 The point is that -- is that as -- as this Court 15 understood in Rash, the -- the creditor is entitled to the
 16 value of its allowed secured claim, and this Court noted
 17 in Rash that already compensates significant risks of
 18 nonpayment. 
 19 Now, I would add, if I may --
 20 QUESTION: Because if this had been foreclosure
 21 value, then if we were going through this exercise, well,
 22 the creditor would -- would then sell the asset and -- and
 23 charge a -- a new borrower with the same rate of interest. 
 24 But the asset would be worth much less than the price --
 25 MR. SALMONS: That -- that's correct, and Your

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Honor, I would add that in fact we think it's possible to
 2 read the statute so there's no risk of nonpayment at all
 3 because the statute refers to property to be distributed
 4 under the plan, and it requires the bankruptcy court to
 5 make a finding that the debtor will be able to make
 6 payments. And there's no guidance whatsoever that would
 7 give bankruptcy courts a way to do anything more, and so
 8 we think in fact that an appropriate rate could even be
 9 the Treasury bill rate which --
 10 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Salmons. 
 11 MR. SALMONS: -- excludes that. 
 12 Thank you. 
 13 QUESTION: Mr. Brunstad, we'll hear from you.
 14 ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR. 15 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 16 MR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 17 please the Court:
 18 The formula approach is surely inaccurate. It
 19 systematically under-values the true risks and costs of a
 20 chapter 13 promise of repayment. We know at best
 21 statistically that chapter 13 debtors at best have a 40
 22 percent rate of -- of payment on the plans.
 23 QUESTION: How -- how many default? 
 24 QUESTION: Your -- your opponent says that the
 25 -- that that's -- if you're taking after the thing is

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 confirmed, after -- that it's a 63 percent.
 2 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor. There -- there
 3 is one study that suggests that, but I must -- I must add
 4 that -- that there are other studies that say that the
 5 successful completion rate is as low as 3 percent in some
 6 jurisdictions. Some 97 percent of chapter 13 fail.
 7 QUESTION: After confirmation.
 8 MR. BRUNSTAD: Those are -- that's a total
 9 number, Your Honor. 
 10 QUESTION: Okay. That's the difference between
 11 your statistics --
 12 QUESTION: Yes.
 13 QUESTION: -- and hers.
 14 QUESTION: Since -- and since this is an after-
 15 confirmation case, why -- why don't we take that
 16 percentage? 
 17 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Your Honor, giving them the
 18 benefit of the doubt, we -- the best we can say, based
 19 upon what we know, is approximately a 63 percent success
 20 rate.
 21 QUESTION: After --
 22 QUESTION: What do you say to Mr. Salmons'
 23 argument that in fact the -- the plan is not supposed to
 24 be confirmed unless the judge makes a -- a determination
 25 that it can be followed, and it therefore isn't legitimate

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to take this kind of risk into consideration at all?
 2 MR. BRUNSTAD: It's what we call the feasibility
 3 standard, Your Honor, and it applies in every single one
 4 of the reorganization chapters. The bankruptcy court must
 5 merely determine that the bankruptcy judge feels that the
 6 debtor will successfully complete the plan. We know,
 7 however, that given the extremely high rate of default in
 8 chapter 13, which far exceeds chapter 11, for example,
 9 that the feasibility standard doesn't even come close to
 10 ensuring --
 11 QUESTION: Well, how do we know how -- how many
 12 -- what's the percentage of people in this chapter that
 13 default within a year on -- on a payment of about $128 a
 14 month I guess, that was a small percentage of what they 15 were paying into the court? What's the figure?
 16 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, there are two sources. The
 17 best statistics that I've been able to come up with is
 18 that it's about a 60 percent failure rate.
 19 QUESTION: 60 percent fail within a year? You
 20 said that 40 percent failed overall. 
 21 MR. BRUNSTAD: 60 percent fail within the 3- to
 22 5-year period.
 23 QUESTION: No. I asked you how many -- this is
 24 -- or let's take it then giving you the benefit of the
 25 doubt. The payment plan was for 17 months. What is the

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 percentage of people who fail to make a -- I guess it was
 2 about 10 percent or 20 percent of the amount he was paying
 3 into court. How many fail to make that kind of payment
 4 within 17 months?
 5 MR. BRUNSTAD: The statistics are not
 6 disaggregated on that basis, Your Honor. 
 7 QUESTION: Correct. That's what I would think.
 8 So what is wrong with us saying just by chance
 9 what the statute says? What the statute says is,
 10 bankruptcy judge, here's what you do. You create a stream
 11 of payments such that that stream of payments plus the
 12 value of the repossession equals $4,000. Now, that's your
 13 job. Go do it. So I would have thought, if I were the
 14 bankruptcy judge, the way I'd do it would be by looking to 15 the prime rate and then asking me -- asking you or others
 16 to tell me how much riskier this is than the prime rate,
 17 and I'd choose a number. And I can't imagine how we're
 18 going to come one whit closer than that general
 19 instruction, but you'll tell me why it is possible to come
 20 closer.
 21 MR. BRUNSTAD: Your Honor, the contract rate is
 22 the best evidence, the single best evidence of the market
 23 rate. 
 24 QUESTION: Contract rate -- if there has to be a
 25 number that's wrong, it has to be that one.

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BRUNSTAD: But it is less --
 2 QUESTION: The contract rate by definition was
 3 entered into at some significant period of time prior to
 4 the present, and the present, by chance in this instance,
 5 is 2 years later, and we know that interest rates fell at
 6 least 1 or 2 percent during that time.
 7 MR. BRUNSTAD: But not for subprime --
 8 QUESTION: So -- what?
 9 MR. BRUNSTAD: But not for subprime loans.
 10 QUESTION: That's impossible. The prime rate --
 11 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. This is why. 
 12 QUESTION: If that's so, then the risk went up.
 13 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, that's not correct, Your
 14 Honor, and this is why. 
 15 QUESTION: No. It isn't? 
 16 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because State law caps the
 17 maximum rate that can be paid. 
 18 QUESTION: Oh, okay. Okay. 
 19 MR. BRUNSTAD: So it increases the pool --
 20 QUESTION: All right. All right.
 21 MR. BRUNSTAD: -- of who can be lent to, but not
 22 the rate. 
 23 QUESTION: All right, because it's a usury
 24 problem. 
 25 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. 

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: So -- so you would be free with your
 2 experts to come in and say why it happens to be that the
 3 bankruptcy judge is wrong to take the prime rate and add a
 4 risk factor, but ordinarily a contract entered into in
 5 advance would not be good evidence of what the interest
 6 rate is today. Now, where am I wrong in that?
 7 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because, again, the contract rate
 8 is the best evidence of a market rate between this
 9 borrower and this lender with this particular --
 10 QUESTION: At a prior time. 
 11 MR. BRUNSTAD: At a particular time --
 12 QUESTION: Yes. 
 13 MR. BRUNSTAD: -- particularly if it's
 14 contemporaneous to the filing. It reflects it and --
 15 QUESTION: Oh, yes, of course. I'm -- but I'm
 16 -- I'm simply saying isn't it true by definition that a
 17 contract entered into at an earlier period of time where
 18 interest rates fluctuate is not going to be very good
 19 interest -- evidence of what that interest rate is today.
 20 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Your Honor, the contract
 21 rate is not perfect, but it's far superior to the formula
 22 approach, and what you see happening -- Justice Ginsburg,
 23 the Second Circuit in the Valenti case came up with a 3-
 24 point factor, just simply canvassing some lower court
 25 decisions and decided prime rate plus 1, 2, or 3 points. 

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 It's not based on any evidence. It's just simply based
 2 upon what the court felt was an appropriate range.
 3 QUESTION: Your --
 4 QUESTION: If you take Mr. Salmons' point that
 5 now we're in bankruptcy, it's a different world, and we've
 6 got one creditor -- let's say $4,000 is the principal for
 7 both, but one lent at prime and one lent at subprime. 
 8 Once we're in the universe of bankruptcy, why shouldn't
 9 those two lenders, both with $4,000 principals, be treated
 10 the same? 
 11 MR. BRUNSTAD: If their risks are different,
 12 they should be treated differently, Your Honor. 
 13 QUESTION: But once you're in the bankruptcy,
 14 the risk of getting back the $4,000 is the same for both 15 creditors, isn't it? 
 16 MR. BRUNSTAD: Not necessarily so, Your Honor. 
 17 You can take a situation. Say you have a hotel, a common
 18 asset in bankruptcy. The hotel may have a senior secured
 19 creditor and a junior secured creditor. The number one
 20 secured creditor's risks are materially less than the
 21 junior secured creditor's. They would be separately
 22 classified. Because their risks are different, the
 23 interest rates are different. 
 24 In this very case at page 12 of the joint
 25 appendix, you can see how the debtor broke down its four

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 secured creditors into four separate categories, and they
 2 have different rates. Two secured creditors are offered
 3 9.5 percent and two are offered 0 percent interest for the
 4 payments the debtor is going to make. 
 5 The concept of equality of distribution is
 6 precisely equality of distribution among similarly
 7 situated creditors. Secured creditors are each unique by
 8 their own definition of the risks that they take. They
 9 have collateral. 
 10 QUESTION: And your response to Justice Breyer's
 11 question, as I understand it, is that 21 percent may not
 12 be precisely what the rate is today for a loan made 3
 13 years ago, but it's going to be a lot closer to it than 8
 14 percent is.
 15 MR. BRUNSTAD: That, plus the fact that the 21
 16 percent is often going to be actually too low to reflect
 17 the actual risk being assumed.
 18 QUESTION: Well, that may be. Well, that may
 19 be, but what I didn't understand about your answer is when
 20 you said that the contract rate must be more accurate than
 21 the formula.
 22 MR. BRUNSTAD: It seems to be.
 23 QUESTION: Since the formula by definition is
 24 perfect --
 25 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. 

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Since the formula is an instruction
 2 to equate the value of the stream of payments plus
 3 repossession with $4,000, the formula by definition is
 4 perfect. So --
 5 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. 
 6 QUESTION: Well, why isn't it?
 7 MR. BRUNSTAD: The formula rate is essentially
 8 standardless, and what we have seen how bankruptcy courts
 9 apply the --
 10 QUESTION: You're saying I take -- you're saying
 11 that --
 12 QUESTION: But yours is in theory perfect.
 13 QUESTION: Wait. No, no. Answer --
 14 MR. BRUNSTAD: Imperfect. That's correct. 
 15 QUESTION: No, no. Yours is in theory perfect
 16 just as -- as the formula is in theory perfect. In both
 17 of them you -- you begin with a starting point, and then
 18 you make whatever adjustments the reality of the risk
 19 requires. That brings you theoretically in both cases a
 20 perfect answer.
 21 The only question is, as a practical matter,
 22 which of the two is likely to come closer to the correct
 23 answer, starting with 8 percent that you know is way off
 24 the mark and then letting the bankruptcy judge figure out
 25 how much you add to that, or starting with 21 percent

33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 which, you know, is -- is -- it could be high, it could be
 2 low. It's much fairer to both parties, but then let the
 3 bankruptcy judge adjust that a little bit. That's the
 4 question: what -- what the practical consequence is not
 5 the -- the theoretical. They're both perfect
 6 theoretically. 
 7 MR. BRUNSTAD: In theory, Your Honor, yes, but
 8 we must be faithful to is the statutory command. And here
 9 what we see happening is what happens in this case. A
 10 bankruptcy judge takes the formula approach, a --
 11 basically a low rate, the prime rate, and is supposed to
 12 adjust it. And what do they do? Well, there's no
 13 evidence to support any adjustment in this particular
 14 case. 
 The debtors' expert did not testify that he knew 15 anything about the risks of these particular debtors. 
 16 There's no basis for the adjustment. The bankruptcy court
 17 did what bankruptcy courts do in these cases; it simply
 18 picked a number.
 19 QUESTION: Well, couldn't the creditor have
 20 brought in an expert?
 21 MR. BRUNSTAD: The creditor did bring in two
 22 witnesses, and the witnesses testified that these
 23 particular debtors with their particular credit histories
 24 would be charged a 21 percent rate of interest. 
 25 QUESTION: Well, can you tell me why is it that

34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the petitioners tell us that their standard is so much
 2 easier to administer? Is it because the courts aren't
 3 administering it in the right way? As I listened to it,
 4 it seems to me I have two choices. I can begin with a low
 5 rate and add or I can begin with a high rate and -- and
 6 subtract. Why -- why is one any more easy to administer
 7 than -- than the other?
 8 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because --
 9 QUESTION: In fact, it -- it would seem to me --
 10 and this I suppose helps you -- that if the courts which
 11 are using the petitioners' formula are doing it the right
 12 way, it might even be harder to administer. They -- they
 13 avoid that problem by just accepting some interest factor
 14 of 1 to 3 percent out of the blue although I don't know 15 how they do that. 
 16 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, what we
 17 have is we have three circuits which have adopted the
 18 formula approach, and so we have the experience of the
 19 courts in those circuits, and we have the balance of the
 20 circuits, approximately seven, that have taken more of the
 21 market rate approach. And what we see happening is that
 22 in those situations where the bankruptcy courts are
 23 applying the formula approach, they are systematically
 24 giving chapter 13 debtors a rate of interest pretty close
 25 to prime. Now, that can't be correct. That gives the

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 debtors with the single highest default rate in bankruptcy
 2 the lowest rates available in bankruptcy.
 3 QUESTION: Would it satisfy you if we said this? 
 4 Suppose we said we see what we're after here. The
 5 objective is to equate the stream of payments plus
 6 repossession with $4,000. Now, on the one hand, we know
 7 it can't be lower than the prime. On the other hand, if
 8 the creditor wants to come in and give a -- present his
 9 evidence, the contract, of how risky this person is, then
 10 in fact it is evidence absolutely. And the bankruptcy
 11 judge will look at it, and he'll try to figure out the
 12 pluses and the minuses, what's happened to the interest
 13 rate, whether this particular person is a good or bad
 14 risk, and he'll choose a number. 
 Don't judges do things 15 like that all the time? 
 16 MR. BRUNSTAD: And apparently incorrectly
 17 systematically in chapter 13 cases.
 18 QUESTION: But no. But does what I say satisfy
 19 you? 
 20 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. And here's why.
 21 QUESTION: If not -- because? 
 22 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because the true market rate of
 23 interest is almost always going to be at least the
 24 contract rate, presumptive contract rate, because the
 25 costs in chapter 13 are so much more extraordinarily

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 higher than the costs of collection outside of chapter 13. 
 2 The automatic stay stays in place for the duration of the
 3 plan. If you have a default, the secured party has to
 4 come back to the bankruptcy court, hire an attorney, pay a
 5 $75 filing fee, argue the case. Bankruptcy judges
 6 routinely give the debtor a second chance to cure the
 7 default. They have to come back. The costs of collection
 8 -- that's even before you get to foreclose on your
 9 collateral. The costs of --
 10 QUESTION: But don't you get certain advantages? 
 11 I mean, you do have the wage order. So there's a court
 12 supervising that this wage -- every month that this
 13 person, this borrower, is going to have to pay.
 14 And in the -- in -- in that setting you also 15 have -- going back to Rash, the one thing I don't
 16 understand about it because it seems you want to take it
 17 the high side both ways. You've already been given the
 18 replacement value rather than the foreclosure value.
 19 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Your Honor. 
 20 QUESTION: So if we're going to do it your way
 21 and say, well, now, suppose the lender foreclosed on the
 22 asset, made a new loan at the 21 percent rate -- but you
 23 would have to use not the replacement value, the higher
 24 value. You could only use what you could get on
 25 foreclosure if we follow your theory about we should make

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 it just like you sold the asset, got money, and made a new
 2 loan. But the -- but you -- but the amount that you got
 3 would be much less than the replacement value which is
 4 what you're getting inside the bankruptcy.
 5 MR. BRUNSTAD: Your Honor, the secured creditor
 6 in the chapter 13 cramdown context is not trying to make
 7 any profit. It's simply trying to mitigate against the
 8 enormous losses that it suffers. 
 9 QUESTION: But isn't that one of the adjustments
 10 that would have to be made? You couldn't say adjust 20
 11 percent against $4,000. You'd have to say $4,000 minus
 12 because your foreclosure price is going to be much lower
 13 than the replacement costs that you've got in the
 14 bankruptcy.
 15 MR. BRUNSTAD: But taking the extremely high
 16 risks of default and the costs of actually having to
 17 foreclose in the chapter 13 context, the relevant market
 18 rate for the value of the stream of payments is always
 19 going to be at least the -- the pre-bankruptcy contract
 20 rate. In fact, it should --
 21 QUESTION: Mr. Brunstad --
 22 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.
 23 QUESTION: -- let me suggest a scary thought.
 24 (Laughter.) 
 25 QUESTION: Is it -- is it possible that the

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 statute does not provide an answer to this question? 
 2 (Laughter.) 
 3 QUESTION: That since both of these schemes,
 4 your proposal and the other side's proposal, are
 5 theoretically perfect, if they are done correctly, the
 6 bankruptcy court is free to use either one so long as he
 7 comes up with the right answer.
 8 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. 
 9 QUESTION: I mean, the only thing the statute
 10 says is what -- what Justice Breyer keeps coming back to. 
 11 You have to provide him $4,000 in value.
 12 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. The -- the
 13 bankruptcy statutes sometimes are obscure until we see
 14 where they come from, which is why we often look at their 15 history. The master concept of cramdown is indubitable
 16 equivalence. It comes from Judge Hand's opinion in the
 17 Murel Holdings case. And the example in 1325(a)(5)(B)
 18 that we're talking about is simply an example of
 19 indubitable equivalence. The secured party must be fully
 20 compensated for the risk that it must assume. The concept
 21 of indubitable equivalence must be completely
 22 compensatory. The secured party is not supposed to take
 23 uncompensated risk.
 24 QUESTION: Nobody is disagreeing with you about
 25 that. That -- what we're -- I think what we're trying to

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 get to -- it's a practical question. I actually think my
 2 approach is more perfect than Justice Scalia's perfect
 3 approach. 
 4 (Laughter.) 
 5 QUESTION: But the reason is it asks the right
 6 question. 
 7 Now, what you're telling me is that by asking
 8 the right question, the bankruptcy judges systematically
 9 have not done it right. And -- and I see your point. So
 10 -- so what we're -- so we're trying to think of a form of
 11 words we could say which would lead -- I can't say take
 12 the contract rate because I know that must be wrong.
 13 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. 
 14 QUESTION: 
 We could say take the contract rate 15 and go down, and then they'll have the same problem. I --
 16 I mean -- all right. But that's what we want them to do,
 17 is to honestly equate the value of the payments with the
 18 $4,000.
 19 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor. 
 20 QUESTION: I think everybody wants that, and
 21 we're searching -- at least I am -- for a way of how to do
 22 that. You keep telling me you take contract rate. I hate
 23 to tell you I keep thinking no.
 24 MR. BRUNSTAD: As a presumptive rate, Your
 25 Honor. And it's important to understand just after this

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Court's decision in Rash set the valuation standard for
 2 setting the principal amount, what you see now is that
 3 since we got the standard right, in 99 percent of the
 4 cases, the parties come to an agreement as to what the
 5 value of the collateral is. Once we get the standard
 6 right here, you should expect the same thing. It won't be
 7 litigated over and over again. 
 8 The correct standard is I think to recognize,
 9 which I think Your Honor does, that this concept of
 10 present value is an economic concept, not an equitable
 11 one, and that essentially what we're doing is we're saying
 12 there is a stream of payments to be made here and we have
 13 to figure out what it's worth. The best test for what
 14 it's worth would be what the market says. 
 15 Now, the problem is, is that in chapter 11 there
 16 is a market. People do lend to chapter 11 debtors, and
 17 the standard is the same in chapter 11 as 13: value as of
 18 the effective date of the plan under 1129. So what we --
 19 we have to be very careful about is in chapter 11, the
 20 markets do value debtors' promises to pay and they lend
 21 money and they charge very high interest rates. Exit
 22 lenders or finance lenders charge very high interest
 23 rates, 18, 19, 20 percent. It can't be true that in
 24 bankruptcy, in chapter 13, who are the riskiest chapter --
 25 riskiest debtors with the highest default rate, that we

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 systematically give them a rate which approaches prime. 
 2 So I think what you need to do, recognizing it's an
 3 economic concept, is say what's the best evidence of a
 4 market rate.
 5 QUESTION: I understand. Tell me an -- a
 6 question I don't know the answer to.
 7 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor. 
 8 QUESTION: When -- when -- if you repossess --
 9 if he defaults again -- I mean, the first time he got into
 10 bankruptcy. Now, we've got the plan.
 11 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes. 
 12 QUESTION: And suppose he doesn't make the
 13 payments on the truck. Does it then cost you a lot of
 14 money to go back even though you say to the judge, judge, 15 this is the second time? We'd like our truck now. It's
 16 only worth $2,000 now. And you still have to pay the $75,
 17 get your witnesses and everything the second time?
 18 MR. BRUNSTAD: What happens the second time,
 19 Your Honor, is if the debtor defaults under the plan, the
 20 automatic stay is still in effect. Unlike chapter 11
 21 cases, where the automatic stay terminates when the plan
 22 is confirmed or becomes effective, here the automatic stay
 23 stays in place until the end of the repayment period. So
 24 if the debtor defaults under the plan, someone has to go
 25 back to court and say, I need relief. I need relief from

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the automatic stay to exercise my collection rights. 
 2 A corporation like SCS can't go back to court
 3 pro se. It needs a lawyer. You have to hire somebody to
 4 go and represent them. You have to pay a filing fee. 
 5 Oftentimes the bankruptcy judge gives the debtor a second
 6 chance to cure the default under the plan. Then the
 7 debtor says I'll cure, and then you come back a second
 8 time, sometimes a third time, sometimes a fourth time,
 9 sometimes a fifth time, incurring costs at each juncture. 
 10 On loans that typically range between $5 to $15,000,
 11 having to go to court even once --
 12 QUESTION: Is that compensated for to some
 13 extent --
 14 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. 
 15 QUESTION: -- that factor by the fact they're
 16 using Blue Book value to value the car rather than what
 17 it'd actually be worth in your hands once you repossess
 18 it?
 19 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. I think that
 20 covers the depreciation problem. As we have delay and not
 21 payment, we have a rapidly depreciating asset, which the
 22 debtor is continuing to possess and drive around. This
 23 interest rate compensate for the risk of nonpayment of the
 24 promises to pay after confirmation and the costs
 25 associated with the debtor's default if the debtor does

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 default under the plan. 
 2 QUESTION: I -- I don't think it's certainly
 3 conclusive of the point, but the initial 21 percent rate,
 4 I take it, did take into account the risk of default. So
 5 in a sense, the creditor has received up front some
 6 compensation for the risk that in fact has occurred.
 7 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, but at the time the loan is
 8 made, Your Honor, we don't know who in the pool of -- of
 9 debtors is going to default. Once the default happens --
 10 QUESTION: Well, but -- but overall, you account
 11 for that.
 12 MR. BRUNSTAD: Overall the risks are spread, but
 13 if you force the secured party to systematically subsidize
 14 interest rates to chapter 13 debtors, who have now 15 demonstrated by their filing they are the riskiest of the
 16 risky, what you will eventually have happen is a
 17 contraction of the ability to lend.
 18 QUESTION: But -- but your original -- you
 19 charge 21 percent, and a lot of people are going to
 20 successfully pay that and that stream there takes into
 21 consideration some account for those who don't pay and go
 22 into bankruptcy, doesn't it? 
 23 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor, but we shouldn't
 24 reward those who file bankruptcy with a rate that is less,
 25 since they are the riskiest of the risky, than we would

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 charge the other members of the pool who avoid bankruptcy.
 2 QUESTION: Maybe they're not.
 3 QUESTION: The -- the Bankruptcy Code, I take
 4 it, has solicitude for debtors. Isn't that one of its
 5 purposes?
 6 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, but --
 7 QUESTION: Or does that just drop out when we
 8 come to the cramdown problem? 
 9 MR. BRUNSTAD: As this Court indicated in the
 10 Johnson case, section 1325(a)(5)(B) is for the protection
 11 of creditors. It is a limit on the debtor's ability to
 12 adjust or restructure the creditor's rights. It is the
 13 creditor's protection. The debtor has options. If the
 14 debtor wants to surrender the collateral, it may and 15 discharge the debt. That is the protection for the
 16 debtor.
 17 QUESTION: But what about then taking this idea? 
 18 I'm trying to figure out how -- we say, okay, we really
 19 mean it. It has to equate those two things. Now, that
 20 put -- and -- and then stop and say, you can do it with --
 21 I -- I think, you know, prime plus or whatever, maybe the
 22 other. But -- but then put the burden back on you to
 23 produce some real evidence and statistics about what
 24 happens to people we don't know about.
 25 Now, who are those people? We agree they've

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 gone into bankruptcy, so they're risky, but they're also
 2 trying to get a second chance, and they also want to keep
 3 things like the truck because it will help them in their
 4 business. And the bankruptcy judge has sat there and
 5 looked them in the eye. And you have all those things
 6 about it which you don't have about the people you're
 7 giving the 21 percent to which is a great mass of
 8 undifferentiated people.
 9 So then you have the burden of trying to bear it
 10 out with statistics and so forth that these people really
 11 are risky. And the bankruptcy judge can't just sit there
 12 and say, oh, I feel sorry for them. All right? What
 13 about something like that?
 14 MR. BRUNSTAD: 
 Well, Your Honor, when we get to 15 the chapter 13 confirmation stage, we're in a similar
 16 position as when we are at the beginning of making loans
 17 to a pool of applicants. We don't know who's going to
 18 default and who doesn't. We do know that a large
 19 percentage will. We do know that the best evidence of a
 20 market rate for these particular class of borrowers is the
 21 contract rate. And the question then becomes, do we want
 22 to have a system which requires us in each bankruptcy case
 23 then to take evidence complicatedly in 471,000 chapter 13
 24 cases as to, gee, we need statistics and evidence as to
 25 this individualized debtor?

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: No, I mean, you wouldn't have to go
 2 that far. Maybe you just have to do it in one or two. 
 3 But at least we'd get to the stage of people who have
 4 trucks and use them for a year and, you know, at least
 5 we'd have somewhat better information than just knowing
 6 about the default rate in bankruptcy cases in general. 
 7 And we get a little finer than that. You see, that's what
 8 I'm trying to work with. I don't have an answer. 
 9 MR. BRUNSTAD: I understand. 
 10 QUESTION: I'm asking.
 11 MR. BRUNSTAD: I understand, Your Honor, and I
 12 wish I could give you a precise formula. The problem is
 13 that these things are normally left to the market to do. 
 14 Congress has said -- Congress has said basically use an 15 economic market concept here in a context in which the
 16 default rate is so high that lenders are just not willing
 17 to lend to chapter 13 debtors. Again --
 18 QUESTION: But -- but I -- I thought the
 19 difficulty of administration charge was the one that the
 20 petitioners were making against you. How -- how do I sort
 21 that out?
 22 MR. BRUNSTAD: And I think -- I think it was
 23 Your Honor who also mentioned that -- that our standard is
 24 no less cumbersome than theirs. We think it is superior
 25 because it will yield the correct result more often.

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: No more cumbersome. Surely, you mean
 2 it's no more cumbersome than theirs. 
 3 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I
 4 misspoke. Excuse me.
 5 QUESTION: Well, Mr. -- Mr. -- it is to this
 6 extent. Most of these debtors are very small debtors. 
 7 You say take the contract rate as the presumptive rate and
 8 then we're going to knock down for all these other things. 
 9 The high replacement cost that -- is one thing. The
 10 interest that they got before bankruptcy is another. The
 11 transaction cost that they're saved, another. And so let
 12 the debtor come in and show that. But the debtor has no
 13 money at all and certainly you don't want the debtor's
 14 money eaten up hiring an attorney and further depleting 15 the money that could go to the creditors.
 16 So it seems to me wildly unrealistic to expect
 17 that if you say the presumptive price is the contract
 18 price, you're going to get a debtor who will be able to --
 19 I mean, I was surprised, looking at this record, that this
 20 debtor got an expert. Who -- who paid the expert? Maybe
 21 because the union was involved? 
 22 MR. BRUNSTAD: I do not know the answer to that,
 23 Your Honor. 
 24 QUESTION: But isn't it typical that these
 25 chapter 13 debtors don't have lawyers and don't have

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 experts? 
 2 MR. BRUNSTAD: No. They often have lawyers,
 3 Your Honor. 
 4 But let me suggest this. If the Court were to
 5 set the rate at the presumptive -- the contract rate as
 6 the presumptive rate, this is what would happen and this
 7 is what has happened in circuits where that is so. The --
 8 the contract rate becomes the presumptive rate, and in
 9 most cases the debtor will offer that in its plan -- in
 10 his or her plan as the appropriate rate. If the debtor
 11 doesn't like that, we'll offer less of a rate and then
 12 what happens is a negotiation. And the debtor and the
 13 secured party get together and they negotiate based upon
 14 the debtor's presentation of this is why I think it should 15 be adjusted off of that because my circumstances have
 16 improved or there's a lot of equity in this particular
 17 collateral, so your risks are less, so you're more
 18 protected. And those various reasons can then be given,
 19 and then the parties can negotiate. 
 20 If, however, you set a standard where the
 21 bankruptcy court is just simply going to decide based upon
 22 the evidence that the parties put in, we're not going to
 23 adopt the formula approach, then you'll be back to the
 24 problem where we are before, lots of litigation. Again,
 25 because the contract rate is the best evidence of a -- of

49
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 a market rate between these parties, it should be the
 2 presumptive rate and we should work from that.
 3 QUESTION: Is there any --
 4 QUESTION: May I ask you a question that's run
 5 through my mind listening to this argument? Going back to
 6 the Rash case, was it, that we --
 7 QUESTION: Yes. 
 8 QUESTION: -- we did not there -- the majority
 9 did not there. I was in dissent in that case. 
 10 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor. 
 11 QUESTION: -- did not take the case to try and
 12 replicate what would have happened if there had been no
 13 bankruptcy. They said, we won't -- won't treat it as a --
 14 now, you're in effect asking we do treat the case as close 15 as possible to what you would have negotiated in a free
 16 market.
 17 MR. BRUNSTAD: Not quite, Your Honor. I think
 18 actually this is the same analysis as in Rash. What the
 19 Court said in Rash that the parties had to do was the
 20 debtor had to go out -- the debtor already has the truck
 21 -- had the truck in Rash -- is go out and see what it
 22 would have cost the debtor to replace that truck. It
 23 didn't actually do it, but simply say what would it have
 24 cost.
 25 The same principle applies here. The debtor

50
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 should actually go out and see what would someone pay. 
 2 How much would someone charge to finance this debtor's
 3 loan?
 4 QUESTION: Yes, but in doing that, they were
 5 saying, we're going to do that instead of trying to
 6 predict what would happen to -- in the normal course of
 7 events between the contracting parties if bankruptcy had
 8 not intervened. 
 9 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, that's true. In this case,
 10 though, that also applies. What would happen if
 11 bankruptcy had not intervened is the secured party would
 12 have foreclosed, repossessed the collateral, and avoided
 13 all the costs. 
 14 QUESTION: But not at replacement value. You
 15 would not have gotten replacement value. 
 16 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's true, Your Honor, but the
 17 reason why you have replacement value is because the
 18 debtor is going to keep the -- the collateral and prevents
 19 the secured party from exercising its rights and forces
 20 the secured party to incur costs that it otherwise would
 21 avoid. 
 22 Now, the whole purpose of the value requirement
 23 and the indubitable equivalent concept and the whole
 24 cramdown standard is to make sure the secured party
 25 doesn't -- isn't shouldered with uncompensated risk. 

51
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 So the question becomes what's best method of
 2 compensating the secured party for its risk. And the
 3 statute, because of what it requires, value as of the
 4 effective date of the plan using an economic concept, says
 5 we basically have to value the stream of payments. Nobody
 6 really is willing to say I would give this debtor $4,000
 7 or take this debtor's promise of payment of $4,000 at --
 8 at a prime rate or anything close to a prime rate. Again,
 9 the contract date is the best evidence of a market
 10 valuation that we have. And so that's what I think we
 11 have to work with --
 12 QUESTION: Is there any --
 13 MR. BRUNSTAD: -- to be faithful to the statute.
 14 15 QUESTION: Is there any indication that if we
 16 take that, that in fact it will increase the likelihood of
 17 default under the plan simply because the higher contract
 18 rate will tend to put more pressure on the -- the debtor
 19 than the debtor in fact ultimately can -- can satisfy?
 20 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Your Honor, in the circuits
 21 where that already is the standard, that the -- that the
 22 presumptive rate is basically the rate that we use.
 23 QUESTION: Yes. What is their experience? 
 24 MR. BRUNSTAD: There -- there is no information
 25 to say it's higher default rate. And certainly the fact

52
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that most of the circuits have this standard has not
 2 stopped chapter 13 from being filed. They keep -- every
 3 year the number goes up. So we're now at about 470,000
 4 chapter 13 cases a year.
 5 QUESTION: But it seems pretty obvious if it's a
 6 higher rate, there are going to be more defaults.
 7 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, not necessarily, Your
 8 Honor, for this reason. Because the debtor makes -- the
 9 -- the debtor does not make payments directly to creditors
 10 under the chapter 13 plan. The debtor makes payments to
 11 the chapter 13 trustee as a dispersing agent, and the
 12 chapter 13 trustee then distributes the money. What
 13 you're doing here is you're reallocating in this case a
 14 few hundred dollars away from unsecured creditors toward 15 the secured creditor because, again, the statute says the
 16 secured creditor is not required to take -- shoulder
 17 uncompensated risk for the benefit of anybody else. 
 18 That's --
 19 QUESTION: Why not take the credit card rate?
 20 MR. BRUNSTAD: Sorry, Your Honor? 
 21 QUESTION: Why not take the credit card rate? 
 22 Why not take his mortgage rate? I mean, you see, those
 23 aren't the right rates, are they?
 24 MR. BRUNSTAD: Here we have a situation in which
 25 the correct rate for auto loans is evidenced by -- I think

53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 best evidenced by the auto loan contract. It is a loan
 2 between this lender and this debtor, decided in the
 3 marketplace, with this particular collateral. It is the
 4 best evidence of a market rate that we have. It's not
 5 perfect, Your Honor. I concede that, but it is the best
 6 evidence. 
 7 QUESTION: It's evidence at a different time
 8 before you had all the considerations. I mean, we're
 9 going in circles, and I mean, in some respects it's good,
 10 in some respects it's bad.
 11 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Brunstad.
 12 Ms. Harper, you have 2 minutes remaining.
 13 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA J. HARPER
 14 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 15 MS. HARPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
 16 First of all, we need to get back to the concept
 17 of present value. Present value is the time value of
 18 money, which is the real rate of interest plus inflation. 
 19 The record in this case shows that the real rate of
 20 interest was 2-and-one-half percent, and inflation was 3-
 21 and-one-half percent. 
 22 Now, in this case, the debtors made all the
 23 payments. They actually paid the contract off early, but
 24 we need to start with as pure a base as possible and then
 25 if there are special circumstances, sure, the bankruptcy

54
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 court could have discretion to add on if there is
 2 particular jeopardy to the property. 
 3 But we're measuring two different things here. 
 4 The -- the statute doesn't say contract. The statute
 5 doesn't say market rate. This market rate concept has
 6 been misabused. And it -- right now under the bankruptcy
 7 court's interpretation anything is okay as long as you put
 8 this market rate label on it, and that's not a proper
 9 standard for chapter 13 confirmation.
 10 The other problem is with the respondent's
 11 approach, the respondent uses words out of the Bankruptcy
 12 Act, pre-Bankruptcy Act, that simply were never enacted
 13 under chapter 13. Full compensation, full value of their
 14 rights. That's nowhere in chapter 13. 
 It's not a part of 15 the chapter 13 requirements. Indubitable equivalence. 
 16 That's not a chapter 13 confirmation concept. That's a --
 17 that's a concept that was brought in to confuse this
 18 issue, but it is not chapter 13.
 19 Respondents -- their amicus said that under
 20 their interpretation of the statute, basically anything
 21 goes. A rate from 100 percent to 300 percent would be
 22 just fine with them. Congress has not chosen to protect
 23 subprime creditors. This goes against --
 24 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Harper.
