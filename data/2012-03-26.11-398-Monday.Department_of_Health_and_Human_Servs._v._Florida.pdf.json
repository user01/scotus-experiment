    "speech": "We will hear argument this morning in Case Number 11-398, Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida. Mr. Long."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Anti-Injunction Act imposes a \"pay first, litigate later\" rule that is central to Federal tax assessment and collection. The Act applies to essentially every tax penalty in the Internal Revenue Code. There is no reason to think that Congress made a special exception for the penalty imposed by section 5000A. On the contrary, there are three reasons to conclude that the Anti-Injunction Act applies here. First, Congress directed that the section 5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes. Second, Congress provided that penalties are included in taxes for assessment purposes. And, third, the section 5000A penalty bears the key indicia of a tax. Congress directed that the section 5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes. That directive triggers the Anti-Injunction Act, which provides that \"no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax may be maintained in any court by any person.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, that depends, as -- as the Government points out, on whether that directive is a directive to the Secretary of the Treasury as to how he goes about getting this penalty, or rather a directive to him and to the courts. All of the other directives there seem to me to be addressed to the Secretary. Why should this one be directed to the courts? When you say \"in the same manner,\" he goes about doing it in the same manner, but the courts simply accept that -- that manner of proceeding but nonetheless adjudicate the cases."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, I think I have a three-part answer to that, Justice Scalia. First, the text does not say that the Secretary shall assess and collect taxes in the same manner; it just says that it shall be assessed in the same manner as a tax, without addressing any party particularly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, he's assessing and collecting it in the same manner as a tax."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, the assessment -- the other two parts of the answer are, as a practical matter, I don't think there's any dispute in this case that if the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply, this penalty, the section 5000A penalty, will as a practical matter be assessed and collected in a very different manner from other taxes and other tax penalties. There are three main differences. First, when the Anti-Injunction Act applies, you have to pay the tax or the penalty first and then litigate later to get it back with interest. Second, you have to exhaust administrative remedies. Even after you pay the tax, you can't immediately go to court. You have to go to the Secretary and give the Secretary at least 6 months to see if the matter can be resolved administratively. And, third, even in the very carefully defined situations in which Congress has permitted a challenge to a tax or a penalty before it's paid, the Secretary has to make the first move. The taxpayer is never allowed to rush into court before the tax -- before the Secretary sends a notice of deficiency to start the process. Now, if -- if the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply here, none of those rules apply. And that's not just for this case; it will be for every challenge to a section 5000A penalty going forward. The taxpayer will be able to go to court at any time without exhausting administrative remedies; there will be none of the limitations that apply in terms of you have to wait for the Secretary to make the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Why will the administrative remedies rule not be applicable, exhaustion rule not be applicable?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, because if the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply, there's no prohibition on courts restraining the assessment or collection of this penalty, and you can simply --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, but courts apply the exhaustion rule. I mean, I know you've studied this. I'm just not following it. Why couldn't the court say, well, you haven't exhausted your remedies; no injunction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, in -- you could do that, I think, as a matter of -- of common law or a judicially imposed doctrine, but in the code itself, which is all -- I mean, the Anti-Injunction Act is an absolutely central statute to litigation --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Yes. Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "-- about taxes. And the code says -- first it says you must pay the tax first and then litigate. So, that's the baseline. And then, in addition, it says you must -- I mean, it's not common law; it's in the code -- you must apply for a refund, you must wait at least 6 months. I mean, that's -- many of these provisions are extremely specific, with very specific time limits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "But they would apply even if the rule is not jurisdictional. The only difference would be that the court could enforce it or not enforce it in particular cases, which brings me to the Davis case, which I think is your biggest hurdle. It's a case quite similar to this in which the constitutionality of the Social Security Act was at issue, and the government waived its right to insist upon the application of this Act. Of course, if it's jurisdictional, you can't waive it. So, are you asking us to overrule the Davis case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, Helvering v. Davis was decided during a period when this Court interpreted the Anti-Injunction Act as simply codifying the pre-statutory equitable principles that usually, but not always, prohibited a court from enjoining the assessment or collection of taxes. So, that understanding, which is what was the basis for the Helvering v. Davis decision, was rejected by the Court in Williams Packing and a series of subsequent cases -- Bob Jones. And so, I would say, effectively, the Davis case has been overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Long, why don't we simply follow the statutory language? I know that you've argued that the Davis case has been overtaken by later cases, but the language of the Anti-Injunction Act is \"no suit shall be maintained.\" It's remarkably similar to the language in -- that was at issue in Reed Elsevier: \"No civil action for infringement ... shall be instituted.\" And that formulation, \"no suit may be maintained,\" contrasts with the Tax Injunction Act. It says the district court shall not enjoin. That Tax Injunction Act is the same pattern as 2283, which says \"courts of the United States may not stay a proceeding in State court.\" So, both of those formulas, the TIA and the no injunction against proceedings at State court, are directed to \"court.\" The Anti-Injunction Act, like the statute at issue in Reed Elsevier, says \"no suit shall be maintained.\" And it has been argued that that is suitor-directed in contrast to court-directed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Right. Well, I mean, this Court has said several times that the Tax Injunction Act was based on the Anti-Injunction Act. You're quite right, the language is different; but we submit that the Anti-Injunction Act itself, by saying that \"no suit shall be maintained,\" is addressed to courts as well as litigants. I mean, after all, a case cannot go from beginning to end without the active cooperation of the court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But how is that different from \"no civil action for infringement shall be instituted\" -- \"maintained\" and \"instituted\"? Anything turn on that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, it's -- I mean -- perhaps a party could initiate an action without the active cooperation of the court, but to maintain it from beginning to end, again, requires the court's cooperation. And even if -- I mean, if the Court were inclined to say as an initial matter, if this statute were coming before us for the first time today, given all of your recent decisions on jurisdiction, that you might be inclined to say this is not a jurisdictional statute, a lot of water has gone over the dam here. The Court has said multiple times that this is a jurisdictional statute. Congress has not disturbed those decisions. To the contrary --"

    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Counsel --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, the Court said that many times, but is there any case in which the result would have been different if the Anti-Injunction Act were not viewed as jurisdictional but instead were viewed as a mandatory claims-processing --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "There's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "-- rule?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "There's certainly a number of cases where the Court dismissed saying it is jurisdictional. As I read the cases, I don't think any of them would necessarily have come out differently, because I don't think we had a case where the argument was, well, you know, the government has waived this, so, you know, even -- if it's not jurisdictional, it --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, the clearest -- the clearest way of distinguishing between the jurisdictional provision and a mandatory claims-processing rule is whether it can be waived and whether the court feels that it has an obligation to raise the issue sua sponte. Now, if there are a lot of cases that call it jurisdictional, but none of them would have come out differently if the Anti-Injunction Act were simply a mandatory claims-processing rule -- you have that on one side. And on the other side, you have Davis, where the Court accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General; the Sunshine Anthracite coal case, where there also was a waiver; and there's the Williams Packing case, which is somewhat hard to understand as viewing the Anti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision. The Court said that there could be a suit if there's no way the government could win and the plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm. Now, doesn't that sound like an equitable exception to the Anti-Injunction Act?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "No, I think the -- I think the best interpretation of the Court's cases is that it was interpreting a jurisdictional statute. And, indeed, in Williams Packing, the Court said it was a jurisdictional statute. But, again, even if you had doubt about simply the cases, there's more than that because Congress has not only not disturbed this Court's decisions stating that the statute is jurisdictional; they've passed numerous amendments to this Anti-Injunction Act."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, it seems -- you can't separate those two points. The idea that Congress has acquiesced in what we have said only helps you if what we have said is fairly consistent. And you, yourself, point out in the brief that we've kind of gone back and forth on whether this is a jurisdictional provision or not. So, even if Congress acquiesced in it, I'm not sure what they acquiesced in."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, what you have said, Mr. Chief Justice, has been absolutely consistent for 50 years, since the Williams Packing case. The period of inconsistency was after -- the first 50 years, since the statute was enacted in 1867, and there was a period, as I said, when the Court was allowing extraordinary circumstances exceptions and equitable exceptions, but then, very quickly, it cut back on that. And since -- and since Williams Packing, you've been utterly consistent --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Well, even since Williams Packing, there was South Carolina v. Regan. And that case can also be understood as a kind of equitable exception to the rule, which would be inconsistent with thinking that the rule is jurisdictional."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, again, I mean, I think the best understanding of South Carolina v. Regan is not that it's an equitable exception, but it's the Court interpreting a jurisdictional statute as it would interpret any statute in light of its purpose, and deciding in that very special case, it's a very narrow exception --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Mr. Long, in Bowles, the Court looked to the long history of appellate issues as being jurisdictional in its traditional sense, not as a claim-processing rule, but as a pure jurisdiction rule, the power of the court to hear a case. From all the questions here, I count at least four cases in the Court's history where the Court has accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General and reached a tax issue. I have at least three cases, one of them just mentioned by Justice Kagan, where exceptions to that rule were read in. Given that history, regardless of how we define jurisdictional statutes versus claim-processing statutes in recent times, isn't the fairer statement that Congress has accepted that in the extraordinary case, we will hear the case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "No. No, Justice Sotomayor, because in many of these amendments which have come in the '70s and the '90s and the 2000s, the Congress has actually framed the limited exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act in jurisdictional terms. And it has written many of the express exceptions by saying notwithstanding section 7421 --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "But doesn't that just prove that it knows that the court will impose a claim-processing rule in many circumstances, and so, in those in which it specifically doesn't want the court to, it has to be clearer?"
  },

    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, but Congress says, notwithstanding 7421, the court \"shall have jurisdiction\" to restrain the assessment and collection of taxes in very limited --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Could you go back to the question that Justice Alito asked? Assuming we find that this is not jurisdictional, what's the parade of horribles that you see occurring if we call this a mandatory claim-processing rule? What kinds of cases do you imagine that courts will reach?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Right. Well, first of all, I think you'd be saying that for the refund statute as well as for the Anti-Injunction Act, which has very similar wording. So, if the Anti-Injunction Act is not jurisdictional, I think that's also going to apply to the refund statute, the statute that says you have to first ask for a refund and file, you know, within certain time. So, it would be -- it would be both of those statutes. And, you know, we are dealing with taxes here. If people can litigate --"

    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",

    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Right."

    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",

    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "-- what -- where can a court then reach the question, despite --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "That would certainly be the first class of cases that occurs to me, where, if the government does not raise it in a timely way, it could be waived. I would think plaintiffs would see if there was some clever way they could get a suit going that wouldn't immediately be apparent that it --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Assumes the lack of competency of the government, which I don't, but what other types of cases?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Mr. Long, I don't think you're going to come up with any, but I think your response is you could say that about any jurisdictional rule. If it's not jurisdictional, what's going to happen is you're going to have an intelligent Federal court deciding whether you're going to make an exception, and there will be no parade of horribles because all Federal courts are intelligent. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "So, it seems to me it's a question you can't answer. It's a question which asks why should there be any jurisdictional rules? And you think there should be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "And, Justice Scalia, I mean, honestly, I can't predict what would happen, but I would say that not all people who litigate about Federal taxes are necessarily rational. And I think there would be a great --"

    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Long --"

  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "I just don't want to lose the second half of your argument. And we've spent all the time so far on jurisdiction. And I accept pretty much -- I'm probably leaning in your favor on jurisdiction, but where I see the problem is in the second part, because the second part says \"restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\" Now, here, Congress has nowhere used the word \"tax.\" What it says is \"penalty.\" Moreover, this is not in the Internal Revenue Code but for purposes of collection. And so, why is this a tax? And I know you point to certain sentences that talk about taxes within the code --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "-- and this is not attached to a tax. It is attached to a health care requirement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "So, why does it fall within that word?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, I mean, the first point is our -- our initial submission is you don't have to determine that this is a tax in order to find that the Anti-Injunction Act applies, because Congress very specifically said that it shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as a tax, even if it's a tax penalty and not a tax. So, that's one argument --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "But that doesn't mean the AIA applies. I mean -- and then they provide some exceptions, but it doesn't mean the AIA applies. It says \"in the same manner as.\" It is then attached to chapter 68, when that -- it references that as being \"the manner of.\" Well, that it's being applied or if it's being collected in the same manner as a tax doesn't automatically make it a tax, particularly since the reasons for the AIA are to prevent interference with revenue sources. And here, an advance attack on this does not interfere with the collection of revenues. I mean, that's -- you've read the arguments, as have I. But I'd like to know what you say succinctly in response to those arguments."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "So, specifically on the argument that it is actually a tax, even setting aside the point that it should be assessed and collected in the same manner as a tax, the Anti-Injunction Act uses the term \"tax\"; it doesn't define it. Somewhat to my surprise, \"tax\" is not defined anywhere in the Internal Revenue Code. In about the time that Congress passed the Anti-Injunction Act, \"tax\" had a very broad definition. It's broad enough to include this exaction, which is codified in the Internal Revenue Code. It's part of the taxpayer's annual income tax return. The amount of the liability and whether you owe the liability is based in part on your income. It's assessed and collected by the IRS."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "There's at least some doubt about it, Mr. Long, for the reasons that Justice Breyer said, and I thought that we had a -- a principle that ousters of jurisdiction are narrowly construed; that, unless it's clear, courts are not deprived of jurisdiction. And I find it hard to think that this is clear. Whatever else it is, it's easy to think that it's not clear."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, I mean, the Anti-Injunction Act applies not only to every tax in the code but, as far as I can tell, to every tax penalty in the code. And --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Long, you said before -- and I think you were quite right -- that the Tax Injunction Act is modeled on the Anti-Injunction Act. And, under the Tax Injunction Act, what -- what can't be enjoined is an assessment for the purpose of raising revenue. The Tax Injunction Act does not apply to penalties that are designed to induce compliance with the law, rather than to raise revenue. And this is not a revenue-raising measure because, if it's successful, they -- nobody will pay the penalty, and there will be no revenue to raise."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, in Bob Jones, the Court said that they had gotten out of the business of trying to determine whether an exaction is primarily revenue-raising or primarily regulatory. And this one certainly raises -- is expected to raise very substantial amounts of revenues, at least $4 billion a year by the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "But Bob Jones involved a statute where it denominated the exaction as a tax."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "That's -- yes."

    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",

  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Absolutely. But even the section of the code that you referred to previously, the one following 7421, the AIA, it does very clearly make a difference -- 7422 -- make a difference between tax and penalties. It's very explicit."

  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Yes, that's -- it does; that is correct. And there are many other places in the code where tax --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "The best collection I've found in your favor, I think, is in Mortimer Caplin's brief on page 16, 17. He has a whole list. All right? So -- I let my law clerk to look all those up. And it seems to me that they all fall into the categories of either, one, these are penalties that were penalties assessed for not paying taxes; or, two, they involve matters that were called by the court taxes; or, three, in some instances, they were deemed by the code to be taxes. Now, what we have here is something that's in a different statute that doesn't use the word \"tax\" once, except for a collection device and, in fact, in addition, the underlying AIA reason, which is to say to the Solicitor General: We don't care what you think; we, in Congress, don't want you in court where the revenue of a State -- Tax Injunction Act -- or the revenue of the Federal Government is at stake, and, therefore, you can't waive it. Now, I got that. Here it's not at stake, and here there are all the differences I just mentioned. So, I ask that because I want to hear your response."

    "speaker": "LONG",

There's a penalty -- it's discussed in the briefs -- for selling diesel fuel that doesn't comply with EPA's regulations, you know. So, there are all kinds of penalties in the code, and I think it's -- that it's reliable."

There's one on health care plans, there's one on pharmaceutical manufacturers, where Congress specifically said the Anti-Injunction Act is triggered for those. It does not say that here. Wouldn't that suggest that Congress meant for a different result to obtain?"

So, they were free-standing fees. And by using that subtitle F language, Congress plugged in a whole set of rules for how to collect and administer the fees, and it went not just to assessment and collection -- and the IRS has recognized this -- but to examination, privacy, a whole series of additional things. So, I think it would be a mistake to look at that language and say, oh, here's Congress saying they want the Anti-Injunction Act to apply. They're actually doing more than that. And, yes, I grant you, you could look at section 5000A, the individual coverage requirement, and say, well, they could have been clearer about saying the Anti-Injunction Act applied. And that's certainly true, but, again, they were trying to accomplish a lot. And it's --"

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "It's easier to talk about this case if we just forget the words \"for the purpose of restraining assessment or collection.\" In a sense, that brings the jurisdictional question and Justice Breyer's question together. It seems to me -- maybe you could just comment on that language. Is that sort of language usually contained in a jurisdictional provision? I mean, you often don't know the purpose of a suit until after the thing is under way. I can see it with malicious prosecution and some civil rights cases. Does it strike you as somewhat unusual to have this provision in a jurisdictional sense?"

    "speaker": "LONG",

I mean, this -- the core language is essentially unchanged since 1867, and it -- you know, I think that's part of the explanation for it. And, again, it's, you know, become the center of a series of provisions that very carefully control the circumstances in which litigation about Federal taxes can take place."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Long, there's another argument that has been made that I would like you to address, and that is all this talk about tax penalty -- it's all beside the point because this suit is not challenging the penalty. This is a suit that is challenging the must-buy provision, and the argument is made that, if, indeed, \"must-buy\" is constitutional, then these complainants will not resist the penalty. So, what they're seeking is a determination that the \"must-buy\" requirement, stated separately from the penalty, that the \"must-buy\" is unconstitutional. And, if that's so, that's the end of the case; if it's not so, they're not resisting the penalty."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, I think that argument doesn't work for two reasons. I mean, first, if you look at the plaintiffs' own complaint, they clearly challenge both the minimum coverage requirement and the penalty. At page 122 of the Joint Appendix, they challenge the requirement that the individuals obtain health care coverage or pay a penalty."

But even if they had filed a different complaint, I don't think you -- in this case, I don't think you can separate the minimum coverage requirement from the penalty, because the penalty is the sole means of enforcing the minimum coverage requirement. So, first, I mean, I think these plaintiffs would not be satisfied if the Court were to render a judgment saying the minimum coverage requirement is invalidated; the penalty, however, remains standing. Anybody who doesn't have insurance has to pay the penalty. Then they'd have to pay a penalty equal to the cost of insurance and they wouldn't even have insurance. So, I don't think that would be --"

But -- but even if that were so, what this Court has said in Americans United is the Anti-Injunction Act bars any suit, not just to enjoin the collection of your own taxes, but to enjoin the collection of anyone's taxes. And so, even if it were really true that these plaintiffs were not interested in the penalty and would never pay the penalty, if they were to succeed in this case in striking down the minimum coverage requirement, the inevitable result would be that the penalty would fall as well, because the government couldn't collect a penalty for failing to follow an unconstitutional requirement.

The statute has two different sets of exceptions corresponding to those two different sections. You're trying to suggest that the statute says, well, it's your choice, either buy insurance or pay a -- or pay a fee. But that's not the way the statute reads. And Congress, it must be supposed, you know, made a decision that that shouldn't be the way the statute reads, that it should instead be a regulatory command and a penalty attached to that command."

And the reason I say that, if you look at the exemptions from the penalty, I mean, the very first one is you're exempt from the penalty because you can't afford to purchase insurance. And it just doesn't seem reasonable to me to interpret the statute as Congress having said, well, you know, this person is exempt from paying a penalty because we find they can't afford to buy insurance; however, they still have a legal obligation to buy insurance. That just doesn't seem reasonable. So, I do think, although it's -- I certainly wouldn't argue it's clear, that that's the best way to understand the statute as a whole.

Congress has authority under the taxing power to enact a measure not labeled as a tax, and it did so when it put section 5000A into the Internal Revenue Code. But for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, the precise language Congress used is determinative.

And I would, if I could, follow up on a question, Justice Ginsburg, that you asked Mr. Long in terms of the language of the Anti-Injunction Act, 7421(a), which can be found at page 16a of the appendix to our brief. I'd ask the Court to compare that to the language of the very next provision in the code, which is on the next page of our statutory appendix, 17a, which is the refund statute, which we've talked about a little bit so far this morning, 7422(a). The refund statute this Court held in Dolan was jurisdictional, and the Court in both Dolan and Brockamp held that the statute of limitations that applies to the refund statute cases is jurisdictional.

But if -- if this Court were to conclude that it isn't jurisdictional, that does empower courts to find other circumstances in which they might find it equitable to allow cases to go forward in the absence of -- despite the existence of the Anti-Injunction Act. And, second, although I certainly am not going to stand up here and disparage the attorneys for the United States in the slightest, the reality is that if this isn't jurisdictional, then it's -- the argument -- it's open to the argument that it's subject to forfeiture by a simple omission in failing to raise it in an answer.

In Reed Elsevier, it was pointed out that the provision there had numerous exceptions to it. Here, too, there are numerous exceptions that we find that have been created by the courts over the years.

We've cited a string of court of appeals cases in a footnote in our opening brief, and over time, it's been very consistent that the courts of appeals have treated the Anti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision. Again, if the Court agrees with our statutory construction, we don't need to reach this issue. But they have -- in fact, one of those cases, the Hansen case, the district court in that case had dismissed the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court of appeals vacated and sent it back with instructions to dismiss under 12(b)(1), which is the subject-matter jurisdiction provision.

The ones that we've identified -- I may be overlapping a little bit with Mr. Long here -- one is 26 U.S.C. 857, which imposes certain penalties in connection with the administration of real estate investment trusts. There are provisions that Mr. Long identified in his brief, sections 6038(a) through (c) of the code, which impose certain penalties with respect to reporting requirements for foreign corporations.

And the -- we have made a representation, and it was a carefully made representation, in our brief that it is the interpretation of the agencies charged with interpreting this statute, the Treasury Department and the Department of Health and Human Services, that there is no other consequence apart from the tax penalty. And I do think, if I could talk for a couple of minutes about the argument that was discussed as to whether this can be conceived of as a suit just challenging the requirement, which is entirely stand-alone based on inferences drawn from the exemptions, I really don't think that's right. And if I could spend a minute on it, I think it's important. The exemptions in section 5000A -- it is true that there are two categories of exemptions. There are exemptions to the penalty and exemptions to the subsection (a) requirement. But the -- but I think, not only as a practical matter, but I think there's a textual indication and even as a legal matter, they are -- they both function as exceptions to the requirement. First, as a practical matter, one of those exemptions is a hardship exemption. And if the Court will just bear with me for one minute here, it's at page 11a of the appendix to our brief. It provides that a person can go to the Secretary of HHS and obtain a hardship exemption for -- which would, as a formal matter here, excuse compliance with the penalty. It seems to me to make very little sense to say that someone who has gone to an official of the United States and obtained an exemption would, nonetheless, be in the position of being a law breaker. We think another way in which you can get to the same conclusion slightly differently is by considering the provision on the prior page, 10a, which is 5000A -- 5000A(e)(3), members of Indian tribes. Members of Indian tribes are exempt only from the penalty as a formal matter under the structure of the statute here, but the reason for that is because members of Indian tribes obtain their health care through the Indian Health Service, which is a clinic-based system that doesn't involve insurance at all, and it's an entirely different system. They were taken out of this statute because they get their health care through a different system. And it doesn't make any sense to think that persons getting their health care through the Indian Health Service are violating the law because -- because exempt only from the penalty but still under a legal obligation to have insurance, when the whole point of this is that they're supposed to be in a clinic-based system."

This is a provision that provides for a certification that certain individuals can get. And this is the paragraph starting with the words \"Other provisions\" contains the quote. And it says, \"an individual with a 'certification' ... that the individual is exempt from the requirement under Section 5000A ... by reason of section 5000A(e)(1) of such Code,\" is entitled to a certificate that allows for enrollment in a particular program for this category of people. But you can see here, Congress is saying an exemption under 5000A(e)(1), which is the exemption from the penalty, and not the underlying requirement, is, as Congress says, an exemption from the requirement of section 5000A."

    "speaker": "VERRILLI",

And if you're in that situation, you're not subject to the penalty. It's also if the cost of insurance would be more than 8 percent of your income, you're not subject to the penalty. So, there isn't necessarily a precise mapping between somebody's income level and their Medicaid eligibility at the present moment.

    "speaker": "BREYER",

Most of them will bet -- that the money by buying the insurance, and that will help pay. But if they don't, they're going to pay this penalty, and that will help, too. And the fact that we put the latter in brings it within the taxing power. But as far as this Act is concerned, about the injunction, they called it a penalty and not a tax for a reason. They wanted it to fall outside that."

But even though that's the case -- and I think that would be true of any -- of any penalty, that it will raise some revenue, but even though that's the case, there still needs to be textual instruction in the statute that this penalty should be treated as a tax for Anti-Injunction Act purposes, and that's what's lacking here."

That statute said no suit shall be instituted. This statute says no suit shall be maintained. No --"

  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "No, that -- that's not true. The suit here has nothing to do with hearing the action. It has to do with the form of relief that Congress is barring.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "It has to be the same challenge, Justice Sotomayor, or else South Carolina v. Regan would say the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply. You are right that once you file -- once you pay your taxes and then file the refund action, the act of filing the taxes converts the suit from one seeking prospective relief into one seeking money damages. And in that sense, you could think of the statute as a remedial limitation on the courts. But whether you think of it as an exhaustion requirement or a remedial limitation, neither of those characterizations is jurisdictional. In Davis v. Passman, you said that a remedial limitation doesn't go --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "It does seem strange to think of a -- a law that says no court can entertain a certain action and give a certain remedy as merely a claim-processing rule. What the -- the court is being ousted from -- from what would otherwise be its power to hear something."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "The suit is being delayed, I think, is the right way of looking at it. The jurisdictional apparatus in the district court is present. Prospective relief under 1331, money damages action under 1346. If the Anti-Injunction Act were jurisdiction-ousting, one might have expected it to be in Title 28 and to qualify those statutes and to use jurisdictional limits."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "Gonzalez -- Gonzalez v. Thaler rests on a special rule that applies with respect to appeals from one Article III court to another. That's -- that explains Gonzalez, and it explains Bowles before it. You have five unanimous opinions in the last decade in which you have strongly gone the other direction on what counts as jurisdictional."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "There is an argument that we should just simply say that Bowles applies only to appeals, but we haven't said that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "Though, you came very close. In Henderson, Justice Sotomayor, you said that Bowles, which is akin to Thaler, is explained by the special rules and understandings governing appeals from one Article III court to another. And you specifically said that it does not apply to situations involving a party seeking initial judicial review of agency action, which is what we have here. So, while you're right, the texts in Bowles and Thaler are not terribly different, those cases are explained by that principle. Under Henderson, it doesn't apply to this case. The text in this case speaks to the suit, the cause of action of the litigant. It doesn't speak to the jurisdiction or power of the court. The Anti-Injunction Act is placed in a section of the tax code governing procedure. It's not placed in --"

    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "It basically, basically the difference -- of language is relevant. There are a lot of relevant things. But one thing that's relevant in my mind is that taxes are, for better or for worse, the life's blood of government."

    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "And so, what Congress is trying to do is to say there is a procedure here that you go through. You can get your money back, or you go through the Tax Court, but don't do this in advance for the reason that we don't want 500 Federal judge -- judges substituting their idea of what is a proper equitable defense, of when there shouldn't be an exception made about da, da, da, for the basic rule. No. Okay? And so, there is strong reason that is there. You tried to apply that reason to the copyright law. You can't find it. Registration with the copyright register is not the life's blood of anything. (Laughter.)"

    "speech": "The language -- you're -- I see the similarity of language. I've got that. But it's the reasoning, the sort of underlying reason for not wanting a waiver here that is -- has a significant role in my mind of finding that it is jurisdictional. Plus the fact that we've said it nonstop since that Northrop or whatever that other case is."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "Justice Breyer, as to reasoning, you -- you give an argument -- you give an argument why, as a policy matter, it might make sense to have a non-jurisdictional statute. But of course, this Court's recent cases time and again say Congress has to clearly rank the statute as non-jurisdictional in its text and structure. It seems to me a general appeal to statutory policies doesn't speak with sufficient clarity --"

    "speaker": "KATSAS",

It is true that in most cases, the government doesn't want and Congress doesn't want people coming into court. But Davis shows that there may be some cases including, for instance, constitutional challenges to landmark Federal statutes where the government sensibly decides that its revenue-raising purposes are better served by allowing a party to come into court and waiving its defense. That's what the Solicitor General did in Davis, and this Court accepted that waiver. As for prior cases, we have the holding in Davis and the holding in all of the equitable exception cases like Williams Packing. The government --"

    "speech": "It is a contradiction in terms. All of your cases analyze the situation as if a statute is jurisdictional, then it's not subject to waiver. If you were to construe this as such a one-off unique statute, it seems to me we would still win because the Solicitor General with full knowledge of the Anti-Injunction Act argument available to him affirmatively gave it up. This is not just a forfeiture where a government lawyer is -- through inadvertence fails to raise an argument. This is a case where the government --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Well, how is -- I mean, I suppose one could try to make a distinction between this case and Reed Elsevier by focusing on the difference between instituting something and maintaining something. I'm suggesting that instituting is more what a litigant does, and maintaining, as opposed to dismissing, is more what a judge does."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "I don't think so, Justice Kagan, because we have an adversarial system, not an inquisitorial one. The parties maintain their lawsuits, I think, is the more natural way of thinking of it. If I could turn -- if I could turn to the merits question on the AIA before my time runs out. The purpose of this lawsuit is to challenge a requirement -- a Federal requirement to buy health insurance. That requirement itself is not a tax. And for that reason alone, we think the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply. What the amicus effectively seeks to do is extend the Anti-Injunction Act, not just to taxes which is how the statute is written, but to free-standing, nontax legal duties. And it's just --"

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Now, if there's nothing behind the command -- it's sort of, well, what happens if you don't follow the mandate, and the answer is nothing -- it seems very artificial to separate the punishment from the crime."

  {
    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "I'm not sure the answer is nothing, but even assuming it were nothing, it seems to me there is a difference between what the law requires and what enforcement consequences happen to you. This statute was very deliberately written to separate mandate from penalty in several different ways. They are put in separate sections. The mandate is described as a \"legal requirement\" no fewer than 20 times, 3 times in the operative text and 17 times in the findings. It's imposed through use of a mandatory verb \"shall.\" The requirement is very well defined in the statute, so it can't be sloughed off as a general exhortation, and it's backed up by a penalty. Congress then separated out mandate exceptions from penalty exceptions. It defined one category of people not subject to the mandate. One would think those are the category of people as to whom Congress is saying you need not follow this law. It then defined a separate category of people not subject to the penalty, but subject to the mandate. I don't know what that could mean other than --"

    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "Because Congress reasonably could think that at least some people will follow the law precisely because it is the law. And let me give you an example of one category of person that might be: The very poor, who are exempt from the penalty but subject to the mandate. Mr. Long says this must be a mandate exemption because it would be wholly harsh and unreasonable for Congress to expect people who are very poor to comply with a requirement to obtain health insurance when they have no means of doing so. That gets things exactly backwards. The very poor are the people Congress would be most concerned about with respect to the mandate to the extent one of the justifications for the mandate is to prevent emergency room cost shifting when people receive uncompensated care. So, they would have had very good reason to make the very poor subject to the mandate, and then they didn't do it in a draconian way; they gave the very poor a means of complying with the insurance mandate, and that is through the Medicaid system."

    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "The injury -- when that person is subject to the mandate, that person is required to purchase health insurance. That's a forced acquisition of an unwanted good. It's a classic pocketbook injury. But even if I'm wrong about that question, Justice Kagan, the question of who has standing to bring the challenge that we seek to bring seems to me very different -- your hypothetical plaintiff is very different from the actual plaintiffs. We have individuals who are planning for compliance in order to avoid a penalty, which is what their affidavits say. And we have the States, who will be subject no doubt to all sorts of adverse ramifications if they refuse to enroll in Medicaid the people who are forced into Medicaid by virtue of the mandate. So, we don't have the problem of no adverse consequences in the case. And then, we have the separate distinction between the question of who has Article III standing in order to maintain a suit and the question of who is subject to a legal obligation. And you've said in your cases that even if there may be no one who has standing to challenge a legal obligation like the incompatibility clause or something, that doesn't somehow convert the legal obligation into a legal nullity. Finally, with respect to the States, even if we are wrong about everything I've said so far, the States clearly fall within the exception recognized in South Carolina v. Regan. They are injured by the mandate because the mandate forces 6 million new people onto their Medicaid rolls. But they are not directly subject to the mandate, nor could they violate the mandate and incur a penalty."

    "speaker": "KAGAN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "It's people who will enroll -- people who wouldn't have enrolled had they been given a voluntary choice."

  {
    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "That's the largest category. I think there could be future eligibles who would enroll because they're subject to a legal obligation but wouldn't have enrolled if given a voluntary choice. But I'm happy to -- I'm happy to focus on currently eligible people who haven't enrolled in Medicaid. That particular class is the one that gives rise to, simply in Florida alone, a pocketbook injury on the order of 500 to $600 million per year."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "But that does seem odd, to suggest that the State is being injured because people who could show up tomorrow with or without this law will show up in greater numbers. I mean, presumably the State wants to cover people whom it is declared eligible for this benefit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATSAS",

  },

    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "I -- I don't know, Justice Ginsburg. All I know is that the difference between current enrollees and people who could enroll but have not is, as I said, on the -- is a $600 million delta. And --"

  {
    "speaker": "KATSAS",
    "speech": "It's possible, but all we're talking about right now is the standing of the States. And the only arguments made against the standing of the States -- I mean, there is a classic pocketbook injury here. The only arguments made about -- against the standing of the States are, number one, this results from third-party actions. That doesn't work, because the third-party actions are not unfettered in the sense of Lujan; they are coerced in the sense of Bennett v. Spear. Those people are enrolling because they're under a legal obligation to do so. The second argument made against the States' standing is that the States somehow forfeit their ability to challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Federal law because they voluntarily choose to participate --"

    "speech": "Everyone agrees that the section 5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes. And the parties' principal argument why that does not make the Anti-Injunction Act applicable is that, well, that simply goes to the Secretary's activities. And I would simply ask, if you look at chapters 63 and 64 of the Internal Revenue Code, which are the chapters on assessment and collection, they are not just addressed to the Secretary. There are many provisions in there that are addressed to courts and indeed talk about this interaction, the very limited situations in which courts are permitted to restrain the assessment and collection of taxes. There was a statement made that there aren't -- and many of the exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act are in the assessment and collection provisions -- there was a statement made that none of these directly confer jurisdiction to restrain the assessment and collection of taxes. That's not true. In footnote 11 of our opening brief, we cite several. I'll simply mention section 6213 as an example. That says -- I quote: \"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy during the time such prohibition is in force may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including the Tax Court. The Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction to enjoin any action or proceeding or order any refund under this subsection unless a timely petition for redetermination of the deficiency has been filed and then only in respect of the deficiency that is the subject of such petition.\""

    "speech": "All that's going to really what I'd think Congress's intent was meant to be in sticking the collection thing into chapter 68, and -- and it's certainly an argument in your favor. The over-arching thing in my mind is it's up to Congress, within leeway. And they did not use that word \"tax,\" and they did have a couple of exceptions. And it is true that all this language that you quote -- you know, the first two sentences and so forth, it talks about the use of \"tax\" in the IRC. It talks about the penalties and liabilities provided by this subchapter. And we look over here, and it's a penalty and liability provided by a different law, which says collect it through the subchapter. And it has nothing to do with the IRC. See? So, we've got it in a separate place. We can see pretty clearly what they're trying to do. They couldn't really care very much about interfering with collecting this one. That's all the statutory argument. Are you following me?"

    "speech": "And so, that's -- I think it's rather detailed, but I think it's a rather clear indication that the Anti-Injunction Act applies. The -- the refund statute that does specifically refer to penalties -- that has nothing to do with this argument that it's assessed and collected in the same manner as a tax. That would simply go to the point that, well, you can't just call it a tax, because they've referred to it as a penalty. And, finally, on jurisdiction, you know, I think the key point is we have a long line of this Court's decisions that's really been ratified by Congress, with all these exceptions in jurisdictional terms. As I read Bowles and John R. Sand & Gravel, the gist of those decisions was not any sort of special rule about appeals, It's that when we have that situation, which I would submit applies as much to the collection of Federal taxes as it does to appeals from Federal district courts when we have this degree of -- of precedent, including precedent from Congress in the form of amendments to this Anti-Injunction Act, that should be -- the presumption should be that this is jurisdictional. If there are no further questions."
