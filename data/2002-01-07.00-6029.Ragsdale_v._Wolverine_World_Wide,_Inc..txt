 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 now in Number 00-6029, Tracy Ragsdale v. Wolverine World
 5 Wide.
 6 Mr. Sutter.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LUTHER O. SUTTER
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. SUTTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 10 please the Court:
 11 The FMLA guarantees much more than 12 weeks of
 12 absence from work. The FMLA guarantees a specific bundle
 13 of statutory rights that an employer must grant eligible
 14 employees. In many cases, the company's leave plan, as is
 15 the case here, may provide different rights from the
 16 bundle of rights that the FMLA grants eligible employees.
 17 825.208 and 825.700(a) implement the statute in an
 18 important way.
 19 Under the regulations, 825.208 and 700, if the
 20 employer wants a period of absences or leave to count
 21 against a worker's annual FMLA entitlement, the employer
 22 must do three things. First, the company must decide to
 23 grant the worker this bundle of rights that the FMLA
 24 grants him or her. Second, the employer must tell the
 25 employee that they have these benefit rights, and third,

3 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the employer must tell the employee that the employer has
 2 elected to count this period of leave against the FMLA.
 3 QUESTION: Does the act require the posting of
 4 some general notice in the place of employment about the
 5 Family Leave Act?
 6 MR. SUTTER: Yes, Justice O'Connor, it does. 29
 7 U.S.C. 2619 provides that each employer shall post a
 8 general notice in the form that the Secretary shall
 9 prescribe, so Congress painted it in broad brush strokes
 10 and intended that the Secretary had the ability to provide
 11 what information is provided to employees.
 12 QUESTION: Well, can the Secretary then provide
 13 that it has to be done by personal communication?
 14 MR. SUTTER: Well, Your Honor, that is just --
 15 as this Court noted in the FDA case, just simply because
 16 the Secretary has spoken and required posting in this
 17 instance does not mean that the Secretary cannot fill the
 18 gap, as it were, and require personal notice if the
 19 Secretary determines that such notice is reasonably
 20 necessary to implement the act.
 21 In this case, Justice O'Connor, I think all
 22 would agree that it is difficult to exercise a right that
 23 one does not know that one has, and in this case the
 24 Secretary decided that the employer must first choose
 25 to -- that the FMLA -- that the worker will get the FMLA

4 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 rights, and then tell the employee, and this regulation
 2 promotes communication, communication between the employer
 3 and the employee.
 4 QUESTION: Mr. Sutter, may I ask if -- in this
 5 case, as I understand it, the employee initially did not
 6 qualify for the FMLA leave because she hadn't been there
 7 long enough. The FMLA is 12 weeks. Her initial weeks,
 8 the first 4 weeks had to be under the company policy
 9 because there was nothing else, so is the thrust of your
 10 argument that therefore she is entitled to a minimum of 16
 11 weeks, even assuming notice at the time that FMLA comes
 12 active?
 13 MR. SUTTER: Justice Ginsburg, the thrust of my
 14 argument is, is that the FMLA is more than just 12 weeks. 
 15 The FMLA is a specific bundle of rights --
 16 QUESTION: Yes, well, that's a separate
 17 question, but let's assume that there's no difference in
 18 the rights under each, and in this case I don't know that
 19 that bundle that you describe is any different under the
 20 company plan as far as continuing the insurance and the
 21 pension payments, but is it your contention that she would
 22 therefore, because she didn't have enough to qualify for
 23 the FMLA leave, she would get 16 weeks --
 24 MR. SUTTER: Yes, Your Honor.
 25 QUESTION: -- and not 12?

5 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SUTTER: Yes, Your Honor, because the act
 2 provides that only eligible employees are entitled to FMLA
 3 leave, and eligible employees must have worked for that
 4 employer for 12 months, and at the --
 5 QUESTION: So it's a little odd that when she
 6 didn't qualify she gets extra time than if she had already
 7 been there long enough to qualify, in which case it would
 8 be only 12 weeks.
 9 MR. SUTTER: Well, I can see where one might
 10 believe that it is a bit odd, but again, Justice Ginsburg,
 11 the company leave plan in this case did not provide her
 12 with all of the FMLA bundle of rights.
 13 QUESTION: Why didn't it?
 14 QUESTION: Why didn't it?
 15 MR. SUTTER: Because the leave plan in this
 16 case, for example, did not allow her to have intermittent
 17 leave. Section 2612 --
 18 QUESTION: She wasn't able to have intermittent
 19 leave anyway, as I understand it. The doctor didn't allow
 20 her to go back to work even intermittently until the
 21 period was over.
 22 MR. SUTTER: Well, Justice Scalia, the doctor
 23 only had two options. Because the employer elected on the
 24 front end not to allow Ms. Ragsdale her bundle of FMLA
 25 rights, the doctor had two options. Either Ms. Ragsdale

6 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 quit, or she cannot work for 30 days. There's a third
 2 option that would have become involved had the employer
 3 given the employee notice of a right to --
 4 QUESTION: You mean the doctor skewed his
 5 medical advice and told her you can't work at all only
 6 because the employer hadn't told her she could work
 7 intermittently? I can't imagine that.
 8 MR. SUTTER: Well, it's --
 9 QUESTION: The problem I have with your case is
 10 not -- not the rule that the employer has to give notice. 
 11 That's a perfectly reasonable rule. The problem I have is
 12 the remedy that is provided if the rule is violated. Now,
 13 under that provision of the act which imposes a penalty
 14 when the employer fails to comply with the provision of
 15 the act, what you're entitled to is damages, what you
 16 would have lost, what you've lost by reason of the
 17 employer's noncompliance.
 18 In this case, I don't see anything at all that
 19 she lost, and the penalty under the regulation that is
 20 imposed for noncompliance with the notice is an entire
 21 free additional 12 weeks. It goes beyond any damages she
 22 suffered at all.
 23 MR. SUTTER: Well, Justice Scalia, we -- it is
 24 difficult, looking 3, 4 years later, to determine whether
 25 or not Ms. Ragsdale would have been able to work

7 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 intermittently. We contend that she would have been. 
 2 However, having said that --
 3 QUESTION: Well, but under the damage provision
 4 of the act you have to prove that. Why isn't it
 5 reasonable to say the employer has to make her good for
 6 any damages she suffered, and if you could show that she
 7 suffered something because of it, fine, but what this
 8 regulation says is, she gets a whole nother 12 weeks,
 9 whether in fact she could have made use of that notice or
 10 not, and as I read the facts I don't see anything she
 11 could have done if she had gotten the notice. I think she
 12 would have been in the same position she's in now.
 13 MR. SUTTER: Well, certainly the district court
 14 did not address the issue of prejudice. However, the
 15 Secretary could have reasonably determined that monetary
 16 penalties were appropriate. However, the Secretary
 17 decided that the FMLA is not simply money to be bought or
 18 to be sold or exchanged. The FMLA is a specific bundle of
 19 rights that the employee has different rights and
 20 obligations under. If the employ -- the -- Ms. Ragsdale
 21 in this case never got FMLA leave because the employer
 22 never designated it as FMLA leave.
 23 QUESTION: But as Justice Scalia points out, the
 24 employee under your view gets even more than she's
 25 entitled to under the act under certain circumstances. 

8 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Suppose that the notice isn't given, and she takes leave,
 2 and medical benefits are not paid. I assume the employer
 3 has to pay for medical benefits.
 4 MR. SUTTER: Right.
 5 QUESTION: And also give 12 additional weeks. 
 6 That seems -- it seems to me that you're having it both
 7 ways.
 8 MR. SUTTER: No, Justice Kennedy, I do not
 9 believe that we are, because in this case, while the
 10 statute explicitly requires 12 weeks of leave in any
 11 period, 2612(b)(1) also allows employees to extend that 12
 12 weeks over a calendar year using intermittent leave, so
 13 looking at this case as simply a calculation of weeks is
 14 inaccurate.
 15 QUESTION: But I put you the case in which she I
 16 would think would be entitled to back -- to compensatory
 17 damages for not having been paid her medical benefits, and
 18 in addition, so that during the period that she took off
 19 the Government counts that for purposes of monetary
 20 liability, but it doesn't count that for purposes of
 21 accrued leave, so she's entitled to monetary compensation
 22 for the benefits that weren't paid during that unnoticed
 23 leave period, and she's entitled to an additional 12
 24 weeks. That just doesn't make sense.
 25 MR. SUTTER: Well, Justice Kennedy, the specific

9 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 issue here is what happens when the employer provides the
 2 employee with less rights than the FMLA bundle of rights
 3 provides. When the --
 4 QUESTION: And the answer is that she ends up
 5 with more than what the Family Leave Act would have
 6 provided.
 7 MR. SUTTER: In this case, Justice Kennedy, in
 8 terms of time I believe the Court is correct. However, in
 9 terms of the specific bundle of rights, the issue for this
 10 Court to determine is whether or not the Secretary has
 11 acted reasonably when, in circumstances such as these, the
 12 employee receives less than what she is entitled to
 13 specifically.
 14 QUESTION: I don't -- well, I don't agree that
 15 that's the issue. I don't think you've established that
 16 she was deprived of any right that she would have been
 17 entitled to under the act. You're simply asserting that
 18 she -- had she received the notice she might have worked
 19 intermittently, but as far as the medical advice is
 20 concerned she couldn't have worked intermittently. Don't
 21 you think you have some obligation to provide that she was
 22 deprived of some of the benefits of the act?
 23 MR. SUTTER: The Secretary may have reasonably
 24 required that this analysis occur after the need for
 25 intermittent leave arose. However, the Secretary, to

10 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 avoid just these types of misunderstandings, required the
 2 designation to be on --
 3 QUESTION: It's a prophylactic rule that the
 4 Secretary has adopted, even though the statute itself, in
 5 the provisions that it sets forth for where the employer
 6 has failed to comply with the act, does not adopt a
 7 prophylactic rule. It says you give the employee the
 8 damages that the employee is entitled to.
 9 MR. SUTTER: Under either a Morning prophylactic
 10 rule, or the interpretive powers granted the Secretary
 11 under Chevron, we believe the regulation is entirely
 12 appropriate because the issue of notice is not addressed.
 13 QUESTION: Well, may I go back to the question
 14 of what the damages are? On your view, or on the
 15 Secretary's view, does the employee get another 12 weeks
 16 of leave if the employee does not need another 12 weeks of
 17 leave?
 18 MR. SUTTER: If the employee does not need --
 19 QUESTION: Let's assume the employee is cured. 
 20 Does the employee then have the right to enjoy 12 weeks
 21 off?
 22 MR. SUTTER: Not unless, for example, she is
 23 involved in a serious car accident, another serious --
 24 QUESTION: Well, no, but my hypothesis is that
 25 whatever the reason for the leave was, sickness or

11 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 pregnancy, be whatever, it's over, so that I take it that
 2 the additional 12 weeks, or only an additional 12 weeks,
 3 if the person still has some medical or social need for
 4 the leave.
 5 MR. SUTTER: That's exactly correct, Justice.
 6 QUESTION: As I understand what Judge McGill
 7 said in the Eighth Circuit, he did say that he -- there
 8 could be cases where it would be appropriate for this
 9 regulation to apply if she could show that she was
 10 disadvantaged by not being given the option, so he left
 11 that door open if there were some disadvantage. He said
 12 he saw none here.
 13 MR. SUTTER: Yes, and that's an entirely
 14 reasonable interpretation, a reasonable alternative to
 15 what the Secretary did here, but that is not the -- Judge
 16 McGill did not give the Secretary the appropriate
 17 deference that she is entitled to in promulgating this
 18 regulation. This regulation says that determination
 19 should be made when the intermittent leave may or may not
 20 be needed.
 21 QUESTION: But his reason, I understand, was
 22 that Congress said 12 weeks, and to interpret that statute
 23 that says 12 weeks to mean 24 weeks, or in this case even 
 24 more than that -- because the company leave was 30 weeks,
 25 right?

12 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SUTTER: The company granted 4 weeks pre-
 2 FMLA eligibility and 26 weeks post.
 3 QUESTION: So his view was that the regulation
 4 conflicted with the statute.
 5 MR. SUTTER: Well, and as this Court recognized
 6 in the FDA case, you cannot read one statute in isolation. 
 7 You have to also look at not only 2612(a), which says
 8 specifically 12 weeks of leave in any 12-month period,
 9 thereby leaving it open for, as the Secretary has done in
 10 this case, identifying four different ways to calculate 12
 11 weeks. For example, it could be backward-looking. You
 12 can -- the employer can look back 12 weeks if it chooses
 13 to do so, or it can look forward.
 14 For example, if I have a broken leg -- if I have
 15 a broken leg, and then I recover from that, and then I
 16 have another serious health condition, you can actually
 17 look forward to the forward-looking 12 weeks, the 12-
 18 month period, so if you take 12 months out of a calendar
 19 you can actually, depending on how you calculate it, have
 20 24 weeks of leave, depending on how they may calculate it.
 21 Now, I would urge the Court to read 2612(a) in
 22 conjunction with 2612(b)(1) which allows intermittent
 23 leave, which can extend FMLA leave over a period of 24
 24 weeks if they work half-time, 36 weeks if they work three-
 25 quarter time.

13 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 May I reserve my time for rebuttal?
 2 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Sutter.
 3 Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.
 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
 5 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
 6 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
 7 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 8 please the Court:
 9 The Secretary of Labor has determined that an
 10 employee can derive the maximum benefit from the FMLA only
 11 if he has accurate information concerning the act,
 12 including the fact that his leave will count against his
 13 12-week FMLA entitlement. To implement that determin --
 14 QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, do you think that that
 15 can be met by just posting some general notice saying that
 16 any leave taken by an employee is going to require taking
 17 FMLA leave first?
 18 MR. STEWART: No, we don't, Your Honor. The
 19 statute itself requires that an employer post notice in
 20 such form as is directed by the Secretary. The Secretary
 21 has addressed the type of notice that must be posted for
 22 the workforce generally, but the Secretary has also
 23 determined that, although the general posting requirement
 24 is helpful, an employee who is actually on the point of
 25 taking leave for an FMLA-covered purpose needs additional

14 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 information concerning the rights and responsibilities
 2 under the act, so the employer couldn't comply with the
 3 regulatory requirement simply by posting a notice for the
 4 workforce generally, and the intention here is not to
 5 penalize the employer for noncompliance with the
 6 regulation. Rather, the Secretary's determination is that
 7 a precondition to effective exercise of FMLA rights is
 8 full and complete information concerning the dictates of
 9 the act, including the fact that the leave will count
 10 against the 12-week entitlement.
 11 QUESTION: That's fine, but where the employee
 12 has no FMLA rights, that is to say, where the leave that
 13 the employer provides gives the employee everything that
 14 the employee would have under the FMLA, why should the
 15 employee get another 12 weeks?
 16 MR. STEWART: First, it's not --
 17 QUESTION: The problem is not the requirement --
 18 to my mind is not the requirement of notice at the
 19 beginning of the leave. It's the penalty that the
 20 Secretary chooses to impose when that notice is not given.
 21 MR. STEWART: Well, first it's not clear in many
 22 cases, and it's not clear in this case, whether in fact
 23 the leave that the employer provided complied with all the
 24 requirements of the act. That is, Mr. Sutter has argued
 25 that the employer's plan doesn't contain a right to

15 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 intermittent leave. Now, there's a further question of
 2 whether this particular employee could have effectively 
 3 utilized the FMLA right to intermittent leave if she had
 4 known she had it, but the thrust of the --
 5 QUESTION: Well, I agree that those are
 6 questions, but it seems to me those are questions that
 7 have to be answered by the person who is seeking to impose
 8 a liability on the employer.
 9 MR. STEWART: But the thrust of the Secretary's
 10 regulation is that it is better to have a bright line rule
 11 than to require the courts to engage in after-the-fact
 12 speculative inquiries regarding what might have been done
 13 months or years earlier if the requisite notice had been
 14 given and this, to the extent this is harsh, it is harsh
 15 in the same way that a statute of limitations is harsh. 
 16 Clearly, when a plaintiff with a meritorious claim has his
 17 suit dismissed because he's missed the statutory
 18 limitations period by a small number of days, there's an
 19 element of unfairness there, but the justification for
 20 having a bright line rule is, first a bright line rule is
 21 likely to produce --
 22 QUESTION: The statutes of limitations are not
 23 imposed by regulation. They're imposed by statute.
 24 MR. STEWART: Certainly, statutory -- statutes
 25 of limitations by definition are imposed by the

16 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 legislature, but there are instances, and we've cited one
 2 in our brief, in which an administrative agency that is
 3 given authority to resolve complaints under an act may be
 4 authorized to promulgate reasonable procedural regulations
 5 to implement that directive, and that might include the
 6 requirement that a claim be filed within a certain number
 7 of days.
 8 QUESTION: What case is --
 9 QUESTION: Mr. Stewart --
 10 MR. STEWART: This is on page 24 of our brief in
 11 footnote 6. We've cited Rennie v. Skerrett, which is a
 12 Seventh Circuit case that discusses predecessor versions
 13 of the current EEOC regulations which provide that Federal
 14 employees claiming discrimination under title VII must
 15 present their claims to the agency within a specified
 16 number of days.
 17 QUESTION: But here there's something really
 18 strange about it. That is, they couldn't give the notice. 
 19 When she started on leave she wasn't entitled to anything,
 20 so here's an employer being more generous than the Federal
 21 law requires in that he's covering her although she's
 22 worked less than a year, so there's no question of giving
 23 the notice when she's put on leave because she's not
 24 entitled to any Federal leave, isn't that so?
 25 MR. STEWART: Well, first the regulation -- she

17 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 was not entitled to FMLA leave at the time of her first
 2 request, but in fact the DOL regulations specifically
 3 require that if an employee requests leave for an FMLA-
 4 covered purpose but is not yet eligible for the
 5 protections of the FMLA, the employer is required to
 6 notify the employee of the time when she will become
 7 eligible, and second, at any rate, when the employee made
 8 her first request for extension of leave she had passed
 9 the 12-month period and she was eligible for the
 10 protections of the act, and it's true that in terms of the
 11 sheer number of weeks of leave that it was willing to
 12 give, the company was more generous than the act required,
 13 but the fact that an individual or a business goes beyond
 14 the requirements of the law in some respects doesn't
 15 excuse its noncompliance with other aspects of the law.
 16 QUESTION: I don't see any noncompliance. You
 17 said about the intermittent, that's fuzzy, but they --
 18 their leave policy covered the health insurance, covered
 19 the pension payments.
 20 MR. STEWART: Well, the intermittent leave is
 21 itself important, and again there may be a substantial
 22 question as to whether this particular employee could have
 23 made effective use of the FMLA right to intermittent leave
 24 had she known she had it, and the Secretary might, as the
 25 Eighth Circuit suggested, have adopted the regulatory

18 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 approach under which that would be the dispositive
 2 inquiry, but instead the Secretary has chosen to
 3 promulgate a bright line rule.
 4 QUESTION: A prophylactic rule, which the
 5 statute itself does not do. I mean, section 2617(a)(1)
 6 requires that when an employer violates section 2615 he
 7 has to pay damages equal to the amount of, and then it
 8 goes through, any wages he lost, salary he's lost,
 9 employment benefits he's lost, and the Secretary comes up
 10 with this new rule in which it doesn't matter whether the
 11 employee's been damaged at all, we're going to impose a
 12 prophylactic rule. I don't know any other situation in
 13 which an agency is authorized to do that.
 14 MR. STEWART: Well, in this case the statute not
 15 only gives the agency general rulemaking authority but
 16 also provides that it will be a violation of the act for
 17 an employer to interfere with or restrain an employee in
 18 her exercise of FMLA rights and, by its nature, that
 19 language presumes that there will be instances in which
 20 employer conduct is not in terms prohibited by the act,
 21 but is likely to have the practical effect of dissuading
 22 or preventing employees from effectively exercising their
 23 statutory --
 24 QUESTION: But if she had no rights, he's not
 25 guilty of that. I mean, what this regulation is saying

19 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is, whether or not the employer in this particular case
 2 restrained her exercise of rights, whether or not she
 3 could have taken intermittent leave, he's going to have to
 4 give her another 12 weeks.
 5 MR. STEWART: Well, under the NLRB, under the
 6 NLRB's approach to implementation of the NLRA, the
 7 question of whether employer conduct has interfered with
 8 or restrained the exercise of protected rights is not
 9 resolved by asking whether particular employees were, in
 10 fact, deterred from engaging in protected conduct. It's
 11 whether the employer conduct is of a nature that could
 12 reasonably be expected to have that effect, and the
 13 Secretary's determination is that failing to inform the
 14 employee that her time is being counted against the 12-
 15 week FMLA entitlement and then dismissing her while she
 16 still has the serious health condition will have the
 17 practical effect of interfering with, or is likely to have
 18 the practical effect of interfering with or restraining
 19 her exercise of protected rights.
 20 And again, the Secretary could have chosen an
 21 approach under which a more case-specific evidence would
 22 be offered as to the actual use the employee might have
 23 made of the information, but the Secretary was not
 24 required to do so, and again, this is comparable to the
 25 situation in a statute of limitations situation where, if

20 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 a suit is filed --
 2 QUESTION: Well, under the statute of
 3 limitations, if a district judge throws out a suit because
 4 a 2-year statute has run and then the appellate court said
 5 no, you -- there was 3 weeks available there and it was
 6 filed on time, we don't give them a whole new 2 years. 
 7 That's what you're doing.
 8 MR. STEWART: Well, the analogy to the statute
 9 of limitations is really that, if the statute of
 10 limitations has expired, we don't ask whether the
 11 defendant could have done anything differently, or whether
 12 the defendant was prejudiced by the absence of notice
 13 within the 2-year period. The -- for purposes of your
 14 hypothetical, though, the situation might also be compared
 15 to a tolling provision in a statute of limitations that
 16 says the statute will not begin to run until the potential
 17 plaintiff has received a particular item of information.
 18 If that were the situation, then the statute of
 19 limitations simply doesn't begin to run until the
 20 plaintiff knows that, and we don't ask whether the
 21 plaintiff would have done anything differently had she
 22 received the information sooner.
 23 And again, this is not intended as a penalty or
 24 even as a penalty for the employer's noncompliance with
 25 the regulatory requirement. Rather, the gist of the

21 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Secretary's determination is, in order to make effective
 2 use of FMLA rights, this sort of information is a
 3 precondition, and therefore it's a natural approach to
 4 say, until the employee has that information the 12-week
 5 period will not begin to run.
 6 QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, suppose somebody has
 7 worked for 5 months but the company has leave that kicks
 8 in that early, and then 7 months later would qualify for
 9 the FMLA, but -- or has already had much more than the 12
 10 weeks of leave, hasn't been given notice because there
 11 wasn't any eligibility, what happens then?
 12 MR. STEWART: May I answer?
 13 QUESTION: Yes.
 14 MR. STEWART: There's a separate provision in
 15 the statute that makes eligibility for FMLA benefits
 16 contingent upon having worked 1,250 hours in the preceding
 17 calendar year and, therefore, it's likely that an employee
 18 who had worked only 5 months and then had been on leave
 19 for 7 months would fail to satisfy that requirement.
 20 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.
 21 Mr. Bennett, we'll hear from you.
 22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. BENNETT
 23 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 24 MR. BENNETT: Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,
 25 may it please the Court:

22 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 The employer notice regulations the petitioner
 2 and DOL are defending here today allow employee -- they're
 3 premised on -- their arguments are, Your Honor, are that
 4 they allow employees the right to, quote, plan leave, to
 5 communicate with each other. What they have done to
 6 this -- these regulations is elevate this right, this
 7 perceived right to plan leave -- if it's a right, it's an
 8 implicit right in the statute, Your Honor. It's not an
 9 expressed right, if it's a right at all, and they have
 10 elevated this right above the expressed right in the
 11 statute to have leave limited to a total of 12 weeks of
 12 leave.
 13 What they have in essence done through this
 14 regulation is what the most skilled and persuasive
 15 legislative body in this country could not do, and that
 16 was entitle employees to leave for more than 12 weeks of
 17 leave. Congress clearly attempted to do that. This leave
 18 went through a number of forms before it was eventually
 19 passed by Congress. The first piece of legislation
 20 providing for family medical leave in 1986 provided for 36
 21 weeks of leave for employees for these conditions, and
 22 that bill did not pass Congress. The 100th Congress came
 23 back with a leave for 26 weeks leave over 24 months, and
 24 again that deal couldn't pass Congress.
 25 It was only when Congress limited the leave to a

23 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 total of 12 weeks of leave over a 12-month period of time
 2 that they were able to pass this particular piece of
 3 legislation. Congress specifically spoke in the statute
 4 and in, more abundantly in the legislative history
 5 surrounding this particular statute, that their primary
 6 intent and focus was to limit leave to a total of 12 weeks
 7 of leave, to grant employees this minimal leave right.
 8 QUESTION: Suppose -- I suppose that the
 9 Government didn't think of what it was doing as giving an
 10 extra 12 weeks of leave. They didn't see it that way. I
 11 imagine the way they saw it is that we think the employee
 12 has to have notice at the time that this counts as his
 13 FMLA leave, and what happens if he doesn't get it? If he
 14 doesn't get it, it doesn't count as FMLA leave. That's a
 15 very simple requirement and a very simple remedy, and it
 16 has the consequence you spoke of, but if that isn't the
 17 simple remedy, they shouldn't have done that simple
 18 remedy, what, in your opinion, should they have done,
 19 assuming the problem?
 20 MR. BENNETT: Again, the issue, as Justice
 21 Scalia has pointed out, is not the requirement --
 22 QUESTION: That's what I'm assuming. I'm
 23 assuming that they come across a real problem. The real
 24 problem is, no, or very few employees, or not many
 25 employees notice what's going on until the moment that

24 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 they have to go for the chemotherapy. At that point they
 2 worry about leave, and so the agency says, employer, if
 3 you want it to count as FMLA leave, tell them
 4 specifically.
 5 Now, we all agree that's fine, and then what
 6 happens if you don't? Well, they say, it doesn't count. 
 7 That's all. Now, you think that part is wrong. Now, I
 8 want to know, if you think that's wrong, what should, in
 9 your opinion, the agency have done there instead?
 10 MR. BENNETT: Congress specified a monetary
 11 penalty. In the statute itself, Congress said you shall
 12 post a notice advising employees of what their rights are. 
 13 If an employer, Your Honor, does not post a notice at all,
 14 doesn't in any way advise their employees of what their
 15 rights are under the statute, completely ignores the
 16 statutory provision to post this notice, all the
 17 employer -- all -- the only penalty the employer gets is a
 18 monetary penalty --
 19 QUESTION: In your opinion, it would have been a
 20 better remedy if the agency had said, and if you don't
 21 tell them, you have to pay them $10,00 cash. That, in
 22 your opinion would have -- I imagine a few employers might
 23 have objected to that.
 24 MR. BENNETT: I think the -- some employers
 25 might object to the amount of the penalty, Your Honor.

25 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Oh well, let's say $5,000.
 2 MR. BENNETT: I believe --
 3 QUESTION: $5,000 cash to any employee because
 4 the notice provision wasn't given, and all small
 5 employers, large employers, any time they fail to -- now,
 6 would you have -- you would have preferred that remedy. 
 7 Do you think most employers would have preferred that
 8 remedy? What amount do you think it should have been?
 9 MR. BENNETT: Well, aside from constitutional
 10 issues as a penalty, I believe you have to look at what
 11 Congress intended. Congress intended that employees get
 12 the notice, and where -- excuse me, get the leave, and
 13 Congress specifically provided where -- a notice provision
 14 within the statute, and that notice provision, Congress
 15 said, if you don't give it, a penalty is appropriate. DOL
 16 has now come up with a whole new penalty that far exceeds
 17 in this --
 18 QUESTION: I'm just trying to make -- to try to
 19 understand, to put you in the position of the agency. 
 20 They're trying to do something, and they're trying to find
 21 a remedy for not doing it, and you say it should have been
 22 like $5,000 payment, and I want you to see that a lot of
 23 people might have thought that was much worse than simply
 24 saying, don't count it as leave. Some might have thought
 25 it was better. So doesn't the agency have a range where

26 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 they can choose what's reasonable?
 2 MR. BENNETT: I believe the agency does have a
 3 range to choose what's reasonable, Your Honor, but I don't
 4 believe --
 5 QUESTION: Could the agency choose a monetary
 6 penalty? Could the agency as a matter of administrative
 7 discretion impose a penalty, or would that have to come
 8 from the -- is that even within the realm of choice that
 9 the agency would have?
 10 MR. BENNETT: Well, again, one of the
 11 contingents we raise, Your Honor, is that Congress
 12 specifically spoke to notice, all the notice that's
 13 required under the statute. We contend that the DOL does
 14 not have the right to come in and promulgate a regulation
 15 that an employer notify an employee specifically and
 16 prospectively that they're using leave, but to the extent
 17 that they do, to the extent that there's some perceived
 18 gap in there where they do have the right to do that, they
 19 can't do that where it's manifestly contrary to the
 20 statute. In this statute, the primary focus --
 21 QUESTION: But the question is, let's assume
 22 that it would be permissible for the Secretary to say,
 23 give them notice that the leave counts as this -- for this
 24 purpose, that that would be permissible. That was an
 25 assumption that Justice Scalia was making. Then what does

27 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the Secretary have in her arsenal to put teeth behind
 2 that, if not the extension of the period?
 3 MR. BENNETT: Again, the Secretary can exercise
 4 the discretion to determine a -- fashion a reasonable
 5 remedy for the company's failure to provide this notice,
 6 but that remedy, Your Honor, cannot exceed --
 7 QUESTION: Well, what would be reasonable? The
 8 fine question maybe a question whether the Secretary has
 9 authority to do it. What, other than saying the period
 10 doesn't run if you don't give the notice, could the
 11 Secretary have done?
 12 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, I believe the penalty
 13 that the Secretary should have granted in this particular
 14 case, or authorized under this regulation, would be a
 15 monetary penalty. Congress said $100 for not telling the
 16 employees at all.
 17 QUESTION: Would there ever be an instance in
 18 which the Secretary, on a case-by-case basis, could say
 19 that we are ordering you to grant additional family leave? 
 20 I.e., suppose the employee knows that his wife is going to
 21 have a difficult pregnancy and he says, I'm going to take
 22 some time off under the company plan at the early stages
 23 and I'll save my family leave for later, and he makes a
 24 mistake, and the mistake is compounded by the fact that
 25 there was no notice. Assume that notice is required, and

28 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that that's valid. Would there ever be an instance in
 2 which additional leave would be an appropriate remedial
 3 step?
 4 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, I'm not sure that
 5 there would be. The statute provides that an employer
 6 cannot interfere or restrain. Where an employee feels
 7 that, indeed, because the employer didn't notify, that
 8 they've interfered or restrained, the statute provides a
 9 cause of action for that, for the courts to determine, and
 10 I suppose they could file a claim with DOL, and in that
 11 situation they may be able to step in and fashion a
 12 remedy, but they'd have to show that, indeed, they somehow
 13 interfered with --
 14 QUESTION: Well, could that remedy ever consist
 15 of granting additional leave?
 16 MR. BENNETT: I suppose, in those situations --
 17 QUESTION: Assuming the employee was prejudiced
 18 in a case that's -- on a case-by-case basis.
 19 MR. BENNETT: We contend, Your Honor, they could
 20 not. The statute provides for leave. You would look in
 21 that case the same as you would, Your Honor, under the
 22 Fair Labor Standards Act for minimum wage. You look first
 23 to see whether or not the basic benefit of the statute was
 24 granted. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act for minimum
 25 wage, for instance, you first look to see if the employee

29 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is paid minimum wage. The employee may file a complaint
 2 because the employer failed to adequately notify the
 3 employee that they were paying them minimum wage. They
 4 didn't note it on their check stub, and the employee
 5 couldn't tell they were being paid the wage.
 6 The first thing you make a determination of was
 7 whether the employee received the minimum wage. If they
 8 do --
 9 QUESTION: Yes, but minimum wages, all we're
 10 talking about is the dollars. Here we're talking about
 11 time as well.
 12 MR. BENNETT: Correct, Your Honor, but if,
 13 indeed, the employee --
 14 QUESTION: And that's the currency the agency
 15 has to deal with, and you say under no circumstance may
 16 the Secretary, however reasonable the employee's reliance
 17 was, however faulty the notice was, under no circumstance
 18 may they ever give additional leave.
 19 MR. BENNETT: Provided the leave already granted
 20 by the -- provided the employee had already been given 12
 21 weeks of leave under the conditions contained within the
 22 statute, Your Honor, that is our contention.
 23 QUESTION: Well, I'm not sure it's incumbent
 24 upon you to write a regulation for the agency. I gather
 25 your point is that whatever the remedy provided by the

30 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 agency, it has to be a remedy that is attached to the harm
 2 that has been caused. I gather your main point is, no
 3 harm, no foul. If the employee has not been deprived of
 4 anything he's entitled to under the statute, there's
 5 simply no basis for remedy at all.
 6 Now, what the remedy might be had the employer
 7 shown that the employee could have had intermittent leave,
 8 or if there's something else that the employee could have
 9 done with notice, that's not the case that you're arguing
 10 to us, is it?
 11 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, that's not our
 12 specific case, that's correct.
 13 QUESTION: Well, but it might be the case if we
 14 stipulate that in some instances additional leave must be
 15 granted.
 16 MR. BENNETT: It could be the case --
 17 QUESTION: If we stipulate that.
 18 MR. BENNETT: Correct, Your Honor.
 19 QUESTION: Then what the agency, what the
 20 Government is going to say, Department of Labor is, well,
 21 since in some instances you grant leave it's just
 22 administratively simpler for us to do it this way and you
 23 always get the leave.
 24 MR. BENNETT: Again, Your Honor --
 25 QUESTION: So it does make a difference in

31 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 answering the question whether or not leave can ever be an
 2 effective standard.
 3 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, again, under the
 4 statute, you read the statute, you look at the legislative
 5 history surrounding the statute, prior to the enactment of
 6 this statute Congress specifically noted in the
 7 legislative history that the United States stood alone in
 8 the industrialized world as not having leave for these
 9 particular types of conditions. Prior to the enactment of
 10 this statute, employees in this country didn't have the
 11 right to take 1 week of leave. Congress was looking to
 12 provide that the employees could get the leave.
 13 For an employee who receives 12 weeks of leave
 14 even if the employee doesn't understand that the leave is
 15 standing medical leave, what Congress was attempting to do
 16 under the Family and Medical Leave Act, Your Honor, will
 17 have been satisfied, again assuming, Your Honor, that the
 18 leave was for the four conditions that they provide in the
 19 statute and that the employer at least granted them 12
 20 weeks of leave, held their job open for 12 weeks of leave,
 21 did not in any way take away benefits that they had prior
 22 to taking the leave, and they helped maintain their health
 23 insurance. That was what Congress --
 24 QUESTION: I think there was one argument in the
 25 brief that she could have initially had the company leave

32 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 when she wasn't eligible yet, and then she could have said
 2 at that point, 4 weeks later when she became eligible for
 3 the FMLA leave, she could say, okay, company, stop the
 4 company leave. Now I'm taking my 12 weeks of Federal
 5 leave, and when I finish that, I'll go back and pick up
 6 the rest of my company leave. That she couldn't do here. 
 7 That one argument in the brief for petitioner was to that
 8 effect, and how do you respond to that?
 9 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, we -- that is a good
 10 point that Your Honor makes. What -- DOL has taken the
 11 statute out of context, and what they are creating is a
 12 separate category of leave specifically coded as, quote,
 13 FMLA leave. The statute doesn't mention that FMLA leave
 14 was to be in addition to any company leave. As a matter
 15 of fact, the statute and the legislative history is
 16 replete with references that Congress was well aware that
 17 employers out there such as my client had more generous
 18 leave policies. They put a provision within the statute
 19 and said, we do not intend by the enactment of this
 20 statute to discourage you from retaining those benefits or
 21 even providing even more generous benefits. What we're
 22 trying to do -- and they also provided in that very same
 23 statute, Your Honor, that employers cannot craft a
 24 regulation, or craft leave policies that go below.
 25 What they intended to do was, where an employer

33 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 had a leave policy that provided for leave, under these
 2 circumstances, if an employer had a policy that in all
 3 intent and circumstances would allow an employee off for
 4 leave for the four conditions they prescribed, if the
 5 leave was job-protected, health insurance was maintained,
 6 an employee didn't lose any other benefits while they were
 7 out on leave, but the employer's leave was only for 10
 8 weeks, all this act did was cause -- was augment that
 9 employer's policy to require the employer to provide the
 10 employee an additional 2 weeks of leave. This act wasn't
 11 meant to require the employer to grant the employee an
 12 additional 10 weeks on top of the 10 they already --
 13 excuse -- 12 weeks on top of the 10 they already had. 
 14 Congress could have said that in the statute.
 15 QUESTION: What if the employer's leave doesn't
 16 precisely mirror the statutory requirements? For example,
 17 what if the employer's leave does not allow intermittent
 18 leave? It says, you've got to take your 12 weeks in one
 19 big lump. You can't work, you know, half a week here,
 20 half a week there.
 21 MR. BENNETT: The statute deals with that, Your
 22 Honor, in the section dealing with interference. In that
 23 case the employee makes a request that they need
 24 intermittent leave, which they have a right to do under
 25 the statute. Congress specifically granted that. Then,

34 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 indeed, the employer's policy, to the extent they did not,
 2 they would be found -- the leave would not be consistent
 3 with family medical leave and you've now interfered with
 4 the employees' leave, and then the question becomes the
 5 remedy for that interference.
 6 QUESTION: But of course the employee has to
 7 know about the -- that particular right in order to invoke
 8 it.
 9 Going back to Justice O'Connor's question of
 10 your opponent, did your client give the statutory -- post
 11 the statutory notices?
 12 MR. BENNETT: Yes, Your Honor, we posted the
 13 statutory notices, and as a matter of fact, because my
 14 client has its own company-provided leave policy, this was
 15 within a collective bargaining agreement, and it's also
 16 within the employee's handbook, so the employees were
 17 aware of it through the collective bargaining agreement,
 18 through the employee handbook which was handed out along
 19 with the collective bargaining agreement to all employees. 
 20 The employer, my particular client, Your Honor, has a 5-
 21 day orientation process, and on one of those days they
 22 specifically go over with employees what their leave
 23 rights are on -- for -- with the company, so this employee
 24 has notice provisions.
 25 QUESTION: But that notice described the

35 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 collective bargaining agreement. Did it also describe the
 2 statutory requirements?
 3 MR. BENNETT: I do not believe there was any
 4 specific reference to the FMLA notice posting, Your Honor.
 5 I -- the employees are shown the bulletin board where all
 6 those notices are posted, title VII, wage and hour, and
 7 FMLA, but no, they're not specifically -- there's not a
 8 specific discussion --
 9 QUESTION: So that to the extent that there may
 10 have been a difference between the statutory requirement
 11 and the company policy, they would not have been advised
 12 of the statutory requirement.
 13 MR. BENNETT: Not by the company, Your Honor,
 14 but the statute doesn't require that. Congress said,
 15 here's the way employees should get notice. Congress
 16 could have crafted another way for employees to receive
 17 notice, but they said notice to the employees shall be
 18 made in this manner, and a general employer notice be
 19 posted to all employees, the same as the Congress has done
 20 for many of our other labor employment law standards. 
 21 They have said that's the method we find the best to
 22 notify employees of their rights.
 23 Employees are notified of their rights under the
 24 ADA in the very same manner. That statute is much more
 25 complicated than this particular statute, where an

36 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 employee who has a disability that could prevent them from
 2 working at all, not just for a few weeks but at all, has
 3 to know that they have to request an accommodation before
 4 an employer has a right to grant you one. That notice is
 5 merely a notice posting on the bulletin board for the
 6 employer, for the employee to know what their rights are
 7 in this statute, and this one is no different, Your Honor.
 8 DOL has crafted a whole new regulation. This
 9 regulation adds a whole new requirement on receiving
 10 leave.
 11 QUESTION: If the requirement was so difficult
 12 to deal with, one would expect there would have been some
 13 comment to that effect. This is with notice and comment
 14 rulemaking, and as I understand it there was no comment by
 15 employers about the requirement that notice be given that
 16 the leave is counting as family leave.
 17 MR. BENNETT: I believe there was a notice on
 18 these regulations when they came out initially, and then
 19 they issued final regulations, and I can't speak directly
 20 as to the comments that were -- all the comments that were
 21 made about this one particular regulation, but I believe
 22 the DOL in their brief does mention that there was not a
 23 objection --
 24 QUESTION: Yes.
 25 MR. BENNETT: -- specific objection by employers

37 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to that, and I believe that to be accurate, Your Honor,
 2 but I don't believe -- and I can attest for my client's
 3 purpose that we did recognize from reading that that what
 4 we were going to have to do was grant additional leave,
 5 additional leave, that we're not going to be able to grant
 6 additional leave, that we're going to have to grant
 7 additional leave over and above what we've given them. 
 8 We've given 30 weeks already for --
 9 QUESTION: But why wouldn't they recognize that,
 10 because that's what the regulation said. The regulation
 11 wasn't trying to disguise that that would be --
 12 MR. BENNETT: No, Justice Ginsburg, it was not. 
 13 I just do not believe that employers fully understood that
 14 that was the penalty provision under this particular
 15 regulation. It's now become very obvious that that's
 16 the -- that's a very steep penalty for employers who fail
 17 to provide the specific prospective notice to employees.
 18 The statute says, employer, if you get -- if an
 19 employee lets you know that they have -- they need leave
 20 for one of these four conditions, you're to look at that,
 21 make a determination whether or not the leave they are
 22 asking for falls within one of those four issues, whether
 23 it's a serious health of themselves, or family, or a birth
 24 or adoption. If it does, then employer, your obligation
 25 at that point is to grant the leave, and you grant the

38 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 leave under these conditions. You must make sure you give
 2 them at least 12 weeks, you must make sure their job is
 3 protected, you must make sure that you continue their
 4 health insurance, and you must make sure that their other
 5 benefits are not diminished during the term of the leave. 
 6 That's what Congress said all you have to do, employer, in
 7 granting the leave.
 8 DOL has now crafted a regulation that says, oh,
 9 hold on, in addition to that you've got to specifically
 10 notify them in advance you can do all of those things. 
 11 You can give them leave for all of those purposes, 30
 12 weeks in our case, but the leave doesn't count. Now,
 13 that's clearly inconsistent with Congress' stated purpose
 14 in providing a leave, what Congress said, what type of
 15 leave would qualify for leave under this --
 16 QUESTION: Well, are you therefore saying that
 17 even the notice provision is beyond the Secretary's power?
 18 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, we have taken the
 19 position that the statute --
 20 QUESTION: No, but I thought that's what you
 21 were suggesting a moment ago. Is that what you meant to
 22 suggest?
 23 MR. BENNETT: The notice --
 24 QUESTION: The Secretary cannot even require a
 25 notice?

39 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BENNETT: Correct, Your Honor. I think the
 2 statute has spoken to that. They talk about notice. That
 3 statute provides that the employee is to notify the
 4 employer of the need for leave. The statute goes on that
 5 once the employer receives the notice, the employer is to
 6 provide the notice. Congress used the term, notify, in
 7 regard to employee, and did not use the term notify in
 8 regard to the employer in that particular case, so you
 9 can't argue that Congress didn't consider notice. They
 10 clearly considered notice, and because they used notice in
 11 one particular portion of the statute and left it out in
 12 another particular portion of the statute, there's a
 13 presumption, Your Honor, that Congress did that
 14 purposefully and intentionally.
 15 QUESTION: What if the employer's leave does not
 16 comply with all of the conditions, all right, that are
 17 required by the act, and the employee goes off on that
 18 leave, and there's no notification that the employee could
 19 get more, could have the benefits continued or what-not. 
 20 What happens in that situation? Does that leave count? 
 21 It doesn't count as statutory leave, does it?
 22 MR. BENNETT: If the employee was given the
 23 leave, Your Honor, I believe that the leave counts. Then
 24 the issue becomes whether you've interfered with their
 25 rights under the statute. Did you -- for instance, if you

40 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 didn't hold their job open, let's just say you gave them
 2 the 12 weeks --
 3 QUESTION: Okay.
 4 MR. BENNETT: -- but you didn't hold their job
 5 open --
 6 QUESTION: Then the damage provision would cut
 7 in.
 8 MR. BENNETT: Correct, Your Honor.
 9 QUESTION: 12 --
 10 MR. BENNETT: The leave, it's not like, as if
 11 the leave doesn't count. They gave them the leave.
 12 QUESTION: The leave --
 13 MR. BENNETT: They gave them an additional 12
 14 weeks plus damages for not giving them their job back. 
 15 They just have to provide them their job back and any lost
 16 pay for failure to do that. But this regulation --
 17 QUESTION: But here there was a requirement that
 18 went beyond what the Federal act requires. That was the
 19 monthly recertification by the doctor that she still had
 20 this disabling condition. For the FMLA you don't need to
 21 have that monthly certificate, do you?
 22 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, the regulations
 23 promulgated by the Department of Labor provide that if an
 24 employer -- excuse me. If a physician certifies that an
 25 employee needs leave for more than 30 weeks -- excuse me,

41 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 for more than 30 days, say this employee's going to need
 2 to be absent for 60 days, or 90 days, the employer can't
 3 require during that initial certification that they
 4 recertify unless they have some other reasons to think
 5 they need to.
 6 But in this case, the doctor's certification
 7 that was provided to the employer was 30 days, and the
 8 statute says where the doctor doesn't provide for a longer
 9 certification, an employer can require that an employee on
 10 a -- provide certification on a reasonable basis no sooner
 11 than every 30 days, which --
 12 QUESTION: Well, wasn't the 30-day period chosen
 13 in this case because the employer's regulation says we'll
 14 only do it for 30 days at a time?
 15 MR. BENNETT: That is true, Your Honor. That
 16 is -- that was the company's policy to require the
 17 certification every 30 days.
 18 The legislative history again surrounding this
 19 statute shows that Congress clearly intended to limit
 20 leave to a total of 12 weeks leave. The length of this
 21 leave is the single most contentious issue Congress was
 22 faced in enacting the legislation. Indeed, there were
 23 those in Congress who wanted a more expansive leave, and
 24 there were those who wanted no federally protected leave
 25 whatsoever.

42 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: So you're saying it's a false
 2 question as to whether, when the employee takes leave,
 3 he's taking FMLA leave or employer's leave, that there
 4 aren't two categories?
 5 MR. BENNETT: No, sir, that's correct,
 6 Justice --
 7 QUESTION: So that you don't have to give the
 8 notice in order that the employee can know which of the
 9 two leaves he's taking. He just takes leave, and if the
 10 employer doesn't give him all of the benefits that the
 11 FMLA requires on that leave, then there's a damages
 12 provision in the act.
 13 MR. BENNETT: That's correct, Your Honor, there
 14 is no requirement in the statute that the employee notify
 15 the employer that they're taking leave. The only
 16 notification -- the only -- the provision that DOL is
 17 bootstrapping their argument to, or their regulation to,
 18 is 2612(b)(2), which says if you're going to do paid
 19 leave, if you're going to provide the employee with paid
 20 leave, which is not the case here, this was unpaid leave,
 21 if you're going to provide the employee with paid leave --
 22 which is not the case here. This was unpaid leave.
 23 If you're going to provide the employee with
 24 paid leave, Congress said, then you've got -- you can
 25 elect -- employer, you can to require them to use paid

43 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 leave, or the employee can use it if they don't have
 2 the -- if they need to take paid leave as opposed to
 3 unpaid, they can use that, but at that point the employer
 4 provides the leave. There's no provision that Congress
 5 said, if it's unpaid leave, you have to designate or
 6 substitute it for company-provided leave. Clearly
 7 explicit is that unpaid leave, as long as it meets these
 8 conditions, is FMLA leave.
 9 QUESTION: Well, there's no provision, but
 10 neither is there any clear answer to the question, and I
 11 suppose one of the arguments in favor of the Secretary's
 12 regulation here is that it really was a gap-filling
 13 regulation with respect to unpaid company leave. We've
 14 got to have a kind of default provision to know which --
 15 whether it counts or whether it doesn't count, and that's
 16 what the Secretary's reg addresses. What's your response
 17 to that?
 18 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, I believe the statute
 19 itself creates a default rule. In that case --
 20 QUESTION: For un -- when the company's leave is
 21 unpaid?
 22 MR. BENNETT: For the unpaid. It creates --
 23 QUESTION: What is the default rule?
 24 MR. BENNETT: In 2612(c) and 2612(d)(1), the
 25 statute specifically talks about unpaid leave, leave shall

44 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 be unpaid. (d)(1) provides that if you're going to
 2 require the employee to use paid leave and it's less than
 3 the 12 weeks, then the additional amount between the paid
 4 leave and the statutory 12 weeks is unpaid, up to a total
 5 of 12 weeks, so the statute says 12 weeks is all we're
 6 requiring. If it's not paid, then the remainder of it is
 7 unpaid. Now then -- and section (d) creates an exception
 8 to that.
 9 QUESTION: No, but that -- as I understand it,
 10 that addresses the issue of the character of leave, if
 11 there isn't a full 12 weeks provided, but as I understand
 12 it also there is no clear default provision when we have a
 13 situation in which there could be concurrent -- in which
 14 the leave could be seen either as unpaid company leave or
 15 as leave under the act. That question, is it under the
 16 act or is it under the company's plan, is answered in the
 17 case of paid leave but it's not answered in the case of
 18 unpaid leave. Am I missing something?
 19 MR. BENNETT: That's true, Your Honor. There's
 20 no specific provision about that. The statute itself
 21 talked about paid leave. It didn't mention the
 22 substitution of unpaid leave. Back again to the point I
 23 made earlier --
 24 QUESTION: And their argument is that because
 25 the statute didn't talk about that, there has -- or it is

45 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 reasonable for the Secretary to come up with a rule that
 2 tells us whether it counts against the act or whether it
 3 doesn't in the unpaid case.
 4 MR. BENNETT: Their assumption is that there's a
 5 gap and that it's reasonable for them to step in.
 6 QUESTION: That's right.
 7 MR. BENNETT: Our position, Your Honor, is that
 8 Congress specifically decided not to require that. They
 9 talk about in the statute a total of 12 weeks of leave. 
 10 The statute doesn't say a total of company -- or paid
 11 leave or unpaid.
 12 QUESTION: Well, Congress may not have required
 13 it, but at the end of the 12 weeks there's still the
 14 question, did this count under the statute, or didn't it
 15 count under the statute, and if the statute was silent, it
 16 would seem to be that that would be a subject for the
 17 Secretary's regulation.
 18 MR. BENNETT: But Justice Souter, the statute is
 19 not silent. The statute says, if you provide leave for
 20 one of these four conditions to one of your employees and
 21 you provide these benefits to them, these basic
 22 protections to them, then that leave is family medical
 23 leave.
 24 QUESTION: You're saying all leave counts under
 25 the statute.

46 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BENNETT: That's correct.
 2 QUESTION: All leave counts --
 3 MR. BENNETT: All leave.
 4 QUESTION: -- under the statute.
 5 MR. BENNETT: Paid or unpaid, Your Honor.
 6 QUESTION: And if you haven't provided in
 7 connection with the leave everything that the statute
 8 requires, such as a person can come back to the same job
 9 and so forth, there's a damages provision.
 10 MR. BENNETT: That's correct.
 11 QUESTION: Which is in the statute.
 12 MR. BENNETT: In the statute, that's correct.
 13 QUESTION: And on that assumption, what was the
 14 purpose of having the special provisions with respect to
 15 whether it counts as statutory or company when the leave
 16 is paid?
 17 MR. BENNETT: There are many employers out there
 18 who -- such as my client who have more generous leave
 19 policies. Congress wasn't concerned about those when they
 20 enacted this statute. It was those unenlightened
 21 employers, as Secretary Robert Reich called them in his
 22 testimony before the Congress on this issue, those who
 23 didn't see the need to have leave of any sort, or
 24 inadequate leave, that this act was sought to benefit.
 25 Those employers who had paid leave said, okay,

47 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 we provide unpaid, but what about our paid leave, can
 2 we -- what do we do about that, do we have to provide them
 3 the 12 weeks of unpaid leave in addition to our paid
 4 leave, and Congress specifically addressed that in the
 5 statute. If you have paid leave, and paid leave and
 6 vacation time and other personal time not necessarily for
 7 a serious health condition, Congress said, if you've got
 8 that, employer, if you're a generous employer that's going
 9 to provide that, we will allow you to substitute that
 10 leave for the unpaid leave we're requiring under this
 11 statute. You can require that, employer, that an employee
 12 take their paid leave, and then you just make up the
 13 difference.
 14 Again, Congress clearly thought 12 weeks was 12
 15 weeks. They were looking to accommodate the legitimate
 16 interests of the employer in this regard, not to burden
 17 the employer by requiring them to provide more than
 18 12 weeks of leave in this statute, but at the same time
 19 balancing the reasonable needs of employees to have at
 20 least -- at least 12 weeks of leave for family and medical
 21 conditions.
 22 Your Honor, I appreciate your time and attention
 23 this morning. Thank you.
 24 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bennett.
 25 Mr. Sutter, you have 4 minutes remaining.

1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LUTHER O. SUTTER
 2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 3 MR. SUTTER: The company never gave the doctor
 4 the option to allow Ms. Ragsdale to work intermittently. 
 5 On the joint appendix at page 63 and 64 the company form
 6 only asks whether the worker needs sick leave. It doesn't
 7 ask, like the certification required by the Department of
 8 Labor, whether or not the worker can work intermittently,
 9 and the form does not allow the doctor to certify more
 10 than 30 days.
 11 In fact, the actual policy at issue in this
 12 company, at issue here allows the company doctor to make a
 13 determination about whether or not Ms. Ragsdale was able
 14 to qualify for this leave. 29 U.S.C. 2613(e) prohibits
 15 that specifically.
 16 The question before this Court --
 17 QUESTION: There's a damages provision for that,
 18 I assume.
 19 MR. SUTTER: Yes. Yes, Justice, but there is
 20 also a provision for appropriate injunctive relief such as
 21 reinstatement and other -- and relief as the court may
 22 deem appropriate, and I would submit to you that, as one
 23 of the Justices recognized, this is not simply about
 24 money. This is a bundle of rights that you must know
 25 about before you can exercise them, and the company, as

49 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 counsel candidly admitted, would interfere with those
 2 rights once Ms. Ragsdale asked for them and the company
 3 refused to give them.
 4 The question then becomes, then, how is Ms.
 5 Ragsdale, or did the Secretary act reasonably when it
 6 required the company to tell Ms. Ragsdale about her rights
 7 to intermittent leave, her rights to extended leave more
 8 than 30 days, her right to be reviewed by a doctor that
 9 does not have a regular relationship with the company, as
 10 required by 2613(e), as well as her right to substitute
 11 paid leave. Ms. Ragsdale in this case had a week of paid
 12 vacation.
 13 Now, whether or not Ms. Ragsdale was prejudiced
 14 is a post hoc analysis. The Secretary has reasonably
 15 determined that these determinations should be made on the
 16 front end. All the employer has to do is make the
 17 election. It's in the employer's power --
 18 QUESTION: Well, of course, you couldn't really
 19 do it on the front end here because she wasn't eligible
 20 originally for FMLA leave. It had already happened.
 21 MR. SUTTER: Well, that's true, Justice
 22 O'Connor, but the regulatory scheme provides that the
 23 employer should have given her a date by which she would
 24 have been eligible for FMLA leave. Under the collective
 25 bargaining agreement this employer had to grant her this

50 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 leave. This is not a situation where it is out of the
 2 company's generosity. This agreement was extracted from
 3 the company by the union.
 4 QUESTION: Well, that's true of most agreements,
 5 isn't it?
 6 (Laughter.)
 7 MR. SUTTER: And that is why -- that is why
 8 Congress required the FMLA --
 9 QUESTION: But it is somewhat unusual that a
 10 union wouldn't advise the employees, its membership about
 11 their statutory rights.
 12 MR. SUTTER: Of course it is, and it might be
 13 entirely reasonable for me to stand up here and substitute
 14 my judgment for the Secretary's, but it is also equally
 15 reasonable that the company be allowed the benefit of
 16 making this determination, and to say that the requirement
 17 that employees communicate is infirmed, we disagree,
 18 because you see, 2612 -- 2611 requires communication for
 19 planning when intermittent leave is required. 
 20 Communication is the sine qua non -- I'm sorry, we don't
 21 speak much like that in Arkansas, but --
 22 (Laughter.)
 23 MR. SUTTER: except where you all can understand
 24 it, but --
 25 (Laughter.)

51 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SUTTER: -- information is the key to
 2 exercising these rights, and if you don't know that you
 3 have them, you can't exercise them, and Justice Scalia,
 4 that is the interference here, and when there's an
 5 interference --
 6 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Sutter.
 7 MR. SUTTER: Thank you.
 8 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The case is submitted.
 9 (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the
 10 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
