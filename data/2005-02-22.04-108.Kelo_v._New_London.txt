2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: We will now hear

3 argument in the case of Kelo vs. City of New London.

4 Mr. Bullock.

5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT G. BULLOCK

6 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7 MR. BULLOCK: Justice O'Connor, and may it

8 please the Court:

9 This case is about whether there are any

10 limits on government's eminent domain power under the

11 public use requirement of the Fifth Amendment. Every

12 home, church or corner store would produce more tax

13 revenue and jobs if it were a Costco, a shopping mall

14 or a private office building. But if that's the

15 justification for the use of eminent domain, then any

16 city can take property anywhere within its borders

17 for any private use that might make more money than

18 what is there now.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bullock, you are

20 leaving out that New London was in a depressed

21 economic condition, so this is distinguished from the

22 case where the State has no particular reason for

23 wanting this, but the critical fact on the city side,

24 at least, is that this was a depressed community and

25 they wanted to build it up, get more jobs.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, it's

2 important to point out it -- in first place that

3 chapter 132 of the statutory section at issue here

4 applies to every city within the State of

5 Connecticut, not those that are simply depressed.

6 And there is a fundamental difference

7 between an area like what was at issue in Berman, an

8 area that actually had problems and a city that has

9 certain problems. Every city has problems. Every

10 city would like to have more tax revenue, but that

11 cannot be a justification for taking the property --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you concede that on

13 the facts, more than tax revenue was at stake. The

14 community had gone down and down and the town wanted

15 to build it up.

16 MR. BULLOCK: It is a desire to try to

17 improve the economy through tax revenue and jobs.

18 That is certainly the case. But that cannot be a

19 justification for the use of eminent domain because

20 if the trickle down effects of economic development

21 are a justification, then there really is no limit on

22 the --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't concede, or do

24 you, that elevating the city from a depressed to

25 prosperous is a better justification than elevating a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 city from prosperous to more prosperous?

2 MR. BULLOCK: That is not -- that is

3 correct, Your Honor. We do not. And chapter 132

4 again applies to not so prosperous cities and

5 prosperous cities.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The line you draw is

7 between blight, which Berman says was in the public

8 use, lighted conditions okay, but depressed

9 conditions, not the best in line with the --

10 MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. We think

11 that that is a line that this Court has drawn that is

12 area specific that focuses on the conditions in a

13 particular area. And the condemnations in Berman

14 removed the problematic areas. It removed the

15 blight.

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Oh, but Berman spoke,

17 in the opinion, said that the determination of the

18 legislature about these things is virtually

19 conclusive, that there is only the narrowest,

20 narrowest role for the judiciary. What kind of

21 standard are you proposing we should get into here to

22 second-guess the public use aspect?

23 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, it is clear that

24 eminent domain power is broad, but there has to be

25 limits, and that's what we are really talking about

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 here.

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, have we ever in

3 any case from this Court said that the limit has been

4 exceeded?

5 MR. BULLOCK: In a few cases from earlier

6 in this century, Your Honor, the Missouri Pacific

7 case, the Thompson versus Consolidated Gas case, but

8 this Court has recognized for over 200 years that

9 there are limits on eminent domain power, that they

10 cannot be used for private cases. And that has been

11 a consistent strain throughout this Court's --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: Justice Douglas says

13 there that as long as it's an objective within

14 Congress and legislature's legitimate grant of power,

15 they can do it, I mean, as long as there's a -- so

16 why does there have to be a limit within that broad

17 limit?

18 MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, the limit

19 is that there cannot be takings for private use.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, there can't,

21 purely. But there is no taking for private use that

22 you could imagine in reality that wouldn't also have

23 a public benefit of some kind, whether it's

24 increasing jobs or increasing taxes, et cetera.

25 That's a fact of the world.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And so given that fact of the world, that

2 is law, why shouldn't the law say, okay, virtually

3 every taking is all right, as long as there is some

4 public benefit which there always is and it's up to

5 the legislature.

6 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, we think that

7 that cuts way too broadly. And it puts --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

9 MR. BULLOCK: Because then every property,

10 every home, every business can then be taken for any

11 private use. For any private development project.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: No. It could only be

13 taken if there is a public use and there almost

14 always is. Now, do you agree with that, or do you

15 not agree with my last empirical statement?

16 MR. BULLOCK: Well, again, the eminent

17 domain power is broad, but there has to be limits.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's, of course,

19 my question. The question is, if you agree with the

20 empirical statement that there almost always is some

21 public benefit attached, then my question is, why

22 must there be a limit within that broad framework?

23 MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, I think

24 with public -- with just having a simple public

25 benefit, then there really is no distinction between

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 public and private uses. And that is what we call

2 upon this Court to state, for instance, in the Berman

3 case and in the Midkiff case, which we think are

4 really at the outer limits of government's eminent

5 domain --

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But do you think those

7 were correctly decided or do you take issue with the

8 decision in those two cases?

9 MR. BULLOCK: We think that those

10 decisions can be consistent with ruling in favor of

11 Petitioners in this particular case, Your Honor,

12 because --

13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But you take the

14 position that a city that is suffering from enormous

15 lack of jobs and depression, economic depression,

16 that there is no public use purpose for taking land

17 to enable the creation of jobs?

18 MR. BULLOCK: That is correct, Your Honor.

19 We do not --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's assume that

21 the city instead of taking the property by eminent

22 domain simply used its, its own -- some of its own

23 regular tax income to buy up the property, and

24 assembled parcels of land with the purpose of selling

25 them to an industrial developer to raise the tax base

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and hence ultimately to raise taxes.

2 Would you say just within the meaning of

3 general understanding of proper governmental purposes

4 that the city was acting in a way that had no

5 legitimate public purpose?

6 MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, I think

7 the question goes to whether or not the government

8 could use its police power to acquire property and

9 then sell it to a private developer.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm not interested

11 in the label. I'm just saying if the government says

12 we need to increase the tax base because we have a

13 depressed city, so we are going to take some of our

14 tax money now, and we are just going to buy up

15 property that people are willing to sell to us, and

16 we are going to assemble parcels. And when we get a

17 big enough one, we are going to sell it to a

18 developer for industrial purposes. And that will,

19 that will raise the tax base. Is there anything

20 illegitimate as a purpose for governmental spending

21 in doing that?

22 MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor. We do not

23 believe that that would be some legitimate because

24 it's not a public use.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't there a public

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 purpose here?

2 MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, because

3 this case affects the eminent domain power, which is

4 regulated by the Fifth Amendment --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but we are talking

6 about -- I mean, I realize that, but I mean, I

7 thought your point was that it was use of eminent

8 domain power for an improper purpose. And you

9 characterize that purpose as conveying property to

10 private owners.

11 Well, in my example, the same thing is

12 going on except that it's not using the eminent

13 domain power. If the purpose in my example is a

14 proper public purpose, why isn't it a proper public

15 purpose when the government does it by eminent

16 domain? What changes about the purpose?

17 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, because of the

18 public use restriction of the Amendment. That's what

19 we really --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bullock, do you

21 equate purpose with use? Are the two terms the same?

22 Does the public use requirement mean nothing more

23 than that it have a public purpose?

24 MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's your answer to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Justice Souter.

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if that is your

3 answer then the slum clearance cases have got to go

4 the other way.

5 MR. BULLOCK: I'm sorry --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: If that is your answer,

7 then I suppose the slum clearance cases were wrongly

8 decided.

9 MR. BULLOCK: Well, your Honor, this Court

10 did hold in Berman and Midkiff that the police power

11 and eminent domain power are coterminous. That was a

12 holding especially of this Court's opinion in

13 Midkiff. And there are certain amici that have been

14 filed in this case, amicus briefs filed in this case

15 that have called upon this Court to re-examine that.

16 And of course, this Court is free to do so.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you are saying we

18 don't have to re-examine it, but I think your

19 adoption of Justice Scalia's approach puts you in a

20 difficult -- I think you're moving in the direction

21 of saying we really have got to overrule the prior

22 cases.

23 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I think under

24 a -- perhaps an original understanding of the takings

25 clause, there was a difference between public use and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 public domain.

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Just for the moment, what

3 about my question? And you can get into history, if

4 you want to, and I tend to be interested in that, but

5 my immediate concern is, if you give the answer that

6 you have just given, doesn't it jeopardize the

7 precedent of the slum clearance cases?

8 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I don't think

9 so, because of the caveat in Berman and Midkiff that

10 eminent domain cannot be used for private uses. And

11 that is what is really at issue here. What I think

12 was the focus of --

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what they

14 were being used for in Berman and -- everybody knows

15 that private developers were the beneficiaries in

16 Berman.

17 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I believe the

18 justifications focused upon the removal of the

19 offensive conditions in Berman, that the public

20 purpose, if you want to call it that, was served once

21 the blight was removed, the public purpose was served

22 once the oligopoly was broken up. Here the focus is

23 that --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: As I understand, you're

25 test then -- you want me to make a distinction between

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 blight which is a permissible governmental use,

2 governmental objective and economic revival, which

3 isn't?

4 MR. BULLOCK: Under the eminent domain

5 authority, Your Honor, we think that --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the line you

7 want me to draw.

8 MR. BULLOCK: Yes. And we think that that

9 is a line --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose an

11 economist or even a judge might say, well, it's

12 very clear that if this economic depression continues

13 for another five years we are going to have blight.

14 Blight is in the eye of the beholder, I know that.

15 MR. BULLOCK: Exactly. And I think that

16 that is really one of the dangers of the majority

17 opinion here is that it puts any property up for

18 grabs. Under the blight statutes, they actually have

19 to -- governments have to meet a certain objective

20 criteria to satisfy that this is actually a blighted

21 area.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it an

23 objective criteria to say that we are going to have

24 economic revival, avoid economic downturns?

25 MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, because, I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 think -- to get back to the decisions in Berman and

2 Midkiff, what this Court I think focused on there is

3 that the public use or the public purpose was direct

4 and immediate. It was served directly by the

5 condemnations and it was immediately served by the

6 removal of the blight and the breaking up of the

7 oligopoly.

8 In economic development condemnations, the

9 only public benefits that come about, if they come

10 about at all, are completely dependent upon private

11 parties actually making a profit. And that those

12 profits then somehow --

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the same thing

14 that is true in the railroads in the west.

15 MR. BULLOCK: But --

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Precisely the

17 description you gave applied to the railroads in the

18 west.

19 MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, those were

20 justified under I think the line of cases that held

21 that those were really essential for land assembly

22 for instrumentalities of commerce. They were --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this seems to be

24 really essential for the purpose of developing

25 industrial property to increase the tax base. The

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 argument is, and I don't know of any reason to doubt

2 it, that doing it seriatim by voluntary acquisition

3 and sale doesn't work.

4 So the rationale for this is essentially

5 the rationale for the railroads, for the public

6 utility line condemnations and so on. There isn't

7 another practical way to do it. And there is a

8 public benefit at the end, and that ought to qualify

9 it as a public use.

10 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, there are many

11 ways to do economic development without condemnation.

12 It happens every single day in this country. And in

13 the states that prohibit the use of eminent domain

14 simply for private business development, those states

15 do make the distinction between blighted areas and

16 simply their communities wanting to take advantage of

17 more tax revenue. And those states are doing fine.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though in Berman,

19 there was a department store that was not blighted,

20 and it was permissible because the whole area was to

21 be improved to raze that department store, even

22 though it wasn't contributing in any way to blight.

23 MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. But the

24 Court in Berman held that there were certain

25 properties that even though they might have been

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 nonblighted, it was essential to have those

2 properties in order to remove the blight from the

3 area that was at issue. So there was the ability of

4 government to get certain properties even though they

5 might have been nonblighted. Here --

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Bullock, would you

7 articulate the test that you would propose the Court

8 adopt. Some amici and others have argued that we

9 should use the substantially advances test, so-called

10 test from regulatory takings. What tests do you

11 articulate?

12 MR. BULLOCK: Well, for our bright line

13 rule, Your Honor.

14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.

15 MR. BULLOCK: The test should be that the

16 government cannot take property simply so that the

17 new owners can put it to ordinary private uses of

18 land. That's really the test. And the --

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's not what's

20 asserted here, of course. Here the city says, we are

21 doing this for purposes of enhancing economic

22 development of a very poor city.

23 MR. BULLOCK: True, Your Honor, but --

24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So what do we do with

25 that alleged purpose? What is your test?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BULLOCK: Well, the test, Your Honor,

2 for --

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it no economic

4 development purpose?

5 MR. BULLOCK: Yes. Yes. When it's only

6 justified in order to gain the secondary benefits

7 from ordinary private uses of land, and the way that

8 businesses always make use of their land to try to

9 make money or to try to make a profit. That's our

10 bright line rule.

11 But for our second test, if this Court

12 accepts that economic development can be a public

13 use, then we advocate a test of reasonably

14 foreseeable uses and minimum standards in order to

15 counter the dangers posed by such private involvement

16 in the use of eminent domain power.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: What's the latter. I

18 mean, I understand the former. That's a big retreat

19 and it comes to me now you're getting to what I

20 think is a possible realm of reason here. But the

21 second part now you said and minimum standards.

22 What minimum standards?

23 MR. BULLOCK: Well, the dissent in the

24 Connecticut Supreme Court talked a lot about minimum

25 standards that should be in place in order to ensure

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that public benefits actually come about. Those

2 could be such things as a commencement date for the

3 project, a construction schedule, financial

4 eligibility for the developers, there's a number of

5 different things.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I mean, are you

7 advocating particular ones?

8 MR. BULLOCK: Not particular ones, just

9 the standard actually be in place and we think that

10 the dissent provides some good guideposts for

11 establishing --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: The remaining test is the

13 --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that approaching --

15 Isn't that in effect changing the test from public

16 use to efficient public use? I mean, what's -- you

17 know, if I condemn land for a public utility and the

18 public utility turns out to be very inefficient, has

19 the condemnation been invalid?

20 MR. BULLOCK: No. Your Honor.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want us to sit

22 here and evaluate the prospects of each condemnation

23 one by one?

24 MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor, what we are

25 advocating for, and utilities of course are

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 justified, have long been justified under a separate

2 line of cases, common carrier regulations.

3 But what we are talking about are certain

4 minimum standards in place at the time of

5 condemnation to try to have some type of reasonable

6 certainty that the public benefits are to come about

7 so we are not talking about ongoing oversight. We

8 are simply talking about minimum standards at the

9 time of the, at the time of the condemnation.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it there isn't,

11 but maybe there is, there isn't any question in this

12 case that the city was acting in good faith and

13 did -- and I presume still does -- intend to convey

14 it to developers who will, will actually proceed to

15 develop a project. Is there a question about that?

16 MR. BULLOCK: A question of whether or not

17 the procedure --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, in other words, I

19 can understand perfectly well, why we would want to

20 draw a distinction between the use of the eminent

21 domain power that takes a parcel of property from

22 private person A and simply then reconveys it to

23 private person B without any particular object in

24 mind except that the city likes B, you know, the

25 mayor is the Democrat and B is the Democrat. That

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 kind of thing.

2 So I can understand the need for some

3 distinction between that case and what we've got

4 here. The question is when you say there have to be

5 minimum standards, I guess, is do we have a problem

6 historically or in this case about the good faith of

7 the taking so that we need the minimum standards to

8 make sure that we are not getting into the first

9 example?

10 MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. And there

11 is a number of reasons why there has to be reasonably

12 foreseeable uses --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there a reason in this

14 case? Is there some doubt here?

15 MR. BULLOCK: Well, it goes to the doubt

16 about whether or not the public benefits will

17 actually come about in this case. The takings here

18 are really for speculative purposes, pure speculative

19 purposes. And that's where the minimum standards

20 come into play to ensure --

21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But do you really want

22 courts to be in the business of trying to weigh the

23 evidence to see if the utility will be successful or

24 the hospital will be successful or the road will be

25 well constructed? I mean, what kind of a test are

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you proposing?

2 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, our test is

3 limited really to the condemnations that are

4 completely dependent upon the private businesses

5 actually being successful, and that those benefits

6 coming about so it would not affect utilities or

7 anything like that. But at a minimum, this Court

8 should require that the government actually name a

9 use.

10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does the record tell us

11 anything about how often takings by eminent domain

12 for economic development occur in this country? Is

13 it frequent? What are we dealing with?

14 MR. BULLOCK: It is, it is frequent, Your

15 Honor. There's no -- we do not know of any study

16 that looks specifically at condemnations for economic

17 development, but after the Michigan court's decision

18 in Poletown, they became commonplace.

19 And you had properties -- business that

20 were being condemned for casinos, other homes that

21 were taken for automobile manufacturers. And the

22 Michigan Supreme Court saw that as a disaster. And

23 overturned that.

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In all of those cases, I

25 think the economic feasibility or economic success

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

1 test would have been easily met. I mean, what you're

2 doing is trying to protect some economic value/ But

3 I think it's pretty clear that most economists would

4 say this development wouldn't happen unless there is

5 a foreseeable chance of success.

6 Let me ask you this, and it's a little

7 opposite of the particular question presented. Are

8 there any writings or scholarship that indicates that

9 when you have property being taken from one private

10 person ultimately to go to another private person,

11 that what we ought to do is to adjust the measure of

12 compensation, so that the owner -- the condemnee --

13 can receive some sort of a premium for the

14 development?

15 MR. BULLOCK: There may be some

16 scholarship about that. This Court has consistently

17 held that the property owner is simply entitled to

18 just compensation of the appraised value of the

19 property. Of course, the property owner --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you have to prescind

21 the project when you fix the value.

22 MR. BULLOCK: I'm sorry?

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You have to prescind the

24 project -- you have to -- you have to ignore the

25 project when you determine the value. The value is a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 willing buyer and a willing seller, without reference

2 to the project.

3 MR. BULLOCK: Yes, that is right. And so

4 they simply get the --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what I am asking is

6 if there has been any scholarship to indicate that

7 maybe that compensation measure ought to be adjusted

8 when A is losing property for the economic benefit of

9 B.

10 MR. BULLOCK: I believe there has been

11 some scholarship about it, but we think it's vital

12 that there be a public use requirement in those

13 takings as well.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you about the

15 standard. Go back for a second.

16 MR. BULLOCK: Yes.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: I gather that the Iowa

18 courts have a standard that includes whether there is

19 a reasonable likelihood that the intended public use

20 will take place. Now, is that the standard you're

21 advocating?

22 MR. BULLOCK: It's similar to our

23 reasonable foreseeability test that we set forth in

24 our brief that this Court actually talked about in

25 the Vester case as well, and a number of the other

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 state cases that are cited in our brief that

2 establish that there has to be a use for the property

3 and that that use has to be reasonably perceived.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a lot of

5 disagreement about this?

6 MR. BULLOCK: No, there's not.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it seems to me

8 you might -- whether there is a reasonable assurance

9 that there will in fact be the public use which the

10 state uses as the justification for taking the

11 property. Is that going to help you that much?

12 MR. BULLOCK: I think it will provide

13 important minimal standards of protection for --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, I don't see

15 how this Court could get into the business of saying

16 you have to have this by a particular day or you have

17 to have 14 witnesses. I mean, we couldn't impose

18 that sort of thing, could we?

19 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I think just the

20 standard needs to be in place.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: There needs to be a

22 reasonable assurance.

23 MR. BULLOCK: Exactly. Or at the very

24 least, a reasonable foreseeability as well, which is

25 at a minimum that is not even in place in this

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 particular case. And the majority of state courts

2 that have looked at this, that is a wel established

3 doctrine.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they might well

5 need it here.

6 MR. BULLOCK: Not in this case, Your

7 Honor.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you do that area

9 by area? I mean, one of the points you made, this is

10 divided into what, seven areas?

11 MR. BULLOCK: Right.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there's some -- to

13 be developed first, you say that your clients lived

14 in parcels that are not likely to be developed soon,

15 if at all. So when making this determination, is

16 development reasonably likely, do you have to do it

17 parcel by parcel or can it be with the whole --

18 MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor. We believe

19 it should be done where the property is actually

20 being conveyed. And we think that that is the

21 proper -- that is the proper test.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's not the area

23 development but this house, will there be -- is it

24 reasonably likely that there will be development in

25 that particular plot.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BULLOCK: In this particular parcel,

2 that is correct, Your Honor, and that has been

3 supported by ruling in just about every

4 condemnation --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you, I'm

6 sorry, I'll make this a quick question. Why do you

7 think it is necessary, given your position, why do

8 you think it's necessary to adopt the test you've

9 just articulated as distinct simply from a good faith

10 requirement. So that if somebody objected and

11 offered to prove bad faith, that would be in effect a

12 defense for the taking?

13 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, because that

14 does not really provide any protection to property

15 owners. The intent to benefit a private party, and

16 the intent to benefit the public are really one and

17 the same in these types of condemnations.

18 And we believe it is imperative at a

19 minimum because the condemnations are dependent upon

20 private parties even being successful that there has

21 to be reasonable foreseeable uses. And also, if this

22 Court so chooses, minimum standards in place to

23 ensure that those benefits actually go to the public.

24 I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.

25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Very well. Mr. Horton.

1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. HORTON

2 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3 MR. HORTON: Justice O'Connor, and may it

4 please the Court:

5 The principal purpose of the takings

6 clause is to provide for just compensation. Now, I

7 want to very briefly state two reasons why you do not

8 want to make a --

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but it has to be

10 for a valid public use.

11 MR. HORTON: Yes, it does, Your Honor.

12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay.

13 MR. HORTON: I completely agree with that,

14 but if the primary purpose of the takings clause is

15 not to regulate legislative determinations of that,

16 but it seems to me that what the opposition is asking

17 for is two tests.

18 One for Berman and Midkiff and National

19 Railroad, and another test for Kelo. There is no

20 principle basis for a court to make what is really a

21 value judgment about whether a long-term plan to

22 revive an economically depressed city is a public use

23 of a higher or lower rank constitutionally --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: But he doesn't -- he

25 doesn't, his second test does not adopt that. The

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 second test which he was arguing at the end is just

2 that there has to be a reasonable assurance that the

3 public use, and it could include all those things,

4 will in fact take place.

5 MR. HORTON: Yes, Justice Breyer. And I

6 noted his remark because that's actually in

7 concession because that's the test the Connecticut

8 Supreme Court imposed. And they have --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: That may be, but what do

10 you think of that test?

11 MR. HORTON: I don't, I don't agree. I

12 don't think it's necessary to do that, because if you

13 have that test, you have to say, well, what do I do

14 about, about other areas than this.

15 Berman is an excellent example of that,

16 because as Justice Ginsburg said, Mr. Berman's

17 property was not blighted. You needed to take

18 Mr. Berman's property in order for the economic

19 development that was going to occur later on.

20 And the question is, was it reasonably

21 assured that the economic development -- in fact,

22 some of the other side's amicus briefs say that that

23 worked out terribly down there, and all it was was

24 discriminating against the poor and, and poverty

25 stricken people and it didn't accomplish any goal --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Horton, what, what

2 difference does it make that, that New London was in

3 an economic depression? Would it not be fully as

4 much, under your theory of a public use, for a city

5 to say, yes, we are not doing badly, but we could do

6 better. Let's attract some high-tech industry here.

7 You can't possibly draw a line between depressed

8 cities and undepressed cities, can you?

9 MR. HORTON: I would not draw a line.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't. And you

11 wouldn't ask us to do it either.

12 MR. HORTON: I would not ask -- I have a

13 back-up argument that you do not need to reach that

14 issue here in light of the facts of this case. But

15 I -- to be candid with you, my view is that the test

16 you have is -- there is no principle --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any city can do it. And

18 in the hypothetical that Justice Souter gave earlier

19 where, you know, you couldn't take it from A and give

20 it to B, because B is a good Democrat, you could take

21 it from A and give it to B if B is richer, and would

22 pay higher municipal taxes, couldn't you?

23 MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. But I have

24 a caveat on that. If you're talking about one

25 property, you're very likely to have a Willowbrook

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 versus Oleck problem about discrimination, you know,

2 intentional discrimination against somebody else's

3 property.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I just want to take

5 property from people who are paying less taxes and

6 give it to people who are paying more taxes. That

7 would be a public use, wouldn't it?

8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: For example, Motel 6

9 and the city thinks, well, if we had a Ritz-Carlton,

10 we would have higher taxes. Now, is that okay?

11 MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. That would

12 be okay. I -- because otherwise you're in the

13 position of drawing the line. I mean, there is,

14 there is a limit. I mean --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that, if that's

16 so then the occasional statements that we see in the

17 writing that you can't take from A to give to B is

18 just wrong?

19 MR. HORTON: No. I don't agree with that.

20 A good example is -- well, there is Missouri Pacific.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think you can't take

22 from A to give to B, that there is some substance and

23 force to that proposition?

24 MR. HORTON: There is some force to it. I

25 certainly wouldn't --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me qualify it. You

2 can take from A to give to B if B pays more taxes?

3 MR. HORTON: If it's a significant amount.

4 Obviously, there is a cost --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll accept that. You

6 can take from A and give to B if B pays significantly

7 more taxes.

8 MR. HORTON: With that --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You accept that as a

10 proposition?

11 MR. HORTON: I do, Your Honor.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But without the

13 addition, I'd please like an answer to your question.

14 MR. HORTON: I'm sorry.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There are statements in

16 our cases that say you cannot take from A just to

17 give to B.

18 MR. HORTON: Yes.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that there

20 is substance to that proposition and that that

21 proposition is correct?

22 MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. I do. And

23 to --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that exactly

25 what happened in Berman?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HORTON: Your Honor, in Berman, the --

2 what has --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't that exactly what

4 always happens unless it's for a firehouse or a

5 school?

6 MR. HORTON: Your Honor, my position is

7 that purely taking from one person to give to another

8 that shows no public benefit other than just giving

9 from -- taking from one person to another would not

10 be a public use.

11 A good example is the Missouri Pacific

12 case. The one case in 200 years of this Court's

13 jurisprudence where you have, in fact, struck such a

14 taking that was not a regulatory taking.

15 I would also point out that there are a

16 few cases around the country where it does not

17 include Justice Scalia's hypothetical about

18 additional taxes.

19 An excellent example of that is the case

20 the other side has cited from New Jersey. Casino

21 Properties versus Bannon, where the Trump Association

22 just wanted a parking lot that was next door. There

23 was no assembly problem. No problem putting small

24 parcels together. There was no talk in the case

25 about taxes or more taxes or more jobs or anything.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 It -- the trial judge there didn't say it

2 was just for a public purpose -- a private purpose,

3 but he said it was overwhelmingly just for the Trump

4 organization's -- so, I mean, if you include Justice

5 Scalia's hypothetical about more taxes, then I say

6 that's sufficient, as long as you get over --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what the

8 Connecticut Supreme Court that we are reviewing said,

9 you -- you are arguing, it seems to me, for something

10 that goes beyond what was adjudicated in this case.

11 I mean --

12 MR. HORTON: Yes.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a finding, a

14 finding before to be a fact in the trial court that

15 this development was going to be primarily for the

16 benefit of the citizens of New London, and not for

17 the benefit of Pfizer or the private developer.

18 MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. I agree

19 with that and that is why I say my back-up position

20 is you don't need to determine whether you go beyond

21 economic depression of a city in this particular

22 case.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a factual

24 finding? You consider that a factual finding?

25 MR. HORTON: I think it's a mixed question

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of fact and law --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that this is

3 primarily for the benefit of the city of New London,

4 not for the benefit of a --

5 MR. HORTON: I consider that --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: In the eye of the

7 beholder, to whom do you think this does greater

8 benefit to, not a factual finding.

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: When, when there is no

10 condemnation to acquire property for the direct use

11 of the public, as for a public right-of-way, or a

12 utility path or something, where it's purely economic

13 development, is there any reason why we shouldn't

14 draw a clear line and say that isn't a public

15 purpose. Let them go out and deal with -- buy it on

16 the market, on the open market. What's the matter

17 with that?

18 MR. HORTON: Well, for one thing we have

19 in this case, and this comes back to the point about

20 this particular case, is a severe assembly problem.

21 We have 115 properties we are talking about on this

22 90-acre plot, and there is 32 acres that come from

23 one place, from --

24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let's look at the

25 specifics here. Pfizer is already in place. That's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 happened.

2 MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor.

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So what are these

4 parcels of the people now before us going to be used

5 for?

6 MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. First of

7 all, it's a long-range plan. If I could have, if I

8 could have the chart, please, if I may show you Your

9 Honor.

10 The -- we are out on a peninsula here, and

11 here is Pfizer down here, which at the time of the

12 taking was almost completed. They moved in a month

13 afterwards. Up here is an old state -- old fort from

14 the 19th century that the state agreed to turn into a

15 state park as part of an overall plan. The overall

16 plan is this whole thing.

17 Now, parcel one is going to be a hotel, is

18 planned for a hotel. Parcel two was planned --

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Let's talk about the

20 litigants.

21 MR. HORTON: Yes.

22 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Before us today.

23 MR. HORTON: Yes. That's right. They are

24 in parcel 3 and they are in parcel 4-A. Now, the --

25 it's to be developed in phases. The first phase is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 one and two. The next phase is then three and four,

2 A, and there is also a marina --

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's planned for 3

4 and 4-A?

5 MR. HORTON: What's planned for 3 is that

6 it's going to be office space. And the expectation

7 is there is going to be a demand for class A office

8 space, which is the best quality office space in this

9 area by 2010. And the expectation is that it will

10 attract the sorts of offices that will feed on the

11 Pfizer. They spent $300 million on a site here.

12 In addition, I may point out, this is the

13 Amtrak line going along here. The only way you can

14 get to parcels 1 and 2 is to go right by parcel 3 or

15 go right by parcel 4-A.

16 This is a waste water treatment facility.

17 Parcel 4-A is for park support or marina support.

18 Now, it isn't more definitive, but obviously, one

19 possible use is for parking here because you've got a

20 waste water treatment facility here. You've got the

21 park here. You've got the marina here and you've got

22 the other parcels here.

23 It's not like we are talking, as in

24 Berman, you're talking about something that's in the

25 parcel. And in Berman, they said it's not for the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 court to decide where the boundary lines ought to be.

2 It seems to me that's another point, Justice

3 O'Connor. It's not like parcel 3 --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, can't the courts at

5 least -- can't the courts, could the courts -- do you

6 object to this, and I'm not advocating it, I want

7 your reaction.

8 MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Could the courts, under

10 this clause, at least review what you've just said

11 for reasonableness? I mean, look at the

12 reasonableness of a claim that this is for --

13 basically for a public use. Look at the

14 reasonableness of the claim that we should do it this

15 way, rather than excusing the people who don't want

16 to sell their houses no matter what and doing it a

17 little bit differently.

18 Reasonableness is a concept that's already

19 in the Constitution in terms of what the legislature

20 can do, but I'm thinking of the stronger kind of

21 reasonableness review that you might have in an

22 administrative action. Now, is, Overton Park, if you

23 want a case. Is that a possible kind of review that

24 you might find appropriate here?

25 MR. HORTON: No, Your Honor, if what

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you're defining as reasonableness is being higher

2 than rational basis. Because in that situation,

3 you're applying a higher standard for a taking where

4 we are paying for it than you would be for --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the reason that you

6 would apply a somewhat higher standard is because the

7 rational basis, with tremendous deference, applies to

8 the power of Congress to act in an economic area in

9 the absence of a particular constitutional provision

10 designed to protect a minority from the actions of

11 the majority.

12 And if you read that public purpose

13 doctrine, a section here as having that in mind, you

14 might want a somewhat higher level of review. Now,

15 that's the whole thing spelled out. I'm not

16 advocating it. But I am putting it forward to get --

17 to get your reaction.

18 MR. HORTON: Your Honor, that same type of

19 remark could be made about rational basis equal

20 protection review.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, and indeed with equal

22 protection, we very often do have a somewhat higher

23 standard of review.

24 MR. HORTON: Ah, yes, Your Honor, but the

25 point here is that you should not have a higher

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 standard of review because we are paying for it. It

2 would be ironic to have a higher test than for

3 example in a regulatory taking or even the same test.

4 You have a test in Nollan and Dolan, for example,

5 which is an exactions case. So that's to say --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Horton, you're paying

7 for it, but you're also taking property from somebody

8 who doesn't want to sell it. Does that count for

9 nothing? Yes, you're paying for it, but you're

10 giving the money to somebody who doesn't want the

11 money, who wants to live in the house that she's

12 lived in her whole life. That counts for nothing?

13 MR. HORTON: No, of course not, Your

14 Honor.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, let me ask --

16 would, would the reasonableness standard, if the

17 project is indeed reasonable, and there is genuine

18 prospect that all of these good things that you're

19 talking about will happen, why wouldn't private money

20 come in to further the project? Why is it necessary

21 to condemn it if it's so reasonable. Why couldn't

22 you, you -- now, you say there is a holdout for one

23 part, parcel. Couldn't the city fund a private

24 purchase of that parcel? Say, you know, we'll make

25 funds available out of our general tax revenue to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 somebody who wants to come in and put together this

2 system? Of course, that person has to buy out

3 property owners, but we'll, we'll give you money to

4 buy them out at high prices.

5 MR. HORTON: Your Honor, there are some

6 plaintiffs who are not going to sell at any price.

7 They want to stay there. You've got a severe

8 assembly problem in this case and it's not as though

9 you can say, well, go somewhere else.

10 You have a situation where you've got the

11 Pfizer plant that is being built there. You've got

12 the state park that's there. You've got this Naval

13 underseas facility that just came on the market.

14 That's the only place anything is going to work and

15 it's -- and it's five to six square miles of town. I

16 mean, there is no other place to go.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How much, how much of

18 this was voluntarily sold, is that correct?

19 MR. HORTON: The large share of it was,

20 but of course, that's because there is always in the

21 background the possibility of being able to condemn

22 it. I mean, that obviously facilitates a lot of

23 voluntary sales. And if, if this is not -- if this

24 is not -- let me put it this way. I mean, there is

25 going to be a more severe holdout problem.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: That may be. Now, that's

2 why I'm back to reasonableness. You see, we are told

3 in the briefs that the people who often might hold

4 out, might be doing so to get more money, but it

5 might also be because they are poor, they are not

6 well connected politically, and their only hope is to

7 go to a court and stop this thing.

8 So you'd give them two weapons. Weapon

9 one is you have to pay them. That's correct.

10 Compensation. And weapon two is they can put you to

11 a test of being reasonable. That might be quite a

12 deferential test, so you might have every leg up.

13 But they at least could catch the instances where

14 this is really not reasonable to do to them what

15 you're doing to them that they don't want.

16 MR. HORTON: I have two responses to that,

17 Your Honor. First of all, that applies to all sorts

18 of takings. If I'm building a road, let me give you

19 an example of the Rindge case that Your Honors

20 decided in the 1920s.

21 That was the road to nowhere. It was a

22 road that went through a farm to the county line.

23 And the other county had no intention at that point

24 of building a road, but Your Honors said, well, they

25 might get around to it at sometime so it's a good

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 idea to build it now.

2 We had a similar situation in Hartford.

3 There is supposed to be a ring road around Hartford,

4 and the State condemned all this land for a ring road

5 around Hartford. Well, one little bit of it was done

6 and then just this, this year, in very low print in

7 the last page of the newspaper, we see about the

8 state getting around to selling the land because they

9 didn't, they didn't do it.

10 I mean, this can happen in the railroad

11 case is a good example. The railroad case. The one

12 Your Honors decided. If it's -- being a common

13 carrier makes all the difference, then how come the

14 ICC just didn't order the Boston & Maine to fix the

15 railroad? You know. Why? You know, you didn't look

16 to make a --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Common carriers are

18 subject to state regulation to a degree that private

19 companies are not. They must, they must treat all

20 comers alike. I mean, I don't think the public

21 utility cases are at all comparable to condemning

22 land in order to get a new company to move in and pay

23 more taxes. I just don't think it's similar.

24 MR. HORTON: Well, I would like to point

25 out that the -- there is a difference, the whole

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 point is about having a test about reasonable

2 assurances about whether something is going to happen

3 and that's where the railroad case makes a

4 difference.

5 QUESTION: I agree with you on that.

6 MR. HORTON: That's the only point I was

7 making, Your Honor. I didn't mean to go further than

8 that. But coming back to Justice Breyer's point, you

9 made a point about poor people. And I'd like to

10 point out, unless you're going to overrule Berman,

11 you know, poor people and minorities are more likely

12 to be vulnerable in the blight cases than in this

13 case.

14 I mean, this is a good example. Economic

15 development can take place anywhere in town. Blight

16 happens in one area of town where the poor and the

17 minorities are likely to live, and in fact, this very

18 case, we have got middle class people. There is no

19 blight that's been alleged in the condemnation

20 papers.

21 The other thing is if you stick to blight,

22 this is the problem you're going to have. You're

23 going to end up making a blight jurisprudence

24 because -- because what's going to happen is the

25 cities are going to say, we can only do this by

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 blight, so they are going to have marginal

2 definitions of blight.

3 Florida, for example, says property is

4 blighted if it's vacant. Is that blight? I mean,

5 you're going to have a big headache in that --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm accepting that

7 you can't make that kind of a distinction. That's

8 where I'm focusing on a test that would possibly

9 apply only where you transfer property from one

10 private person to another, but still wouldn't make

11 those distinctions of blight or not blight.

12 MR. HORTON: Yes. But I mean, the other

13 thing is, are you going to make -- would the Court

14 make a distinction between a case where the city is

15 doing the developing itself, and another case where

16 the city gives it to a private person.

17 I'd like to point out, my client is going

18 to keep the property. It's -- it's going to be

19 leased to a developer. It's not going to be sold to

20 the developer. So I mean, if this developer builds a

21 building on this property, and then doesn't comply,

22 they are in big trouble.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It does seem ironic that

24 100 percent of the premium for the new development

25 goes to the, goes to the developer and to the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 taxpayers and not to the property owner.

2 MR. HORTON: Well, that's an interesting

3 point. A question was raised earlier about the other

4 side about whether there should be --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The compensation

6 measures.

7 MR. HORTON: The compensation measures.

8 Exactly. By the way, the answer to your question is

9 if there is some -- if there is some scholarly

10 articles on that, I'm not aware of it either.

11 But I would point out that's something,

12 you know, in terms of social costs and things like

13 that, that is something that this Court might or

14 might not wish to consider in a just compensation

15 case, but I don't think it should affect whether you

16 take the property or not. It seems to me that is --

17 I'm not taking a position on that one way or another,

18 but it seems to me that's -- you have to assume in

19 this case that there is going to be just

20 compensation.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: On that point, just in

22 Connecticut, if the property owner goes to the jury

23 and receives more than the state offered, does the

24 state also have to pay those attorneys' fees?

25 MR. HORTON: Under -- under state law?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under Connecticut law,

2 if the property owner is offered $100 but goes to the

3 jury and gets $200, does the property owner have to

4 pay the attorneys' fees or does the state pay the

5 attorneys' fees?

6 MR. HORTON: The state does not pay

7 attorneys' fees, Your Honor. Everybody pays his own

8 attorneys' -- and likewise, the other way, if it's

9 lower amount than what was put in than, you know,

10 it's not as though the state gets attorneys' fees

11 back. It works both ways.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Horton, what do you

13 think is the reason that there are not a lot of

14 examples of the sort that I think one of Justice

15 O'Connor's hypotheticals raised, in which the, I

16 don't know, the Econoline Motel gets condemned so

17 that the Ritz can be built, thereby increasing tax

18 revenue and so on, kind of parcel by parcel

19 augmentations to the tax base and so on. Why aren't

20 there a lot of examples like that?

21 MR. HORTON: I think there is two good

22 reasons for it, and that it's a theoretical more than

23 a practical problem. First of all, you've got all

24 sorts of transaction costs when you, when you go

25 through eminent domain, as opposed to doing things

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 voluntarily.

2 So you are not going to do things -- as a

3 as a practical matter, to take Justice Scalia's

4 earlier example, for one piece of property because of

5 the transaction costs involved. I mean, you're never

6 going to make up -- unless it's to, you know, to

7 favor the governor's friend or something like that,

8 as you say.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: In which case we have a

10 different --

11 MR. HORTON: In which case you have a

12 different problem. The Willowbrook versus Oleck

13 test.

14 QUESTION: Okay. So we have transaction

15 costs.

16 MR. HORTON: Transaction costs, but that

17 is a serious problem. And the other thing, there is

18 the democratic process, Your Honor. I mean,

19 especially if the taxpayers are paying for something

20 and you know, they are getting a bad reason or run

21 around about the reason, you know, that's subject to

22 review.

23 It seems to me democracy can make good

24 decisions and -- or bad decisions under the

25 Constitution, but the important thing is that when

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it's paid for, it's not like regulatory takings which

2 are, you know, the taxpayers don't see that until

3 it's too late. You know, in this type of taking, the

4 taxpayers are seeing up front what's going on.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true. But now,

6 put yourself in the position of the homeowner. I

7 take it, if it's a forced sale, it's at the market

8 value, the individual, let's say it's someone who has

9 lived in his house his whole life. He bought the

10 house for $50,000. It's worth half a million. He

11 has 450,000 profit.

12 He pays 30 percent to the Government and

13 the state in taxes, and then he has to live

14 somewhere. Well, I mean, what's he supposed to do?

15 He now has probably 350,000 to pay for a house. He

16 gets half a house because that's all he is going to

17 do, all he is going to get for that money after he

18 paid the taxes, or whatever.

19 And I mean, there are a lot of -- and he

20 has to move and so forth. So going back to Justice

21 Kennedy's point, is there some way of assuring that

22 the just compensation actually puts the person in the

23 position he would be in if he didn't have to sell his

24 house? Or is he inevitably worse off?

25 MR. HORTON: Well, I mean, first of all,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the -- in Connecticut, fortunately, we have

2 relocation loans which are involved here. And they

3 are available in this case.

4 There was, it wasn't clear from our brief

5 whether they were loans or not, and it is correct

6 that they are loans. The other side pointed out that

7 that was for all projects in the state. That's not

8 true, you know, I mean, there is $10 million involved

9 in relocation funds.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the loans don't make

11 him whole. Isn't --

12 MR. HORTON: That's true.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, what bothered

14 Justice Breyer I guess bothers a lot of us. And that

15 is, is there a problem of making the homeowner or the

16 property owner whole? But I suppose the answer to

17 that is that goes to the measure of compensation

18 which is not the issue here.

19 MR. HORTON: Yes. And that's, and I had

20 said that earlier. But another point when I was

21 talking about roads is that applies to -- that could

22 apply to any type of case. It doesn't just apply to

23 a case like this.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would really

25 overrule a bunch of prior cases and really throw

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 condemnation law into chaos.

2 MR. HORTON: Yes. And Justice Scalia, a

3 question you -- or actually it was a comment you had

4 made about public use versus public purpose. And

5 that would not only overrule -- and my opposing

6 counsel said there is a difference between the two.

7 And when pressed by Justice Souter -- and I would

8 point out, that's just overruling cases going back to

9 Berman. That's overruling two decisions by --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the remedy?

11 Let's repose the problem to which I want to remedy

12 then. And maybe this isn't the right remedy.

13 But the remedy that they are saying, and

14 I'm really repeating it, is an individual has a house

15 and they want to be really not made a lot worse off,

16 at least not made a lot worse off just so some other

17 people can get a lot more money. Now what, what is

18 the right -- is there no constitutional protection?

19 If this isn't the right case, what is?

20 MR. HORTON: Well, the right case is in

21 the just compensation concept, but going to your,

22 your point, if this were here as just compensation, I

23 would say in terms of just compensation, in deciding

24 what the fair market value is today, you can

25 certainly take into account the economic plan that's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 going into effect. You know --

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Really? I thought that

3 that was a fundamental of condemnation law that you

4 can not value the property being taken based on what

5 it's going to be worth after the project. That's

6 just --

7 MR. HORTON: Well --

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Unless Connecticut law

9 is much different from any other state.

10 MR. HORTON: I may have misspoken on that

11 subject, Your Honor.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You didn't misspeak. But

13 you know, in any case --

14 MR. HORTON: I apologize, I --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: What this lady wants is

16 not more money. No amount of money is going to

17 satisfy her. She is living in this house, you know,

18 her whole life and she does not want to move. She

19 said I'll move if it's being taken for a public use,

20 but by God, you're just giving it to some other

21 private individual because that individual is going

22 to pay more taxes. I -- it seems to me that's,

23 that's an objection in principle, and an objection in

24 principle that the public use requirement of the

25 Constitution seems to be addressed to.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HORTON: But as I say, Your Honor, if

2 public use and public purpose are the same thing,

3 which they are unless you're going to overrule

4 Holmes' decisions from 1905 and 1906.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't the first of

6 Holmes' decisions to be overruled.

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I think you'd

8 have to take some substantial chunks of language out

9 of Berman as well, because Justice Douglas spoke very

10 expansively in that case.

11 MR. HORTON: Plus I think Holmes was right

12 when he said that to say that the public actually has

13 to use the property is not an appropriate meaning of

14 the phrase, so I would not think you'd want to

15 revisit that case, even if you want to revisit some

16 other of Holmes' decisions.

17 But the -- I guess the best answer I have,

18 Justice Breyer, to your question, after I, after I

19 misspoke is simply to go back to the point that the

20 time at which you consider what just compensation is,

21 is in the just compensation proceedings.

22 And while I misspoke about what the test

23 was, and I apologize for that, certainly this Court

24 can consider if social costs should be taken into

25 account at that time. I'm not saying they should. I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 haven't thought that through as can you obviously see

2 by my misanswering the question, but it seems to me

3 because my primary answer is that you don't look at

4 that now.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, the tax

6 code does have special provisions for involuntary

7 sales and reinvestments.

8 MR. HORTON: Yes, it does.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The tax hypothetical is

10 not accurate.

11 MR. HORTON: Yes.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Horton, I'm not

13 proposing that the state has to use the property

14 itself. I'm simply proposing that its use not be a

15 private use which has incidental benefits to the

16 state. That is not enough to justify use of the

17 condemnation power.

18 MR. HORTON: Well, I don't think --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can give it to a

20 private entity, you can give it to a railroad, to

21 some public utility. But the use that it's put to by

22 that railroad and public utility is a public use.

23 That's why it's a public utility.

24 It's quite different to say you can give

25 it to a private individual simply because that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 private individual is going to hire more people and

2 pay more taxes. That, it seems to me, just washes

3 out entirely the distinction between private use and

4 public use.

5 MR. HORTON: Well, I don't agree, Your

6 Honor, because I think, you know, I think if a person

7 is without a job and if a person is not able to get

8 basic services that they need from the town because

9 the town can't afford it, that's just as important as

10 a trains running on time or eliminating blight.

11 And Justice Breyer, I thought of another

12 answer to your question that has to do with this

13 case. And that is even on a higher test, we win

14 because the Connecticut Supreme Court applied a

15 higher test in this case.

16 And just -- I would say that in this case,

17 the essence of federalism is to let various courts

18 make various decisions about what they consider an

19 important public purpose. It may be different in

20 Utah from the way it is in Connecticut, and it's

21 different in Florida, and I don't think this Court

22 should be having a new jurisprudence for this area

23 and having two separate tests, and maybe having a

24 test that even approaches the Nollan Dolan test where

25 you certainly want to discourage people from taking

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 these actions.

2 And so it seems to me the four words I

3 think that this Court should consider -- and I'm not

4 going to tell you the four words since my red light

5 is on. Thank you, Your Honor.

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Bullock, you have

7 three and a half minutes.

8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY SCOTT G. BULLOCK

9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Bullock, do you know

11 those four words?

12 MR. BULLOCK: I wish I did. I could

13 respond to it if I -- if I actually did. Your

14 Honors, first of all, just a couple of matters

15 regarding the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision.

16 The Connecticut Supreme Court did not apply the test

17 that we suggest in our case, they explicitly, the

18 majority explicitly declined to apply heightened

19 scrutiny in this, in this instance.

20 I think the key to understanding their

21 argument is the answer to the question of, can you

22 take a Motel 6 and give it to a fancier hotel? Their

23 answer is yes. And that's what's really at stake

24 here.

25 These condemnations are taking place

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 throughout the country. A city in California

2 condemns the 99 cents store in order to give it to

3 Costco. Now, were they giving enormous benefits to

4 Costco? Of course they were. But they did so

5 because they wanted to get the tax revenue, and

6 that's the problem with these types of condemnations,

7 the desire to help a private party and the desire to

8 help the public are really one and the same. The

9 public only benefits if the private party is

10 successful.

11 The NLDC is a private body. It has a

12 private board of directors, and it is leasing land to

13 a private developer for 99 years at $1 a year. That

14 is private ownership of land.

15 Also, Your Honors, there is no severe

16 assembly problem in this particular case, and in many

17 other development situations. The NLDC and the city

18 have 32 acres that was given to them by the Federal

19 Government for them to do as they wish. And our

20 homeowners who have lived there a long time and wish

21 to hold on to their properties do not object to that

22 development going on. It is within the rights of the

23 city and the NLDC to do so.

24 Also, Your Honor, the Rindge case that was

25 cited by the Respondents, they actually knew what was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 going to go on in that, in that case. They knew what

2 the use was going to be.

3 And finally, Your Honors, the Respondents

4 talk about the effect that this may have upon poor

5 people. Not all neighborhoods, not all poor

6 neighborhoods are blighted. But the one thing that

7 all poor neighborhoods share in common is that they

8 don't produce much in the way of tax revenue, so

9 you're going to put poor neighborhoods and working

10 class neighborhoods like the ones that exist in Fort

11 Trumbull in jeopardy if the Court affirms the

12 decision below.

13 And that's why so many organizations that

14 are concerned about the rights of senior citizens and

15 the rights of minorities and poor folks like legal

16 services corporations have joined in our side to

17 support the property owners in this case. If there

18 is no further questions, Your Honors, I will close.

19 Thank you.

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Thank you Mr. Bollock.

21 The case is submitted.

22 (Whereupon, at 11:12 a.m., the case in the

23 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
