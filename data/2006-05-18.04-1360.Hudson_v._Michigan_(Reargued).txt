3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear reargument

4 this morning in Hudson v. Michigan.

5 Mr. Moran.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8 MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 For centuries the knock and announce rule has

11 been a core part of the right of the people to be

12 secure in their houses from unreasonable searches and

13 seizures. It reflects the notion that when the

14 government has the right to enter a house, whether to

15 perform an arrest, to search for evidence, or to seize

16 goods, that the people should have the right to answer

17 the door in a dignified manner, except in an emergency,

18 and to avoid the unnecessarily gratuitous embarrassment

19 and shock that often follows a precipitous police

20 entry.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So wouldn't it be

22 more accurate to say that it's protected the right to

23 be free from unreasonable entry as opposed to

24 unreasonable search and seizure?

25 MR. MORAN: Well, this Court has recognized

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in Wilson, consistent with the common law authorities,

2 Mr. Chief Justice, that they are connected, that the

3 entry directly affects the reasonableness of the search

4 and seizure that occurs within. And that's why this

5 Court in Miller and in Sabbath suppressed the evidence

6 following knock and announce violations. But in

7 Wilson, this Court directly stated that the common law,

8 the Fourth Amendment, -- the common law that informs

9 the Fourth Amendment, directly demonstrates that the

10 Framers thought that the method of entry directly

11 affects whether a search or seizure inside a home is

12 reasonable.

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so in your view,

14 there has to be a 4- to 6-hour search for complex

15 financial records, business documents. There's a

16 warrant. The search is otherwise proper. They forget

17 to knock. They say, oh, you know, we are police

18 officers. There's a discussion for a while. But --

19 anything seized after that is -- must be suppressed.

20 MR. MORAN: If there is --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It just seems to me in the

22 hypothetical I put -- and there's obviously a reason I

23 put it -- is there's just no causal link between the --

24 the suppression and -- and the failure to knock.

25 MR. MORAN: Your Honor, the evidence inside

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- the evidence is seized inside. The seizure of the

2 evidence inside is directly related to the manner of

3 entry, just as there's a direct causal link between

4 when the officers come in without a warrant when they

5 should have gotten a warrant first. They thought there

6 was an exigent --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you say directly

8 related. That -- that assumes the very point that I

9 have in mind. I don't know why it's directly related.

10 MR. MORAN: Well, going back to Wilson, this

11 Court said in Wilson, if I might quote from Wilson,

12 that the -- the common law search and seizure leaves no

13 doubt that the reasonableness of a search of a dwelling

14 may depend in part on whether law enforcement officers

15 announce their presence and authority prior to

16 entering.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It depends -- it depends in

18 part.

19 MR. MORAN: It depends in part, certainly.

20 There are other factors as well, but the reasonableness

21 of the search depends in part.

22 The issue --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, what -- what do you

24 do with our opinion in -- in 1986 in Segura v. United

25 States, which seems to me to contradict your assertion

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that you cannot separate, for purposes of the

2 exclusionary rule, the manner of entry from the search?

3 In that case, the -- the policemen entered without a

4 search warrant. So the entry was clearly a violation.

5 They left two officers in the room and other officers

6 went back and got a search warrant. When they returned

7 with the search warrant, the two officers who were in

8 the room proceeded to do a search, and we admitted the

9 evidence. It seems to me that in that case, we -- we

10 did succeed in -- in separating the -- the entry from

11 the subsequent search, and I don't know why -- why we

12 can't do the same thing here.

13 MR. MORAN: Because there were exceptional

14 circumstances, Justice Scalia, in Segura.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what were the

16 exceptional circumstances?

17 MR. MORAN: A 19-hour delay and a warrant

18 that was obtained that had nothing to do with the

19 initial entry. That was in no way dependent on the

20 initial entry.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're still, it would seem

22 to me -- I don't know -- the warrant wasn't dependent

23 on the initial entry? You could also say the initial

24 entry wasn't the product of the -- of the later

25 warrant.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MORAN: The initial entry was not the

2 product of the later warrant, but once this Court ruled

3 --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And therefore was unlawful.

5 MR. MORAN: That's right. The -- the initial

6 entry wasn't lawful.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But we didn't hold -- but we

8 didn't hold that.

9 MR. MORAN: Well, but this -- the Government

10 in Segura never contested the fact that the evidence

11 that was seen and seized during the initial entry

12 should be suppressed. And that's all we're asking for

13 here.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me? No, I don't

15 understand that.

16 MR. MORAN: When the officers went in

17 initially in Segura, some evidence was seen and seized

18 at that time, and the Government did not contest that

19 that evidence should not --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I'm talking about only

21 the evidence that -- that was the product of the search

22 conducted after the warrant was delivered.

23 MR. MORAN: That's right.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that evidence was

25 admitted in.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MORAN: Right, but the --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though the entry of

3 those officers was an unlawful entry.

4 MR. MORAN: The entry -- the initial entry

5 was an unlawful entry. When they came back with the

6 warrant --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no, no. The -- there

8 was no subsequent entry. You said the initial entry

9 was unlawful. Those officers stayed there. Their

10 presence there was the product of an unlawful entry.

11 MR. MORAN: Their presence was, yes.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Their presence was the

13 product of an unlawful entry, and nonetheless, we

14 admitted in the -- the material that they obtained in

15 the search after a warrant had been obtained.

16 MR. MORAN: I -- I read Segura as saying that

17 the presence -- the later presence of the warrant,

18 which was in no way tainted by the initial entry, made

19 the officers' presence in the home retroactively lawful

20 from that point. It was unlawful until that point,

21 which is why the Government did not contest the -- the

22 point that all the evidence that was seized during the

23 initial entry up to the point when the warrant was

24 issued had to be suppressed. That's all we're asking

25 for here.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1 I can imagine hypotheticals in which you have

2 a knock and announce violation and then something

3 happens like in Segura or like in Murray, where you

4 have later action that creates an independent source.

5 But in your typical --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the -- suppose the

7 officer -- excuse me, we forgot to knock, but we are

8 police officers. We do have a warrant. We're going to

9 proceed with a search. Please don't be alarmed. We're

10 going to -- does that do it?

11 MR. MORAN: That might do it. That would be

12 a different case than the case we have here --

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but your -- your

14 point is -- is there -- is that they have to go out and

15 come back in again.

16 MR. MORAN: You would have to create some

17 sort of analogy to Murray and Segura. Murray and

18 Segura are exceptional cases. There are very rare

19 cases when the Government breaks in and then realizes

20 we shouldn't have done that. We should go get a

21 warrant.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree. Segura -- I

23 forget what it is in torts. It's kind of a

24 supervening, independent cause or something like that.

25 MR. MORAN: Yes. Yes. And -- and you can

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 have -- imagine such hypotheticals in the knock and

2 announce context. And in the Moreno case in the Ninth

3 Circuit, you have one where you have a knock and

4 announce violation committed in the outer door. No

5 evidence is found in the outer door, but then the

6 officers properly knock and announce at the inner door,

7 and the Court in the Ninth Circuit held that that was

8 proper to seize that. We have no problem with that.

9 That -- that seems like a proper result because

10 ultimately the purposes of the knock and announce rule

11 were vindicated when the officers knocked and announced

12 at the inner door before -- before forcing entry.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Moran, how -- how

14 long do you think the officers had to wait before they

15 could have entered?

16 MR. MORAN: In this case?

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

18 MR. MORAN: From Banks, somewhere closer to

19 15 seconds. 15 to 20 seconds was considered --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would -- if they

21 had done that, what would have been different from what

22 happened in this case?

23 MR. MORAN: Mr. Hudson presumably would have

24 gotten up from his chair, would have come to the door,

25 would have admitted the officers, and then after --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you presume

2 that? Someone sitting in a chair with gun -- with a

3 gun and the drugs you say would have gotten up and

4 said, oh, it's the police. Let's see what they want?

5 MR. MORAN: We presume that people act

6 lawfully in response to commands from the police. We

7 do not presume that people will act unlawfully. If the

8 police have evidence or information that someone will,

9 in fact, act unlawfully by trying to dispose the

10 evidence or by --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't a good sign of

12 what might have happened what actually happened when

13 the police came in, which was there was an effort to

14 hide the evidence?

15 MR. MORAN: The record does not disclose any

16 effort on Mr. Hudson's part to hide any evidence, Your

17 Honor.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- where --

19 where were the drugs found?

20 MR. MORAN: The rocks of crack cocaine, for

21 which he was convicted, were found in his left front

22 pants pocket.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where was the gun

24 found?

25 MR. MORAN: The gun was in the chair.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the chair?

2 MR. MORAN: In the chair. There was no

3 evidence that there was any secreting of evidence in

4 this case.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any reason

6 to suppose that if the officers had waited 15 seconds

7 instead of the 3 to 4, that they wouldn't have found

8 the same evidence?

9 MR. MORAN: It's always possible, Your Honor,

10 but we don't presume that. Just as in Segura, the

11 Court said --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the only -- the

13 only reason they wouldn't have found the same evidence,

14 I take it, is if they -- if -- if the defendants had

15 had additional time to dispose of it.

16 MR. MORAN: We don't contest that they would

17 have found the same evidence, no. We do not argue that

18 Mr. Hudson or any of the other people in the house

19 would have destroyed the evidence.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is --

21 MR. MORAN: We certainly don't make that

22 argument.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is in the chair the same

24 thing as on the chair?

25 MR. MORAN: I --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: You tell me something is in

2 the chair. Did they stuff it -- stuff it in the

3 cushion or what?

4 MR. MORAN: It's not really clear from the

5 record, Justice Scalia.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, inside it --

7 MR. MORAN: It's in -- in the chair.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's pretty clear

9 you don't talk of something as being in the chair.

10 It's on the chair unless you stuff it in the chair. I

11 assume he stuffed it behind a pillow or something.

12 MR. MORAN: I'm not completely clear exactly

13 where in the chair it was.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: English is English. You

15 said it was in the chair.

16 MR. MORAN: In the chair.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

18 MR. MORAN: 49 of the 50 States currently

19 suppress evidence following knock and announce

20 violations, just as this Court did in -- in Miller and

21 Sabbath.

22 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what do you think is

23 the standard for determining what sort of causal

24 connection there has to be in order to have suppression

25 here?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MORAN: We go back to the Wong Sun fruits

2 test. Is the evidence that was recovered the direct

3 fruit of the violation? In other words, is there a

4 clear, logical connection? Now, my opponent --

5 JUSTICE ALITO: What's the purpose of the

6 causal connection requirement? What's the reason for

7 having it?

8 MR. MORAN: Well, it's so -- it's so that

9 there is a -- an obvious connection. Before the court

10 takes the step of -- of excluding evidence, there

11 should be some connection, some clear connection,

12 between the violation and the evidence recovered. But

13 my --

14 JUSTICE ALITO: And what's the reason for

15 requiring a clear connection?

16 MR. MORAN: I suppose that it's simply the

17 matter of logic, that evidence that's completely

18 unrelated to a violation nobody would think should be

19 -- should be excluded. But evidence --

20 JUSTICE ALITO: But why?

21 MR. MORAN: Well, it's -- it's unrelated. So

22 if, for example, the police break into my house and --

23 and find evidence -- find nothing in my house -- they

24 illegally break into my house, but then they -- they do

25 a proper warrant search of my office and find evidence,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I -- I don't -- I don't see any connection between the

2 illegal search of my house and the legal search of my

3 office, assuming that it was not the fruit of the

4 illegal search of my house.

5 JUSTICE ALITO: But why? Isn't the reason

6 just a -- just a question of crafting an appropriate

7 remedy for -- an appropriate deterrence --

8 MR. MORAN: Yes.

9 JUSTICE ALITO: -- for violations?

10 MR. MORAN: Exactly. It -- the whole point

11 is deterrence. And so you wouldn't deter the officers

12 who illegally broke into my house by excluding the

13 evidence from my office if -- if -- it may even well be

14 different --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure you would. Sure you

16 would.

17 MR. MORAN: Well, it may well even be a

18 different --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you'd deterred him

20 more if you threw the whole case out, but we don't do

21 that.

22 MR. MORAN: No, we don't.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

24 MR. MORAN: We -- we limit --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we insist that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the deterrence somehow be related --

2 MR. MORAN: We do.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to the -- and -- and the

4 related usually means that the acquisition of the

5 evidence was the product of the violation. It was

6 caused by the violation. And -- and for that reason,

7 we keep it out.

8 And here, it's -- it's hard to say that this

9 was caused by the fact that they -- that they entered

10 in a few seconds too soon. So he would have answered

11 the door and they would have seen the stuff.

12 MR. MORAN: What the knock and announce

13 violation causes, Justice Scalia, is the officer to be

14 illegally in the home. Going back to the common law

15 authorities, the courts have long recognized --

16 American courts have long recognized that an officer

17 who illegally enters a home, even with a valid writ or

18 a valid piece of paper allowing him to be in the home,

19 if the manner of entry is illegal, he is a trespasser.

20 His entry is -- is void ab initio. And so in that

21 sense, the entry is the cause of the illegal --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Although you say it can be

23 retroactively validated.

24 MR. MORAN: After Segura --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, in Segura, you can

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 retroactively validate it by -- by getting a warrant

2 afterwards.

3 Could it be -- have been retroactively

4 validated by knocking and announcing afterwards? I'm

5 -- I'm sorry we came in too soon, and they run back to

6 the door and they knock and announce and wait -- wait

7 10 seconds.

8 MR. MORAN: Again, I --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that do the job?

10 MR. MORAN: I concede that it's possible that

11 you can come up with a Segura-type hypothetical. I

12 think the easiest one is the Moreno case from the Ninth

13 Circuit.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: The hypothetical sounds

15 ridiculous only if one accepts your explanation of

16 Segura, that -- that it was somehow a retroactive

17 validation.

18 MR. MORAN: Well --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry. I have laryngitis.

20 Can you hear me all right?

21 MR. MORAN: Yes, I can, Justice Breyer.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Why is it retroactive

23 validation? I would have thought Segura and those

24 cases are Silverthorne cases.

25 MR. MORAN: It is. It's an --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: All that it is is it's an

2 independent chain of events.

3 MR. MORAN: It's an independent source.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: An independent chain of

5 events that almost certainly would have led to the

6 discovery of the evidence despite -- not without --

7 despite the unlawful entry. And if that's so, all we

8 have is a -- is a set of cases where deterrence is most

9 unlikely to play any significant role because no

10 policeman could possibly count on that kind of thing

11 getting the evidence in --

12 MR. MORAN: And that's exactly right. And --

13 and the situation we have in Michigan now is that

14 officers know to a certainty that if they violate the

15 knock and announce rule, nothing will happen. And so

16 that's why in all the other States --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not true.

18 There are cases where the violation of the knock and

19 announce rule gives rise to evidence that may be

20 admitted and that would presumably be excluded if you

21 can show that the seizure is related to the violation.

22 The problem here is that the evidence that is being

23 suppressed, as -- as you've suggested, that there's no

24 question that it would have been available if the

25 officers had waited 15 seconds as opposed to 4 seconds.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, none of the

2 parties has been able to identify any cases in which

3 you can point to evidence and say this -- this evidence

4 was produced by the knock and announce violation and

5 nothing else in the house --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Solicitor General

7 hypothesized one in the amicus briefs. If somebody --

8 you know, they -- they burst in and someone screams,

9 you know, run away, it's the police, that excited

10 utterance caused by the absence of a knock and announce

11 would presumably be related to the violation and could

12 be suppressed. That doesn't mean that the gun and the

13 drugs that are found in the room is in the same

14 category.

15 MR. MORAN: If I may make two responses to

16 that. First, the Solicitor General hypothesized such a

17 case but has not identified a single case where that's

18 ever happened. It's purely hypothetical.

19 But the second point is that excluding that

20 evidence would have no deterrent effect whatsoever

21 because by -- by definition, that's evidence that the

22 police would only get by committing the knock and

23 announce violation. So the police lose nothing by

24 risking the possibility that somebody will make an

25 excited utterance and then say, okay, we won't get to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 use that excited utterance, but we would never have

2 gotten that excited utterance in the first place.

3 That's not deterrence, Mr. Chief Justice. That's

4 restitution. That's like saying that I can be deterred

5 from stealing something by being told that if I'm

6 caught, I'll have to give it back.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What it is is

8 recognizing that if there is a fruit of the illegal

9 act, it is suppressed so that there is a cost to the

10 illegal act. What it's saying is that not everything

11 that happens after the illegal act is a fruit of the

12 illegal act.

13 MR. MORAN: I think your question, Mr. Chief

14 Justice, really goes to the worst position language in

15 Nix, and the point is, from our brief, is that this

16 Court has placed the prosecution in the worst position

17 than it would have been had the police acted lawfully

18 dozens, possibly scores, of time -- times.

19 All the cases in which the Court has noted

20 that the police easily could have obtained a warrant.

21 Most recently in Georgia v. Randolph, where this Court

22 noted that there were two lawful methods for the police

23 to get the cocaine -- the cocaine residue on the straw,

24 but still suppressed the evidence. The police and the

25 prosecution do get placed in a worse position, and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that's necessary for deterrence. What --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it have been

3 possible for these police to get a no-knock warrant?

4 MR. MORAN: It might well have been. I was

5 asked this question last time, Justice Ginsburg, and

6 I'd like to modify my answer. In Michigan, there is no

7 statute governing no-knock warrants, and there's --

8 there are also no court decisions governing no-knock

9 warrants. And there never will be under the People v.

10 Stevens regime.

11 One of the nice things that's happened in --

12 in -- since Wilson v. Arkansas, in fact, before Wilson

13 v. Arkansas in many States, is courts have developed --

14 developed procedures for police officers to get no-

15 knock warrants, to go to the police and ask for a no-

16 knock warrant.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about in this

18 case, which is Justice Ginsburg's question? If the

19 police said, we have reasonable grounds to -- to

20 believe that he has a weapon and we're also looking for

21 drugs that are easily disposable, would that be grounds

22 for knocking -- for not -- for dispensing with the

23 knock requirement?

24 MR. MORAN: Could the -- could a judge have

25 issued such a warrant in Michigan? Is that your

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 question?

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's take it step by

3 step. Suppose the police articulate this at the outset

4 --

5 MR. MORAN: It could well --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and under -- under State

7 procedures, they're allowed to make the on-the-spot

8 judgment. Would that -- would those facts suffice to

9 allow them to enter without the knock?

10 MR. MORAN: If they had specific information

11 along those lines, that -- that there was evidence

12 hidden in places or -- or stored in places where it

13 could easily be disposed --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is that correct? I

15 thought in most States, there had to be a statute that

16 authorizes a non-knock warrant.

17 MR. MORAN: In most States --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that most States do

19 have such statutes. And we had this case because

20 Michigan chooses to go on -- on a separate path.

21 MR. MORAN: Most States do have statutes, but

22 a few States by court decision have allowed for the

23 issuance of no-knock warrants. My point --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Even -- even if Michigan

25 doesn't, I mean, that has nothing -- as I understand

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it, that -- that doesn't affect the -- the answer to

2 the Federal question that we have because, as I

3 understand it, we -- we can -- we can take as good law

4 that even with a warrant that does not have a no-knock

5 authorization, if the police have a justification for

6 going in without knocking, so far as the Fourth

7 Amendment is concerned, the search is still good.

8 MR. MORAN: That's right.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that correct?

10 MR. MORAN: Absolutely.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: So what we're really arguing

12 is what -- what is Michigan law on the subject, but the

13 -- the issue we've got is not Michigan law.

14 MR. MORAN: That's right. And this case

15 comes to us in the posture in which --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is a -- this is a

17 place -- a case in which the warrant was for drugs. Is

18 that not so?

19 MR. MORAN: It was.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so in -- in this

21 case, they could have entered in your view if they had

22 specific knowledge of the gun and disposable

23 contraband.

24 MR. MORAN: Yes, after Banks and -- and

25 Richards, especially Richards, if the police had

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reasonable suspicion that you had contraband in a

2 position where it could be easily disposed and if they

3 had information about the weapons that could be used to

4 resist the police entry, then yes, there could have

5 been a -- a legal no-knock entry.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about just the former

7 without the latter? I thought the former alone would

8 be enough.

9 MR. MORAN: Either would be. That's correct,

10 Justice Scalia.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Going back to my question,

12 isn't it then a reasonable assumption, based on the

13 police experience in case after case, that where there

14 -- where narcotics are housed, there is often a gun and

15 there is ease of disposal, couldn't the police simply

16 say this is a narcotics search and therefore we don't

17 need to knock and announce because those circumstances

18 will be present in most cases?

19 MR. MORAN: No, because this Court

20 unanimously foreclosed that argument in Richards v.

21 Wisconsin by holding that there must be a

22 particularized showing for the particular case. That

23 particularized showing I will gladly concede will be

24 easier to make in a narcotics case than it would be in

25 a -- in a stolen property case.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 But it wasn't made in this case, and this

2 case comes to this Court on the posture that the

3 prosecution has conceded, at every step of the way,

4 that that particularized showing was not made here and

5 that, therefore, there was a knock and announce

6 violation.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. A

8 particularized showing of what?

9 MR. MORAN: That in this particular case,

10 it's likely that the drugs would be in an easily

11 disposable situation and that the occupants would be

12 armed and ready to resist the police entry. And there

13 was no such showing made here.

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --

15 MR. MORAN: The prosecution didn't even

16 attempt to make such a showing.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm vaguely recalling

18 cases from the court of appeals in the D.C. Circuit

19 that accepted a presumption that if there are drugs

20 around, there are likely to be firearms around. Are

21 you saying that that's inconsistent with the Richards

22 decision?

23 MR. MORAN: That might not be inconsistent,

24 but the -- the -- to follow that up with, therefore,

25 you can do a no-knock entry automatically is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 inconsistent with the Richards decision.

2 The --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?

4 As I understand it, the prosecutor conceded a violation

5 of the knock and announce rule.

6 MR. MORAN: Yes.

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: And I'm just wondering. In

8 Michigan, since there's no adverse effect to it, do the

9 prosecutors routinely concede that there's a violation

10 because there's no point in litigating it I suppose?

11 MR. MORAN: Well, I don't even think we get

12 that far, Justice Stevens. Motions to suppress aren't

13 filed. There's no point filing a motion to suppress

14 except for the -- the fact that this case is pending in

15 this Court. There's no point for --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that if the issue

17 arises, you can assume the prosecutor will always say,

18 yes, we'll assume there was a violation. There would

19 be no reason not to assume that.

20 MR. MORAN: That's right.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you'll never really

22 litigate in Michigan how far they can go before they

23 violate the rule.

24 MR. MORAN: It's a dead letter in Michigan.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But I assume that lawsuits

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 are allowable if -- if knock and announce is -- is not

2 observed, and if you intrude upon someone in a state of

3 undress.

4 MR. MORAN: Michigan --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't a civil lawsuit

6 bringable?

7 MR. MORAN: Michigan has a particularly

8 vigorous State immunity statute that makes it

9 effectively impossible to sue for a -- a knock and

10 announce violation. I have not found a single Michigan

11 case in which anyone has successfully sued for a knock

12 and announce violation.

13 You can sue in Federal court under section

14 1983, but there you run into various doctrines,

15 especially including qualified immunity.

16 I made the claim the first time and it still

17 hasn't been contradicted by my opponents. We've not

18 been able to find any cases, published or unpublished,

19 in which anyone has collected anything other than

20 nominal damages anywhere in the United States --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But those doctrines

22 that you're talking about would be overridden on the

23 hypothetical that you want us to be concerned about.

24 In other words, you're saying if you don't suppress the

25 evidence, there's going to be no incentive to comply

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 with the law. So they're going to deliberately violate

2 the law. Well, if they're deliberately violating the

3 law, qualified immunity isn't going to help them very

4 much.

5 MR. MORAN: Qualified immunity would still

6 protect them to the extent that any reasonable officer

7 could have thought that a -- a no-knock entry was

8 valid. I cited a number of cases, for example, where

9 innocent people have been shot following entries into

10 wrong doors, and qualified immunity has been granted to

11 the officers.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute. The

13 government is not arguing here that -- that it's valid.

14 It's just arguing that though it is invalid, the

15 punishment for it should not be to let the criminal go.

16 That's -- that's all they're saying.

17 MR. MORAN: That -- that is their argument.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: The punishment for the

19 invalidity should not be the -- the inadmissibility of

20 all of the evidence of the crime that was found.

21 MR. MORAN: That --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's quite different

23 from saying that it's -- that it's valid. So I think

24 they acknowledge that -- that a lawsuit against an

25 officer who knowingly dispenses with -- with knock and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 announce because, as you say, he says there's --

2 there's no consequence, but there is a consequence. He

3 can be sued.

4 MR. MORAN: I assume --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes he may be

6 going into the wrong house and the person suing him may

7 not be a criminal, but may be some -- some innocent --

8 innocent bystander.

9 And -- and what about -- you know, you say

10 there's no incentive to knock and announce. There --

11 there may -- you don't know any Michigan cases in which

12 a -- a civil suit has succeeded, but I know numerous

13 cases in which police who -- who burst in without

14 knocking and announcing expose themselves to danger,

15 that is, to being shot at by a -- by a householder who

16 doesn't know that they are the police. Isn't that

17 enough of -- of an incentive, the fact that you may

18 lose your life?

19 MR. MORAN: No, Your Honor, because I think

20 what some officers will do is exactly what Officer Good

21 did in this case, which is shout police and then burst

22 in immediately. So they'll do the announce part, which

23 protects the police, to some extent, from being shot,

24 but they will skip the rest of the knock and announce

25 requirement, which is to wait some reasonable amount of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 time to allow the householder to make himself more

2 dignified, to get to the door, to answer the door, to

3 admit the police in a dignified manner.

4 You raise the point that lots of innocent

5 people are subject to search warrants. Thousands of

6 cases every year of -- of people who didn't do anything

7 either --

8 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think you said the --

9 you thought the police here had to wait what? 15

10 seconds? What was the figure you gave?

11 MR. MORAN: Well, from Banks, this Court

12 ruled that 15 seconds -- 15 to 20 seconds was an

13 appropriate time for a drug search.

14 JUSTICE ALITO: And now suppose they waited 10

15 seconds. And so there would be a -- a constitutional

16 violation? Why would suppression be appropriate in

17 that situation? Why would it be in any way

18 proportional to the -- to the violation that occurred?

19 MR. MORAN: Well, if it was 10 seconds,

20 Justice Alito, the government still might have an

21 argument. 15 seconds was enough in Banks. The Court

22 did not say --

23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, wherever the line is,

24 suppose they're just -- they're just slightly on the

25 wrong side of the line?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MORAN: I think as a practical matter,

2 that if the police are just very slightly on the wrong

3 side of the line, the courts are not likely to hold

4 that there was a knock and announce violation. But

5 when you have a flagrant violation like here --

6 JUSTICE ALITO: Then you're -- you're

7 contradicting the premise.

8 MR. MORAN: Well, in a case like -- in a --

9 if a court were to hold that the police did violate the

10 knock and announce requirement by coming in -- by

11 coming in, by not giving the person a reasonable amount

12 of time to come to the door or to make himself

13 presentable, then yes, the evidence should be

14 suppressed because those officers need to be deterred.

15 The -- the exclusionary rule is all about deterrence,

16 and is there any method that will deter officers from

17 violating the knock and announce requirement other than

18 excluding the evidence by teaching them through example

19 that next time you need to wait longer? You need to

20 wait a reasonable amount of time for someone to come to

21 the door unless you have facts suggesting that waiting

22 a reasonable amount of time would defeat the purposes

23 of the search.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about -- you talk about

25 deterrence. What about their not getting promoted? I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 assume that -- that police departments, even if you

2 have some maverick officers, that the administration of

3 the police department teaches them that they have to

4 knock and announce. Or if it doesn't teach them that,

5 then you do have a 1983 cause of action against the

6 city, not just the officers. And that -- you know,

7 that's a deep pocket.

8 MR. MORAN: I very seriously doubt officers

9 such as Officer Good will not be promoted because of

10 the violation that he committed --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Really?

12 MR. MORAN: -- in a case like this.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you know, I'm the

14 police commissioner and I have a policy that you -- you

15 obey the law, you knock and announce, and -- and I know

16 that this particular officer disregards it all the

17 time. You really think that's not going to go in his

18 record?

19 MR. MORAN: I do, Justice Scalia, and I think

20 it's inconsistent with Mapp in which the Court

21 recognized that other remedies have proven completely

22 futile in enforcing the -- the Fourth Amendment.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mapp was a long time ago.

24 It was before 1983 was being used, wasn't it?

25 MR. MORAN: It was before 1983 was --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: You bet you.

2 MR. MORAN: -- being used. But I don't think

3 section 1983 has changed the landscape here. I -- I

4 don't think Mapp is ripe for overruling, and in fact,

5 the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, one of the amici

6 for the other side, concedes that tort remedies cannot,

7 at this time, substitute for the exclusionary rule.

8 If there are no other question, I'll reserve

9 the balance of my time.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Moran.

11 Mr. Baughman, we'll hear now from you.

12 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN

13 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14 MR. BAUGHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15 please the Court:

16 Justice Robert Jackson once said that when he

17 was arguing cases before the Court, he always gave

18 three arguments: the well-structured argument he

19 rehearsed, the disjointed and confused argument he

20 delivered to the Court, and the brilliant argument he

21 thought of in the car on the way home. I have the rare

22 opportunity to deliver the argument I thought of in the

23 car on the way home.

24 (Laughter.)

25 MR. BAUGHMAN: But I'm going to refrain,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 mindful of the fact that this is our -- our second time

2 through and try to hone in on -- on what I think are

3 some critical points.

4 A search warrant, a judicial command, must be

5 obtained from a neutral and detached magistrate. It

6 must particularly describe the place to be searched and

7 the things to be seized, and it must be issued based on

8 probable cause drawn from information which is sworn to

9 are affirmed -- or affirmed. If these requirements are

10 met, the privacy of the described premises will be

11 invaded, and any privilege the occupants might have to

12 withhold evidence or contraband from the police is

13 abrogated.

14 But that command must be executed in a

15 reasonable fashion. And so the police may not bring

16 third parties into the premises who are unnecessary to

17 the execution of the warrant. They may not search in

18 places where the items described may not be found.

19 They may not cause unnecessary damage to property, and

20 they may not use force to accomplish the entry unless

21 consent to enter is denied either explicitly or

22 implicitly or unless entering immediately is reasonable

23 under the circumstances to avoid the destruction of the

24 evidence or harm to the officers.

25 If no valid warrant exists in the first

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 place, then -- and no exception exists, then the

2 privacy of the dwelling has been unlawfully invaded.

3 It never should have happened. But if a valid warrant

4 exists and some error occurs in its execution, it is

5 not the invasion of privacy which should not have

6 occurred that is commanded by the warrant.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you -- you concede that

8 there was error in execution here? You concede that

9 there was a violation because -- technically because

10 there was no knock?

11 MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you concede that?

13 You've got a case in which, as I understand it, not

14 only was the evidence but the warrant itself an

15 indication not only that drugs were present, but that

16 guns were present. It's perfectly true we don't have a

17 general rule that anytime you do a drug search, you can

18 do a no-knock, but in this case you had specific

19 evidence that there were firearms there. And based on

20 what I've seen in the case, I don't know why Michigan

21 did not argue that, in fact, it was justified to go in

22 without knocking.

23 And I'll be candid to say you -- to tell you

24 that the fact that Michigan does not make that argument

25 suggests to me that Michigan is trying to structure a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 case in which it's going to have the best shot to -- to

2 get the exclusionary rule out of the way here. Why

3 don't you claim that the search was lawful?

4 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, let me first say this

5 case was not structured to try -- to try to -- to get

6 it here on our -- on our part. I think initially the

7 prosecutor handling the hearing here reached the

8 conclusion that Richards precluded an argument that a

9 no -- that the failure to knock and announce was

10 justified here. But --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Richards precluded a

12 general rule, but it didn't preclude you from arguing

13 in a specific case, and it's the fact that the

14 prosecutor and, hence, all the way up the line to you

15 do not argue that is -- is what I don't understand.

16 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, again, I -- I think it

17 would be an interesting argument to revisit Richards on

18 this proposition.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't think we have to

20 revisit Richards. I -- I think what -- what I'm --

21 what I'm concerned is that you don't make an argument

22 based on the evidence in this case that you had

23 probable cause to believe that there were going to be

24 guns facing you when -- when you went in the door and

25 therefore the knock was not required.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BAUGHMAN: Again, I think the -- the

2 belief of the prosecutors, as the case went forward,

3 was that because that belief, the -- you're correct.

4 Guns were described as things to be seized in the

5 warrant. The probable cause for that was not any

6 specific knowledge about a gun in the house. It was

7 the officer's general experience that when I execute

8 search warrants for drugs, guns tend to be there.

9 Richards seems to say, at least it certainly could be

10 argued, that's not sufficient. You can't make that

11 decision based on experience that drugs and guns go

12 together.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you suggesting --

14 did -- did the warrant -- I don't know this. I should

15 but I don't. Did the warrant authorize seizure of guns

16 as well as --

17 MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, it did.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- drugs? Well, are you

19 suggesting that the -- the gun portion of the

20 authorization was, in fact, invalid?

21 MR. BAUGHMAN: No. I -- I don't because I

22 believe probable cause can be based on the experience

23 of officers --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

25 MR. BAUGHMAN: -- without specific knowledge

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of the --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- so -- in any case, at

3 -- at the moment that you got the warrant, you -- you

4 had, in fact, a -- a finding by a trial court, or a --

5 whoever the issuing magistrate was, that there was

6 probable cause to believe that you were going to

7 confront guns as well as drugs inside. And -- and

8 Richards does not seem to me to be a good reason, under

9 those circumstances, to concede that you didn't have a

10 basis for -- for dispensing with the knock.

11 MR. BAUGHMAN: It may not have been a good

12 reason, but it was the reason in that the prosecutors

13 believed that the rejection of the drugs and guns

14 always go together as a justifying -- not knocking

15 and announcing in Richards meant that the determination

16 in this case that guns were on the premises based on

17 the officer's experience that drugs and guns go

18 together, not any specific knowledge about a gun was

19 inadequate then to forgive knocking and announcing.

20 That may have been a misjudgment, but it was a belief

21 that Richards foreclosed that. It was not an attempt

22 to set the case up. We had the Stevens case in

23 Michigan.

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, do you think

25 just as an empirical matter that in most cases where

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there's known to be guns plus drugs, the police will

2 enter without knocking?

3 MR. BAUGHMAN: No. I -- I don't believe

4 that's the case. I think if there's specific knowledge

5 that there are guns on the premises, yes, absolutely.

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's -- there's specific

7 knowledge.

8 MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes. If they knew -- I think

9 then they would enter without knocking. If -- if the

10 --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: There was specific knowledge

12 here.

13 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, no, it's knowledge based

14 on experience.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you got a -- you got a

16 warrant --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's in the warrant.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that said look for them.

19 That's about as specific as you can get.

20 MR. BAUGHMAN: I understand but the facts in

21 the affidavit justifying looking for guns was in my

22 experience drugs and guns go together.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you can't have it both

24 ways.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, nevertheless, was not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there a finding that there was probable cause that

2 there was a gun there?

3 MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes.

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: All right.

5 MR. BAUGHMAN: I would be happy to -- to, in

6 a different case, make the argument that although

7 Richards says a court cannot say that knock and

8 announce is forgiven every time a drug warrant is

9 executed on the theory that experience teaches that

10 drugs and guns go together. I'd be happy to argue that

11 that holding does not apply when a judge determines, in

12 issuing the warrant, that drugs and guns go together,

13 so I'm putting it in the warrant. I'd be happy to

14 argue that case.

15 At this time --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't argue it to me. It

17 doesn't make much sense.

18 (Laughter.)

19 MR. BAUGHMAN: Prosecutors believed that

20 Richards couldn't be avoided by putting the drugs and

21 guns go together into the warrant instead of --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this?

23 MR. BAUGHMAN: -- the judge --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question

25 about the practice in Michigan? Since People against

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Stevens and People against Vasquez have been decided,

2 are there any cases, other than this one, in which a

3 prosecutor has raised the knock and announce argument

4 that got litigated all the way to the appellate court?

5 MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, there have been a handful

6 of cases where defense attorneys have filed a motion,

7 despite People v. Stevens, and then they -- they have

8 lost because of Stevens.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: So but there really is no

10 incentive for the prosecutor to fight -- argue about

11 this anymore in Michigan, is there?

12 MR. BAUGHMAN: No. Not, in the criminal

13 case, the prosecutor is responsible -- be, as it was in

14 this case, although the judge refused to follow Stevens

15 --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it concedes there's a

17 violation.

18 MR. BAUGHMAN: -- there should be no hearing.

19 They're not conceding the violation. They're simply

20 saying the -- a violation is irrelevant to the question

21 of the admission of the evidence, so we should not

22 litigate it.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: So there's no point in

24 litigating it.

25 MR. BAUGHMAN: Exactly.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it's a functional

2 equivalent of conceding a violation in every case

3 because there's simply no effective remedy.

4 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: No effective remedy in the

6 litigation itself.

7 MR. BAUGHMAN: In the criminal --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, there's always

9 the possibility that the officer will be disciplined by

10 his very zealous superior, I guess.

11 MR. BAUGHMAN: Or -- or civil litigation.

12 There is no -- there is no exclusion. Yes, that's

13 correct.

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- do you dispute --

15 your -- your brother on the other side said in his

16 argument that he had not heard a dispute about this.

17 But do you dispute his claim that there has never been

18 any -- at least in recent history, any -- any civil

19 judgment actually rendered against anyone in the

20 officer's position?

21 MR. BAUGHMAN: I -- I am not aware of one

22 from Michigan. I am aware that there have been civil

23 judgments against officers from other jurisdictions.

24 I'm not aware of one in Michigan. I know there have --

25 there are some suits that have been brought in the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Eastern District that are pending. And -- and part of

2 the difficulty is civil suits can be brought. They can

3 be settled. There can even be trials and damages

4 awarded, and they won't be in the reports. They're not

5 in the F.Supp.'s. They're not in the --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: But we don't -- we don't

7 have any indication that there's an effective

8 deterrence then in civil suits. Maybe there will be

9 some day, but we haven't seen it yet in Michigan, I

10 take it.

11 MR. BAUGHMAN: I think one could also make

12 the argument that that cuts the other way. The fact

13 that there are not a lot of reported decisions may mean

14 there's not a lot of violations going on, that the

15 police are not routinely kicking down doors without

16 knocking and announcing when they should, and that's

17 why they're not being sued.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: And it may mean that -- that

19 potential plaintiffs say if the courts are winking at

20 this in the criminal case, we don't have much chance of

21 getting a -- a verdict in a civil case.

22 MR. BAUGHMAN: No. It's not --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: We don't know, but that

24 might be the case too, mightn't it?

25 MR. BAUGHMAN: It might be, but it's not been

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 my experience that either -- either the criminals or

2 certainly innocent parties, people -- probable cause,

3 after all, doesn't mean certainty. People who have had

4 damage done or physical injury occur have been -- are

5 shy about suing the government in those circumstances.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any evidence that

7 the citizens -- that Michiganders are less litigious

8 than people in other States?

9 MR. BAUGHMAN: That certainly hasn't been my

10 experience and certainly not in my county.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the mere existence

12 of suits in other States ought to suffice as something

13 --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's -- that's a

16 deterrent. Shouldn't it?

17 MR. BAUGHMAN: I would -- I would think so.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I still don't understand

19 where -- where we are with guns. You -- you have a

20 specific finding in a warrant that says there's

21 probable cause there's going to be a gun, and there's

22 drugs. I take it your position is that this allows you

23 to enter without knocking.

24 MR. BAUGHMAN: It would be my position. I

25 would have thought, as the prosecutor thought here,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that a probable cause finding that guns are in the

2 house, based not on any specific knowledge about guns,

3 but based on experience in similar circumstances, was

4 not sufficient to satisfy Richards in terms of not

5 knocking. I would certainly make the argument that it

6 ought to be, but I would have not criticized the

7 prosecutor, who didn't make that argument.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: But why would you bother

9 making the argument? The evidence can't be suppressed.

10 I don't understand why -- why would there ever be any

11 litigation over this issue in a criminal case?

12 MR. BAUGHMAN: And -- and I think Your Honor

13 is correct. The prosecutor's point in this case was we

14 shouldn't litigate --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: And can you cite me any

16 other example of a -- a violation of the Fourth

17 Amendment? Maybe we shouldn't have held it's a

18 violation. I understand that argument. Is there any

19 other area of Fourth Amendment law in which the

20 violation of the Fourth Amendment is not followed by a

21 suppression ruling?

22 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, certainly. Let me give

23 an example. One of the circumstances that I indicated

24 that the police -- a manner in which the police must

25 behave when reasonably executing a warrant is not to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 look in places where the items sought cannot be found.

2 If the police were searching a house for stolen

3 computer monitors, a large object, and as they were

4 searching for them, they opened the desk drawer where

5 the monitor could not be and they shut it, and they

6 found computer monitors in the home, the -- this Court

7 has never addressed the question, that I'm aware of,

8 but the law is uniform in the country that you would

9 not suppress the computer monitors.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, now you're talking

11 about other cases in other courts. I looked through

12 with my law clerks 300 cases since Weeks, not Mapp,

13 Weeks. That's what we're talking about, 1914. I

14 couldn't find in 300 cases one single Supreme Court

15 case that did not suppress evidence where there was a

16 Fourth Amendment violation with one exception. The

17 exception is there are sets of cases where deterrence

18 is really not a factor. For example, good faith; for

19 example, it isn't going into a criminal proceeding.

20 Okay?

21 Now, what I'd like you to do is to tell me if

22 I missed some, which is certainly possible, or second,

23 if you want us to change the rule and go back 300 years

24 or 300 cases back before 1914, or are you going to tell

25 us that deterrence doesn't play a role here or whatever

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you want? I want to put to you the state of the art as

2 far as I can see it.

3 MR. BAUGHMAN: It would be my position that

4 in all of those cases, there was a causal connection

5 between the evidence found in the --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there's a causal

7 connection absolutely here. It is a but-for

8 connection.

9 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: This person being in the

11 room and a child of 2 would know that if you get into a

12 room, as a result of your being in that room, you're

13 likely to find evidence. So it's both but for and it

14 fits within the problem. There we are.

15 That's the same, by the way, as it is with

16 making a false oath to a magistrate. You make a false

17 oath to a magistrate. That permits the magistrate to

18 get into the house with -- the policeman gets in there

19 with a warrant. It doesn't take the court long to

20 suppress that. About a second. And -- and how -- how

21 is this somehow different?

22 MR. BAUGHMAN: Let me try to give a couple of

23 examples from different situations to make my point

24 that there is a difference.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, give some cases first.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 He's talking about actual cases.

2 MR. BAUGHMAN: I --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, isn't it possible

4 that if his law clerk overlooked Segura, he overlooked

5 other cases as well.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: No. We read Segura. We

7 read Segura, which happens to be a case --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: There was unquestionably,

9 was there not, a violation of the Fourth Amendment in

10 Segura?

11 MR. BAUGHMAN: Your Honor is correct, and I

12 am confident that when the officers returned with the

13 search warrant, with the officers already inside, they

14 did not knock and announce when they when they returned

15 with the search warrant.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: He is not -- well --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that an example

18 where there's a violation of the Fourth Amendment that

19 is brought up and yet suppression is not the --

20 MR. BAUGHMAN: Because of the habeas concerns

21 of comity that this Court has, that's correct. It is

22 also not suppressed.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- important exception. The

24 exception which comes from Silverthorne is when there

25 is an independent chain of events such that it will be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- not could be, but would be -- in fact, discovered

2 anyway, despite the unlawfulness -- Silverthorne --

3 Holmes says, of course, you don't keep it out then

4 because that's not going to impact deterrence. Now,

5 that's Segura. That's Silverthorne. That's case after

6 case. Of course, I accept that. And if you can show

7 that this case somehow fits within that chain, fine.

8 Then I -- then I maybe appear I have my mind made up on

9 this, but I'm open to change.

10 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, let -- let me try a

11 couple of examples that --

12 (Laughter.)

13 MR. BAUGHMAN: -- that I -- that I hope might

14 make the point. It is -- and my -- my belief is --

15 it's common in human experience that things can be

16 accomplished either by command or by permission when

17 the manner of doing so, the manner in which they end up

18 being accomplished is subject to criticism. And let me

19 give a couple quick examples.

20 If, when she was young, I sent my daughter to

21 her room -- and that was rare, but if I sent her to her

22 room and she stomped up the stairs and slammed the

23 door, she would be in further difficulty not because

24 she carried out my command by going to her room, but

25 because she stomped up the stairs.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 If a young athlete is told by his coach,

2 catch the ball with two hands and he catches it with

3 one, he is admonished not because he caught the ball

4 but because he caught it with one hand.

5 And if a football player taunts the opposing

6 team as he crosses the goal line, he gets a penalty not

7 because he crossed the goal line, but because he

8 taunted the other team.

9 These strictures are not prerequisites to the

10 conduct. I do not tell my daughter go to your room but

11 only if you don't stomp up the stairs --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. That's -- I -- I

13 understand that point from your brief and I'm glad that

14 you brought it up. But I have never -- I have never

15 seen Fourth Amendment matters cut that finely. I have

16 never seen the courts say I want to go back to the

17 reason why this policeman is unlawfully in the room and

18 then try to connect each piece of evidence with that

19 reason. Rather, they ask is he unreasonably and

20 unconstitutionally in the room.

21 So my concern about that, which I'd like you

22 to address, is if we took that approach, I think we'd

23 be doing it for the first time, and we'd let a kind of

24 computer virus loose in the Fourth Amendment. I don't

25 know what the implications of that are. I can't tell

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you what you're saying is illogical. It's not

2 illogical. It's conceivable, but it strikes me as

3 risky and unprecedented.

4 MR. BAUGHMAN: I think as -- as -- in the

5 examples I gave, knock and announce works the same way.

6 These are not prerequisites. They're rules of

7 conduct. They are principles of behavior. It's not do

8 this only if you behave in this manner. It's do this

9 and behave in this manner while doing it. And if you

10 don't behave in the manner we have prescribed, the

11 question is what flows from that misbehavior, not from

12 the achievement of the end.

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that your

14 example it's -- stomping up the stairs is like failing

15 to knock and announce.

16 MR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct, and -- and the

17 police are not illegally on the premises and my

18 daughter --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: And so there should be a

20 deterrent for the stomping up the stairs, and you've

21 got no deterrent for the knock and announce.

22 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, and part of what -- part

23 of what I wanted to say also to Justice Breyer and I

24 think also works here is it's -- the suggestion seems

25 to be that knock -- that a Fourth Amendment violation

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- the question of whether one has occurred and the

2 question of whether or not the -- to apply the

3 exclusionary rule are one in the same. And this Court

4 has never said that. To me that would be a dramatic

5 changing of the law of this Court. This Court has

6 always said those are separate questions, and I think

7 Petitioner's argument conflates the two.

8 We first ask whether there has been a

9 constitutional violation and then we say -- this Court

10 has said the premise for application of the

11 exclusionary sanction is whether or not the challenged

12 evidence is the product of the illegal government

13 activity. So once we establish that there has been a

14 constitutional error, the question becomes is the

15 challenged evidence the product of it. And just like

16 the touchdown is not the product of the taunting, the

17 entry into the premises is not the product of the

18 failure to knock and announce. It's the product of a

19 warrant, which the judge issued commanding the police

20 to enter.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't the problem

22 that in -- in fact, it's the product of both? The

23 warrant alone does not get the police officer into --

24 into the building. It -- it is in fact the entry that

25 gets the police officer into the building, the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 execution of the warrant. The judge has to do

2 something. The police officer has to do something.

3 And the question that I think we face when we

4 say is the later search the product of the entry, is --

5 is what your -- what -- I think a point that -- that

6 counsel on the other side was making. It's a pragmatic

7 point. Where do we draw the line of causation? And

8 his answer is -- and I think the -- the answer of the

9 cases that Justice Breyer was -- was referring to -- is

10 this. We draw it in a way that will allow us to deter

11 illegal police conduct, and if we engage in this

12 slicing process of causation that you talk about, there

13 will be no deterrent for the violation of the no-knock

14 rule. If instead we say, yes, this is enough the

15 product that we ought to deter -- that we ought to --

16 to respond to it in a way that will deter the no-knock

17 and therefore we find causation and we get deterrence.

18 What is fallacious about that argument?

19 MR. BAUGHMAN: There's nothing fallacious

20 about the argument if one accepts that excluding the

21 truth in -- in a criminal proceeding is a fair tradeoff

22 in that circumstance --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: We do that every single time

24 we exclude a piece of evidence in every suppression

25 case, don't we?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BAUGHMAN: But -- but the Court has --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Don't -- don't we?

3 MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, we do. But the Court has

4 said that because that's a dramatic thing to do,

5 because it -- it has a high societal cost, it should

6 only be done when there is a causal connection, when

7 the evidence is the product of the police wrongdoing.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

9 Baughman.

10 MR. BAUGHMAN: I thank the Court.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Salmons.

12 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

13 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

14 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

15 MR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

16 and may it please the Court:

17 Suppression would not be an appropriate

18 remedy in this context for two primary reasons. The

19 first is if the knock and announce rule does not

20 protect the individual's privacy interest in the

21 underlying items seized and, instead, it seeks to limit

22 discrete risks related to the execution of warrants

23 that property will be damaged, that officers will be

24 mistaken for intruders, or that occupants will be

25 caught in embarrassing situations. That makes the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 knock and announce rule similar to other Fourth

2 Amendment requirements related to the manner of

3 executing warrants such as --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what -- what do you

5 say to Justice Breyer's argument that we haven't

6 previously analyzed suppression by tracing or trying to

7 trace the causal connection between a particular piece

8 of evidence and a particular reason for the rule that

9 was broken? What we have said in the past is if the

10 rule or the standard is violated and the search is

11 therefore unreasonable, the evidence doesn't come in.

12 You're proposing a -- a different causal

13 analysis. You're proposing a causal analysis that

14 requires the connection between a piece of evidence and

15 the particular reason for one of these standards in

16 every case in which suppression is -- is requested.

17 Number one, do you agree that that -- that

18 would be a departure, as Justice Breyer suggested? And

19 number two, what would be the justification for that?

20 MR. SALMONS: It would not be a departure,

21 Your Honor. In fact, that's common practice in the

22 Fourth Amendment area. This Court, for example, in New

23 York v. Harris looked to the purposes of the rule

24 against arrest in the home absent a warrant and to

25 conclude that it wasn't appropriate to suppress a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statement made at the station even though it assumed

2 that there was but-for causation. And this Court in

3 Cruz did a similar analysis. It's very common to look

4 to the purposes served --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: It's common, when you have a

6 chain of causal connection, to say it ends somewhere.

7 It's common, and in Harris, it ended once they left the

8 home and now they're over in the station.

9 MR. SALMONS: But --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: This isn't over in the

11 station. This is in the home. You speak of interests,

12 but this doesn't interests.

13 What about Boyd? I mean, the most famous

14 statement in Fourth Amendment history to all invasions

15 on the part of the government and its employees of the

16 sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life. It

17 is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of

18 his drawers that constitutes the essence of the

19 offense. But it is the invasion of his indivisible

20 right of personal security, personal liberty, and

21 private property.

22 Now, I thought -- 1886 -- that's what's

23 governed these cases for about 100 -- and far more, a

24 century and a half or a quarter. And -- and the --

25 then suddenly you say, well, it's this interest in the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 one or the other one. I mean, doesn't that describe

2 it?

3 MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. I mean,

4 certainly that's -- that is one of the principles

5 underlying the Fourth Amendment, but this Court has

6 looked to the types of considerations I'm discussing,

7 and I will give you some examples. And we think, in

8 fact, the knock and announce rule is very analogous to

9 -- for example, to a claim of unnecessary property

10 damage or to a claim that the officers brought the

11 media along when they shouldn't or that they used

12 excessive force.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no doubt in

14 here that an invasion of the home was authorized by the

15 warrant. Right?

16 MR. SALMONS: That's correct.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The interest we're

18 talking about is not the sanctity of the drawers. It

19 is 10 seconds that the officers should have waited

20 additionally, according to the -- to your brother.

21 MR. SALMONS: That's correct. The illegality

22 --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct? I'm sorry. That

24 is correct? I -- I thought that this warrant does not

25 say you can enter the house without knocking.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I mean, I have a warrant. This warrant lets

2 me search the house in daytime. I search it in

3 nighttime. Is my search authorized?

4 MR. SALMONS: I don't think that would be a

5 warrantless search or I don't think that would be a

6 violation. That might be --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: I have a warrant --

8 MR. SALMONS: -- of the manner of execution.

9 But again, if I may --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what happens with my

11 example? I'm curious. That's not a rhetorical

12 question.

13 I have a warrant which says, search 1618 5th

14 Street. I search 1518 5th Street. Was it a warrant --

15 a warrant back search?

16 MR. SALMONS: Well --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't have a warrant to

18 search 1518. I don't have a warrant that allows me to

19 come in in the middle of the night when it says day,

20 and I don't have a warrant here that allows me to come

21 in without knocking. So where's the warrant?

22 MR. SALMONS: I think the question in that

23 case, Your Honor, would be about reasonable reliance on

24 the warrant and whether it was a reasonable mistake.

25 And if it wasn't, then it would be a warrantless

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

58

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 search.

2 And if I may just focus the Court --

3 attention on the claim of unnecessary property damage.

4 We think that's quite analogous here in part because

5 the typical -- in the typical case, a premature or

6 unannounced entry will be a forcible entry. But

7 whether the claim is that the officers entered a few

8 moments prematurely or that they unnecessarily used a

9 battering ram on the door, in either case the -- the

10 violation doesn't relate to the privacy interests and

11 the items to be seized and shouldn't result in

12 suppression. And in addition to that --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it does relate to the

14 privacy interests, and we've seen the explanation. One

15 of the reasons for requiring the knock is that there is

16 enough respect for a person's home, a person's privacy

17 to say the police should not barge in like an invading

18 army.

19 MR. SALMONS: Well, that certainly is --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: That is a respect for

21 privacy.

22 MR. SALMONS: That -- that certainly is true,

23 Your Honor, but that -- that is not a protection --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that is involved -- and

25 that is -- that is the whole point of -- of knock and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

59

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 announce, isn't it?

2 MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. The point of

3 knock and announce is a more limited privacy. It's not

4 related to the privacy of the items to be seized.

5 That's separate. And that's why it makes it like the

6 claim of unnecessary --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: We're talking about the

8 privacy of individual in his home, and the

9 reasonableness of the search depends upon the

10 reasonableness of invading the individual's privacy in

11 his home. Is that not the general rule?

12 MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. I think what

13 -- what focuses in terms of suppression is whether the

14 government has obtained an evidentiary advantage as a

15 consequence of the illegality. Here, the illegality

16 was the failure to delay a few additional moments

17 before entry.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then there will never be a

19 suppression of -- of evidence specified in a warrant

20 when the warrant's no-knock component is violated --

21 MR. SALMONS: But --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- because we -- we will say

23 -- in every single time, following your argument, you

24 will -- we will say the -- the violation had nothing to

25 do with the authorization to seize the evidence. The

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

60

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 violation simply had to do with the -- with the -- the

2 niceties and the risks involved in entering. So if we

3 accept your argument, no-knock is -- is a dead duck,

4 isn't it?

5 MR. SALMONS: I don't think so, Your Honor.

6 If I may try to explain. I think as a general matter,

7 with regard to physical evidence in the home that's

8 within the scope of the search warrant, that you're --

9 you're probably right. Most of the time, that evidence

10 will come in.

11 We think that there are probably at least two

12 areas that might lead to suppression in these cases.

13 One is the -- the type of statements that the Chief

14 Justice mentioned earlier. Another might be what you

15 might call proximity evidence, that the officers went

16 in prematurely and as a result, they saw a --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salmons, may I ask you

18 this -- this question? If you'd been the prosecutor in

19 this case and you had -- knew that the evidence would

20 be suppressed if there were a constitutional violation,

21 would you have conceded that there was a constitutional

22 violation in this case?

23 MR. SALMONS: Well, I don't think -- I think

24 there is a reasonable argument that could be --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes or no.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

61

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SALMONS: I'm -- I'm attempting to answer

2 that, Your Honor. I think there's a reasonable

3 argument that could be made in this case that there

4 wasn't a violation. I think it was probably a smart

5 strategy.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you would not have

7 conceded.

8 MR. SALMONS: I can't -- I can't second-guess

9 the strategy here to concede it.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you would not have

11 conceded. If you -- if you thought there was a

12 reasonable argument, you would not have conceded that

13 there was a violation, would you?

14 MR. SALMONS: I think I probably would have

15 argued in the alternative, Your Honor. I think that's

16 probably the safest --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what --

18 what happens if there's a violation of the daytime

19 warrant provision in -- in a search warrant and the

20 search is at night? Do we suppress?

21 MR. SALMONS: I think generally no, Your

22 Honor. I think -- and I would -- I would --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases -- are

24 there cases on that?

25 MR. SALMONS: I -- not in this Court. There

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

62

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- there may be in the court of appeals. I think the

2 way that the Court would analyze that would be, again,

3 along the same lines.

4 Now, certainly in jurisdictions that haven't

5 adopted the rule that we're articulating here, the

6 courts may suppress. But we think under the principles

7 we're articulating, that suppression probably would not

8 be appropriate there.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but apparently you're

10 saying we would not suppress because as long as the

11 warrant specified the items to be seized and they

12 didn't go beyond that, there was no causal connection

13 between the fact that they broke in and disturbed

14 people in the night, when they were not authorized to,

15 and their ultimate obtaining of -- of the evidence.

16 Once again, it seems to me if we follow your -- your

17 reasoning, then the distinction between the nighttime

18 and the daytime warrant is a dead letter.

19 MR. SALMONS: Well, you know, we respectfully

20 disagree with that. We think that there are two

21 separate questions, what the Constitution requires and

22 whether suppression is an appropriate remedy.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: The Constitution requires --

24 MR. SALMONS: The Court has always treated

25 those --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

63

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: The Constitution requires a

2 reasonable search. It is hornbook law that violating

3 no-knock, violating nighttime searches when only a

4 daytime search is authorized amounts to an unreasonable

5 search. You're saying that's utterly irrelevant

6 because there's no causal connection between that

7 violation and the seizure of the particular items that

8 the warrant -- the warrant specified.

9 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, if I may. It's

10 also hornbook law now in this Court that you can't

11 unnecessarily destroy property in executing the warrant

12 or effecting the entry and that you can't bring the

13 media along. This Court in both Ramirez and --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd to get your -- I'd like

15 to get your position. I -- I think Justice Souter is

16 correct, that under the theory you're arguing to us

17 here, the violation of the daytime warrant rule is not

18 grounds for suppressing evidence. So we can have

19 nighttime searches with no suppression remedy.

20 MR. SALMONS: Well, I -- I think that's

21 probably the position that we would take. I think the

22 way the Court would analyze that, as it has done in

23 these other cases, it would look to two factors. One,

24 what are the purposes served by the Fourth Amendment

25 rule that's violated and how well those purposes fit

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

64

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 with the remedy of suppression; and two, whether the

2 government obtained any evidentiary advantage as a

3 result of the violation.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

5 Salmons.

6 Mr. Moran, you have 3 minutes remaining.

7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN

8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9 MR. MORAN: Thank you --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think there --

11 you think there was a violation of the knock and

12 announce rule in this case. Correct?

13 MR. MORAN: I do, Your Honor. The warrant

14 was never actually made part of the record, but my

15 understanding, from the record we have, was that only

16 drugs -- there was only knowledge of drugs. The -- the

17 warrant authorized a search for guns because Officer

18 Good told the magistrate that in his experience guns

19 were often associated with drugs. But they had no

20 particularized information about any guns on the

21 premises. They only had particularized information

22 about drugs on the premises.

23 The issue here about causation goes back, I

24 think, to the common law. And as Justice Breyer

25 articulated, when an officer is illegally in the home,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

65

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that causes his seizure of goods or his arrest of

2 people in the home to be illegal. If I can go all the

3 way back to 1831, Chief Justice Shaw of the

4 Massachusetts Supreme Court said, the rule is well

5 established -- this is 1831 it was well established --

6 that where an authority given by law is exceeded, the

7 party loses the benefit of his justification and the

8 law holds him a trespasser ab initio although, to a

9 certain extent, he followed the authority given. The

10 law will operate to defeat all acts thus done under

11 color of lawful authority when exceeded and a fortiori

12 will it operate to prospectively to prevent the

13 acquisition of any lawful right by the excess and abuse

14 of an authority given for useful and beneficial

15 purposes.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you draw a

17 distinction between two cases? If they illegally

18 entered and they suddenly said we waited 4 seconds, it

19 was supposed to be 15. They say, never mind. They go

20 back out. There's another knock. They wait 15 and

21 they come in. Then it's all right. Correct?

22 MR. MORAN: It might be.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. But you're

24 saying it's a world of difference if, when they go in

25 and enter and they say, we should have waited 10 more

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

66

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 seconds, we're the police, we're here to execute a

2 search warrant, let's count to 10, then all of a

3 sudden, it's invalid from there on. Those are the --

4 they're two different cases in your mind?

5 MR. MORAN: I think that's -- that's right

6 because an -- a reasonable search and seizure, as this

7 Court held in Wilson, requires a lawful entry. Eight

8 Justices agreed that an -- a lawful entry is the

9 indispensable predicate of a reasonable search in Ker

10 v. California. These are not disconnected. It is not

11 in.

12 The -- the prosecution's claim here, the

13 Respondent's claim, would eliminate all manner of entry

14 arguments from the exclusionary rule. Nighttime

15 search, use of excessive force, blowing up the building

16 to get in, knocking a wall off the building wouldn't

17 matter. They were in -- they're in, they have a

18 warrant, everything is fine once they're in. It simply

19 wouldn't matter for exclusionary purposes.

20 In Harris, I want to stress again in Harris

21 that this Court never questioned the fact that the

22 evidence found inside the home had to be suppressed,

23 and that's all we're asking for here. The evidence in

24 the home.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
