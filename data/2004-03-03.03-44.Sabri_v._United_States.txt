3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument


4 now in No. 03-44, Basim Omar Sabri v. the United States. 


5 Mr. Birrell.


6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. BIRRELL


7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


8 MR. BIRRELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


9 please the Court:


10

Section 666(a)(2) of title 18

is


11 unconstitutional on its face because it never requires the


12 jury to find an element that the Constitution always


13 requires. The statute's unambiguous language allows a


14 violation to be proved with entirely local conduct


15 unrelated to Federal spending. It thus intrudes deeply


16 into an area the Court has recognized as one in which the


17 States possess primary authority. 


18 QUESTION: Yet there's no doubt, Mr. Birrell, is


19 there, that in some circumstances the statute could be


20 constitutionally applied?


21 MR. BIRRELL: There are no circumstances where


22 66(a)(2) -- 666(a)(2) could be constitutionally applied,


23 Your Honor, because the -- because the statute never


24 requires that the jury find a connection between the


25 Federal spending and the offense conduct. In the same way


3 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 that there were possibly circumstances in Lopez where
 2 there might have been an adequate Federal connection, but
 3 because the jury is not required to find it, there are not
 4 any circumstances where the statute could be
 5 constitutional. 
 6 QUESTION: Why -- why can't it be constitutional
 7 under the Commerce Clause? I know the Government doesn't
 8 rely on that, but respondent can be supported here on any
 9 -- any ground. Why -- why isn't this a commercial
 10 transaction as -- as, you know, our -- our Commerce Clause
 11 law is? So long as the transaction is commercial, we will
 12 assume it's interstate commerce. We will accept Congress'
 13 judgment on that.
 14 Why isn't it a commercial transaction when you
 15 bribe somebody? Money for -- for whatever the favor he
 16 does.
 17 MR. BIRRELL: A couple things, Your Honor.
 18 First of all, there is not a requirement that interstate
 19 commerce nexus be proved in the statute.
 20 QUESTION: That's not necessary. So long as
 21 it's commercial, our cases -- our recent cases, say so
 22 long as it's commercial, we'll accept Congress' judgment
 23 that it's interstate.
 24 MR. BIRRELL: Well, if Congress could create
 25 commerce -- Commerce Clause jurisdiction everywhere that

4 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 it could spend money, then -
 2 QUESTION: No, no, not everywhere it could spend
 3 money. Everywhere there is a commercial transaction. One
 4 of our cases, for example, held that loan-sharking could
 5 be covered under the Commerce Clause because it was a
 6 commercial transaction, just as illegal as -- as the -
 7 the bribery here, but if that could be covered by the
 8 Commerce Clause, why can't this?
 9 MR. BIRRELL: Because without -- without a
 10 showing that in each case there was a connection between
 11 interstate commerce and the transaction -
 12 QUESTION: That's not what our cases require. 13 QUESTION: Is that true of the drug statutes 14 too? 15 MR. BIRRELL: I'm sorry, Your Honor? 
 16 QUESTION: I mean, is it true whenever the Feds
 17 prosecute a person for a drug transaction, a jury has to
 18 determine there was a connection between these drugs and
 19 interstate commerce? 
 20 I've never heard of that requirement that -
 21 that the -- that the jury would have to determine whatever
 22 facts are necessary for the statute to be constitutional
 23 even -- even though that's not an element of the offense.
 24 Does that come out of a case or someplace? Where does it
 25 come from?

5 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 MR. BIRRELL: Well, unless -- unless there was
 2 an understanding that in every instance there was an 3 effect on interstate commerce, then - 4 QUESTION: I mean, there might be instances 5 where there's no effect on interstate commerce, a home -
 6 you know, that -- that will be an issue, homegrown
 7 marijuana. So suppose there is some drug somewhere that
 8 has no effect. Suppose it didn't. There could be such a
 9 thing. We can imagine it. But does that mean in all
 10 these other cases that Congress -- that the statute is
 11 void because the jury hasn't found -- I'd be repeating
 12 myself. You answer.
 13 MR. BIRRELL: I -- I think that it is different
 14 because the Commerce Clause is -- is a regulatory power
 15 that permits Congress to regulate. The Spending Clause
 16 power is -- is a different sort of power. It does not
 17 make that -
 18 QUESTION: And you say here Congress does not
 19 rely on the Spending Clause because it -- it makes conduct
 20 criminal against an individual. 
 21 MR. BIRRELL: I believe that Congress passed
 22 this law under the Spending Clause power. I believe
 23 that's what they intended to do. All the -
 24 QUESTION: To spend for the general welfare was
 25 the basis in the court below and that combined with

6 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 Necessary and Proper.
 2 MR. BIRRELL: That's right, Your Honor. 
 3 QUESTION: And that's the position that was
 4 taken below, and I think most of the courts of appeals
 5 went on that same ground.
 6 MR. BIRRELL: It's my understanding that every
 7 court that has looked at this has said that Congress
 8 attempted to pass this -- this particular statute under
 9 the Spending Clause. 
 10 QUESTION: Does -- does it matter what they
 11 intended to pass it under? I mean, if they have the power
 12 under another -- under another head, would -- would that
 13 not be enough?
 14 MR. BIRRELL: That is true, Your Honor. They
 15 could -- they could -- the statute could be upheld if
 16 Congress has the power to do it on any basis.
 17 QUESTION: The justification sounds like a
 18 Spending Clause justification, doesn't it, that the -
 19 that they could not by a lesser means safeguard these
 20 Federal funds? They tried narrower statutes and they
 21 didn't work. But what they were trying to do was to
 22 safeguard the integrity of the money that they were giving
 23 to these units by not having corrupt operations. Isn't
 24 that the case?
 25 MR. BIRRELL: That -- that's what they said they

7 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 were trying to do. They were trying to regulate the


2 integrity of -- or -- or police the integrity of


3 organizations, agencies, and local and State governments


4 that receive Federal funds. That's what they said they


5 were trying to do.


6 QUESTION: And why is that not satisfactory?


7 MR. BIRRELL: It's not satisfactory because the


8 statute doesn't require any connection between the


9 spending -- Federal spending and the criminal conduct.


10 QUESTION: Suppose that, just to use an analogy


11 in the private sphere, a major corporation has a choice of


12 two subcontractors and one subcontractor is known for


13 engaging in lots of bribery and kickbacks, et cetera.


14 It's confident that it's got auditors that will be able to


15 protect it in this instance. But don't you think if you


16 were the CEO of the corporation, you'd rather prefer -


17 rather deal with the subcontractor that was always clean?


18 It's just a common sense business judgment, and that's all


19 the Government is doing here.


20 MR. BIRRELL: That's not what the Government is


21 doing here, Your Honor. What the Government is doing here


22 is to criminalize purely local conduct.

They're


23 criminalizing conduct that has no relation to any Federal


24 spending.


25 QUESTION: Well, it has relation because it


8 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 wants to give its funds to those entities that it has
 2 confidence in with respect to all of their operations.
 3 MR. BIRRELL: Well, it can make a choice about
 4 giving money or not without criminalizing conduct.
 5 Congress has a number of ways that it can protect its
 6 Federal money. It can protect it under Commerce Clause,
 7 Property Clause, not giving money, relying on the States
 8 to do -- to do what they need to do, False Claims Act,
 9 conditional spending. There's -
 10 QUESTION: They really say if we find a city
 11 council that takes money and -- from us, the city council
 12 takes the money for us for some of its programs here.
 13 There's a corrupt city councilman. We want to prosecute
 14 that person. Why? Because we want council -- members of
 15 councils to know that we're not going to tolerate
 16 corruption on behalf of the agency that's giving out our
 17 money, whether in the particular instance it involved our
 18 money or not. Now -- now, why isn't that sufficient
 19 connection?
 20 MR. BIRRELL: Because, Your Honor, there is -
 21 it may be that what -- that is what the Government wants
 22 to do, but the question is whether the Government has the
 23 power to do that.
 24 QUESTION: That's true, but why doesn't it?
 25 MR. BIRRELL: It doesn't have the power to do

9 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 that because there's not an element in the statute that


2 requires there be a connection proved between the Federal


3 spending and the wrongful conduct. There may be one, but


4 the jury is not required to find one.


5 QUESTION: Suppose the Federal Government had


6 recast the statute and said no State can get -- what's the


7 limit -- $10,000 or more from the Federal Government


8 unless it agrees to criminalize and impose the same


9 penalty set forth here for any State corruption. Would


10 that be constitutional under the spending power? It's a


11 condition to the grant.


12 MR. BIRRELL: It might be if -


13 QUESTION: It unquestionably would be, wouldn't


14 it? It's take it or leave it. It's -


15 MR. BIRRELL: Assuming it wasn't -


16 QUESTION: -- it's connected to the grant. It


17 has some remote connection to it. That ought to be


18 enough. It just seems very strange to me that the Federal


19 Government would be able to compel the State to impose


20 such criminal penalties, but it cannot itself do so in


21 connection with its spending.


22

MR. BIRRELL:

In -- in Your Honor's


23 hypothetical, it might be coercive, unduly coercive, but


24 other than that, I don't see a problem with your


25 hypothetical. 


10 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 But there's a -- the -- the Court -- this -- the


2 Court has said that Congress can attach conditions to


3 money provided that the four Dole factors are met. But


4 that is not what's occurring here. This Court has never


5 said that Congress can use the Spending Clause power to


6 create a criminal law statute. And the danger with this


7 is -


8 QUESTION: Well, have we ever said it can't?


9 MR. BIRRELL: Well, only inferentially by Dole.


10 So the question is never square with -


11 QUESTION: I think it's kind of hard to read


12 Dole for that proposition.


13 I may have missed your response to an earlier


14 question. You -- you bring a facial challenge. Why


15 should we entertain a facial challenge? What if we


16 treated it as an as-applied challenge? Do you say the


17 Government cannot prove the elements that you think are


18 necessary and thereby obtain a conviction?


19 MR. BIRRELL: I -- I say that we -- we properly


20 bring a facial challenge because the statute has no

21 element requiring a connection between the Federal

22 spending -

23

QUESTION:

I don't -- we don't normally

24 entertain facial challenges to statutes on a ground like


25 that. If it could be applied properly in an individual


11 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 case, why would we entertain the broader challenge? 


2 MR. BIRRELL: This statute cannot be properly


3 applied in any case. It's always unconstitutional because


4 it lacks this connection element. The statute is like -


5

QUESTION:

You say because it lacks the

6 requirement of a jury finding that there was the

7 connection.

8

MR. BIRRELL: Yes.

Well, there are two


9 concepts, both that there's not an element and that the


10 jury doesn't need to find it. This statute is -- is like


11 the statute in Lopez.


12 QUESTION: Well, what if -- what if Congress had


13 found that interstate commerce is involved here and did


14 not provide for an individual jury finding in every case,


15 would your argument be the same?


16 MR. BIRRELL: I don't know, Your Honor, but


17 Congress didn't make that finding.


18 QUESTION: It's a very candid answer. 


19 (Laughter.) 


20 QUESTION: Where -- where does this -- I mean,


21 I've asked you this before, but I'm not sure. Where does


22 this jury finding thing come from?

It's quite


23 interesting.


24 But -- but where -- I mean, suppose that


25 Congress passed a statute under the Patent Clause


12 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 criminalizing certain conduct in respect to patent, and at
 2 the border there might be an -- a question of whether it
 3 does or does not fall within the Patent Clause, that
 4 particular criminal behavior. But I wouldn't jump from
 5 that fact that you'd have a legal argument it's outside
 6 the Patent Clause to the conclusion that therefore a jury
 7 has to find in every patent crime -- a jury has to find
 8 that it is within the clause. I'd have thought that was a
 9 question for the judge, not the jury. So you've been
 10 emphasizing the contrary idea, and where do you get it
 11 from?
 12 MR. BIRRELL: Well, in the -- in the -- in Your
 13 Honor's Patent Clause hypothetical, that is a case where
 14 the Court would -- or the Congress would have a -- an
 15 enumerated regulatory power. This is -- this is a 16 different thing. Now - 17 QUESTION: Well, it has the Commerce Clause 18 power. 
 19 I -- I don't understand your reliance on Lopez.
 20 You just said just -- just as Lopez was bad, whether or
 21 not there -- Lopez was -- was bad because it was not
 22 commerce, which is a judgment that this Court will make,
 23 whether it's commerce or not, but once it is commerce,
 24 you're in a different ball park. Once it is commerce, we
 25 assume it's interstate commerce, and that explains, you

13 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 know, a whole bunch of our cases, such as our loan
 2 sharking cases. So Lopez has nothing to do with this
 3 case. Lopez was not commerce.
 4 Now, you -- you may argue that -- that bribery
 5 is not commerce although loan-sharking is, but I'm not
 6 sure how strong an argument that is.
 7 MR. BIRRELL: This case is like Lopez because
 8 the way I read Lopez -- I mean, I understand your point
 9 about whether the conduct in Lopez was commerce conduct or
 10 not, but the way I'm reading Lopez is that the point is
 11 that when you're on the -- the fringes of the power,
 12 commerce power in that case, that there needs to be a -
 13 an element where the jury would find in each case that 14 there was a connection between the exercised power of 15 Congress and the conduct. 16 So in our case - 17 QUESTION: You think there is such a -- such a
 18 connection with loan-sharking, good, old, local, you know,
 19 break-your-knees loan-sharking. It's not -- not an
 20 interstate thing.
 21 MR. BIRRELL: Well, you've -- you've told me
 22 that -- that the Court has said that there is, and I -- I
 23 accept that.
 24 QUESTION: That's United States v. Perez. We
 25 took a very expansive view of the Commerce Clause. And it

14 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 was pretty much of a local transaction in -- in the case,
 2 but the Court pointed out, you know, the ripple effect
 3 that all commercial transactions have.
 4 MR. BIRRELL: Well, I would return to my point
 5 that I think that if the Congress can create Commerce
 6 Clause jurisdiction by spending money and Congress is
 7 entitled to spend money under the Constitution anywhere it
 8 deems it important for the general welfare, then what
 9 would naturally follow, it seems to me, is the general
 10 police power that the Constitution denies to the Federal
 11 Government. It seems to me to be an inescapable chain of
 12 reasoning that will get us there.
 13 QUESTION: Have any local law enforcement
 14 offices complained about the Federal presence?
 15 MR. BIRRELL: There -- there's nothing in the
 16 record about it, and I don't have anything to offer
 17 outside the record of it. But the -- the question whether
 18 the local governments or government agents consent to an
 19 invasion of their area of authority is -- is not
 20 dispositive.
 21 QUESTION: Question whether they regard it as an
 22 invasion of their authority or rather a legitimate
 23 endeavor by the Federal Government to protect its money.
 24 MR. BIRRELL: Well, the -- the statute doesn't
 25 require the Federal Government to be acting to protect its

15 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 money. There -- there is not any requirement that this
 2 money be the Government's money. For example, a private
 3 citizen offers a -- a bribe to an agent. It could be an
 4 agent of a -- a corporation. The offer is refused and 12
 5 months later and for the first time more than $10,000 is
 6 given to an unrelated part of the agent's business, the
 7 business the agent works for. Then we now have a Federal
 8 crime committed. There's not any requirement in the
 9 statute that there be a connection between the Federal
 10 money and the offense conduct. And furthermore, there's
 11 not any requirement that the jury find it.
 12 QUESTION: Would you like to reserve the balance
 13 of your time, Mr. Birrell?
 14 MR. BIRRELL: I will reserve the balance of my
 15 time, Your Honor. 
 16 QUESTION: Very well. 
 17 We'll hear from you, Mr. Dreeben.
 18 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
 19 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 20 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 21 please the Court:
 22 The court of appeals correctly held that section
 23 666 does not require proof of a Federal connection between
 24 the offense conduct and the federally funded program or
 25 Federal funds beyond that which the text of the statute

16 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 itself requires. 2 QUESTION: What -- what is the basis, Mr. 3 Dreeben? Under what authority did Congress pass the 4 statute? 5 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, the Government
 6 has relied on Congress' Necessary and Proper Clause
 7 authority to protect its Spending Clause expenditures and
 8 programs in this case.
 9 I recognize that the Commerce Clause could also
 10 provide a basis for Congress to reach transactions
 11 involving criminal activity that affect commerce, but this
 12 Court in Salinas v. United States, in describing why
 13 section 666 was constitutional, as applied to the facts of
 14 that case, discussed that there was a legitimate Federal
 15 interest in protecting the particular program that
 16 corruption had affected in that case. And the outgrowth
 17 of section 666 historically is of an effort by Congress to
 18 improve on previously deficient methods of protecting
 19 federally funded programs. There were -
 20 QUESTION: How far does that go? What if -
 21 what if the Federal Government gave the State $1? Could
 22 it make -- could it make it -- it a crime for any person
 23 to bribe any State officer anywhere in any program at all?
 24 You know, the -- really is -- is there no end to the -- to
 25 the scope of Congress' purported protection of its funds?

17 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I think that this
 2 Court recognized, as recently as last term in Jinks v.
 3 Richland County, that analysis under the Necessary and
 4 Proper Clause is deferential, tracing its roots back to
 5 McCulloch v. Maryland, but there is an attenuation element
 6 to the analysis. The law does need to be conducive and
 7 plainly adapted to the end that Congress is seeking to
 8 protect. And in your example of $1 to a State and then
 9 protection through criminalizing the activities of 10 hundreds of thousands of agents, there might be an 11 attenuation problem. 12 QUESTION: Do you think $10,000 is -- is clearly
 13 -- what's -- what's the -- what's the annual budget of New
 14 York State, do you know, or California? 
 15 MR. DREEBEN: Okay. The annual budget of
 16 California is -- at least in 1999, was $242 billion. 
 17 QUESTION: $242 billion. 
 18 MR. DREEBEN: And the Federal Government -
 19 QUESTION: And because there's $10,000 of
 20 Federal money, a drop of Federal money in this sea of -
 21 of California funds, the -- the Federal Government can
 22 control the whole thing.
 23 MR. DREEBEN: But there's not a drop. There's a
 24 virtual flood. There was -
 25 QUESTION: No, no. But for the statute to

18 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 apply, it takes only $10,000.
 2 MR. DREEBEN: It does, Justice Scalia, but
 3 Congress was well aware that every State is the recipient
 4 of billion upon billions of dollars in Federal aid. There
 5 is substantial Federal money flowing to all of the States,
 6 and Congress could have dispensed with any dollar
 7 limitation whatsoever with respect to State aid and simply
 8 made a per se finding that Federal money is so infused
 9 into the State's budgetary activities, Federal programs
 10 are so pervasive -
 11 QUESTION: How much does it give California? I
 12 just -- just --
 13 (Laughter.) 
 14 QUESTION: You say it's a big -- a big figure.
 15 I believe you, but -
 16 MR. DREEBEN: As of -- as of 1999, California
 17 received $35,955,000,000.
 18 QUESTION: But why is California relevant? This
 19 is Minnesota, isn't it? 
 20 (Laughter.) 
 21 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens -
 22 QUESTION: It was my fault. I brought it up as
 23 a hypothetical. Right?
 24 (Laughter.) 
 25 MR. DREEBEN: But I have Minnesota too. 

19 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 (Laughter.) 
 2 MR. DREEBEN: Minnesota received -- Minnesota's
 3 budget was $36 billion, and it received 4,000,000,496
 4 Federal dollars -
 5 QUESTION: What about Massachusetts? 
 6 (Laughter.) 
 7 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I only have 30
 8 minutes and there are 50 States. 
 9 (Laughter.) 
 10 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, I am concerned about the
 11 breadth of your reliance on the Necessary and Proper
 12 Clause and the Spending Clause power here. It seems to me
 13 that Federal funding extends to a huge range of
 14 activities, and why, under your theory, couldn't Congress
 15 make -- take over the entire criminal law scheme because
 16 it affects Federal taxpayers? I mean, I don't see any
 17 limit to your theory, and I'm curious why you're so
 18 reluctant to rely on the Commerce Clause. What's going on
 19 in this case?
 20 MR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor -
 21 QUESTION: Are you trying to overcome the
 22 problems of Lopez somehow, get a new thread of analysis
 23 that gets you out from under that? What's -- what's
 24 happening in this case?
 25 MR. DREEBEN: No. I think there are ample

20 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 avenues for the Federal Government to legislate, when
 2 things involve interstate commerce, without worrying about
 3 Lopez. 
 4 I believe the Court could uphold the statute as
 5 a regulation of interstate commerce, but it was clearly
 6 not designed with that in mind, and this Court did not so
 7 regard it, or at least didn't articulate itself as
 8 regarding it that way in Salinas v. United States. The
 9 problem that Congress was trying to solve was a very
 10 particularized problem, not the generalized problem of
 11 there is crime in America, therefore it will affect
 12 federally funded activities. 
 13 The problem that Congress was trying to solve
 14 was that it would give Federal money to particular
 15 entities to -- to administer Federal programs, and there
 16 would be crime that had the potential to affect those
 17 Federal interests, but because of deficiencies or
 18 perceived deficiencies in prior statutory law, that crime
 19 could not be prosecuted. In particular, with theft crimes
 20 there was a problem because once title had passed with the
 21 money to the local entity or State entity, some courts
 22 were saying that was no longer theft from the Federal
 23 Government and the theft statute didn't apply. With
 24 respect to the Federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. 201,
 25 lower courts had divided on whether State and local

21 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 officials who were administering Federal programs could be
 2 held accountable as Federal officials.
 3 And to remedy those deficiencies of prior law,
 4 section 666, as the court of appeals I think aptly
 5 described it, changed the enforcement paradigm, and it
 6 said that what we want now is not to focus on particular
 7 Federal monies that we have difficulty tracing into
 8 federally funded entities or who is a Federal official.
 9 We want to make sure that the entities that we fund to
 10 carry out Federal assistance programs are clean, and the
 11 way that we are going to do that is to draft a
 12 prophylactic statute that ensures that all agents who are
 13 involved in the authority to conduct business on behalf of
 14 the entity are not engaged in significant acts of theft, 15 embezzlement, or bribery. 16 It, therefore, included various limitations in 17 section 666 that prevent it from being an all-
 18 encompassing, all-devouring statute that sweeps in all
 19 related crimes to the entities that are funded. There's a
 20 $5,000 limitation with respect to the transactions that
 21 are going to be influenced. It's not every traffic ticket
 22 that is issued by any State agency. And there is a -- a
 23 condition, of course, that there be $10,000 of Federal
 24 money going into the entity. 
 25 Of course, there are going to be cases under

22 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 this statute where it will be difficult to articulate a
 2 clear -
 3 QUESTION: $10,000 annually or is it just a -
 4 could it be a one-shot deal?
 5 MR. DREEBEN: It's -- could be a one-shot deal.
 6 it's a $10,000 grant during a 12-month period that spans
 7 the offense conduct in question. 
 8 And as I was saying -
 9 QUESTION: If -- if the State got -- I mean, the
 10 way you read it, just because you got $10,000 last year
 11 doesn't mean that next year you're still subject to the
 12 act. It has to be -
 13 MR. DREEBEN: That's right. 
 14 QUESTION: -- during the year. Okay.
 15 MR. DREEBEN: That's right. The offense conduct
 16 has to be -
 17 QUESTION: It says in any 1-year period, but I
 18 -- I assume that that means -
 19 MR. DREEBEN: Any 1-year period, but there's
 20 another provision in the statute that makes clear that the
 21 period can include time before the offense conduct and
 22 time after the offense conduct, which is naturally read to
 23 mean that it has to span the offense conduct. And that
 24 provision was designed to overcome the difficulty that
 25 State and local agents would be bribed for activities that

23 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 they would have the power to engage in once the Federal


2 money was awarded to their agency. And in anticipation of


3 Federal money coming into the entity, the officials could


4 engage in corrupt conduct. 


5 QUESTION: I assume this means that the Federal


6 Government could also criminalize federally robbery or


7 burglary committed against a private individual who has


8 received Federal funds, who has received a Federal subsidy


9 in one way or another. Right? 


10

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Justice Scalia, within


11 limits. I think that there could be a -- a point in time


12 at which the Court might say that if the Federal

13 Government passed a statute that said every robbery

14 involves -

15 QUESTION: I mean, that's probably all of us,


16 you know. 


17 QUESTION: All welfare recipients --


18 MR. DREEBEN: All money -


19 QUESTION: -- all Medicare beneficiaries, and so


20 forth?


21 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the Court -- the Court long


22 ago upheld in United States v. Hall a statute that


23 prevented fraud and embezzlement directed at funds going


24 to veterans. So it has already upheld statutes in which


25 the Federal interest in protecting the beneficiary's


24 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 use -
 2 QUESTION: It was limited to the funds, though.
 3 It didn't say anything you -- anybody who gets any money
 4 from a veteran is -- is -- you know.
 5 MR. DREEBEN: That's -
 6 QUESTION: And that's what this says. Anybody
 7 who -- who bribes any State official, whether the Federal
 8 funds are at issue or not.
 9 MR. DREEBEN: Well, this -- this statute,
 10 though, I think rests on a generalization that is less
 11 attenuated and more reasonable than statutes that would
 12 take the form of the statute Your Honor has described.
 13 This statute basically says if you have corrupt officials
 14 in the entity that's getting Federal money, we have reason
 15 to worry that you have poor internal controls, that you
 16 have a culture of corruption, that you have insufficient
 17 mechanisms to root it out, and that the officials that are
 18 engaged in corruption today with respect to State money
 19 may tomorrow be engaged in corruption with respect to
 20 Federal money.
 21 QUESTION: So -- so call -- call this the clean
 22 funnel rationale. The agencies are funnels funneling
 23 money to the -- and say, look, we have a pretty strong
 24 rationale here. We want clean funnels because a little
 25 bit of the money going through is Federal. Take that as

25 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 given.
 2 If I were to say you're right, what's the
 3 standard where the Spending Clause is at issue? What
 4 words would be used there? And the reason that this is
 5 difficult at the moment for me is because this is not a
 6 condition imposed upon spending. You're not saying to the
 7 State, we'll give you the transport money if you -- this
 8 is really a Federal law protecting the -- the spending.
 9 You may be right in this case, but we're going to have to
 10 say some kind of standard.
 11 Should we say it's just whatever would be
 12 necessary and proper to protect the object of the
 13 spending, which is quite far out because you can spend for
 14 things you don't otherwise have the power to do? Or
 15 should we say something else, or should we say we don't
 16 have to reach that here because if in fact the power would
 17 be there under the Commerce Clause anyway, that at least
 18 is good enough and isn't a stretch of the Spending Clause
 19 where there's a necessary and proper rationale? What in
 20 your view is the proper way to write those words?
 21 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I think the most
 22 logical way to write this opinion is to rely on the test
 23 that this Court articulated in 1819 through Chief Justice
 24 Marshall with respect to the power under the Necessary and
 25 Proper Clause. Here the enumerated power that's being

26 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 protected is the spending power. The Necessary and Proper


2 Clause was long ago construed to give Congress substantial


3 deference to pass laws so long as they are conducive to


4 the end that Congress is trying to achieve and its

5 legitimate.

6 QUESTION: The -- the McCulloch language? Let

7 the end be legitimate -

8 MR. DREEBEN: That's -- that's correct. That's


9 correct, Justice Kennedy. 


10 QUESTION: Suppose that -- that to -- to take


11 the phrase, the clean funnel theory, we thought that that


12 theory is best sustained under the Commerce Clause. What


13 would be the closest case that we could cite in support of


14 our position if we were writing under the Commerce Clause?


15 Are there cases in which governmental entities and -- and


16 their -- the integrity of the operations are protected


17 under the Commerce Clause? Have we ever talked about


18 that?


19 MR. DREEBEN: I can't think, off the top of my


20 head, Justice Kennedy, of a Commerce Clause case that was


21 specifically directed at governmental activity. Of


22 course, this statute is not specifically directed at


23 governmental activity.

It's directed at any fund


24 recipient, be it private, Indian tribe, or governmental.


25 So the Court could rely on cases probably like Reno v.


27 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 Condon in which the Court upheld a law that dealt with an
 2 item in commerce, be it in the hands of the Government or
 3 in hands of private parties. And of course, United States
 4 v. Perez did uphold a very broad view of the Congress'
 5 power to regulate transactional conduct. 6 QUESTION: No governmental entities in that 7 case, as I recall. 8 MR. DREEBEN: No governmental entities in -- in 9 Perez, but of course, this case doesn't focus on
 10 governmental entities as such. What it focuses on them is
 11 -- it focuses on them in their capacity as administrators
 12 of funds that are paid out under Federal assistance
 13 programs. It treats them identically to private entities
 14 that also receive Federal funds under Federal programs,
 15 which is strong evidence that what Congress had in mind
 16 here was ensuring that its purposes and goals under the
 17 Spending Clause aren't frustrated by corruption within
 18 whatever entity it is that happens to be taking the funds
 19 to administer the program. 
 20 QUESTION: I think some of our -
 21 QUESTION: Is the -- is the Spending Clause -
 22 is it -- is it something new or were the statutes that
 23 were inadequate, the predecessors of 666 -- what was the
 24 constitutional heading of authority that the predecessors
 25 of 666 -

28 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, 18 U.S.C.,
 2 section 641, which was the Federal theft statute, was
 3 really a protection of Federal property, and that probably
 4 could be justified under a variety of enumerated powers
 5 under Article I.
 6 18 U.S.C., section 201 was the Federal bribery
 7 statute that primarily focuses on people who are Federal
 8 officials or who are designated to become Federal
 9 officials. And this Court in United States v. Dixson
 10 interpreted the statute to cover State and local officials
 11 who were administering Federal programs because they were
 12 acting on behalf of the United States. And with respect
 13 to that branch of section 201, although the Court did not
 14 address the constitutional question in Dixson, I think
 15 that the proper grant of authority to analyze it is the
 16 Necessary and Proper Clause as applied to the spending
 17 power because it, like section 666, criminalizes the
 18 activities of non-U.S. persons because they are engaged in
 19 an activity that relates to federally funded programs. 
 20 So the theory of protecting through criminal law
 21 the misdeeds of agents that may impair Federal programs or
 22 impair Federal funds is not new. What was new about
 23 section 666 was its removal of the impediments that
 24 Congress found in the prior law so that it could have an
 25 effective mechanism to ensure the integrity of its

29 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 programs. 
 2 The case that is before the Court today is a
 3 facial challenge to section 666, arguing that it is always
 4 and everywhere unconstitutional. That submission is
 5 impossible to reconcile with this Court's decision in
 6 Salinas v. United States which specifically said that as
 7 applied to the conduct in that case, where there was a
 8 connection to a Federal program, the statute was
 9 constitutional as applied. 
 10 What that means is that the court of appeals was
 11 clearly correct in holding that section 666 is not
 12 facially unconstitutional. It leaves open whether there
 13 is an as-applied constitutional challenge to section 666.
 14 No such challenge was brought in this case, and the United
 15 States made a proffer to the district court indicating how
 16 the particular bribery in this case would have had an
 17 effect on Federal funds and Federal programs, making clear
 18 that no such as-applied challenge would have succeeded.
 19 So the only way that petitioner can prevail in
 20 this case if this Court is prepared to say that
 21 notwithstanding its prior decision in Salinas, holding
 22 that section 666 was constitutional as applied, it now
 23 turns out that section 666 is facially unconstitutional
 24 and can never be applied to anyone anywhere. We submit
 25 that that is incorrect.

1 QUESTION: If there were a nexus requirement
 2 that we wrote into the statute -- the hypothetical gets a
 3 little murky at this point -- would -- would juries have
 4 to find that there was a nexus or could the judge
 5 instruct -
 6 MR. DREEBEN: Judging from the way that this
 7 Court resolved the Salinas decision, Justice Kennedy, it
 8 would be a constitutional as-applied challenge to be
 9 resolved by the Court. This Court in Salinas said that
 10 the statute was constitutional as applied and there had
 11 been no jury finding on any nexus requirement. 
 12 QUESTION: But in subsequent trials, if we found
 13 a nexus requirement, would the juries have to determine
 14 the nexus?
 15 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think that they would,
 16 Justice Kennedy. Just as in a case like New York v.
 17 Ferber where the Court held that child pornography can be
 18 outlawed across the board, the statute is not --
 19 QUESTION: Well, but --
 20 MR. DREEBEN: It's not invalid on overbreadth
 21 grounds.
 22 QUESTION: Yes.
 23 MR. DREEBEN: But the Court left open the
 24 possibility that there would be as-applied challenges, and
 25 it didn't suggest that those as-applied constitutional

31 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 challenges would raise jury issues. They would instead


2 raise issues of law for the -


3 QUESTION: Well, but if Congress in its -- in -


4 in the statute says there must be some connection with


5 interstate commerce, then certainly it's a jury issue.


6 And Justice Kennedy's question, as I understood


7 it, was that supposing the Court were to read in a nexus


8 requirement, just exactly what Congress might have put in.


9 You say that would not be a jury question then. 


10

MR. DREEBEN:

I am judging, Chief Justice


11 Rehnquist, by the way that this Court resolved the legal


12 issue in the Salinas case. The Court would have two


13 options open to it if it decided, contrary to our

14 arguments today, to read in some sort of a nexus

15 requirement. It could do what the Second and Third

16 Circuits have done, which is, we think incorrectly,


17 superimpose on the statute as an implicit element that has


18 no textual foundation some sort of a Federal nexus.


19 Now, if the Court did construe section 666 to


20 require a Federal nexus, that's clearly a jury issue under


21 United States v. Gaudin. Every element, be it implicit or


22 explicit, has to be found by the jury. 


23 But alternatively, I understood Justice Kennedy


24 to be suggesting that there could be a constitutional


25 overlay to ensure that there was no unconstitutional


32 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 application of section 666, and if it's treated as a pure
 2 constitutional question, then I think the better reading
 3 of this Court's decisions is that it would be a question
 4 of law -
 5 QUESTION: Do you think this Court's decisions
 6 have been consistent on that question? 
 7 (Laughter.) 8 MR. DREEBEN: I think they have been groping 9 towards consistency. 10 (Laughter.) 11 QUESTION: Let me write that down. Groping 12 towards -13 (Laughter.) 
 14 QUESTION: I can -- I can use that in --
 15 (Laughter.) 
 16 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, what answer do you give
 17 to the dissenting judge in the Eighth Circuit who said it
 18 is now a Federal crime for an auto mechanic to induce a
 19 public high school principal to hire him to teach shop
 20 class by offering free car repair?
 21 MR. DREEBEN: Well, so long, Justice Ginsburg,
 22 as the statutory valuation elements are met, that the
 23 transaction involves $5,000 or more, which it probably
 24 would, given teacher salaries, then it would be covered by
 25 section 666, and the Government would have discretion to

33 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 prosecute it. I think what that illustrates is that the
 2 broad prophylactic approach that section 666 takes leads
 3 easily to the manufacturing of hypotheticals that seem
 4 attenuated from core Federal interests. 
 5 And the choice that Congress had before it was
 6 to draft a statute that would go to that degree of breadth
 7 but eliminate impediments that had previously hobbled the
 8 enforcement of a law or draft a statute which Congress
 9 believed was both under-inclusive and would put to the
 10 jury perhaps difficult and murky issues of whether there
 11 really was a Federal connection that justified application
 12 of the statute. And let me give an example because it's a 13 very important, classic example of the way that we use 14 section 666. 15 Suppose that there is a city council person or a
 16 mayor or some other official who has responsibilities for
 17 some respect -- in some respects administering a Federal
 18 program or Federal funds, and he turns out to be engaged
 19 in corruption with respect to non-Federal monies and non-
 20 Federal programs. The Government wants to prosecute him
 21 to ensure that he doesn't begin to widen his field of
 22 operation and harm the Federal program, but in the facts
 23 that can actually be proved, there's no connection between
 24 the Federal program and the offense conduct.
 25 Conceivably could a statute be drafted that

34 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 would allow the Government to say that's the kind of
 2 Federal nexus that's covered? Certainly, but there are
 3 many, many hypotheticals where the potential injury to
 4 Federal interests is not necessarily going to be easy to
 5 articulate and prove to a jury. 
 6 As a matter of discretion, the United -
 7 QUESTION: Who -- whose burden is it? I mean,
 8 assume we accept your -- your proposition that we should
 9 uphold it on its face, at least, and that future as-
 10 applied challenges will still be allowed. Would it be the
 11 burden of the defendant to establish that -- that this
 12 goes too far, that this is not reasonable protection of
 13 the Federal monetary interest? 14 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia. If it's a 15 question of law, is the statute unconstitutional as 16 applied, then the defendant should have the burden of 17 establishing that. But I understood Justice Ginsburg's
 18 hypothetical to raise the question what if Congress had
 19 drafted a narrower statute that had some sort of an
 20 offense nexus element. Then we'd have to prove it up. 
 21 The United States Attorneys Manual does direct
 22 prosecutors to use 666 in cases where there's a
 23 substantial and identifiable Federal interest. So what
 24 you have here is a combination of Congress saying we need
 25 a statute that's adequate to vindicate Federal interests

35 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 and prior efforts to draft narrower ones have frustrated


2 that goal. We're going to draft a broader statute. And


3 then the Federal executive branch uses its discretion to


4 prosecute cases that do, indeed, pose a real threat to


5 Federal interests. Now, that's as a matter of discretion.


6 It's not as a matter of constitutional law, and it's not


7 as a matter of what the statute provides.


8 QUESTION: Well, then why should we take that


9 into consideration deciding the question before us?


10

MR. DREEBEN:

It's not relevant, strictly


11 speaking, to the constitutional question. What it is


12 relevant to is why it was rational for Congress to draft a


13 somewhat broader statute without fearing that, by virtue


14 of having given the executive branch this power, State


15 criminal law would be thoroughly swamped, I believe as one


16 of the dissenting opinions said.


17 QUESTION: But what if you have a new executive


18 coming in who is really hot on this subject and says we


19 want to prosecute every case we can under it?


20 MR. DREEBEN: Then I'll have to withdraw this


21 statement. 


22 (Laughter.) 


23

QUESTION:

Or an even more realistic


24 hypothetical is the United States Attorney in Chicago or


25 New York, who are not always, shall I say, responsive to


36 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 the directives of central justice, bringing a prosecution
 2 against a political opponent that has really no connection
 3 with a Federal interest. That might happen.
 4 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I often say that
 5 the only way that we get uniformity in Federal criminal
 6 law enforcement is from a decision by this Court.
 7 If the Court has no further questions. 
 8 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.
 9 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you. 
 10 QUESTION: Mr. Birrell, you have 12 minutes
 11 remaining. 
 12 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. BIRRELL
 13 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 14 MR. BIRRELL: Thank you, Your Honor. 
 15 Turning first to the discussion about Salinas,
 16 Salinas did not decide the issue presented in this case.
 17 The constitutionality of the statute was not before the
 18 Court in Salinas. Salinas was a question of statutory
 19 interpretation. What the Court appeared to do was to
 20 conduct a harmless error review because the
 21 constitutionality had not been raised in the briefs, was
 22 not in the cert petition, and it does not impede our
 23 facial challenge. 
 24 I think that this -- this -
 25 QUESTION: You -- you think Salinas, had the

37 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 constitutional been raised, would have -- should have come
 2 out the other way.
 3 MR. BIRRELL: I think that if the constitutional
 4 issue had been raised in Salinas, it would have come out
 5 the other way, yes.
 6 I think as well that if I could direct the Court
 7 to page 34 of our brief, that this will respond to the
 8 discussion about the element, that this is an analysis
 9 about the element in Lopez. We would submit the same
 10 would apply here. 
 11 There are many noncommercial applications of
 12 this statute, for example, bribery regarding civil rights
 13 law. So I don't think the Commerce Clause is -- is the
 14 answer.
 15 Furthermore, in -- 666(a)(2) doesn't even
 16 require any actual recipient corruption because the third
 17 party to the funding contract under (a)(2) can -- can
 18 offer a bribe to an absolutely incorruptible official and
 19 yet still be charged with a Federal crime.
 20 The -- the overreaching question in this case,
 21 Your Honors, is that Federal power must have judicially
 22 enforceable limits and this statute ignores them and is
 23 unconstitutional in every instance. 
 24 Thank you. 
 25 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
