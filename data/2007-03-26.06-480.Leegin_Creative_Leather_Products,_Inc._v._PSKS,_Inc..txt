1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in case 06-480, Leegin Creative 5 Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated. Mr. Olson. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 The per se illegality rule for resale price 11 maintenance is widely recognized to be outdated, 12 misguided and anticompetitive. It should be replaced 13 with the same rule of reason standard that applies to 14 other forms of vertically imposed marketing 15 restrictions. 16 The Sherman Act bars only unreasonable 17 restraints of trade and the court presumptively applies 18 a rule of reason analysis to determine whether a 19 restraint is unreasonable. 20 Per se rules should be rare and imposed only 21 where the court is virtually certain based upon 22 considerable economic experience that a practice is 23 nearly invariably anticompetitive. Vertical minimum 24 retail -- resale price maintenance are plainly not 25 invariably anticompetitive. In fact, a broad consensus
3

1 of economists and decisions of this Court recognize that 2 vertical restraints promote interbrand competition, 3 which is the goal of the antitrust laws and are rarely, 4 if ever, anticompetitive. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was an argument 6 made, Mr. Olson, that it is somewhat difficult to 7 distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context, 8 that in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made 9 with the dealers was more successful in getting a 10 horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers 11 had attempted it themselves, in which case some might 12 have held back. 13 MR. OLSON: Well, the economists who have 14 looked at the use of resale price maintenance have said 15 that that would very rarely, if ever, be the case. It 16 certainly could not be the case in this industry in 17 connection with this participant in the marketplace. 18 There are something like 5,000 dealers that the Brighton 19 products are sold through. There are thousands and 20 thousands of other competing dealers, hundreds of 21 products. 22 What the Court has said repeatedly is that 23 programs such as this may promote interbrand 24 competition, perhaps -25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, suppose just
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the dealers in New York, the retail dealers agreed among 2 themselves on the price. Would that be lawful? 3 MR. OLSON: No. I think that that would be 4 covered by a horizontal prohibition, Justice Stevens. 5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you say that it's 6 per se unlawful? 7 MR. OLSON: I think it would be, as 8 horizontal restraint among competing dealers, it could 9 be a per se violation under horizontal rules if it was 10 -- if it was -- involved the manufacturer in some way, 11 it could be dealt with by the rule of reason. 12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why should that be any 13 different from the arrangement where those dealers all 14 got together in the convention and recommended to the 15 manufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of 16 precisely the same dimensions? Why -17 MR. OLSON: What this Court said in 18 Sylvania, and said again in the State Oil versus Khan, 19 is that the manufacturer has very, very little incentive 20 to increase -21 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm asking what if 22 he did, why should you draw a distinction? 23 MR. OLSON: Because the motivation for the 24 arrangement, if it comes from a manufacturer -- you're 25 suggesting a hypothetical in which all of the dealers in
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 a particular area would get together to impose this on a 2 manufacturer. I think it's very unrealistic that that 3 would happen. 4 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. They just passed a 5 resolution asking the manufacturer to impose this 6 vertical restraint and ways to do it. Should that be 7 different from one in which the manufacturer does it 8 independently? 9 MR. OLSON: I think that if the manufacturer 10 makes a decision, whether it's because dealers would 11 like to see that happen or not, as this Court said in 12 Business Electronic versus Sharp Electronics, there's of 13 course relationships between the dealers and the 14 manufacturers, that the dealers may have an interest in 15 doing this, because they may find for the same reason 16 that the manufacturer does that it promotes the sales of 17 products. The record is clear in this case that this 18 was an effective strategy for the Brighton company, the 19 Brighton Leegin company that's manufacturing the 20 Brighton products, to enter a very difficult and highly 21 competitive marketplace, and it was successful. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe, Mr. Olson, 23 you could give us an example where the rule of reason 24 would find a violation in this situation? 25 MR. OLSON: Well, it might be a situation,
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the economists have written about this, say that it 2 would be very rare, and would require retailers with a 3 strong powerful market power to impose a situation where 4 the manufacturer would do that to help facilitate a 5 horizontal cartel. That certainly was not involved in 6 this case, and that would probably be found to violate 7 the rule of reason. In addition, it would probably be 8 unlawful under the horizontal rules established by this 9 Court. That was not an issue in this case. The 10 economists say that that would very seldom happen. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: You say very. Which 12 economists? I know the Chicago school tends to want 13 rule of reason and so forth. Professor Sherer is an 14 economist, isn't he? Worked at the FTC for a long time. 15 A good expert in the field. He points out the drug 16 industry after you got rid of -- after you got rid of 17 resale price maintenance, the margins fell 40 percent. 18 The drug stores it went down 20 percent. He says with 19 blue jeans, alone, it saved American consumers $200 20 million to get rid of it. And his conclusion is, as in 21 the uniform enforcement of resale price maintenance, the 22 restraints can impose massive anti-consumer benefits. 23 Massive. 24 MR. OLSON: Well -25 JUSTICE BREYER: What that sounds like is
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that if at least he, who is an economist, thinks if you 2 get rid of Dr. Miles, every American will pay far more 3 for the goods that they buy at retail. Now that's one 4 economist, of course. There are other whose think 5 differently. So how should we decide this? 6 MR. OLSON: Well -7 JUSTICE BREYER: Should we overturn 8 Dr. Miles and run that risk? 9 MR. OLSON: In, in the vast majority of the 10 economist whose have looked at this have come out to the 11 opposite conclusion, Justice Breyer. Secondly -12 JUSTICE BREYER: We're supposed to count 13 economists? 14 MR. OLSON: No. No. I think that -15 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that how we decide it? 16 (Laughter.) 17 MR. OLSON: But what this Court -- what this 18 Court has repeatedly said, that under circumstances such 19 as this where there's a consensus among leading 20 respected economists, that is one factor. There's 21 another factor -22 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I haven't seen a 23 consensus. A consensus? Isn't, doesn't Sherer and all 24 these people, doesn't that point of view count, too? 25 MR. OLSON: This is one factor that the
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Court should consider and the Court has considered in 2 the past when dealing with something that the Court 3 itself has said, is an anachronistic and chronologically 4 schizoid rule, to have a rule of reason for certain 5 vertical restraints and a fixed, rigid, per se rule with 6 respect to other vertical restraints. The Court -- the 7 Court itself has made those pronouncements. 8 The enforcing agencies have changed their 9 view with respect -- and they are here today, the 10 Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, all 11 of whom have announced that they believe that it is very 12 rare for a rule such as this, for an arrangement such as 13 this to be anticompetitive. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was not so long 15 ago that the Department of Justice took a different 16 view. And of all of the vertical restraints, this is 17 the only one where Congress has been a player. I mean, 18 Congress allowed the fair trade laws to operate. And 19 then it withdrew that. There's no other restraint where 20 they are has been congressional action, where the 21 argument could be made, well, Congress is well aware of 22 this, the Court should allow them to make the change, if 23 they so will. 24 MR. OLSON: Essentially, the same argument 25 was made in the Sylvania -- at the time of the Sylvania
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 case. The same argument was made just a term or two go 2 in connection with the Illinois Tool case that dealt 3 with tying arrangements. The same argument was made in 4 State Oil versus Khan. This Court has construed the 5 antitrust laws as an expression by Congress that the 6 courts should be aware of the dynamic potential in the 7 marketplace -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in those cases you 9 didn't have the counterpart to Miller-Tydings and 10 McGuire. That's what makes this -- this one different 11 in terms of congressional intention. 12 MR. OLSON: The repeal of those statutes, 13 Justice Ginsburg, repealed per se legality rules. It 14 was not a congressional expression against the rule of 15 reason -16 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but there was in the 17 patent case, though, Mr. Olson. We relied on the fact 18 that the patent law changed. 19 MR. OLSON: Yes, you did. 20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 21 MR. OLSON: And that was a, that was one 22 factor, however, Justice Stevens. I think, as I read 23 that opinion, the Court was also concerned with the fact 24 that the, the per se rule which -- and the Court said 25 the statement thing just a few weeks ago in the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Weyerhaeuser case -- to the extent there's practices 2 that can be procompetitive, the Court should not set a 3 low threshold of illegality, especially low per se 4 illegality threshold. There were -- there have been -5 it is worth emphasizing that the Court has repeatedly 6 said we don't want per se rules when we don't have a 7 substantial body of economic experience that shows us 8 that this practice -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what 10 about the reliance interest, though? I mean, hasn't a 11 whole industry of discount stores developed in reliance 12 on the Dr. Miles rule? And don't we need to be 13 concerned about the disruption to that established 14 practice? 15 MR. OLSON: There's really no evidence that 16 the marketplace as it exists today is a result of the 17 Dr. Miles rule of 1911, Chief Justice -18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there evidence that 19 the, basically that the rise of the Wal-Marts and the 20 Targets is correlated with the demise of fair trade? 21 So -- that there's that correlation. 22 MR. OLSON: Actually I looked into that, 23 Justice Souter. And me, my limited historical research 24 is that the -- those discounters were coming on strong 25 before 1975 which is when the, the consumer price,
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 whatever it was, act was passed in response to that. 2 There are -- the evidence basically shows 3 that -- and this Court has said -- that it's interbrand 4 competition that ultimately produces lower prices. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't know. We 6 have -- you talked about -- just for fun I got out of 7 the library a book by Professor B. S. Yamey, called 8 resale price maintenance where he has five economists -9 now maybe you're not going to count them as economists. 10 Now I didn't find in that book a single argument that 11 isn't also in your briefs, nor did I find in your brief 12 as single argument that isn't in the book. 13 There's one interesting thing about the 14 book. It was written in 1966. So I guess my question 15 is what's changed? Now I know two things have changed. 16 One is there's evidence in Canada, Britain, 17 and in the states that were under Miller-Tydings, that 18 when you got rid of resale price maintenance, prices 19 went down. That's changed. And the second thing that's 20 changed is there's far more concentration, I gather, 21 today in the retail side of the market than there are 22 used to be, a factor which makes resale price 23 maintenance dangerous because it's more likely to take 24 place at the request of the dealers. 25 Now, I see those two changes. My question
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to you is looking at Yamey's book which is called Resale 2 Price Maintenance, so you might have found even it even 3 on Google, and -- what's changed? What's new? 4 MR. OLSON: Well, a number of things have 5 changed. The -- the number of respected individuals, 6 notwithstanding that book, who have looked at it and 7 have focused on the marketplace, have said that because 8 it allows -- it increases the possibility of interbrand 9 competition, it can provide incentives for dealers to 10 provide service, differences in the products. And other 11 things that have happened since then, are this Court's 12 decision in the Sylvania case, which -- which involved 13 an elaborate analysis of vertical restrictions and found 14 that they are largely procompetitive and undermine the 15 ruling -- the reason for a per se rule. 16 This Court's decision in State Oil versus 17 Khan, and the other cases that this Court is very well 18 aware of where per se rules have systematically been 19 dismantled because they are artificial themselves in the 20 marketplace. This -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Olson, does brand 22 competition generally help retailers, or is this a 23 question that can't be answered? 24 MR. OLSON: Did you say inter -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Interbrand, interbrand
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 competition? Do retailers like interbrand competition? 2 MR. OLSON: Well, I don't know that -- I 3 don't know whether people like competition. But the 4 antitrust laws like competition and this Court likes 5 competition. And this Court has said that interbrand -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but we're talking 7 about inter -- we're talking about retailers. It, it 8 seems to me at the outset of the argument, you -- you 9 acknowledged, and I think it is the general rule -- that 10 if the retailers themselves have this resale price 11 maintenance, it is invalid. Well, if the manufacturer 12 does this just for the convenience of the retailers, and 13 that's -- many of the examples in your brief, it is for 14 the convenience and for the benefit of the retailers, 15 then why shouldn't there be a per se rule? Why should 16 we allow the manufacturer to do something we that 17 wouldn't allow the retailers to do, if it's for the 18 retailers? 19 MR. OLSON: Well, the manufacturer is very 20 unlikely to do this for the convenience of the 21 retailers, to -- because it's in the interest of the 22 manufacturer to have the retail price as low as possible 23 so that the manufacturer will sell as many of the 24 manufacturers' products as possible. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if, if indeed that's,
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that's what he's aiming at, low price. Is it the object 2 of the -- is the sole object of the Sherman Act to 3 produce low prices? 4 MR. OLSON: No. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was consumer 6 welfare. 7 MR. OLSON: Yes, yes, it is. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought some 9 consumers would prefer more service at a higher price. 10 MR. OLSON: Precisely. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the mere fact that it 12 would increase prices doesn't prove anything. It 13 doesn't prove that it's serving consumer welfare. If, 14 in fact, it's giving the consumer a choice of more 15 service at a somewhat higher price, that would enhance 16 consumer welfare, so long as there are competitive 17 products at a lower price, wouldn't it? 18 MR. OLSON: That's -- that's absolutely 19 correct. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't know why, why we 21 should have to focus our entire attention on whether 22 it's going to -- going to produce higher prices or not. 23 The market out there has different goods at different 24 prices which have different qualities that attract 25 different consumers.

1 MR. OLSON: I -- I agree completely. I 2 would like to reserve the balance of my time for 3 rebuttal, but let me say that that's what this Court has 4 said over and over again. If you -- the purpose of the 5 antitrust laws is not price, but it's competition, 6 because competition between competing manufacturers give 7 the consumers more choice. Some people may want the 8 cheapest product. Some people may want the product 9 that's more available to them. They may wish the return 10 policy or the warranty policy or the repair policy that 11 the dealer provides. And in this marketplace 12 particularly, that system of providing competition is 13 consistent with the antitrust laws and has produced 14 success in the marketplace. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, before you sit 16 down, there's just one thing that wasn't covered in your 17 argument or in the brief, but the complaint alleged in 18 this case that Leegin allowed certain favored dealers to 19 discount; this plaintiff, but others were allowed to 20 discount. And if that were true, as a matter of fact, 21 then that would be a -- a plain violation of antitrust 22 law, wouldn't it? 23 MR. OLSON: This -- but the case was never 24 litigated on that basis. It wasn't considered on that 25 basis in the Court of Appeals. It came up sort of as a
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 late thought in the opposition to the petition for 2 certiorari. But that is not this case. The case was 3 litigated on the per se rule of Dr. Miles. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 5 Mr. Olson. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in the complaint,. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 8 Mr. Olson. 9 Mr. Hungar? 10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR 11 ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, 12 AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER 13 MR. HUNGAR: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, 14 and may it please the Court. 15 The same considerations that led this Court 16 in Sylvania and State Oil to reject outmoded per se 17 rules compel that same result here. The Dr. Miles rule 18 conflicts with this Court's modern antitrust 19 jurisprudence in three fatal -20 JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe I'll put my question, 21 which is really just one for this. I understand 22 perfectly that the per se rule is a result of balancing 23 differ things. Of course, resale price maintenance does 24 raise prices, and it is very often anticompetitive. Of 25 course, sometimes, there are good reasons for it that
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 might help consumers. 2 Now, in addition, you need clear rules. Now 3 those three sets of things require a balance. And we 4 have a hundred years of history where this Court and 5 Congress and others have balanced those three sets of 6 considerations, and they've come out one way. Now, the 7 Department of Justice wants to rebalance them and come 8 out the other way. 9 There are good arguments on both sides. Why 10 should we overrule a case that's 96 years old, in the 11 absence of any -- any -- congressional indication that 12 that's a good idea, when it's simply a question in a 13 difficult area of people reaching a slightly different 14 weight on some these three sets of things? 15 MR. HUNGAR: Several reasons, Your Honor. 16 It's not -- it's not a close question whether this Court 17 under its modern antitrust jurisprudence as an initial 18 matter would impose a per se rule in this context. 19 There is economic -- there is consensus among the 20 respected economists -21 JUSTICE BREYER: I would think it is quite a 22 close question. 23 MR. HUNGAR: I don't think you, Your Honor. 24 Given that -25 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, even so. Go
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 ahead. 2 MR. HUNGAR: Given that this Court's test, 3 the question this Court's modern cases ask, in 4 distinguishing between the rule of reason and the per se 5 rule, is whether the challenged conduct is always or 6 almost always anticompetitive. That's what the Court 7 has said. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Price fixing, horizontal, I 9 guess, or territorial divisions, we should overturn 10 those too. 11 MR. HUNGAR: Certainly not, Your Honor. 12 Because that, that is almost always anticompetitive in 13 our experience and in the experience of the courts. But 14 the same is not true in the resale price maintenance 15 context. Dr. Miles has foreclosed the courts from 16 conducting the kind of analysis that would actually look 17 into this question. But the empirical data that are 18 available would suggest that anticompetitive 19 explanations for resale price maintenance do not have 20 very much explanatory power. When you actually look at 21 the cases that have been litigated, they involve 22 manufacturers without market power, unconcentrated 23 markets, no evidence in the vast majority of those cases 24 of any cartelization going on. So the anticompetitive 25 explanations, while certainly valid in some cases, do
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 not appear to explain most of the retail price 2 maintenance that has been litigated. It's true that 3 retail price maintenance can but does not always result 4 in price increases, but, as Justice Scalia pointed out, 5 price is not the only thing that consumers care about. 6 And there is widespread consensus in the economic 7 literature and in this Court's recent cases that 8 price-based vertical restraints, just like non-price 9 based vertical restraints, while they generally reduce 10 intrabrand competition, generally enhance interbrand 11 competition. 12 In Monsanto and Business Electronics, 13 this Court made clear that price vertical restraints, 14 like minimum resale price maintenance, frequently, in 15 fact usually, have the same or similar effects to the 16 non-price vertical restraints to which this Court now 17 applies rule of reason analysis. So the reason in -18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't your argument 19 also apply to a conspiracy among the New York dealers in 20 this product just to fix prices? Because there's plenty 21 of interbrand competition, I think. I don't think you 22 can say it's absolutely clear that that would always be 23 anti-competitive because they would also agree to 24 provide additional services. 25 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 horizontal -- the important thing to keep in mind is 2 that the incentive of the manufacturer when the 3 manufacturer -4 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm talking about a case 5 in which it's the dealers who want to agree to provide 6 extra services at higher prices as their method of 7 better serving the public and they all agree that they 8 have to be conscious about the competition from other 9 brands. Why can we be absolutely certain that's always 10 going to be harmful to the consumer? 11 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the reason why we 12 know that is always or almost always harmful is that the 13 incentive at a horizontal level of a retailer cartel, 14 just like the incentives of the participants in a 15 manufacturing cartel -16 JUSTICE STEVENS: They might be precisely 17 the statement as the manufacturers: We think we'll make 18 more, all make more money if we concentrate on service 19 rather than price. 20 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because the 21 manufacturer's incentive is not to increase the profits 22 of the retailers, but the retailers when they get 23 together obviously have a very different incentive, 24 which is not to benefit the manufacturer. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: What you say is right.
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 What you say there is right. I feel I'm back in 1966. 2 The argument against that is, we don't know which way 3 the push comes. The large retailers, Home Depot, 4 whatever they are, huge retailers, they want -- or maybe 5 it isn't the discounters, it's some other once. We 6 don't know which way. You're throwing it into court. 7 You're throwing it before 12 people who may or may not 8 work this thing out. So the argument against what 9 you're saying is not logic. It's empirical and 10 administrative. 11 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor -12 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what it was. That's 13 what it is now, I guess. 14 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, in State Oil the 15 same argument was made. The argument was made that, 16 while we don't have compelling empirical evidence that 17 Albrecht results in harm to the economy, we don't have 18 compelling empirical evidence that resale price 19 maintenance, maximum resale price maintenance, is 20 generally pro-competitive, and in the absence of such 21 empirical evidence there's no basis for overturning 22 precedent. This Court unanimously -23 JUSTICE SOUTER: We do have empirical 24 evidence, though, don't we, that the decision of this 25 case is going to be very significant in the sort of
22

1 battle between Wal-Mart and the Main Street stores; and 2 why should this Court in effect take a shot in the dark 3 at resolving that, as distinct from leaving it to 4 Congress, which is in a position to know more about 5 where the shot is going to land than we are? 6 MR. HUNGAR: This Court -- I'm sorry. 7 There's no empirical evidence that I'm aware of about 8 what impact eliminating Dr. Miles would have on the 9 Wal-Marts of the world. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's my point. But it 11 seems to me there is a body of some empirical evidence 12 that the success of the Wal-Marts and the Targets and 13 the Home Depots was a success which was correlated with 14 the elimination of price maintenance by the States. 15 MR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor. 16 In fact, as Mr. Olson pointed out, the K-Marts of the 17 world began during the fair trade era. 18 JUSTICE SOUTER: They began, but they have 19 flourished in the post-fair trade era. 20 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor, but I think 21 considerations likes the opening up of international 22 trade and the development of markets like China to 23 supply low-cost goods have a lot more to do with the 24 success of the Wal-Marts of the world than a rule like 25 Dr. Miles.

1 Remember, it's perfectly legal under current 2 law for manufacturers to impose the same sort of 3 constraints as long as they do it by fiat and unilateral 4 enforcement rather than by agreement. So the suggestion 5 that somehow this is going to revolutionize the economy 6 if Dr. Miles is overruled is simply unsupportable. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, what's 8 the great benefit then in changing the rule if it's 9 perfectly legal to achieve the same result already? 10 MR. HUNGAR: As the Ping amicus brief, the 11 Ping Golf Club Manufacturer amicus brief, indicates it's 12 extremely expensive and inefficient to follow the 13 Colgate regime, that for those manufacturers for whom 14 resale price maintenance would be in effect a strategy 15 like Leegin it's more efficient to do it in many 16 circumstances by agreement, rather than the disruption 17 that is entailed when you terminate a dealer without 18 further discussion for discounting one item in order to 19 keep your policy in place. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't that answer 21 your argument that there isn't reason to believe that 22 there is going to be disruption if Dr. Miles goes, 23 because now it's going to be easy? 24 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, in 1945 during the 25 height of the fair trade era the FTC did a study which
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 concluded only about 5 percent of the economy was 2 affected by fair trade. And the fair trade regime, 3 remember, is a different and more extreme regime. There 4 it was per se legality, not rule of reason. So it's 5 just -- there's just no basis for these assertions that 6 somehow the economy is going to be massively changed. 7 But it is also perfectly clear and undisputed that there 8 are circumstances in which it is more efficient for a 9 manufacturer to adopt resale price maintenance. It will 10 enhance its ability to compete and it will provide 11 consumers more of what they want, and that is a good 12 thing and the antitrust laws should not automatically 13 foreclose that merely because in a small percentage of 14 cases it is conceivable that there can be 15 anticompetitive effects. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it fair to say that 17 there is reason to believe that there may be a massive 18 reorientation in the retail economy if Dr. Miles goes? 19 And that gets to my problem, why should we be the people 20 to make a guess as opposed to the Congress as the 21 institution to make the guess? 22 MR. HUNGAR: I'm not aware of any reason to 23 believe that, Your Honor, based on the historical record 24 and based on the modern realities. The Wal-Marts of the 25 world have succeeded because of their discounting

1 strategy. That's not going to change, and manufacturers 2 have an incentive to have their goods sold through those 3 stores and that's not going to change either in the vast 4 majority of cases. And With respect -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the rule of reason is 6 the one that applies, I gathered, perhaps incorrectly, 7 from Mr. Olson's remarks that this would be -- this case 8 would be thrown out on summary judgment, it would never 9 get to trial. How do you think the rule of reason would 10 operate if it were the rubric under which this case were 11 to be decided? 12 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I think it would 13 operate as it does usually, which is the plaintiff would 14 be required to establish an anticompetitive effect 15 resulting from the challenged conduct, and once that 16 burden is overcome the defendant would be required to 17 come up with some legitimate business justification, 18 some pro-competitive results that outweigh that. And 19 only if they could do that would they succeed. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's the formula, 21 but I take it from what you said and Mr. Olson said that 22 the plaintiff could never get across the first 23 threshold? 24 MR. HUNGAR: We don't agree with that, Your 25 Honor. In cases where resale price maintenance is being
26

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 used to facilitate cartelization, either at the 2 manufacturer or the retail level, the plaintiff could 3 prevail. Also in, for example, in an oligopolistic 4 market. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in this case, this 6 case has none of those features. 7 MR. HUNGAR: Well, right. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Leegin loses under the 9 rule of reason, right? 10 MR. HUNGAR: We don't know that. It seems 11 likely to assume that, though, and that's not a bad 12 thing. Leegin is obviously not dominant in the market. 13 It's obviously not going to succeed unless what it is 14 offering at a higher price is what consumers want, and 15 that is a good thing under the antitrust laws. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 17 Mr. Hungar. 18 MR. HUNGAR: Thank you. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Coykendall. 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. COYKENDALL 21 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 22 MR.

27

1 Discouraging price cuts and depriving consumers of low 2 prices is bad antitrust policy. RPM prohibits price -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? I mean, You 4 really think that antitrust policy means when -- any 5 arrangement that produce a higher price is bad? 6 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, we aren't talking 7 about any arrangement -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, a lot of consumers 9 want, you know, extended warranties. They want show 10 rooms where they can go and look at things. All of 11 which costs more money. And where you can not have 12 resale price maintenance the customers -- or you have 13 the free rider problem. The customers shop at the place 14 that has the big show room, likes at all the product 15 there, and goes and buys it from somebody else who has 16 not incurred that expense. 17 Now, I just don't think that all the 18 customers want is cheap. I think they want other things 19 besides cheap. I think they want service. I think they 20 want selection. I think they want the ability to view 21 goods and so forth. Why do you discount all of those 22 things? 23 MR. COYKENDALL: I don't discount all those 24 things. All those things are available under our 25 current regime where we have a per se prohibition
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 against resale price maintenance. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they aren't 3 available. This company thought that it could provide 4 higher service if it could assure its retailers that 5 they would not be undercut by people who are not 6 providing that kind of service. 7 MR. COYKENDALL: And there's no question 8 that even the plaintiff in this case was providing that 9 service. He was providing it more efficiently and he 10 just wanted to pass those efficiencies on. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't, I don't know that 12 there's no question about that. There's certainly no 13 question that this company was successful in breaking 14 into a difficult market with its strategy of assuring 15 its retailers a cushion so that they could provide the 16 service. 17 MR. COYKENDALL: The record shows that with 18 this specific company, most of the growth of its sales 19 occurred before it established a resale price 20 maintenance policy. So there are no demonstrated 21 benefits from this company of imposing and enforcing a 22 resale price maintenance policy. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your main 24 objection to -- I mean, it's hard to propose a rule of 25 reason. Why, why can't the rule of reason work to

1 promote the objectives you've just articulated?

2 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, as a practical matter

3 for someone in my position, or plaintiff's position,

4 it's impossible for a small dealer to muster the

5 resources in order to put forth --

CHIEF JUSTICE

6 ROBERTS: For a small dealer. But as we've already

7 heard, the dealers who engage in the discount policy are

8 prices like Target and Wal-Mart. Those aren't small

9 dealers. Those are behemoths in the retailing industry.

10 MR. COYKENDALL: I would suggest that those

11 are not the people that really are being protected by

12 this particular per se prohibition. It is the small mom

13 and pop operation like my client that wants to innovate

14 and expand and pass on efficiencies and compete with the

15 big discounters who might have power of their own in

16 order to secure discounts.

17 JUSTICE ALITO: So you don't agree with the

18 argument that we've heard this morning that the

19 transformation of American retailing since the 1970s and

20 the rise of the large-scale low-price retailers has

21 anything to do with the end of the fair trade laws and

22 that overruling Dr. Miles would reverse that?

23 MR. COYKENDALL: No, I absolutely agree with

24 that. But it's resale price maintenance that enables

25 these initiators, these small companies, these small

30

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 operations, to grow and innovate, achieve the 2 efficiencies, and pass those on, attract customers by 3 reducing prices. And all that is stopped by imposition 4 of a resale price -5 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there anything to suggest 6 that the large-scale low-price retailers who were 7 supposedly dependent on Dr. Miles are -- support its 8 retention? Have they filed amicus briefs here or 9 otherwise suggested that this is essential to their 10 continuing operation? 11 MR. COYKENDALL: Again, the large-scale 12 dominant players in the retail industry have their own 13 market power. They don't need the protection of the 14 per se rule in order to enforce them. It's the next 15 generation that this rule really aims to protect. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. I 17 mean, if it was really the case that they were going to 18 be losing, losing profits, I think they would have been 19 here. I mean, we talk about the Wal-Marts and the 20 Targets. They're not here on amicus briefs because 21 they're -- what they're selling is cheap. They are 22 selling price, and people who want low price and for 23 whom that's of value above all other things are going to 24 continue to go to those stores. So they're not going to 25 be harmed by the fact that some manufacturers want to
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 provide not just the low price -- of course, they'll try 2 to keep the price as low as possible -- but service. 3 I just don't see what, what harm can 4 possibly come, so long as there's no market dominance, 5 from allowing some people to make their money on service 6 and -- rather than cheap price. 7 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, again I would suggest 8 that under this current system the way it is we have 9 both the full service providers of complete service that 10 offer goods at a certain price and we have discounters 11 selling those same goods. There is currently a mix of 12 service and price that better serves the economy than 13 just having one cookie cutter -- a one size fits all 14 approach that you would have with resale price 15 maintenance. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought the per se 17 rule was the cookie cutter approach. 18 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, in terms of 19 prohibiting price or in terms of, yes, prohibiting price 20 fixing, that's true. But it permits stores to have full 21 price and full service and charge high prices for that 22 service, and it permits discounters to reduce price, 23 reduce service and cater to those customers who want the 24 goods with lower service. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: The Internet -- is it --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you would have said four years ago, or I think we are in 2 this argument, you would have said that it's the large 3 discounters, the growing discounters, the Walgreen's of 4 the world who want to get rid of retail price 5 maintenance, it's there to help the mom and pops. Okay. 6 They're in now, they're big, and they may want to 7 maintain resale prices because they may want to extract 8 the other profit, while the Internet little company 9 comes in and says I can get it to you cheaper. 10 Now I can imagine circumstances like you 11 say. I can imagine they're not like you say. I don't 12 know. And so what should I do if I really don't know? 13 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, there is no doubt 14 that resale price maintenance raises prices to 15 consumers. The only economic doubt is whether there are 16 any redeeming effects of those prices; and that's where 17 the economic dispute of this is. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought the 19 Ping brief that was referenced earlier made a point that 20 it made, the prices may be -- resale price -- the 21 current Dr. Miles rule may result in increased prices 22 because of the inefficiencies for those retailers, or of 23 those manufacturers who want to establish a regime where 24 something other than price is important, and they have 25 to do that unilaterally, which increases inefficiencies.
33
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, Your Honor, I would 2 suggest that, first of all, eliminating the per se rule 3 would not decrease the inefficiencies of the Colgate 4 doctrine. If they want to impose resale price 5 maintenance in order to avoid even a rule of reasoned 6 approach, they would have to go -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even with the tremendous 8 anomaly that the employer -- that the -- the 9 manufacturer cannot do this by agreement, but he can do 10 it just unilaterally and terminate any dealers that 11 won't go along? Those two are substitute of each other. 12 Colgate seems to say you can achieve the same end but 13 we're not going to let you do it by agreement, you have 14 to do it on your own, and then you have to do the 15 draconian thing of terminating the dealer. 16 MR. COYKENDALL: I believe that anomaly 17 really lies at the heart of the Sherman Antitrust Act 18 which is aimed at contracts, combinations and 19 conspiracies. Unilateral conduct isn't reached by that, 20 it's the price of being in a fair country. People can 21 deal in ways that they want to with this particular 22 issue. 23 But again, eliminating the per se rule will 24 not help Ping out if they want to maintain their retail 25 price maintenance as legal, as unilateral. They'll
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 still have to go through these same machinations. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? Why 3 can't -- eliminating the rule, I thought the whole point 4 was they would just put in their contracts, you have to 5 sell it at this price, and they could enforce the 6 contracts, rather than having to have these machinations 7 of making sure they don't do anything that looks like an 8 agreement with their retailers. 9 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, again, then they 10 would be subject to a rule of reason analysis and the 11 uncertainties occasioned with that as to whether this 12 contract is lawful. If they want to avoid that, then of 13 course, they would have to stick with the Colgate 14 doctrine. 15 Your Honor, this particular case, we have 16 clear evidence that RPM was used to facilitate a 17 horizontal retailer cartel. We have evidence in the 18 briefs that Leegin would gather its dealers in a dealer 19 meeting, discuss the policy, agree to changes, and reach 20 a consensus, and then enforce that policy against 21 everyone. 22 One of the evils of resale price maintenance 23 is specifically this: It does facilitate the formation 24 of cartels. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but the conspiracy
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that it facilitated was just with intrabrand 2 competition. There wasn't conspiracy that affected 3 interbrand competition. 4 MR. COYKENDALL: Retail -5 JUSTICE STEVENS: So I'm not sure that 6 economically it makes any difference whether the dealers 7 are the one who decide to do it or the manufacturer was, 8 or they all did it at the same time. 9 MR. COYKENDALL: Horizontal conspiracies, 10 even among a single brand, has always been a per se 11 violation of the antitrust law. You can look back at 12 the -13 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if we say the rule 14 or reason should apply to all cases that just affect 15 intrabrand competition, I'm not sure why we should keep 16 this outmoded rule about horizontal conspiracies that 17 only affect intrabrand competition. 18 MR. COYKENDALL: There you're striking 19 really at the heart of the -- the heart of the Sherman 20 Act, et al., holding that horizontal conspiracies, which 21 nobody believes promote competition, could be justified 22 under the same thinking. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it's a totally -- I 24 cannot imagine why a horizontal conspiracy among dealers 25 could ever produce consumer welfare. It will be a
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 horizontal conspiracy to get more money out of the 2 consumer; but whereas the manufacturer who wants to 3 impose resale price maintenance, his interest isn't to 4 give the retailer as much -- more money than the 5 retailer is now making. He's going to try to keep their 6 margin just as low as it ever was, so that he can sell 7 as many of his products as possible consistent with his 8 desire to sell his product by attaching to it more 9 service, better warranty, more showrooms, whatever. 10 You know, horizontal conspiracy, the 11 incentives are entirely different. When you're dealing 12 with a manufacturer, it seems to me his incentive is 13 still to keep the price as low as possible consistent 14 with the additional good that he wants to give consumers 15 to attract those consumers to his product. 16 MR. COYKENDALL: In this particular case 17 there is a complete alignment of incentives, because the 18 manufacturer was also a retailer competing in this 19 market. He has the incentive to increase retailer 20 profits. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if that's the case 22 and if that makes a difference, the rule of reason would 23 allow you to make that argument. But you -- but you 24 want to say it's bad across the board for everybody. If 25 indeed there's something peculiar about this case, the
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 rule of reason would allow you to argue that. 2 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, Your Honor, we would 3 suggest that the horizontal conspiracy between Leegin as 4 a retailer and the other retailers offering his products 5 is more than just a rule of reason approach. That would 6 be per se illegal under this Court's precedents. 7 Retail price maintenance also has the 8 problem we discussed earlier of perpetuating incumbent 9 forms of distribution at the expense of the innovative 10 and more efficient distribution means. Retailers, in 11 retail competition matters, retailers should be entitled 12 to innovate, pass efficiencies along to customers in the 13 form of lower prices, attract new customers, and grow in 14 that manner. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Coykendall, the -- on 16 the question -- you alleged in the complaint that there 17 was some discounting allowed by, how do you pronounce 18 it, Leegin? 19 MR. COYKENDALL: Leegin. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Leegin. And Mr. Olson 21 says that that wasn't pursued at trial; is that correct? 22 MR. COYKENDALL: That particular aspect was 23 referred to; it wasn't pursued as a separate part of 24 this. Prior to trial, the judge did rule that the 25 Dr. Miles line of cases applied and the conduct would be
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 judged under the per se rule. So certain aspects with 2 respect to the horizontal conspiracy and the differences 3 in discounts -- I mean, developed that much. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose you were to lose, 5 you would still have that claim, I take it? 6 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, yes. We would 7 suggest the record is sufficient that on remand the 8 instruction given the jury as to the standard by which 9 their conduct could be judged could be sustained as a 10 per se violation under the rules related to horizontal 11 conspiracies as well. And again, I would suggest that 12 perhaps if the Court doesn't reach that, it should 13 remand to the Fifth Circuit for them to consider whether 14 that is a possibility. 15 Resale price maintenance can distort 16 consumer choice. The retailers -- so the person comes 17 into the store -- the retailers can exercise pressure to 18 influence the selection of higher margin products over 19 ones that may better fit the consumer needs. That is an 20 evil of resale price maintenance, whether or not it does 21 promote efficiencies. 22 And if resale price maintenance does act as 23 it is theorized, to increase retailer services, some 24 consumers will be worse off, they'll be paying for 25 services they don't want.

1 There are alternatives to RPM. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't suppose there's any 3 -- I don't suppose there's any way to protect against 4 the fallout to the consumer, is there? I mean if 5 indeed, if indeed a store presses on a consumer a 6 product that's more expensive than what he needs or -7 and what he wants, is this a real argument against this, 8 that there's some stupid consumers whose can be conned? 9 I mean, whatever rule we adopt, that's going to be the 10 situation. 11 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, if -- what you're 12 doing is you're building in this high margin that gives 13 the retailer an incentive to do that. If there is no 14 resale price maintenance so that margin isn't 15 guaranteed, the incentive disappears. What is clear is 16 that retail -- resale price maintenance is a blunt 17 instrument to achieve any economies. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're assuming that the -19 that the retailer has a higher margin on the resale 20 price good. Why do you assume that? 21 MR. COYKENDALL: That's the only incentive, 22 the only reason for imposing resale prices 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's only going to be given 24 the thing if he does the kind of additional service that 25 the manufacturer wants. That's the whole purpose of it.
40

1 And the manufacturer is going to try to keep his margin 2 just as low as he can consistent with the -- you know -3 consistent with selling as many products as he can. 4 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, there are more 5 efficient ways than RPM to achieve any benefits of 6 efficiency, such as contracts with the retailers to 7 provide those additional demand creating services. He 8 could pay the retailers to provide those services. He 9 could provide those services directly, I would suggest. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would you argue 11 that those are more efficient than resale price 12 maintenance? 13 MR. COYKENDALL: The resale price 14 maintenance amounts to nothing more than throwing money 15 at the problem. You're guaranteeing a margin and you're 16 hoping that it's going to be used somehow for the 17 consumer's benefit, and you've got no guarantee that any 18 dealer is going to use the margin that they're 19 guaranteed in any way to service the consumers. 20 And I would suggest that in geographically 21 isolated areas -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you can add 23 the contractual provisions you were talking about to a 24 contract that has a minimum resale price. The minimum 25 resale price is to take away the incentive from the
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 retailer not to carry through on the non-price aspects. 2 MR. COYKENDALL: If you have a contract 3 requiring those services, you don't need the minimum 4 resale price. That's just completely unnecessary. And 5 that would prohibit the efficient dealer from passing on 6 those efficiencies to its consumers. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does that presume a 8 contract in which the retailer has a separate charge for 9 the service? 10 MR. COYKENDALL: It could be. It may not. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If not, I don't see how 12 that would work under your rule. 13 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, under -- the idea is 14 the manufacturer chooses to deal with only those dealers 15 that offer this particular service. They sign a 16 contract to provide that service. If they don't want to 17 provide that service, they don't sign the contract, 18 these don't get the goods. It's as simple as that. 19 If the question is providing a larger margin 20 to the dealer, the most efficient way is for the 21 manufacturer simply to lower their wholesale price, and 22 the margin the dealer receives is higher. 23 Again, if there are other efficiencies, they 24 might be achieved by exclusive territories as permitted 25 by Sylvania or by the Colgate doctrine.

COYKENDALL: Your Honor, as this Court 11 observed in Sylvania, Congress by repealing the 12 Miller-Tydings McGuire Act did indicate its support for 13 the per se rule.

UNDERWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 21 it please the Court: 22 When a manufacturer agrees with its 23 retailers to fix a minimum resale price, the whole point 24 of the agreement is to prevent price competition among 25 retailers, to prevent discounts. For almost 100 years
43

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the Court has interpreted Section 1 of the Sherman Act 2 to prohibit such price fixing agreements. Any change in 3 that fundamental understanding of the statute should be 4 made by Congress and not by this Court. 5 The per se rule against resale price 6 maintenance is different in at least three ways from 7 other antitrust rules that this Court has overturned. 8 First, unlike the other rules, it alone has been settled 9 law for a century, reaffirmed over and over again by 10 this Court. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's also been 12 settled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that 13 manufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more 14 inefficiently. Doesn't it make sense to allow them to 15 adopt the most efficient means to an end that is already 16 completely legal? 17 MS. UNDERWOOD: No. That tension that you 18 -- that supposed anomaly that you described is simply a 19 result of the fact that the antitrust rule -- law does 20 not prohibit all anticompetitive behavior. It prohibits 21 agreements that are anti -- that restrain competition. 22 And so it will often be the case that it is 23 possible for somebody unilaterally to do something that 24 has the same effect as an agreement, or approximately 25 the same effect, as the antitrust law simply draws that
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 line because of a different value, a value in preserving 2 the independent action of individuals. 3 It is, however -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's often the 5 case. Give me some other examples where you can achieve 6 the same industry-wide effect unilaterally. 7 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, as you have observed, 8 virtually any vertical restriction could be accomplished 9 by having the manufacturer integrate the retailing 10 function and become one entity instead of two entities. 11 Then the possibility of conspiracy or agreement is 12 eliminated and the manufacturer, if he simply integrates 13 the whole function, is -- can fix prices, fix his, what 14 are in effect his own prices and be outside the reach of 15 the antitrust laws. There are other reasons why a 16 manufacturer might not find it convenient to do that 17 integration, but it is certainly possible by ceasing to 18 be multiple entities and to become one entity to avoid 19 the prohibitions of the antitrust law. 20 It is also -- so, this is old and well 21 settled. Unlike the Schwinn rule against territorial 22 restraints which was overturned only 10 years after it 23 was established, or the Albrecht rule against maximum 24 resale price maintenance which was overturned 29 years 25 after it was established, this has a much more settled

UNDERWOOD: They were relying -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: They left the situation 13 where it was, which is that the antitrust law is as 14 determined by this Court, and we had shown our 15 willingness to update the antitrust law when sound 16 economic doctrine suggests is necessary. 17 MS. UNDERWOOD: No. The legislative history 18 described in some detail in the Antitrust Institute's 19 brief shows that actually they were returning the law to 20 the per se rule against resale price maintenance because 21 they thought resale price maintenance was bad and should 22 be prohibited. 23 This is -- it is also true that -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But of course, they 25 could always pass a law saying that if their intent is

UNDERWOOD: That's true, they did not do 3 that here and I'm not suggesting that they did, only 4 that, uniquely among the rules that this Court has 5 established in the antitrust area, this rule has 6 received the repeated attention of Congress; and so the 7 Court's deference to Congress and reluctance to overturn 8 the rule should be at its peek as compared with those 9 other rules. 10 And third, price is different. This Court 11 has said that price competition is the central nervous 12 system of the economy. Other restraints, to be sure, 13 might indirectly affect price, but not with the same 14 absolute force. Territorial restraints don't absolutely 15 prevent price competition because customers can travel 16 or order by phone, mail, or Internet, and indeed under 17 territorial restraints there are often multiple 18 retailers in a particular territory who can compete. 19 Maximum price maintenance doesn't prevent competition at 20 all unless, as the Court noted in Khan, it's really 21 Minimum resale price maintenance in disguise, in which 22 case the Court in Khan said it's illegal. 23 Manufacturers can of course pay retailers 24 for the services that enhance the product that are being 25 advanced as the pro-competition benefit of resale price

1 maintenance. But the question for this Court is whether 2 the manufacturer should be allowed to use a price-fixing 3 agreement to make that payment to buy those services, 4 and that's not a question of fact for a jury to decide 5 in a rule of reason trial. That's a question of 6 statutory interpretation for this Court. It's a 7 question really of what kind of currency a manufacturer 8 can use to buy those retailer services. 9 It's also true that the claim that 10 price-fixing works to induce those services is both 11 debatable and untested. The retailers have no 12 obligations to provide services under the retail price 13 maintenance agreement at issue in this case and in other 14 cases. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they could. I 16 mean, you could easily write the agreement saying you 17 have to charge this much and because you have to charge 18 this much you also have to provide the training, the 19 service, whatever the non-price inducements are. 20 MS. UNDERWOOD: You could. You could also 21 require those things without resale price maintenance 22 and then the retailer would be free to decide to raise 23 the price to pay for that or to provide it so 24 efficiently that he could in effect engage -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then the

1 retailer, but then the retailer might have a real 2 incentive not to do a good job on the service because 3 they really want to market it for price, not for 4 service. 5 MS. UNDERWOOD: That really depends, doesn't 6 it, on what the consumers in the market want, and if 7 it's correct, if the manufacturer -- if the claim on 8 behalf of the manufacturer here is correct that what the 9 customers want is service, the retailers are in at least 10 as good a position to identify that fact as not. 11 I think the point -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there you 13 have the free rider problem, which is you go to the 14 fancy show room, you figure out what you want, and then 15 you buy it at the discount store. 16 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. That's at its peak, 17 perhaps, when you're talking about electronics. When 18 the shopping experience alone is what is thought to be 19 the benefit, which is often the case, you can't free 20 ride on that. You either shop in the place where you 21 like to shop or you shop -- or you have a different 22 shopping experience in Target. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: But some manufacturers want 24 their product associated with excellent service, high 25 warranty, and all of that. And there is no way to get
49

1 that uniformly for that product without this kind 2 of agreement. 3 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, there is. The 4 manufacturer can contract for it. The manufacturer can 5 decline to deal with people who don't provide it. The 6 very same point that was being made earlier. 7 I think that the point here is that 8 permitting resale price maintenance would be such a 9 drastic change in the longstanding settled 10 interpretation of the Sherman Act that it doesn't really 11 qualify as the kind of common law evolution that this 12 Court has said is appropriate ordinarily in making 13 antitrust rules under the Sherman Act. If that change 14 is to be made at all, it should be made by Congress and 15 not by this Court. 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct on the 17 congressional point that there was a period when 18 Congress would have prohibited the Solicitor General 19 from making the argument he made today? 20 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, there was such a 21 period. And this Court noted that fact in -22 JUSTICE STEVENS: So there was a legislative 23 expression of a position on this particular issue? 24 MS. UNDERWOOD: There was a legislative 25 expression of position on this particular issue.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that no longer 2 is applicable? 3 MS. UNDERWOOD: That is -- the Solicitor 4 General is no longer barred from making that argument, 5 as is evidenced today. What he -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess Congress changed 7 its mind then. 8 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, I think Congress found 9 it unnecessary or perhaps questioned the wisdom or 10 constitutionality of barring the Solicitor General from 11 making particular arguments. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I find it hard to believe 13 that. 14 (Laughter.) 15 MS. UNDERWOOD: But Congress has 16 consistently -- well, and the repeal -- the reason the 17 repeal of the Miller-Tydings Act seems particularly 18 relevant is that it is indeed -- it was an amendment to 19 this statute that this Court is being asked to 20 interpret, so it sheds some light on the on the meaning 21 of this statute as it stands. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As Mr. Olson pointed out, 23 under the fair trade laws this was per se legal. So 24 that's kind of a different thing. 25 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. But when Congress
51
Alderson Reporting Company

1 repealed that, there were considerable -- there was 2 considerable expression of legislative history, for 3 those who find legislative history helpful, that 4 declared opposition to resale price maintenance, not 5 simply that it was sometimes helpful and sometimes 6 hurtful. So to the extent Congress's intent can be 7 gleaned from that legislative history, it was an intent 8 to return to the regime of per se illegality. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe on the year by 10 year, don't spend any money on, maybe Congress decided 11 that wasn't an appropriate technique, but Congress has 12 used that after, hasn't it, in other cases? 13 MS. UNDERWOOD: It has, but I would question 14 the wisdom of that technique as a method of expressing 15 Congress's views. The fact that Congress went so far as 16 to use it once suggests a very strong view indeed. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 18 Ms. Underwood. 19 Mr. Olson, you have 3 minutes remaining. 20 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 21 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 22 MR. OLSON: The Respondent and its amici 23 seem to recognize that what this Court said in State Oil 24 versus Khan, that a vertical restraint imposed by a 25 single manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand 2 competition and, by the way, it enhances intrabrand 3 competition on matters of service and availability and 4 other things in addition to price. The Respondent and 5 their amici seem to have acknowledged these 6 pro-competitive factors but say you should do it by a 7 contract with 5,000 different retailers, which you then 8 have to go out and enforce, or you have to do it under a 9 Colgate system, which the Ping brief demonstrates it's a 10 blunt instrument, it requires terminating retailers with 11 which you had a relationship for years, it prohibits 12 even talking to the loyal retailers to fix small 13 problems. 14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you're just giving 15 them an additional ground for termination. 16 MR. OLSON: Pardon me? 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're just giving, you're 18 just suggesting we should give them an additional ground 19 for termination. 20 MR. OLSON: No. What we're suggesting is 21 that the agreement is something, the details can be 22 worked out. The manufacturer can -- and the Ping brief 23 explains this. The manufacturer can go to the retailer 24 and say: Look, maybe you didn't get it right, your 25 sales person said the wrong thing; let's fix it, because

1 we want to be dealing together. The antitrust laws -2 in other word, what the Respondent and its amici want or 3 they suggest forward integration, so you just acquire 4 all your retailers. 5 The benefits of these type of arrangements 6 provide the consumers with choices. It stimulates 7 interbrand competition. It promotes intrabrand 8 competition on things other than price. It provides 9 consumers with more choices. It ultimately gives more 10 freedom to the manufacturer to stimulate the sale of its 11 products, to enter the marketplace. 12 These are things that the Court has said, 13 and provides a more varied market price. The court has 14 repeatedly raid that the presumptive rule is a rule of 15 reason. Per se rules should be crossed out or not 16 adopted unless they're dealing with a practice which is 17 invariably anticompetitive. This practice, as 18 acknowledged, is procompetitive. It provides many 19 opportunities, and it is irrational for vertical 20 restrictions to exist in this world in the non-price 21 area or the maximum price area as subject to the rule of 22 reason and the minimum retail price maintenance under a 23 rigid per se rule that cannot be changed. 24 And as this Court has repeatedly held, 25 Congress intended by the use of restraint of trade and
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the unreasonable restraint of trade for this court to 2 continue to breathe life into the restrictions of the 3 antitrust laws in the benefit of the consumer and in the 4 benefit of competition, eliminating rigid per se rules 5 which make it unlawful for a manufacturer to do 6 something that's rational in the marketplace, to give 7 consumer choices, or to do it in some indirect way that 8 is a lawyer's dream and an entrepreneur's nightmare 9 makes no sense at all. 10 For all those reasons, the rule of reason in 11 this area, as in the other areas, should replace the 12 per se rule which is rigid and anticompetitive at the 13 end of the day. 14 Thank you. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 16 Mr. Olson. 17 The case is submitted. 18 (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., The case in the 19 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 20 21 22 23 24 25
