1 PROCEEDINGS

2 (11:07 a.m.)

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 next in Domino's Pizza v. McDonald.

5 Ms. Mahoney.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8 MS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 The complaint in this case actually alleges

11 that Domino's breached its obligations under a contract

12 with JWM. It does not allege that any of the terms of

13 McDonald's own contracts were violated.

14 The Ninth Circuit, nevertheless, held that

15 Mr. McDonald could recover damages so long as he could

16 show that he had suffered some distinct injury arising

17 out of the violation of the contract between his

18 company and Domino's.

19 We -- we ask this Court to reverse that

20 holding for two principal reasons.

21 First, Mr. McDonald did not hold any rights

22 under the contracts between his company JWM and

23 Domino's, and that's disqualifying under section 1981.

24 Second, the injuries that he alleges are

25 simply too indirect to be cognizable under an implied

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 right of action. This Court, even in the context of

2 express rights of action, whether RICO or the Clayton

3 Act, has looked to the background principles of the

4 common law to define the scope of a damage recovery.

5 And these kinds of injuries, which are really the

6 classic form of derivative injury, have never been

7 recoverable.

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can -- can you tell me, Ms.

9 Mahoney, just in -- in a case where the person is

10 directly implicated -- he was the one discriminated

11 against. He obtains in a suit the damages for the loss

12 of the profits in the contract. What are the other

13 damages? Does he get emotional distress?

14 MS. MAHONEY: If -- if he's -- yes, you can

15 get emotional distressed under section 1981, and --

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: If -- if you're

17 contracting for yourself --

18 MS. MAHONEY: That's correct.

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in your own behalf.

20 MS. MAHONEY: Absolutely. There is no

21 standalone cause of action under Federal law simply for

22 emotional distress that is suffered as a result of

23 racially discriminatory conduct. Presumably Congress,

24 you know, might do that some day, but it has not done

25 so. And in fact, even under title VII, racially

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 disparaging comments can cause distress to a worker and

2 they're still not actionable unless it rises to the

3 level of a hostile work environment.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what was the

5 plaintiff's -- it wasn't here. What kind of damages

6 was he asking for?

7 MS. MAHONEY: He is asking -- it's -- it's --

8 the complaint is a little unclear, but he's asking for

9 losses that arise out of the company's failure to have

10 revenues that would have passed through the company to

11 him in either his capacity as a shareholder or possibly

12 as an employee. In fact, it's important to stress how

13 indirect these injuries really are. The gravamen --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought they were --

15 they were essentially, as I guess you said a moment

16 ago, emotional distress kinds of injuries because

17 otherwise he'd be claiming a double recovery. So he

18 doesn't do that because they -- they settled the

19 contract case with the corporation for what? $46,000?

20 MS. MAHONEY: $45,000, Your Honor.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so that the only thing

22 he -- he's not claiming an economic injury, as I

23 understand it, or am I wrong?

24 MS. MAHONEY: I think you're wrong, Your

25 Honor. He actually in his complaint asked for economic

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 damages. He doesn't specify them, but in an affidavit

2 that he submitted to the district court, he said that

3 his net worth had declined 8 million dollars and he is

4 saying that he --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I guess that's

6 where I went wrong. I thought those were the reasons

7 that he was claiming that he had been distressed

8 emotionally.

9 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're -- you're saying

11 he wants the --

12 MS. MAHONEY: But either way, the outcome

13 should be the same because emotional distress is not a

14 standalone claim. He has to establish that he had

15 rights to make and enforce a contract that were

16 violated, and even if he did that, he still has to show

17 that the damages that -- that were caused by Domino's

18 were sufficiently direct to be cognizable.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you have a --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what he's saying

21 is treat me as a sole proprietor. Yes, I created this

22 corporation so I can be insulated from liability, but

23 this is a one-person show and so I am bringing a 1981

24 claim and say forget the corporation. I'm the only

25 human that's involved in this activity.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think there's a

2 couple of problems with that. I mean, first of all,

3 these were contracts where Domino's had rights under

4 these contracts as well, and if it had sued Mr.

5 McDonald under the terms of the contract for failing to

6 perform, he would have rightly said, that's not my

7 contract.

8 And I don't think that we can think that

9 Congress intended this Court to simply disregard those

10 principles that have always governed where you -- if

11 you take the benefits of avoiding liability, you can't

12 turn around and say, well, now that it's time to

13 recover against Domino's, it is my contract. That's

14 not the way the law works. He can't disown the -- the

15 force of the law when he's taken the benefits of the

16 law.

17 And now, the burden here is really a moderate

18 one. It's one that says that the recovery that is owed

19 will come through the corporate entity. He will get

20 whatever his share of that is through the -- the

21 corporate processes, and he won't be able to have an

22 independent claim for emotional distress. But --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if you

24 have a case where a company says we are not going to

25 deal with any companies that have an African American

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 as the CEO? Couldn't that CEO, the individual, claim

2 that that policy interferes with his ability to make

3 contracts with his company to be the CEO?

4 MS. MAHONEY: Well --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And shouldn't he then

6 have a right to bring a claim under section 1981?

7 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, if his company

8 fired him because he couldn't make contracts -- in

9 other words, they said, we -- we don't want you to be

10 our CEO. We don't want a black CEO because, after all,

11 we're going to lose business with these other companies

12 -- then I think under an interference theory, that he

13 probably could sue under 1981, sue both his company and

14 also the third party that induced the interference.

15 If we look to common law principles, the

16 common law of tortious interference established various

17 rules that were designed to provide recovery for

18 interference when the causation was sufficiently

19 direct, and the common law says -- this is section 766

20 of the Restatement and cases that follow that -- that,

21 in essence, if the third party -- or if the defendant

22 induces the breach, essentially, you know, tells them,

23 this is how we want it done, we want you to fire so and

24 so if you want our business, if they induce the breach

25 or induce the violation, then they can be liable as

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 well.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that McDonald had

3 had a contract with the corporation that he gets 80

4 percent of the gross from every contract. Could he

5 then sue?

6 MS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor. There are two

7 different things. I mean, one -- one part of it is

8 that here his -- he doesn't say that his contract

9 wasn't performed, but he also would have to show that

10 Domino's was the direct cause of his loss. And the

11 common law, under section 766, for instance, says,

12 look, if a -- if a third party or if the defendant just

13 made it more difficult for your employer to perform or

14 for your company to meet its obligations, its

15 contractual obligations, by causing it to have less

16 money, that doesn't count. That's not inducing a

17 breach.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but in this

19 case, it's pretty obvious they didn't care about the

20 corporation. They cared about him. He was the target.

21 MS. MAHONEY: Well, he may have been the

22 reason for the discrimination, but the target, in terms

23 of the direct victim of the conduct that is alleged,

24 was clearly JWM. It's JWM whose contracts were

25 supposedly breached.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And -- and the point is, Your Honor, the --

2 the law has made it clear that simply breaching a

3 contract in a manner that makes it more difficult for

4 somebody else to perform is not a sufficiently direct

5 cause of the -- of the failure to perform all of the

6 succeeding downstream contracts. Otherwise, the -- the

7 rules of privity would simply be eroded. And so instead,

8 it's a very narrow category of cases where a breach of

9 contract can be viewed as the direct cause of another

10 party's failure to perform a separate contract with the

11 plaintiff.

12 And let me give you an example, just to -- to

13 show what it's talking about. If, for instance, there

14 is a contract where I am the defendant and I have the

15 right to approve an assignment, and the plaintiff has a

16 contract with a third party and I refuse to approve

17 that assignment. Then I have retained the legal

18 control under the terms of my contract as to whether

19 the plaintiff's contract can be performed or not. And

20 in that circumstance, if -- if I deny approval on the

21 basis of race, I have made it literally impossible for

22 the other parties to perform.

23 And that's the -- the narrow exception. It's

24 either inducing the breach, inducing the breach of a

25 contract, or it's making it literally impossible, but

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 not simply making it more expensive or more difficult.

2 And -- and I think it's important to

3 emphasize why these rules were developed under the

4 common law this way. In -- in part, it is to protect

5 the very reasonable and legitimate interests of -- of

6 innocent third parties. In -- in -- take the corporate

7 context. If General Motors has a dispute with a major

8 customer, and imagine that there is some sense that

9 that -- that the customer may have breached its

10 contracts because it -- it thought GM's work force had

11 too many black faces, GM has got to figure out what to

12 do about that. It's not going to capitulate and fire

13 its work force, but it has to decide whether it wants

14 to settle, whether it wants to litigate. It may

15 litigate and then want to settle. But that's its

16 claim, its contract claim, and it has to have the

17 freedom to figure out how it ought to be settled.

18 If every black employee at GM could file an

19 action under section 1981 for emotional distress or for

20 wage increases that they might not have gotten because

21 GM lost this big piece of business, then GM would lose

22 the ability to control the settlement of its own claim.

23 And so -- and it's an innocent party in this fact

24 pattern.

25 So the law has been designed under -- under

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the common law to make sure that everybody's interests

2 are sufficiently protected.

3 And what the Ninth Circuit's, you know,

4 ruling does here and what the plaintiffs are really

5 asking for is to just blow through all of those rules

6 that -- that have been designed to -- to make sense out

7 of contracts -- contract laws and still allow some room

8 for tortious interference sorts of principles. And

9 under -- under the Court's cases, I don't think there

10 is any basis to think that Congress intended the Court

11 to create an implied right of action that is completely

12 divorced from the common law principles that would have

13 foreclosed these kinds of remedies.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any --

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say there is or --

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- are there any cases

17 where we pierced the corporate veil in order to help

18 the shareholder?

19 MS. MAHONEY: Not that I know of, Your Honor.

20 And I --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is kind of an inverse

22 --

23 MS. MAHONEY: Yes, inverse -- reverse

24 piercing.

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- corporate veil piercing.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. MAHONEY: Not that I know of, and I don't

2 -- and I -- I think if you did that, would you do it

3 for employees too? Can all the employees sue? I mean,

4 where -- where does it stop? Can -- if Domino's

5 violated a term of a contract because it was -- it

6 wanted to cause economic loss to the employee of a

7 subcontractor, can -- can he then sue?

8 I mean, looking at the theory of damage in

9 this case shows just how indirect it is. If you look

10 at paragraphs 24 through 27 of the complaint, the sole

11 theory of harm here is that Domino's had an obligation

12 to provide a letter to -- to JWM, certifying that JWM

13 wasn't in breach of any terms of the lease, and that it

14 refused to provide that letter, and when it did so, the

15 bank denied some financing on a project, and then that

16 caused JWM not to have money to invest in other

17 projects. And so then it didn't have enough money to

18 pay its creditors, and so then it went into -- had to

19 declare Chapter XI bankruptcy. And then McDonald

20 didn't get as much money from the corporation as he

21 otherwise would have.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: There are two separate

23 arguments here, and I'm trying to separate them. I

24 guess that many States have a doctrine in two areas of

25 law. Third party beneficiaries can sometimes recover;

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 sometimes they can't. Victims of efforts to interfere

2 with a contract sometimes recover; sometimes they

3 can't. And one question is whether this particular

4 individual fits within those doctrines. And you have

5 to be an expert on contract law to know.

6 But in respect to the civil rights law, I

7 guess your position is -- and this is what I want to

8 know -- that whatever those doctrines are, they have to

9 be the same for white people as for black people.

10 MS. MAHONEY: I think the language of the

11 statute says that it's protecting the -- the right of

12 all -- the same right to make and enforce --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. So -- so it might apply.

14 And one thing you couldn't do if you're a State is have a

15 different rule for black people that treated them worse

16 than white people.

17 MS. MAHONEY: I think that's correct, Your

18 Honor, but --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And has there

20 ever been a case in respect, whether it's affirmative

21 action or some other thing, that interprets that --

22 that -- this particular civil rights statute to say

23 that for whatever historical reasons, et cetera, black

24 people are entitled to more protection under contract

25 law than white?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. MAHONEY: Not that I can think of, Your

2 Honor. And I think the language of this statute,

3 though -- I mean, certainly though -- of course, the

4 Court in McDonald did interpret this statute to -- to

5 also protect white person -- white -- white people,

6 people of all color, despite the language that says,

7 you know, rights the same as -- as whites. But --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do corporations have a

9 color?

10 MS. MAHONEY: No, they don't, Your Honor, but

11 all of the courts of appeals have, in effect, imputed

12 race to corporations under circumstances where their --

13 their contractual rights have been violated because of

14 the race of their shareholders or employees. And that

15 has been well-settled, at least in the courts of

16 appeals.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: So how do we deal with this?

18 That is to say, do I have to become an expert on

19 contract law, or do I say to the Ninth Circuit or the

20 circuit, look, the -- the question here is not what the

21 contract law is except insofar as it's relevant to

22 whether there's a differential in treatment?

23 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't

24 think you have to be an expert on contract law. I

25 think that this Court already held in Patterson, for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 instance, that section 1981 was designed to have its

2 own Federal content, but that when we look at the term,

3 the right to make and enforce contracts, certainly we

4 have to interpret that in light of common law rules.

5 And under the common law of contracts, only parties and

6 third party beneficiaries have -- hold rights under

7 those contracts.

8 Under section 302 of the Restatement, it

9 defines who a third party beneficiary is, and I think

10 that's a good starting place. It shows us that

11 children, you know, as in this Court's case in Runyon,

12 are third party beneficiaries. Union members are third

13 party beneficiaries of collective bargaining agreements

14 under that -- under the comments in the Restatement.

15 But the plaintiff acknowledges that the shareholders

16 and employees are not intended third party

17 beneficiaries of the contract.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe not --

19 maybe not shareholders in general, but what if you have

20 a situation, like here, where you're dealing with sole

21 shareholders? Why is that a real stretch to say that

22 that person is a third party beneficiary of the

23 contracts of his corporation?

24 MS. MAHONEY: Well, the -- for two reasons.

25 First, the contract has to actually identify third

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 party beneficiaries. In other words, parties need to

2 agree on who the third -- on who the beneficiaries are

3 supposed to be. And here, of course, there's nothing

4 in the contracts. They haven't alleged there's

5 anything in the contracts to identify him as that.

6 And also, if -- if --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was nothing in

8 these contracts requiring anything in the way of

9 personal guarantees or anything of that sort?

10 MS. MAHONEY: I don't believe so, Your Honor.

11 It's certainly not alleged in the complaint that there

12 is a personal guarantee. And -- and I don't think so

13 because when Domino's sued JWM, it did not sue Mr.

14 McDonald. And -- and as I say, if -- if they had, I'm

15 sure Mr. McDonald would have put up his hand and said,

16 no, thank you, that's not my contract.

17 And I -- so I don't -- I think that really

18 what we are asking the Court to do is just to look at

19 the language and -- and read it in light of these well-

20 established principles because that's what Congress

21 would have intended the Court to do, and that he is not

22 a third party beneficiary. He is not a party. And so

23 the Ninth -- the rationale of the Ninth Circuit would

24 need to be reversed because that's all it relied upon.

25 And then the alternative theory --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that's exactly

2 what I'm asking. If -- if you win, this case is

3 reversed, sent back. I mean, what do -- would I tell

4 them? And why not tell them, instead of having to

5 delve into this, is, look, it's plausible here that

6 third party beneficiary doctrine might cover this

7 person? It's also plausible not. We're not experts.

8 We don't know. You figure out what the normal rule is

9 and apply that normal rule.

10 MS. MAHONEY: Well, I don't think we need to

11 do that because there's been a concession in this case

12 that Mr. McDonald is not a third party beneficiary

13 under the normal rules and is asking, instead, that the

14 Court create new rules, rights greater than third --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the other

16 part of it, which is the -- the interference with the

17 contract? Could we say the same thing there? We send

18 it back, say, look, we're not experts on this, it's a

19 matter of State law typically, and be absolutely sure,

20 please, that whatever doctrine you normally apply is

21 applied to this case too because it's plausible. He's

22 the sole shareholder. He's the sole beneficiary.

23 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I -- I -- we would

24 ask that this Court not do that for two reasons, that

25 the alternative theory of tortious interference was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 never pled. It was never argued, and the district

2 court dismissed this complaint with prejudice because

3 there was no alternative theory. They did not move for

4 leave to amend.

5 So I think this Court should say one of two

6 things about the alternative theory. Either, number

7 one, it is waived, or number two, based on the

8 arguments that have been advanced and the allegations

9 of the complaint, it could not possibly be cognizable.

10 And I -- I don't think you have to be an expert on

11 interference law in order to reach that conclusion

12 because --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying this is a

14 matter of Federal contract law, common law, Federal

15 common law, are -- or are you saying you go State by

16 State, in which case 1981 is some places it will be

17 third party beneficiary, some it won't?

18 MS. MAHONEY: I -- I think, Your Honor, that

19 in -- in the prior cases, in Patterson in particular,

20 that the Court rejected the idea that it ought to be

21 the State -- the law of each State that governs the

22 scope of the rights. That argument, I believe, was

23 advanced by the Solicitor General, and this Court said,

24 no, they didn't think that was correct.

25 And similarly, in Haddle v. Garrison, which

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 is a section 1985 case, this Court looked to common

2 law. But it -- it said that it's really Federal common

3 law that controls these issues.

4 So I think it's looking just to -- to State

5 law principles to inform what Congress may have had in

6 mind when it -- it allowed for persons to recover for

7 violations of the rights to make and enforce contracts.

8 Here --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is it State law

10 today or State law back when section 1981 was passed?

11 MS. MAHONEY: This Court has looked to both,

12 but in Associated General -- Associated General

13 Contractors, for instance, this Court said that it's

14 not bound by the terms of common law that existed at

15 the time that the statute was adopted, and -- but

16 rather, that common law evolves, and so it's

17 appropriate to -- to look beyond that.

18 I think it bears emphasis, though, that the

19 common law of tortious interference at the time that

20 this statute was adopted in 1866 was narrower than it

21 is today. But even under the broader views of tortious

22 interference, the plaintiffs concede that they would

23 not be able to recover under those theories, and

24 instead, have said to this Court 1981 should be -- go

25 well beyond the terms of common law interference

1 principles.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in a -- in a sense

3 this is stronger than some tortious interference claims

4 because here the target is this -- this party.

5 MS. MAHONEY: That's always true in tortious

6 interference claims, Your Honor, and --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean that -- that the

8 injured party has to be the target?

9 MS. MAHONEY: Absolutely. The injured party

10 has to allege that the defendant knew about the

11 contract and specifically intended to interfere with

12 the performance of the plaintiff's contract. But,

13 nevertheless, we know of no --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: To interfere but not

15 necessarily to injure him.

16 MS. MAHONEY: And to injure. Well, to injure

17 him, to prevent his performance for -- for purposes of

18 injury, yes.

19 And, nevertheless, we are aware of no case

20 that has ever found that an employee of a company or a

21 shareholder of a company could recover under common law

22 tortious interference theory simply because it suffered

23 losses arising out of a breach of contract with its own

24 corporation that made it more difficult or more

25 expensive for the corporation to recover.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And I think it -- it is -- also bears

2 emphasis of where this theory would take the Court if

3 it were to recognize this. It would go far afield from

4 the core requirement that there not be discrimination

5 in the terms of an employment contract because this --

6 the tortious interference theory, of course, is based

7 solely on the concept that he may have had some sort of

8 implied employment agreement with JWM.

9 What this would mean then is that if -- in

10 the case of GM, if a major customer cancels a contract

11 and GM doesn't give raises to its work force, all of

12 the black workers would have causes of action because

13 of the injuries that were intended because the contract

14 was canceled on the basis of race, but their similarly

15 situated white coworkers would not. They would have

16 suffered exactly the same injury, but they would have

17 completely different rights. And that shows why this

18 derivative injury theory just doesn't fit section 1981

19 because at its core, it has to be about preventing

20 discrimination in the terms of the actual contract.

21 And here, there is no allegation that JWM

22 subjected McDonald to any discriminatory terms of

23 employment, and therefore, it is not -- or that it -- a

24 breach was induced. And therefore, it isn't the

25 paradigm case, and it would create problems down the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 road to recognize this -- this kind of theory.

2 So I don't -- I don't think that we are

3 asking the Court to do anything radical, and I think

4 the whole issue of tortious interference can be

5 avoided, if the Court would prefer, because the -- the

6 theory was unquestionably waived.

7 There are 14 paragraphs of facts in this

8 complaint laying out the factual allegations.

9 Paragraph 11 says that Mr. McDonald is the president,

10 sole shareholder, and operator of the company. Nowhere

11 in those 14 paragraphs does it say that he had an

12 employment contract with JWM.

13 Similarly, the cause of action paragraphs --

14 I believe there are 15 of them -- repeatedly identify

15 the contract between Domino's and JWM as the contract

16 at issue, the contract that was breached, the terms

17 that were violated. Nowhere does it refer to an

18 employment contract.

19 This complaint, as the district court

20 recognized, only pled one theory, and that was the

21 theory that Mr. McDonald was entitled to enforce the

22 rights of JWM. It does not plead any theory about

23 violations of his own employment contract. And as I

24 said, that -- even if -- even if you could infer it,

25 you would still have to find that it's not a cognizable

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 theory because he doesn't allege that the terms of that

2 contract were actually violated. And in fact, at page

3 45 of his brief -- or 44, he concedes that JWM did

4 perform the terms of the contract. And second, even if

5 there had been a failure of performance, he cannot show

6 that Domino's was a sufficiently direct cause of that

7 failure of performance.

8 Just -- just to give, you know, yet another

9 example, I mean, if I -- if my employer has a -- a bad

10 year this year because somebody breached a contract

11 with the employer and I don't get a bonus, I -- you

12 know, I may say I've suffered some -- some loss. The

13 value of my contract, my employment contract, may be

14 reduced, but my rights under that contract have not

15 been impaired or abrogated. I have the same rights.

16 They're just worth something less.

17 And all that this statute does is to protect

18 rights, the same rights as white people have. It

19 doesn't say that you are protected from any kind of

20 discriminatory conduct in the economy that may, in some

21 sense, make your rights less valuable.

22 I'd like to save the remainder of my time for

23 rebuttal.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

25 Mr. Lichtenstein.

1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN LICHTENSTEIN

2 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

4 it please the Court:

5 The issue here is whether, by choosing to

6 operate as a solely owned corporation, John McDonald

7 forfeited his 1981 protection.

8 Rather than federalizing State contract law,

9 section 1981 imposes a nonnegotiable nondiscrimination

10 duty that is neither a contractual provision nor

11 governed by contract law. Intentional racial

12 discrimination is not merely a breach of contract

13 terms. As this Court has already noticed -- noted, it

14 is more akin to a tort.

15 Domino's question presented asks that both

16 plaintiff and defendant had to be parties to the

17 contract. Yet, Domino's notes that non-parties without

18 privy of contract are also protected, citing third

19 party beneficiaries and the fact there were employers,

20 such as supervisory employees or prime contractors.

21 Thus, even Domino's concedes that the answer to the

22 question presented is no. Section 1981 protection is

23 not limited to parties to the contract.

24 There's still, however, the remaining

25 question of whether John McDonald fits within the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statute's protection. Clearly, if he had been a sole

2 proprietor, there would be no question of stating a

3 cause of action. We contend that he's still protected

4 based on three grounds: one, the intended language of

5 section 1981; two, John McDonald's relationship with

6 Domino's; and three, John McDonald's relationship with

7 JWM.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's take that

9 last one first, if you don't mind, since the argument

10 is that you've waived that argument by not -- not

11 raising it below.

12 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, we believe that it

13 has been sufficiently raised below. 1981 does not have

14 any special or enhanced pleading requirements. This is

15 notice --

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Where in the complaint

17 does it allege a tortious interference claim?

18 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: It doesn't allege a

19 tortious interference claim, and this really isn't a

20 tortious interference claim as petitioners suggest.

21 This is a 1981 discrimination claim, and very clearly

22 that was alleged.

23 In terms of the requirement for wages, back

24 wages and front wages, that is on -- I believe it's

25 page 17.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. The --


2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. 


3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the allegation I'm 


4 looking for -- and I -- I guess you probably didn't --

5 you didn't have to raise it below, given the state of

6 the Ninth Circuit law I would suppose. But in your

7 brief in opposition, where is it raised that this

8 interferes with the contract between you and -- between

9 McDonald and JWM?

10 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I don't think it does

11 appear there specifically. But again, the -- the

12 question was a fairly narrow one, which is what is

13 Ninth Circuit law? Does Gomez apply? And it went up

14 to the Ninth Circuit on that particular level.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But coming here, I

16 would have thought our rules say that if you're going

17 to rely on this as a ground for affirmance here, we

18 should see it in the brief in opposition.

19 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: The brief in opposition at

20 the Ninth Circuit you're referring to or --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here.

22 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: -- this brief? The

23 allegations concerning our argument about --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Brief in opposition to the

25 petition for certiorari. You -- you did not raise

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 this.

2 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: They did not raise that --

3 that does not appear there.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- it's -- it's brand new

5 to us. We -- we didn't think this was in the case at

6 all.

7 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, again, I think that

8 if the issue is whether it was raised below or should

9 be, then perhaps a remand back to flesh out that

10 particular argument would be the appropriate response.

11 I think that in terms of --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It wouldn't just be an

13 argument. You'd have to amend your complaint because

14 it wasn't set out in the complaint.

15 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: If the Court believes that

16 it more specifically needs to be set out in the

17 complaint, then clearly that would be one of the

18 remedies. We don't really believe that that is

19 necessary in a sense when dealing with the question

20 presented. Both of our arguments are really sort of

21 formulations of the same argument. The question is did

22 Domino's actions aim at John McDonald? Was he the

23 precise target? That was clearly set out, and --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Is targeted enough? I mean,

25 I'm thinking here not necessarily your case, but in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 general. Is a claim of discrimination -- I don't know

2 the state of the law, but maybe if a minority

3 shareholder -- a minority person is the sole

4 shareholder of a corporation, maybe that corporation

5 could assert protection, or maybe it couldn't.

6 But here, I take it that the corporation JWM

7 brought an action and won or settled for $45,000. So

8 they're out of it.

9 Now we're just thinking about the sole

10 shareholder, and the sole shareholder says there's

11 another action here. And as to the two most plausible

12 ones that I would like to assert an action as a third

13 party beneficiary, we've heard the other side say that

14 you've conceded you have no right there. And as to the

15 other one, which might be protected in many cases, that

16 the -- knowing that what was going to happen, they

17 deliberately interfered with the contractual relation

18 between me and the corporation. That's what we're

19 asking about now. And you say, well, I didn't raise

20 that.

21 Now, is there a reason you should be given an

22 opportunity to raise it?

23 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I believe that the

24 opportunity to raise that is part of the -- the same

25 argument. This isn't really a question of third party

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 beneficiary. This is an issue of --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: You conceded that out.

3 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: -- discrimination and this

4 was claimed in terms of discrimination. If in fleshing

5 this out, it was not specified in the various ways that

6 this discrimination was affected, that oversight

7 shouldn't preclude the basic argument that is really

8 the same --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

10 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Because it still is

11 responsive to the question presented, which is, is the

12 privity issue one that precludes recovery from John

13 McDonald? And that seems to be the same issue,

14 regardless -- regardless of how it's formulated. And

15 the answer to that question I think is -- is clearly no

16 in terms of the tort -- tortious behavior by the -- by

17 Domino's in terms of the discrimination. It is not --

18 also, the damages that are --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I -- I thought

20 the question presented -- I didn't think. I'm reading

21 it from the petition for writ of certiorari. In the

22 absence of a contractual relationship with the

23 defendant, are allegations of personal injuries alone

24 sufficient to confer standing on a plaintiff pursuant

25 to 42 U.S.C., section 1981? So, I mean, the question

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 presented was -- was precisely if your client did not

2 have a contractual relationship, would the mere

3 allegation of personal injury, which you're now

4 alleging, be enough to confer standing?

5 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, it's -- the

6 allegation of both -- well, discrimination is a

7 personal injury. In Goodman, this Court has said that

8 violation of section 1981 is a personal injury. It's

9 not a contract injury. So the question presented --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the question is -- I

11 mean, that begs the question, whether there has been a

12 violation of section 1981, and the argument here is

13 that there's no violation of section 1981 unless you're

14 interfering with a contract of the plaintiff.

15 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: And the response of the --

16 of the respondent is it is not simply your own contract

17 or your contract with the defendant that is subject to

18 1981 protection. There are several instances -- and

19 we've cited them in our brief -- such as Shaare Tefila

20 and Runyon -- where the actual target of the

21 discrimination is not in contractual privity with the

22 defendant. And --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you referring to

24 Runyon, for instance? The parents always had a special

25 relation to the child. It's something of a stretch to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 say that the corporation has that same relation with

2 its own shareholder.

3 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I think in this particular

4 case it isn't a stretch. The discrimination was aimed

5 at John McDonald. It was not --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: That might --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's no doubt he's the

8 target. That's the --

9 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: But, I mean, the --

10 Domino's itself viewed JWM as John McDonald. The

11 statement, we don't want to do business with you people

12 -- you people isn't anyone else other than John

13 McDonald. And the allegations go further than simply

14 back wages and even the dignitary damages which are

15 available under section 1981 but not under contract law

16 is also alleged that by going after his credit and

17 going after the banks that he had relationships with

18 and given guarantees to and going after him personally,

19 that this wasn't simply derivative of JWM's damages,

20 that he had his own separate damages that, in fact,

21 could not have been recovered by JWM had JWM filed a

22 1981 action.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any overlap?

24 The -- what damages could the corporation JWM have

25 collected under -- had it brought a 1981 suit?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: It had -- it could bring

2 the -- a suit for the damages of the lost revenue that

3 it could have gotten from its contract. We believe,

4 looking at State law, because we think it is a matter

5 of State law, that here JWM would get its net profits.

6 The wages that would be paid out would be recoverable

7 by John McDonald. Different States may look at this

8 differently, but that really wasn't the issue that this

9 case had been --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: Then the argument for

11 sending it back, if I understand it, is this, that when

12 you look at the question presented, no one could

13 possibly file a lawsuit -- and you didn't -- on the

14 theory, well, I'm hurt, so somebody should pay me.

15 That isn't a legal theory.

16 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: That is correct.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Rather, the legal theory

18 here was that this contract-related section of the law

19 is violated. And you want to say the simple fact that

20 the contract wasn't between McDonald and JWM, that's a

21 separate matter. That doesn't bar you from bringing

22 your claim. So, on the one hand, you argue that I can

23 bring my claim as long as I'm a target and the motive

24 as to why they breached some other contract, the one

25 between the two corporations.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And we seem to have it conceded that even if

2 that's too broad, there are at least some circumstances

3 where you could bring your claim. One is if you were a

4 third party beneficiary. That's not present here. And

5 the second is if you are a target such that their

6 action violates and interferes with a contract between

7 you and your own corporation. At least you have that

8 going for you. So you say, well, if I was wrong about

9 the broader theory, give me a chance to allege the

10 narrower.

11 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, I don't --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?

13 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, I don't really think

14 --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to be helpful in

16 this respect.

17 (Laughter.)

18 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I understand, and I do

19 appreciate it.

20 I don't think the broader theory, number one,

21 was if I was a target, that's all there is.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: No. You have to say there's

23 certain kind of target. The kind of target is that

24 they --

25 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Also --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- were discriminatory,

2 aiming at me, et cetera.

3 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes. I think that there

4 are circumstances, in terms of alleging particular

5 injuries and interference with the making, enforcing,

6 or performance of contract. I don't --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which you didn't allege and

8 didn't even raise in the brief in opposition here.

9 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I -- I think we alleged

10 that in terms of the ability of Mr. McDonald to perform

11 on the contract, even though it was --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those contracts --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: His contract with -- with

14 the corporation?

15 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: The --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: No.

17 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: The statute doesn't say

18 that it has to be his own contract with the defendant.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's exactly the issue.

20 And --

21 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: And that's --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that's how I

23 understood this came -- case came up here. The

24 contract you're relying on is the contract between the

25 corporation -- between the corporation and Domino's.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And can you -- can you sustain a lawsuit for the

2 violation of that contract? There was no mention of

3 any other contract. I don't know why we should send it

4 back down so you can mention a contract that you

5 haven't even thought of even when you filed the brief

6 in opposition.

7 So that's the issue, whether the violation of

8 the contract between McDonald -- between Domino's and

9 your client's corporation will allow your client to get

10 -- to get some damages inasmuch as he was the target.

11 That's how I understood the lawsuit.

12 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, that is clearly the

13 main thrust of -- of our position.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, could you tell me when

15 -- the -- the claim was settled when your client's

16 corporation was in bankruptcy. Right?

17 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I assume your client had

19 no -- nothing to say about -- about whether the

20 settlement would be -- would be accepted by the trustee

21 or not.

22 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Absolutely. He -- it was

23 out of his hands.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: It was out of his hands,

25 which means that, you know, you're -- you're sort of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 pleading the advantage of a corporation, limited

2 liability and all of that, and went through bankruptcy

3 taking that advantage, one of the consequences of which

4 was that you left it to the corporation to settle this

5 claim.

6 And now you want to disclaim the advantage of

7 a corporation and say, oh, although the -- you know,

8 the corporation settled it out -- you know, I was no

9 longer in control of it because of the bankruptcy -- I

10 want to bring the claim on my own. I mean, I can

11 understand why it would be nice for you to get that,

12 but it doesn't seem to me that you should be able to

13 play dog in the manger that way. You either -- you

14 either accept the corporate form or you don't.

15 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: The corporate form gives

16 certain protections, largely from personal

17 responsibility for corporate debt has some tax

18 advantages. It certainly is not going to protect any

19 corporate officer or shareholder from their own, for

20 example, tortious behavior.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you'd have to concede

22 at a minimum that now that the corporation has settled

23 the breach of contract claim, that to the extent that

24 the corporation could have recovered under 1981, that's

25 gone too because those two claims were intimately

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 related, and you would be precluded from bringing such

2 a claim. So to the extent that there's an overlap, you

3 face a res judicata bar.

4 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Your Honor, even if that

5 claim had not been precluded by bankruptcy -- and there

6 were two plaintiffs in this case, JWM and McDonald --

7 there certainly couldn't be double recovery. Anything

8 that would be recoverable in any form by JWM clearly

9 cannot be recovered by John McDonald as an individual.

10 And the Ninth Circuit said that. They were talking

11 about his own separate and distinct injuries. So

12 double recovery would never be possible.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So they -- the Ninth

14 Circuit's view is there are two potential plaintiffs in

15 this situation. Both can sue and one gets -- the

16 damages are not identical. That's --

17 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I'm sorry.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The shareholder can sue.

19 The sole shareholder can sue. The corporation can sue.

20 Both have 1981 claims. It's not either/or.

21 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Correct.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They both have 1981

23 claims, but the damages are different in the case of

24 the individual than in the case of the corporation.

25 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Absolutely.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just -- did the

2 individual plaintiff assert the 1981 claim at any time

3 before the settlement of the corporate claim?

4 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes, I believe that the --

5 and I would have to check on the timing of this, but I

6 believe that the suit was filed prior to the settlement

7 of the 1981 claim -- of the bankruptcy --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: I would have assumed --

9 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I'm sorry. Of the

10 bankruptcy claim.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- there wouldn't have been

12 a settlement first without taking care of the second,

13 if they had known both were on the table. But you say

14 the first had been -- both of them had been --

15 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: That is my understanding.

16 I -- I would have to really check on that, but that is

17 my understanding.

18 And again, we are looking at this particular

19 situation. We keep talking about actual target. The

20 petitioner keeps talking about derivative, incidental

21 claims. This isn't a derivative, incidental claim.

22 There is no one who has a race in this case that is

23 relevant other than John McDonald. JWM, John W.

24 McDonald, didn't get its financing, didn't get its

25 credit based on the fact that it was just created as a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 corporation. It was John McDonald.

2 Here, you have a situation where -- and

3 it's kind of a unique one -- where there's a claim that

4 John McDonald, the actual person who was being

5 discriminated against, can't recover but some other

6 entity can. That sort of turns section 1981 on its

7 head.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it was his -- it was

9 his corporation, and until he went bankrupt, any

10 recovery by that corporation would have been a recovery

11 by -- by John McDonald. What -- what created your

12 problem is the fact that -- that the corporation went

13 bankrupt.

14 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Your Honor, I don't think

15 that's the --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But, you know, that's --

17 that's one of the -- one of the consequences of taking

18 advantage of the corporate form.

19 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Your Honor, I don't think

20 that's the case because if there was, for example, this

21 two-party suit, JWM could not recover for dignitary

22 damages. Only an individual can do that.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, can you -- can you do

24 that under a general contract theory?

25 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I don't believe you can do

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it under a general contract --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're reporting not

3 merely the -- the tort of tortious interference, but

4 some general, broader concept of tort law as being

5 subsumed with -- under 1981. Aren't you?

6 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes, and I think the --

7 the case law indicates that, that this is not simply

8 just federalization of State law. This -- looking at

9 the history of section 1981, this was designed to

10 combat not tortious interference claims in common law,

11 but the black codes during Reconstruction that

12 prohibited black individuals, individuals just like

13 John McDonald, from being able to pursue their trades,

14 operate --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but the -- the

16 focus of it is, as -- as I understand it, and the --

17 the kernel of it is -- is the capacity to contract.

18 And we can certainly understand, I guess, how tortious

19 interference with contracts might come under that

20 umbrella, but you're going further and you're saying, I

21 take it, any tort that would give a recovery --

22 recognize a recovery for -- for dignitary injury would

23 be subsumed with -- within the concept of what 1981 was

24 intended to -- to cover, which is a broader

25 proposition.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I think that what we are

2 saying I think is what the Court has said -- is that

3 this is a personal injury, and that dignitary claims

4 are subsumed under 1981. I don't think it's expand --

5 I don't think --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, contract -- I -- you

7 -- you pointed out the -- the terminology which

8 includes contract damages or -- or contract harm as

9 personal harm, but it doesn't necessarily follow from

10 that that every harm or every injury that is personal

11 falls under -- conceptually under the 1981 umbrella.

12 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: No. Discrimination is a

13 personal injury. This Court said that in Burke and I

14 believe in Goodman also. So we're talking about

15 personal injury here, not just contract harm.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't -- it doesn't

17 talk about personal injury that -- that broadly. It

18 talks about the right to make and enforce contracts.

19 That's the portion of it you have to be relying upon.

20 It doesn't talk about --

21 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, it's --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- personal injury. It's

23 not a --

24 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: -- it's --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it's not a more

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 generalized tort. If want to call it a tort, it is a

2 tort that goes to your ability to make and enforce

3 contracts. I don't see anything --

4 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I believe, Your Honor --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- dignitary about that.

6 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: -- that it goes to your

7 right to not suffer discrimination within the realm of

8 making, performing, and enforcing contracts. The focus

9 is on discrimination, which is a personal injury and a

10 personal harm, and the --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying it means

12 discrimination that relates to the making and enforcing

13 of a contract with somebody else. And you're saying

14 that since the discrimination was targeted at you, even

15 though the contract was with -- was with somebody else,

16 you have a claim under this language of 1981.

17 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes, in this circumstance

18 where the contract with someone else was the mechanism

19 that was used to target an individual. And, again,

20 when you're dealing with --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but there's no way to

22 confine it to the individual, is it? I mean, the -- on

23 your -- on your target theory, a -- a general

24 discriminatory animus as a basis for breaching a

25 contract with General Motors would give a right of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 action to -- to every minority employee of General

2 Motors. Isn't that correct?

3 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: If there is a

4 circumstance, as I understand the hypothetical, where

5 there is blatant and intentional discrimination, racial

6 discrimination, by a multinational corporation like

7 General Motors, who say we're not going to do business

8 with any company that hires black people -- and clearly

9 there's an uphill battle for any kind of proof, but

10 you'd have to show that there was actual targeting,

11 that it really did interfere with the ability to

12 perform contracts, and that there were specified

13 individual damages. But if that were the case and

14 could be proven, that would be pretty egregious and

15 probably something that 1981 should cover.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but when you say

17 damages that can be proven, the only damages you -- you

18 insist upon proving is the fact that you were a target

19 and that it -- it insulted you. It -- it was -- you

20 know. That's the only damage you require. So you're

21 saying that every -- every minority employee of all of

22 the companies with whom GM, or whoever it is didn't do

23 business, would automatically have a cause of action.

24 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: No, Your Honor, I don't

25 believe we're saying that because --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. Okay. Well, then --

2 then what do they have to show? They have to show that

3 -- that their salaries were -- were reduced? But --

4 but you haven't shown that here. You didn't plead that

5 here. They have to show -- show that a contract with

6 them was breached? But you didn't plead that here and

7 you didn't show it here. So the -- the only thing that

8 -- that you -- you can answer is they would all have

9 causes of action if their -- their honorific values

10 were somehow impugned.

11 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I don't believe so, and I

12 think that what was pled and what we believe is not just

13 the wages that were not paid, but also the dignitary

14 damages and also the damages specifically aimed at John

15 McDonald in terms of ruining his credit, going to the

16 banks, and in a sense slandering him, and those kinds

17 of damages that were not recoverable by JWM but were

18 specifically John McDonald.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: That was -- that was the

20 consequence of the bankruptcy of his corporation. I

21 mean, that didn't -- didn't --

22 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: No, sir. There were

23 actually allegations of statements we are going to ruin

24 you personally and actions that went to ruin him

25 personally. This was not just simply derivative from

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the corporation.

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: But none of the ruin

3 occurred, as I understand it, until the corporation

4 went bankrupt. In other words, there was no direct --

5 the bank, for example, didn't say we're not doing any

6 more business with -- with you, McDonald. As I

7 understand it, all the -- all the -- leaving dignitary

8 harm aside, all the actual loss was -- was as a

9 consequence of the loss to the corporation. His stock

10 fell, you know, whatever. But it -- it seems all

11 derivative from the corporate loss.

12 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I don't believe so, sir.

13 And the opposition to the motion to dismiss talked very

14 specifically about the statements to the banks that

15 were specific to John McDonald that hurt John McDonald

16 individually that really was not derivative from the

17 bankruptcy --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have an action --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, can you give me an

20 example?

21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- on that in California?

22 Wouldn't you have an action in the State if somebody

23 goes and deliberately interferes with your credit and

24 so forth?

25 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, I think the action

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that Mr. McDonald took was just this, the 1981 action,

2 saying that there was a Federal violation, that this

3 was done to discriminate against him, and this seems to

4 fit in with the 1981 cause of action and the purpose of

5 1981, which is why this case was filed.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it fits, it's because

7 of some cases. So -- because this whole area, 1981,

8 didn't take off until Runyon against McCrary. So we're

9 starting with what? 1976. So to -- to flesh out what

10 that claim is, you must be relying on some decisions of

11 this Court when you talk about dignitary damages.

12 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, again, we -- I think

13 we could look at Shaare Tefila as -- as a good example

14 of the kinds of damages. This was the Nazi swastika on

15 a synagogue.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that didn't

17 go into anything. That was a two-page per curiam, and

18 it was just was there a claim. And it didn't --

19 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, the claim was still

20 -- it was certainly not because of any kind of -- of

21 privity. It was damages based on --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that was

23 about does the -- does the act cover religion or -- or

24 does it cover that situation, or is it limited to race,

25 or does anti-semitism count as race. I thought that's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 what was all that was decided.

2 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, at that time, that

3 -- it said that anti-semitism counted as race, but

4 certainly they were able to recover once that threshold

5 was met because of the dignitary harms.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't see anything

7 in the opinion about -- I just see the issue before the

8 Court was does this come under the heading race.

9 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: My reading of that was --

10 was a bit broader I think.

11 Also, you could look at cases such as

12 Sullivan where the right not to be discriminated

13 against was compensable for the black family that was

14 not allowed into the club. So the cases that we have

15 cited --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Both Sullivan and

17 Shaare Tefila, of course, though, were 1982 cases.

18 Right?

19 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Correct.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not 1981 cases.

21 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Right. But this Court has

22 said that the language is so similar that they should,

23 for these purposes, be viewed as having the same rules.

24 And clearly, it would make no sense to have -- have

25 different ones. So they were 1982 claims, but the idea

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that discrimination in terms of housing should have

2 dignitary claims while discrimination in terms of

3 contract should not is something this Court has never

4 said.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

6 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Thank you.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Mahoney, you have

8 4 minutes remaining.

9 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

10 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11 MS. MAHONEY: Thank you, Your Honor.

12 I'd like to focus on the issue of whether

13 there is any need for a remand.

14 The district court dismissed the complaint

15 with prejudice, and I think that it's fair to say that

16 at that point, the plaintiff was under an obligation to

17 seek leave to amend if it had any other alternative

18 theory that it wanted to advance in this case.

19 Otherwise, we're left with the situation where they can

20 see that dismissal with prejudice, litigate up to the

21 Ninth Circuit, and then we litigate here. We go back

22 down and we keep doing this seriatim. It would make no

23 sense. The dismissal with prejudice was proper, and

24 certainly in a 1981 case, despite liberal rules of

25 pleading, you have to identify the contract that was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 supposedly violated, as well as, you know, the other

2 elements.

3 Second, I think that if this were a harder

4 case about tortious interference principles, even if it

5 hadn't been waived, I might understand the Court's

6 reluctance to get into it. But we know from the

7 briefing that the plaintiff has conceded that his claim

8 would not be cognizable under the common law of

9 contract, third party beneficiary, or tortious

10 interference, and that is very plain from the brief at

11 pages, I think, 43 through 46 where they acknowledge

12 that under section 76 of the Restatement, they would

13 not be able to -- to recover. And they say, so what.

14 This isn't a federalized version of common law of

15 interference.

16 So given that concession, I think all this

17 Court would have to say is that the alternative theory

18 that wasn't even pled can't possibly state a claim

19 because it -- it asks us to go far beyond what the

20 common law did.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, may -- may I

22 ask you one brief question that I should have asked on

23 direct? I hope you have time for it.

24 But supposing a fact situation in which a

25 wholly owned -- a -- a corporation wholly owned by an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 African American starts to negotiate with your client,

2 and your client says, we have a policy of not dealing

3 with companies owned by African Americans. Would the

4 corporation or the individual have a lawsuit under

5 section 1981?

6 MS. MAHONEY: I think the corporation would,

7 Your Honor.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: You think the corporation

9 would.

10 MS. MAHONEY: Absolutely because they -- a

11 refusal to deal -- it covers rights to make and enforce

12 contracts, and if -- if the defendant said, I will not

13 deal with this company, then I think that they have a

14 right.

15 And in this case, there was a claim that was

16 brought by the company for -- based on -- for breach of

17 contract.

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But not under 1981.

19 MS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor, but the trustee

20 makes a finding that the -- the causation -- or reports

21 to the court that causation principles could not be

22 established, and so there was no point in bringing a

23 1981 claim because he actually found in -- in materials

24 that are in the record of the bankruptcy proceeding --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but in your view, to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the extent that racial discrimination might have

2 affected negotiations, that would be an element of the

3 corporation's claim under 1981 rather than an

4 individual claim.

5 MS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

7 MS. MAHONEY: Because if the -- if they were

8 negotiating on behalf of the company, that is the

9 company's right to contract. It is not the

10 individual's right.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you attribute the

12 shareholder's race to the corporation?

13 MS. MAHONEY: That's what the courts of

14 appeals all do. Judge Friendly in Hudson Valley

15 Freedom Theater looked at this issue and said that it

16 was the best way to approach this issue, that -- that

17 -- and explained that it doesn't make sense to impute

18 the corporation's contract rights to somebody else,

19 give them power to enforce their contract rights. And

20 it wasn't a 1981 case, but it was analogous, and that

21 it made sense to, under those circumstances, impute

22 race, in effect.

23 And I think that the way that courts have

24 done it is also a link to the word discrimination,

25 which appears in 1981(c). In -- in Jackson v.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Birmingham for the -- for instance, this Court did find

2 that a -- a male coach had been subjected to

3 discrimination on the basis of sex, even though he's

4 obviously not a woman, because it's a form of

5 discrimination. And I think the courts have looked at

6 that as well.

7 But this -- the -- the -- all of the exact

8 same issues that are alleged in this complaint were

9 already raised and litigated through depositions and

10 discovery in the bankruptcy court. And this presents

11 all of the problems that this Court addressed in

12 Associated General Contractors about why there's such a

13 strong presumption against derivative claims because

14 here you can't trace the losses. You have no idea

15 whether or not the monies that JWM would have recovered

16 from Domino's would have been used to pay other

17 creditors or used to do new projects or perhaps given

18 to -- to McDonald.

19 Thank you, Your Honor.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

21 The case is submitted.

22 (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the

23 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
