1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:40 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Case 07-11191, Briscoe v. Virginia. 5 Mr. Friedman. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 8 MR. FRIEDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 We ask the Court in this case to take no new 11 ground beyond that established just last term in the 12 Melendez-Diaz case, but the stakes of this case are 13 high. If the Court were to reverse Melendez-Diaz and 14 hold that a State may impose on the defendant the 15 burden of calling a prosecution witness to the stand, 16 it would severely impair the confrontation right and 17 threaten a fundamental transformation in the way 18 Anglo-American trials have been conducted for hundreds 19 of years. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The State court has 21 interpreted their provision to give the defendant the 22 choice of subpoenaing the witness or asking the State 23 to bring in the witness. Why is that overruling 24 Melendez-Diaz? 25 MR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, the -- the State
3 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 courts, since the time of this case -- since the time 2 that these cases were tried, raised the possibility of 3 asking the -- that the defendant could ask the witness 4 to bring -- that the defendant could ask the 5 prosecution to bring in the witness. It doesn't 6 really change anything from a straight subpoena 7 statute in any -- in either event. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how is that 9 different from a notice statute? If -10 MR. FRIEDMAN: Okay. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we take the statute 12 as the State supreme court has read it -13 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- they say: In my 15 mind, it's a notice statute; tell the prosecutor you 16 either want them to call the witness or you subpoena 17 the witness. That's what the State court has told us. 18 Whether or not you had notice of that interpretation 19 is a separate question. 20 MR. FRIEDMAN: That -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's separate out the 22 two questions. 23 MR. FRIEDMAN: Okay, fine, fine. The -- the 24 two aspects that Melendez-Diaz said were wrong with 25 the subpoena statute are both present in this statute

1 even as interpreted by the -- by the State supreme 2 court. That is, nothing in Melendez-Diaz -- I'm 3 sorry, nothing in the Magruder case -- the opinion 4 here suggests that the prosecution would bear the 5 burden of calling the witness to the stand. I think 6 the Magruder case, the decision of the State supreme 7 court is very explicit and goes in accordance -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that's our first 9 question -10 MR. FRIEDMAN: That's -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the Confrontation 12 Clause require, not just the ability to 13 cross-examine -14 MR. FRIEDMAN: That's right. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but an affirmative 16 obligation to place the witness on the stand? 17 MR. FRIEDMAN: That's correct. That's 18 correct. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just ask you one 20 -21 MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes. Sure. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would swearing the 23 witness in and saying to the witness "Is this your 24 report?" and the witness saying "Yes" -- what would be 25 unconstitutional about that, given our case law that
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 says that any prior statements by a witness are 2 admissible once the witness is on the stand or 3 constitutionally admissible once they are on the 4 stand? 5 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. Right. The cases 6 involve that were California v. Green and United 7 States v. Owens. In both cases, there were questions 8 asked of the witness about what happened. So I do 9 believe -- though it hasn't been resolved in this 10 Court, I do believe that the prosecution should go 11 beyond simply saying "Is this your" -12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. "Should" is 13 a different question than the one I asked. 14 MR. FRIEDMAN: No. I mean, I think the 15 Constitution -- I think constitutionally, the -- the 16 prosecution would be compelled at least to ask: What 17 is your recollection? Do you endorse this statement? 18 But even if that's not true -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have anything 20 historically or in any case that would suggest that 21 that is a constitutional requirement? I mean, I do 22 accept that there is plenty that says you have a right 23 to be -24 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to confront the

1 witness. 2 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what would require 4 the prosecutor to actually do more than I just 5 suggested? "Is this your statement? Is this your lab 6 report?" 7 MR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, so far as I can 8 tell, it's hardly ever been tried, for the obvious 9 reason that if all the prosecution does is say, "Is 10 this it," and not ask a further question of the 11 witness -12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not terribly 13 persuasive. I don't disagree with you. 14 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. It -- well, that's -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's a matter of trial 16 tactic, but I'm not talking about trial tactic. 17 MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes. Right. But I -- but 18 it's something that prosecutors don't try because they 19 would have to bear the -- the risk. So part of my 20 response is: Well, let them go ahead and try it if 21 they want to. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Bear what risk? 23 MR. FRIEDMAN: I'm sorry. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Bear what risk? What risk? 25 Bear what risk?

1 MR. FRIEDMAN: Bear -- bear the risk that 2 the -- that the witness has gotten on the stand and is 3 not even asked to recall. Bear the cost of putting a 4 witness on with no recollection. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he says, "Is this 6 your lab report and do you stand by it?" 7 MR. FRIEDMAN: "And do you stand by it?" -8 that's the critical point. That's going beyond the 9 hypothetical, as I understood it from Justice 10 Sotomayor. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see. So -- okay. 12 MR. FRIEDMAN: But -- but -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I understood the 14 hypothetical to be -- to be otherwise, then. 15 MR. FRIEDMAN: But -- no, no. If it's "And 16 do you stand by it" -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 18 MR. FRIEDMAN: -- then that's fine. 19 But I do know of a couple of cases involving 20 child witnesses where they don't ask -- they put the 21 witness on the stand, and they don't ask anything 22 about the events at issue. And in those cases 23 there's -- courts have held that that's -- that's not 24 acceptable. So -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but -- so

1 what difference? That's because there's nothing in 2 evidence about the incident, correct? 3 MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, no. No, then they 4 presented a former statement by the child. So -- so I 5 do think that there is some justification -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that was a -7 MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those were found -- I 9 don't -- were those found as violations of the 10 Confrontation Clause? 11 MR. FRIEDMAN: Those are found to be 12 violations of the Confrontation Clause. The -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or due process? 14 MR. FRIEDMAN: Confrontation Clause. State 15 v. Rohrich, which is cited in my brief on another 16 point, and Warren, an Illinois appellate case from, I 17 think, just last term. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: It's not clear to me what 19 your answer to these questions is. If all the 20 prosecution does is call the analyst on the stand and 21 admit -- have the analyst provide a foundation for the 22 admission of the report, let's say, pursuant to the 23 hearsay exception for recorded recollection, and does 24 nothing more, would there be a Confrontation Clause 25 problem?

1 MR. FRIEDMAN: And there's -- there's the 2 question, "Is this your report? Do you stand by it?" 3 Then -- then I don't think there is a Confrontation 4 Clause problem, because -- because the prosecution has 5 put the witness on the stand, has asked those 6 questions, and then the witness -- and -7 JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference 8 between that situation and the situation in which the 9 report is -- is admitted, subject to -- and the 10 analyst is available, and the defense can question the 11 analyst if the defense wishes to? 12 MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, I think -- I think the 13 difference is that once you ask the question -- "Do 14 you stand by it?" -- then the witness has testified 15 one way or another. And the prosecution, as I say, 16 bears the risk that the witness will not testify in 17 accordance with the prior statement. California -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On the past recollection 19 recorded, the witness doesn't stand by the statement. 20 The witness says: I made the statement, have no 21 current knowledge; I can't stand by it or not stand by 22 it. 23 MR. FRIEDMAN: That's right. I take 24 California v. Green at its word. California v. Green 25 says and Owen follows up and says that if the witness
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 does not testify in accordance with the prior 2 statement, then the defendant has had some of the -3 has had considerable benefit of cross-examination 4 already. So -- so the prosecution has to -- has to 5 put the witness through that pace to make sure that 6 that happens. Beyond that -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what you 8 just said. Want to say it again? 9 MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes. California v. Green 10 says that if the witness testifies inconsistently with 11 the prior statement, that the defendant has had the 12 benefit of cross-examination in showing the 13 inconsistency. So -- so Justice Alito asked me what's 14 the difference, and I'm saying a difference, one 15 difference is, that if the witness does not testify in 16 accordance with the prior statement, that's apparent 17 to -- that's apparent to the jury. There are also all 18 the practical differences that we emphasize. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are asking us now to 20 state something that you admit is in really no 21 constitutional case or historical case, that says the 22 right to confrontation means that the witness has to 23 tell the story, and the form of telling that story has 24 to be a verbal recitation; it can't be past recorded 25 recollection because you just said they have to tell
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the story. It can't be based on official documents or 2 anything else, because it has to be their story. Am I 3 hearing you wrong? 4 MR. FRIEDMAN: No, I don't believe so. I'm 5 saying that the -- that the witness has to take the 6 stand, has to -- has to testify live, viva voce, face 7 to face, in the time-honored phrases which have always 8 governed testimony in an Anglo-American trial. Then 9 the -- I think the witness has to at least be asked 10 what happened. If the witness says, I don't recall, 11 then the prior statement may be introduced. I'm not 12 -13 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the -14 MR. FRIEDMAN: I'm not asking the Court to 15 go beyond anything that has previously been said. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the theory of this? 17 I understand in hearsay, which as we have just seen 18 demonstrated, is very complicated, filled with all 19 kinds of rules -20 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- some of which I may 22 recall and others of which I certainly don't. 23 (Laughter.) 24 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Confrontation Clause, I would have thought, would have 2 picked out the heart of that. So we have Sir Walter 3 Raleigh and Sir Walter Raleigh says, "Bring in 4 witnesses," which they wouldn't. So why shouldn't we 5 say what this clause is about is Sir Walter Raleigh? 6 MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, if -7 JUSTICE BREYER: Bring in the witnesses. 8 Now, once you bring them in, the defendant can do what 9 he wants. He has had his chance to cross-examine 10 them. End of the matter, and leave the rest up to the 11 hearsay law. 12 MR. FRIEDMAN: I want to emphasize that the 13 Confrontation Clause is about a lot more -- there were 14 nearly 200 years of history between Walter Raleigh and 15 the Confrontation Clause, and what was established is 16 that in an Anglo-American trial witnesses give their 17 testimony live, face to face, and Melendez-Diaz 18 emphasized last term you can't prove the case via an 19 affidavit. 20 So -- so it's -- it's the fundamental 21 question that -- that Crawford establishes -22 fundamental principle that Crawford establishes is 23 this is the way witnesses testify in our trials: 24 live, in front of the jury, subject to oath and then 25 cross-exam.

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why -- and -- I trust 2 the trial process, and much of your brief was talking 3 about that process -4 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and the fact that 6 it's much more effective when the witness tells their 7 story and you get a chance to cross-examine than if 8 you have to start from the platform of 9 cross-examination. Once a defendant makes it known 10 that a -- he's going to cross-examine a lab 11 technician, don't you think that in the vast majority 12 of cases the prosecutor is going to put that witness 13 on? 14 MR. FRIEDMAN: I -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if he does or 16 doesn't, why shouldn't we leave it to the normal trial 17 strategy and practice to leave to that prosecutor the 18 burden of non-persuasion, which is what confrontation 19 was about? 20 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. Yes. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is -22 MR. FRIEDMAN: If -- if the prosecutor is 23 certain that the defendant is going to put the witness 24 on the stand, then -- then the prosecutor has some 25 reason to -- to put the witness on first. The problem
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is that the -- the defunct Virginia statute puts the 2 burden on the defendant of bringing the witness in, 3 and the defense -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- well, I was 5 starting from a different proposition than you did -6 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. I'm sorry -- but -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because I think 8 that's a question for your adversaries: How could you 9 have known -10 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that you should have 12 asked the State to bring that witness in? 13 But putting that aside -14 MR. FRIEDMAN: But -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- assume we are reading 16 it the way the Court has now. 17 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. The -- the fact is 18 that under the Virginia statute, given -- and as 19 interpreted by the Commonwealth, too -- given that the 20 defendant has the burden of putting the witness on the 21 stand, defendants rarely exercise that right, because 22 it's a corrupted right, because it isn't nearly as 23 valuable, as I think Your Honor understands, as the 24 right to stand up and cross-examine a witness who has 25 actually just testified.
15 Alderson Reporting Company

1 I don't think that the right given by the 2 Virginia statute is -- the former Virginia statute is 3 actually the right to cross-examine. It's not in form 4 cross-examination, and it's not in substance 5 cross-examination. It's a right to make the witness 6 the defendant's own, and that's the way -- that's the 7 way the statute is -- is worded. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Friedman, one of the 9 problems that has been brought up is that this is an 10 inordinate expense, and you're wasting the time of the 11 analyst. Do you recognize any economy -- for example, 12 that the analyst could testify from the lab, have 13 video conferencing, and so the analyst, while the 14 prosecutor must call her, can testify from the lab 15 instead of coming down to the courthouse? 16 MR. FRIEDMAN: That -- that is a -17 certainly a possibility, at least on consent of the 18 defendant, and some States, including my own State of 19 Michigan, has been experimenting with that. And I 20 think that's a plausible possibility. 21 Now, if the defendant were to insist on -22 on live testimony, that is an open -- that's an open 23 question as to whether video testimony would be 24 acceptable. This Court some years ago refused to 25 transmit to Congress a proposed amendment to Federal
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the majority in a 2 statement by Justice Scalia said there is a virtual 3 satisfaction of the confrontation right, not a real 4 satisfaction. 5 So the matter as to whether it could be done 6 without consent hasn't been satisfied -- hasn't been 7 determined. But certainly on consent it could, and in 8 many cases I believe the defendants -- that those 9 defendants who do want confrontation would be 10 perfectly willing to accept video. 11 But I do -- I do want to respond also to the 12 -- the premise. I -- I believe that sufficient data 13 is now available to show rather clearly that the 14 expense is not inordinate. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: How can you say that? We 16 have an amicus brief from 26 States plus the District 17 of Columbia arguing exactly the contrary. 18 MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes, I -19 JUSTICE ALITO: They say that there is a 20 very substantial category of cases in which defendants 21 really have no interest whatsoever in contesting 22 either the nature or the quantity of drugs involved, 23 but they will refuse to stipulate to those things 24 simply for the purpose of putting a financial burden 25 on the prosecution, because they know, if they do
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that, it may be helpful for them in getting a better 2 plea bargain, plus there is a certain risk that the 3 analyst will not show up, and they will get the 4 benefit of that. 5 MR. FRIEDMAN: So, Your Honor, I think that 6 what the -- the States' amicus brief shows is that 7 there are -- there are a lot of drug prosecutions, and 8 there are a lot of drug analyses, and then there is 9 this speculation about the type of gamesmanship that 10 you have mentioned. But if we look for hard data, 11 there is nothing supporting that. 12 So let's look at a couple of jurisdictions 13 that have perfectly valid notice-and-demand rules. 14 Ohio -- it's less than one appearance per lab analyst 15 per month. That is in the State lab. Less than one 16 appearance per month. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: If this is not a burden on 18 these 26 States plus the District of Columbia, why are 19 they bothering to make this argument? Just for 20 amusement? 21 MR. FRIEDMAN: I'm sure not for amusement. 22 I think there's a certain amount of solidarity. I'm 23 sure that they would rather not have whatever expense 24 there is. But, frankly, I think a large part is that 25 they recognize that the defunct Virginia statute is an
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 impairment to the confrontation right and makes it 2 harder for defendants. It makes -- it makes it less 3 likely that the confrontation right is going to -- is 4 going to be invoked. 5 Let's look at the District of Columbia. The 6 District of Columbia, it's about -- it's about a half 7 a person a year in extra expense caused by lab techs 8 having to come and testify. 9 That's -- that is not a large burden for the 10 District of Columbia, and in fact, the District of 11 Columbia -- the lab that services the District of 12 Columbia has gotten by with five fewer technicians 13 than it did before the change. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I assume you've 15 picked the best example for you. D.C. is a small 16 place. You go to a big State, and the lab is not 17 always right next door. 18 MR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, I -- I'm just 19 little old me, and I just picked what I could get. 20 And, frankly, the example I picked was because the 21 Solicitor General's brief had data on the District of 22 Columbia, so I asked some more questions. That's why 23 I got -- that's why I got the District of Columbia. 24 Ohio -- I asked because they are a neighboring State, 25 and I was able to get some information.

And suppose, in 4 your case, this hearsay of business record or -5 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: And how often will you say: 7 I understand it's admissible, but I would like as well 8 to call the witness who prepared it. Will you do that 9 very often? 10 Suppose you learn that that witness is -- is 11 4,000 miles away, so you say, I'd like to call this 12 witness, and you know perfectly well that it's going 13 to be virtually impossible for that witness to be 14 produced. What happens? 15 MR. FRIEDMAN: We are talking about 16 non-testimonial hearsay? 17 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to think of 18 something that's hearsay, and -19 MR.

1 present, in cases where they happen to know that lab 2 technician has left the job and is married and is 3 reliving in a distant State, say okay, let's call her. 4 And that way the prosecution really cannot present the 5 case except at inordinate expense. 6 And I'm concerned about that -7 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: -- but I don't see quite 9 how to deal with it, how much of a problem it is, and 10 the impact on this particular situation. 11 MR.

It would be malpractice 9 for you not to. 10 MR.

1 I quote Patrick Hagan, who says -- who says: "The sky 2 has not fallen; we can do this very well." 3 JUSTICE BREYER: And then there are 4 conflicting reports in the newspapers, but I don't 5 know. 6 MR. FRIEDMAN: It's -- and, of course, there 7 can be an adjustment period, but -- but States can 8 adjust. I think the -- the simplest answer to your 9 question, Justice Breyer, is the use of depositions, 10 and I think prosecutors probably have been underusing 11 depositions. But -- but if a lab tech is about to 12 retire and that lab tech has done a test that is about 13 to be used, then take the deposition. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: What happens if the lab 15 is -- is divided into four or five parts and there is 16 several different machines and we have different 17 people at different times using these different 18 machines and performing different operations and each, 19 at the end, certifies that the red light was on or it 20 was this or it was that? Now, do we have to call all 21 those people? 22 MR. FRIEDMAN: No, I don't believe you have 23 to call all those people. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Each of them -25 MR. FRIEDMAN: I do believe that there has
23 Alderson Reporting Company

1 to be -2 JUSTICE BREYER: Each of them looked at a 3 special part. Each of them said -4 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that it was this or 6 that, and in respect to each of those statements, it's 7 this or that. That is hearsay. 8 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. The problem, of 9 course, isn't hearsay. The problem is -- the only 10 question is -11 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, it's no 12 confrontation because in this instance the hearsay 13 prevents the confrontation. 14 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. The -- the 15 prosecution has to present the testimony of witnesses. 16 It has to present the testimony live. Depending on 17 how the lab is organized -- usually, labs can organize 18 so that only one person needs to -- needs to present. 19 In any event, of course, the State is 20 acknowledging that, if the defendant brings -- demands 21 they have to bring in the witnesses, that's not at 22 issue. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Your answer to my question 24 is, if a laboratory is so organized so that six or 25 seven people perform different steps of the operation,
24 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 if it is organized in that way, all of them must be 2 brought? 3 MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I don't believe so. I 4 believe -5 JUSTICE BREYER: You don't believe so, but 6 you gave me an answer saying they did have to, so -7 because you said they could organize differently. So 8 now explain to me why they don't. 9 MR. FRIEDMAN: But even if -- even if they 10 are organized in that way, for instance, if one person 11 observes all the -- all the procedures, that's 12 sufficient. Apart from that, as Melendez-Diaz 13 indicates, it's up to the -- it's up to the State to 14 decide what the evidence they are going to present is, 15 whether -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose one person doesn't 17 observe all the procedures.

Can the conclusion be presented by one 5 witness from the lab, when that witness did not 6 observe all of the procedures? 7 MR. FRIEDMAN: I think -- I think that there 8 probably has to be a witness who has observed the 9 procedures. If I am -- and that's an issue that will 10 be presented to the Court, we can be pretty certain. 11 I think that issue is entirely orthogonal to the issue 12 here because the Commonwealth is acknowledging -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry.

FRIEDMAN: That's a bit of -- a bit of 13 professorship creeping in, I suppose. 14 But the Commonwealth is acknowledging that 15 they have to bring in witnesses if the -- if the 16 defense demands, so this is another issue as to who 17 are -- who are the witnesses. And it's -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, in your view, it 19 wouldn't satisfy the Confrontation Clause if, say, the 20 supervisor shows up and said that this is -- this is 21 the way the analysts operate and describes the 22 procedures. 23 MR. FRIEDMAN: In my view, it wouldn't, but 24 if I'm wrong, it doesn't change this case whatsoever. 25 It does not change this case whatsoever. It has

1 nothing to do with the issue here. The issue here is 2 -- is the witnesses who are going to testify and how 3 much they -- they testify, and I want to -4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the reason that I ask 5 is because floating in the back of my mind is -- is if 6 -- (a) does the Confrontation Clause apply? 7 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: And if the answer to (a) is 9 yes, then are there different kinds of implementation 10 rules in different areas where there are other signs 11 of security, where there are other reasons for 12 thinking it's not bad testimony? That line is not 13 something that's necessarily workable, and -- but I 14 brought it up to try to think about it. 15 MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes. I think -- I think it's 16 an interesting question, and it's question 3 in the 17 evidence exam that I am just grading, in fact. But I 18 think that's an issue that the Court will have to 19 resolve. 20 And, as I say, my views are what they -21 what they are, but if you reject my views on that, it 22 doesn't change this case whatsoever. 23 What I think is important to recognize is 24 how fundamental a transformation in the Anglo-American 25 trial is threatened if -- if the Court were to hold

1 that the prosecution can present an affidavit and 2 leave it to the defendant, if he dares, to put the 3 witness on the stand. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, does that square with 5 where we started out? We have situation A, where the 6 prosecutor calls the lab analyst, and the lab analyst 7 says, this is my report, and I stand by it, period. 8 Now, it's up to the defense to cross-examine. That's 9 situation A. 10 Situation B is the report is admitted 11 without the analyst present, but the defense can then 12 -- without the analyst on the stand -13 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: But the defense can then 15 cross-examine the analyst. 16 MR. FRIEDMAN: I wouldn't call that 17 cross-exam -18 JUSTICE ALITO: There's such a slight 19 difference between those two situations. Now, how is 20 that a fundamental transformation of the way 21 Anglo-American trials are conducted? 22 MR. FRIEDMAN: It's fundamental 23 transformation because the prosecution can present a 24 stack of affidavits, and they wouldn't even have to be 25 affidavits. They could just be signed -- they could

1 just be statements. It could present videotapes. It 2 could present audiotapes. It could craft those and 3 rehearse those behind the scene. It could present 4 those to the trial -5 JUSTICE ALITO: No. Let's just not get 6 beyond the facts of this case, where all -- all that 7 we are dealing with is a -- an analyst's report 8 relating to the -- the nature of the substance that 9 was tested and, if it's a controlled substance, the 10 amount. That's it. It doesn't extend to anything 11 else, videotapes or anything more. There's such a 12 slight difference between those two situations. 13 MR. FRIEDMAN: I think there's an enormous 14 difference in -- in impact. It's an enormous impact, 15 as I've emphasized in my brief, because of the 16 impairment of the ability to examine. 17 I don't believe it's cross-examination. In 18 practice, it is -- if the defendant said, I don't want 19 to cross-examine, but I still insist that the witness 20 get up on the stand and let's see what the witness can 21 do -- and the Commonwealth makes no attempt to 22 distinguish between these witnesses and other 23 witnesses for what is -- what is satisfactory 24 confrontation. It says: This is good confrontation. 25 He could do it with all witnesses.

FRIEDMAN: Thank you. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. McCullough. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McCULLOUGH 8 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 9 MR. McCULLOUGH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 10 it please the Court: 11 I think an appropriate place to start would 12 be how the Supreme Court of Virginia construed the 13 statute and get past that and into the confrontation 14 issue. 15 The first thing I would note there is that 16 the Petitioners simply have not challenged the 17 decision of the -- the interpretation of the Supreme 18 Court of Virginia that it placed on the statute. So I 19 think, to the extent that they are now, for the first 20 time in their reply brief, trying to raise a separate 21 due process issue, that the construction of the court 22 was so unreasonable that it violates due process, it's 23 far too late in the day to do that. So I think the 24 Court -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It goes -- that goes to
31 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the waiver question. 2 MR. McCULLOUGH: Right. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did they know at 4 trial that they were supposed to say to you: I don't 5 want a subpoena; you bring them in. 6 MR. McCULLOUGH: I think the -- the way the 7 Supreme Court of Virginia construed the statute is 8 perfectly sensible. What it says -- and the key 9 phrase is on page 2 of our brief -- that "no" -10 excuse me -- "such witnesses shall be summoned and 11 appear at the cost of the Commonwealth." And unlike 12 some statutes that say the defendant shall subpoena or 13 shall summon -- for example, like the Idaho and the 14 North Dakota statutes that the Petitioners cite -15 they are express in saying it has to be the defendant 16 who issues a summons. This just says "shall be 17 summoned." 18 In a criminal trial at the time these 19 Petitioners were being tried, there were two parties 20 that have the authority to issue summons. One was the 21 clerk of court; that is, a defendant would go to the 22 court and say: These are my witnesses; have them 23 produced for trial on this date. And the other was 24 the Commonwealth. So the statute simply doesn't say 25 it has to be the Commonwealth, it has to be the
32 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 defendant. It's silent. The Supreme Court of 2 Virginia has a long history of construing statutes in 3 a way that obviates a constitutional problem. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're -- you're 5 still begging the question. How -- they did what any 6 reasonable defendant would do and say: I object to 7 the admission of this lab report; I have a right under 8 the Confrontation Clause to have the -- the lab 9 technician here. 10 And the Commonwealth court said, no, you 11 don't. 12 MR. McCULLOUGH: Right. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so did the court on 14 appeal. 15 How did they know that this was a notice 16 and-demand statute as opposed to a subpoena statute? 17 MR. McCULLOUGH: I think it was incumbent on 18 counsel to raise the issue exactly like counsel for 19 the defendant did in the Grant case. And I think it's 20 noteworthy that in the Grant case the -- the motion 21 was filed well in advance of trial, on November 2nd, 22 2007, before the Supreme Court of Virginia ever 23 construed the statute in this fashion. And so the 24 fact that a statute may be susceptible to more than 25 one interpretation doesn't obviate the need for
33 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 counsel to take the steps that are necessary to 2 protect the right. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you: If we 4 were to -- how do we articulate a rule, or do we need 5 to, that would take care of the fears of your 6 adversary that trials would become trials by 7 affidavit, that the -- that prosecutors will choose to 8 put all witnesses on -- by videotape, by affidavit, by 9 deposition, whatever mode they choose except bringing 10 them into court -- and forcing defendants then to call 11 the witnesses and do a what's -- what I call a 12 cold-cross? 13 What rule would we announce in this case -14 MR. McCULLOUGH: I think -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that would avoid -16 what constitutional construction of the Confrontation 17 Clause would we issue that would protect against that? 18 MR. McCULLOUGH: I think there are several 19 constitutional, legal, and practical considerations 20 that make this -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. Forget the 22 practical. Talk about the legal, constitutional. 23 MR. McCULLOUGH: Right. Constitutionally, 24 there are two obstacles to a wholesale type of trial 25 system where the prosecution would simply present a
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 stack of affidavits. 2 The first of those is the Due Process 3 Clause, which -- for example, in these child witness 4 cases, what a number of courts have held is that it's 5 going to inflame the jury against the defendant if a 6 videotape is introduced and then the defendant is 7 called -- forced to call the witness to the stand. 8 And that's simply not the case with these types of 9 witness. So the Due Process Clause itself puts the 10 brakes on the type of wholesale at-trial -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: They're trial witnesses. 12 Anything else? 13 MR. McCULLOUGH: Another is the fact that 14 under the Confrontation Clause, the cross-examination 15 has to be effective. And so if the prosecution on the 16 day of trial dumps a series of affidavits on the 17 defense, it's going to be pretty difficult for the 18 defense to be in a position to effectively 19 cross-examine. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, just one or two. Just 21 one or two affidavits. Or it -- the court has a rule 22 you have to provide those affidavits several weeks 23 before trial. That would be okay? 24 MR. McCULLOUGH: I think, under the -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: We'd have a whole
35 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 European-type trial, right? It would be trial by 2 affidavit. 3 MR. McCULLOUGH: Right. I don't think the 4 Confrontation Clause, in terms of what it's 5 historically intended to protect, blocks that 6 scenario. 7 I think the key to the Confrontation Clause, 8 what this Court has said for a long time, turning to 9 the history of the clause, is that it's designed to 10 protect the reliability of the government's evidence. 11 And the way it does that is by subjecting that to the 12 crucible of cross-examination, face to face, of live 13 witnesses. And this statute protects exactly that; 14 that is, the defendant says he wants the witness there 15 -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: It does more than that. It 17 does more than that. It is the prosecution that has 18 had to place the witness on the stand. It has not 19 been up to the defense to say, oh, no, I object to 20 this affidavit, I would like you to bring -- no. The 21 prosecution has to bring in the witness. That has 22 been what the Confrontation Clause has meant. 23 MR. McCULLOUGH: We agree that we have to 24 produce the witness for court, but we see little 25 constitutional --
36 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, you don't agree with 2 that. You say you don't have to do it unless the 3 defendant objects and issue -- gets a subpoena issued. 4 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well, we agree that if the 5 defendant does provide the notice, as with the notice 6 and-demand statute, that it -- that it's our burden to 7 make sure that witness is there. And if -- as the 8 statute provides, the witness has to be summoned and 9 appear. 10 So this statute has always been strictly 11 construed against the prosecution. If it fails to do 12 exactly what the statute requires, that cuts against 13 the prosecution. So the witness does have to appear. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: How is that clear from the 15 statute? 16 MR. McCULLOUGH: I'm sorry. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: How is that clear from the 18 statute? It just says that a subpoena shall issue. 19 What if a subpoena issues and nobody comes? 20 MR. McCULLOUGH: Right. And it -- the fact 21 that the prosecution -- excuse me, that the statute is 22 interpreted strictly against the prosecution comes 23 from several decades of jurisprudence from the Supreme 24 Court of Virginia, and we cite those cases on page 1 25 our brief.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: A strict construction of 2 statutes in general, or a strict construction of this 3 provision? 4 MR. McCULLOUGH: This particular -- this 5 particular statutory scheme. For example, if the -6 19.2-187, the statute that precedes this, says that it 7 has to be filed 7 days before the trial. And if it's 8 filed 6 days, forget it, you have to bring in a live 9 witness. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about the 11 specific issue of the person subpoenaed not appearing. 12 Do you have a case? 13 MR. McCULLOUGH: No, I don't have a case -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: So we don't really know. 15 MR. McCULLOUGH: -- but I -- but I think the 16 answer follows inexorably -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know how -- how 18 strict construction gets you to the -- to the result 19 that when it is the defendant who has to take the 20 initiative to get the person brought in, if the person 21 doesn't show up, it's -- it doesn't fall on the 22 defendant; it falls on the prosecution. I don't see 23 how strict construction gets you there. 24 MR. McCULLOUGH: The -- the Grant case, for 25 example, which our Court of Appeals of Virginia said
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 was simply was an application of the holding in the 2 Magruder decision. There the defendant did -- well in 3 advance of trial, sent notice to the Commonwealth and 4 said, I want the witness there. The Commonwealth 5 didn't get the subpoena out. So that was the first 6 part of that, "shall be summoned." And the court of 7 appeals said you should never have allowed this in, 8 without the live witness being present. 9 And so what -- although Grant didn't address 10 the appear part, the same answer is true; that is, the 11 defendant says, I want the witness there; the 12 Commonwealth issues a summons, but the witness doesn't 13 appear. It's the same result. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I think that 15 underlying this is a fairly simple problem, 16 conceptually. Imagine we have Sir Walter Raleigh at 17 trial, and there's an affidavit for missing witness A 18 and witness B and witness C, and they are over in a 19 room somewhere, whether they were treated badly or 20 not, and they have written these pieces of paper. In 21 they come. 22 And Walter Raleigh says: "Bring me the 23 witness." Now, suppose they had trotted him out, and 24 he cross-examined him. Still, those pieces of paper 25 came in, and they weren't cross-examined. And so what
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 do we do about that? They weren't cross-examined, and 2 how did they get in here? 3 MR. McCULLOUGH: I think your question goes 4 to the very heart of why we have the Confrontation 5 Clause. It wasn't because of this formalistic order 6 of proof that our modern trials have. And -- and one 7 thing that makes this case conceptually difficult is 8 we are so accustomed to this clean order of 9 presentation -- that -- that that's how we have all 10 tried our cases, that's how we are used to seeing 11 them, but that's not the heart of the Confrontation 12 Clause. 13 The Confrontation Clause is because, for 14 example, the colonists were subject to anonymous -15 JUSTICE BREYER: As I read this statute, it 16 does let in that piece of paper. 17 MR. McCULLOUGH: It does. But -18 JUSTICE BREYER: And so why then, by 19 analogy, isn't the statute bad? 20 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well, because -21 JUSTICE BREYER: If -- unless you -- unless 22 you have some special kind -- I mean, you'd have to 23 some special -- specially reliable evidence that sort 24 of fell within the Confrontation Clause but not 25 totally. And that's what I -- the more I think about
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that, the harder that one is to do. 2 MR. McCULLOUGH: I think there are -3 JUSTICE BREYERE: So -- so -4 MR. McCULLOUGH: There are characteristics, 5 of course, to this particular type of evidence that 6 were debated in this Court's Melendez-Diaz opinion 7 that make this procedure certainly more appropriate, 8 and one of those is, these -- what -- functionally 9 what you are doing when you have this witness on the 10 stand is either past recollection recorded or past 11 recollection refreshed, because they are doing 12 approximately 900 of these certificates a year. They 13 are largely fungible things like -- like crack cocaine 14 or powder cocaine. And so we're miles from the type 15 of scenario where -16 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, to put my chips on 17 the table, which you probably understand, I thought 18 the reliability of this evidence in the mine run of 19 cases was such, and the distance from Sir Walter 20 Raleigh was sufficiently great, that it fell outside 21 the scope of the Confrontation Clause for those two 22 reasons, but mine was a dissenting opinion. 23 MR. McCULLOUGH: Right. I -24 JUSTICE BREYER: So, therefore, what do I 25 do?
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 (Laughter.) 2 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well, I think, though, even 3 -- even going back to the very heart -- the historical 4 heart of this clause, the problems for these colonists 5 was anonymous accusers and absentee witnesses. That's 6 -- that's why -- they were enraged because of this 7 deeply unfair trial procedure. It wasn't because, for 8 example, a harbor master might be called in and 9 records of what ships came in for these colonists who 10 were in the vice admiralty courts, and some paper is 11 introduced about what ships came in, and then they get 12 an opportunity to cross-examine them before the 13 prosecution has asked any questions of the -- the 14 harbor master. 15 That's not the problem, that the 16 Confrontation -- Confrontation Clause -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the problem you 18 describe, the hearsay rule would have solved that 19 alone, wouldn't it? 20 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well, that's one of the 21 practical -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so what's left for 23 the Confrontation Clause to do? 24 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well, the Confrontation 25 Clause is designed to ensure -- the core of it -- and
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we agree with this -- is what this Court has said for 2 a long time, a face-to-face encounter with a witness 3 who is cross-examined face to face, under oath. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't have to 5 happen in the prosecutor's case. In other words, the 6 prosecutor puts in the reports and rests. And the 7 defendant says, there wasn't sufficient evidence; I 8 move to dismiss the case. It couldn't be dismissed at 9 that point. The prosecutor would prove its case by 10 the affidavit alone. 11 MR. McCULLOUGH: Right. But first -- a 12 couple points in response. 13 First of all, the statute doesn't say at 14 what point the defendant gets to treat this witness as 15 an adverse witness. It just says the report comes in, 16 and then the defendant can call the witness as an 17 adverse witness. And the Supreme Court of Virginia 18 deliberately left the question of the order of proof 19 unresolved, because it viewed those things as a due 20 process issue. So I don't think it's axiomatic under 21 the statute, although it's possible, that the 22 defendant would conduct a cross-examination during his 23 case. 24 But -- but beyond that, the Confrontation 25 Clause isn't designed to constitutionalize Federal
43 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 or a motion to strike. 2 The defendant could still -- in Virginia procedure, 3 it's a motion to strike. The defendant could still 4 make that motion at the close of all the evidence. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's still not clear -6 not clear under the statute that if the witness 7 doesn't show up, it's the prosecution that bears the 8 burden. 9 MR. McCULLOUGH: No, I think that's very 10 clear. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that clear? 12 MR. McCULLOUGH: Under both the plain 13 language of the statute and the way it's been 14 construed adversely to the Commonwealth. The plain 15 language of the statute is the witness shall be 16 summoned and appear. So there's a requirement of 17 appearance. And if the defendant asks the prosecutor 18 to summon the witness, the witness then has to appear. 19 And going -- and we cite some of these cases, again on 20 page 1 of our brief. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't say what the 22 consequence of his not appearing is. That the -- that 23 the written testimony is -- stands and is admitted, 24 without the opportunity to cross-examine the witness? 25 MR. McCULLOUGH: The consequence emerges
44 Alderson Reporting Company

1 from this line of cases, Justice Scalia, that if the 2 -- the statute requires the witness to appear, and if 3 the Commonwealth doesn't do exactly what the statute 4 requires, a live witness -- or excuse me, the 5 certificate does not come in without the live witness. 6 Just like, if you don't -- the statute says file 7 7 days before court. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, the prosecutor issues 9 the subpoena. 10 MR. McCULLOUGH: Right. And that would -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: The witness does not show 12 up. 13 MR. McCULLOUGH: Right. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about fault 15 on the part of the prosecutor. I'm talking about the 16 fact that the witness has died, has fled the State, is 17 simply not available. 18 MR. McCULLOUGH: But I think the language 19 answers that. The witness has to appear. The statute 20 says shall be summoned, and the requirement is that 21 the witness appear. If the witness does not appear -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, he is required 23 to appear. But what happens if he doesn't appear? 24 MR. McCULLOUGH: I'm sorry, but we seem to 25 be going in -- in circles. And I want to answer your
45 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 question. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, we're not going in 3 circles at all. You -- you appeal to the language 4 that the witness shall appear as resolving what 5 happens when he doesn't, and it doesn't resolve that. 6 It just says he must appear. And if he doesn't appear, 7 what happens? 8 MR. McCULLOUGH: If he doesn't appear, the 9 Commonwealth has failed to do what the statute 10 requires, which is to make sure the witness appears. 11 And if the Commonwealth fails to do exactly what the 12 statute requires, it must -- it cannot rely on a piece 13 of paper. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't see the 15 statute requiring that. It requires that of the 16 witness, he shall appear. 17 MR. McCULLOUGH: And -- I mean, to the 18 extent there's -- there's any question about that, I 19 don't think it's a matter that this Court should 20 resolve in the first instance. I think it would be a 21 matter of remand to the Supreme Court of Virginia to 22 determine what -- what the statute requires in that 23 instance. 24 Let me just spend a moment since we've 25 talked about the costs. Our experience in Virginia,
46 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we -- of course, we've repealed this statute. This 2 Court signaled in Melendez-Diaz what a safe harbor 3 was, with notice and demand, and so we went there. 4 And what we have seen under our new statute 5 is rampant demands for the witness to appear, followed 6 by: Oh, well, he's here; I'll stipulate. Or no 7 questions of the witness. So our experience under 8 this old statute compared to our new one is that we 9 had far more -- or far less under our old statute of 10 this sort of tactical demands for confrontation. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: How new is the new one? 12 MR. McCULLOUGH: It went into effect 13 August 21, 2009. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. The -- the reply 15 brief of -- of the Petitioners mentions that -- that 16 the same thing, a spike occurred in other 17 jurisdictions after Melendez-Diaz, but then the spike 18 went down, after -- after 6 months or a short period. 19 MR.

I will say that 8 this type of statute -- as this Court noted in 9 Melendez-Diaz, defense attorneys don't want to 10 necessarily antagonize the court and so on by making 11 these kinds of gamesmanship demands. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 13 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well, a cross-examination 14 focused statute like this one more blatantly exposes 15 that type of gamesmanship and, therefore, may have a 16 better deterrent value, as opposed to a garden variety 17 statute. 18 I do want to just say, really briefly, that 19 the practical concerns, even if they are not 20 constitutional concerns, are very important because 21 the prosecution always bears the burden of persuasion, 22 and a live witness is always more compelling than a 23 piece of paper. 24 And so the -- the practical realities of 25 this -- a trial by affidavit simply are not likely to

KRUGER: No, Justice Scalia, not at all. 5 We believe that a State complies with that very rule 6 from Melendez-Diaz when it ensures that the analyst is 7 present in court to submit to cross-examination, which 8 is the core of the confrontation right. This Court 9 affirmed in its decision -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's present only if the 11 defendant asks for him, right? 12 MS. KRUGER: That's right, and that's -13 that's because -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's exactly what 15 this addressed. It's not -- it's not replaced by a 16 system in which the prosecution presents its evidence 17 by -- and waits for the defendant to subpoena the 18 affiants if he chooses. 19 MS. KRUGER: This Court has recognized that 20 the confrontation right is designed to achieve a 21 particular purpose, and that is to ensure that the 22 government's evidence is subject to adversarial 23 testing at trial. 24 It is ultimately up to the defendant in 25 every case to decide, no matter how the prosecution
50 Alderson Reporting Company

1 presents its evidence on direct, whether or not it 2 wants to confront the witness and submit that 3 witness's testimony to adversarial testing -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: That may be. It's a 5 perfectly reasonable argument. I just object to your 6 saying that it doesn't contradict Melendez-Diaz. 7 MS. KRUGER: I think it would be surprising 8 to discover that Melendez-Diaz went quite so far. 9 This Court has never before recognized a dimension of 10 the Confrontation Clause that would govern the manner 11 in which the prosecution presents its evidence, except 12 for the rule that it affirmed it in Crawford, which is 13 that so long as the government ensures that the 14 witness is available for cross-examination at trial, 15 the Confrontation Clause places no constraints on the 16 government's use of prior testimony or statements. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So the 18 statement, the sentence in this opinion, that, in your 19 opinion, would have the effect of limiting 20 Melendez-Diaz without overruling it, what is that 21 statement? 22 MS. KRUGER: I think the statement is it 23 requires only that the Court reaffirm what it already 24 said in Crawford, in the context of the lab analyst 25 testimony at issue in this case, which is, again, when
51 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the analyst is available for cross-examination at 2 trial, the government has complied with what the 3 Confrontation Clause demands. 4 It has provided a constitutionally 5 sufficient opportunity for the defendants to submit 6 that analyst's findings to adversarial testing -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it just doesn't -8 doesn't apply just to analysts, right? I mean, is 9 there anything peculiar about analysts? Would it not 10 exist for any other witness? 11 MS. KRUGER: Well, our principal submission 12 is that the Confrontation Clause provides, in every 13 case, an opportunity for effective cross-examination. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 15 MS. KRUGER: And there may be independent 16 constraints on the manner in which the prosecution 17 presents its evidence under the laws of evidence in 18 the jurisdiction because of the government's need to 19 satisfy its burden of proof and ensure a fundamentally 20 fair trial under the Due Process Clause. 21 To the extent that the Court -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what -23 is that a yes or a no? 24 MS. KRUGER: Well, it is to say that 25 Confrontation Clause is not what prohibits that
52 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 practice. What prohibits that practice are other 2 equally effective sources in the law -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So as far as the 4 Confrontation Clause is concerned, this would apply to 5 other witnesses as well? 6 MS. KRUGER: I think that that's right, but 7 even if the Court were to disagree with that 8 submission, this Court could rely on the kinds of 9 distinctions that it has drawn in other cases, like 10 Inadi or like White v. Illinois, which recognized that 11 there is a class of hearsay evidence that's not simply 12 a weaker substitute for live testimony at trial, that 13 has independent, probative significance that makes it 14 somewhat irrelevant whether or not the court -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Indicia of reliability -16 you want us to go back to that? Is that -17 (Laughter.) 18 MS. KRUGER: No, it's not a question of the 19 reliability. What Crawford did was replace a system 20 in which hearsay evidence and its admissibility was 21 dependent on reliability with one in which the 22 touchstone is an opportunity for cross-examination. 23 And it's precisely in response to that point 24 that Crawford, again, reaffirmed the rule that it 25 first announced in Green, that so long as the
53 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 out-of-court declarant is present at trial to explain 2 or defend his out-of-court statements, the 3 Confrontation Clause is satisfied. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: What if it doesn't quite 5 work, that the Confrontation Clause seems to be 6 expanding, just with the opportunity for 7 cross-examination creating all kinds of incursions 8 into areas where it's not necessary for fairness 9 purposes? 10 Then does it make sense to say -- hey, 11 unfortunately, to say that the only workable system is 12 that you have a system which has exactly the 13 confrontation point, but indicia of reliability do 14 have an impact as to what the implications of the 15 Confrontation Clause violation are, in terms of 16 practical trial necessity. 17 MS. KRUGER: But -18 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, there we are, 19 accepting the warnings of the dissenters in Crawford. 20 (Laughter.) 21 MS. KRUGER: I don't think that the 22 touchstone of this Court's analysis need return to the 23 now discredited Ohio v. Roberts regime. 24 It's simply a practical point. To the 25 extent the Petitioners are arguing that their
54 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 opportunity to confront and to cross-examine is 2 constitutionally inadequate merely because the 3 prosecution hasn't guaranteed that it would call the 4 witness to the stand first, I think the court can take 5 due account of the fact that that is not necessarily 6 so. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about Raleigh's 8 witnesses -- you know, the hypothetical I gave you, 9 for the heart of the matter, the heart of the matter, 10 and they stick it in their affidavits, and you say, 11 oh, don't worry, don't worry, you can cross-examine 12 them later in the trial. 13 MS. KRUGER: I think, to the extent that the 14 Court were otherwise inclined to invent a new body of 15 Confrontation Clause jurisprudence to govern the 16 manner in which the prosecution puts on its witnesses 17 and questions them, this isn't the appropriate case to 18 do it because, as we have seen from Petitioners' 19 submission earlier this morning, there is no 20 substantive difference from a defendant's 21 perspective -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- are you 23 suggesting or are you saying even a trial by affidavit 24 is okay under the Confrontation Clause? Is that your 25 position?
55 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MS. KRUGER: Our principal submission is 2 that the Confrontation Clause allows the government to 3 rely on affidavits, so long as it bring the affiants 4 into court, so that the defendant can ask whatever 5 questions -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are absolutely 7 saying that, under the Confrontation Clause, trial by 8 affidavit of any witness would be okay. 9 MS. KRUGER: That is our principal -10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you -- are you 11 then saying that there is some other constitutional 12 limit to that choice, outside of the Confrontation 13 Clause? And if you are, what would be that other 14 constitutional limit? 15 MS. KRUGER: We do think that there are 16 constitutional limits in the Due Process Clause, and 17 it's guaranteeing the right to -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how many hundreds of 19 cases will it take to identify those limits under that 20 very clear Due Process Clause? 21 (Laughter.) 22 MS. KRUGER: Well, it's -- it's somewhat of 23 a difficult question to answer because this is not a 24 question that arises particularly frequently. The 25 laws of evidence, as a general matter, express a
56 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 strong preference for the prosecution to present its 2 evidence through live testimony -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't we want clear rules 4 for the presentation? Don't we want clear rules, not 5 gambling on what the Supreme Court will say about due 6 process? 7 MS. KRUGER: I think that it's difficult to 8 imagine that a new-found constitutional rule that 9 would require the prosecution to present its evidence 10 in a certain way in every case would lead to that sort 11 of clarity. It would, if anything, create -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Kruger, can I just ask 13 this question? I just want to be sure. Supposing you 14 have an eyewitness. Can you follow the same procedure 15 that you recommend for the scientific witness here -16 and for an eyewitness? 17 MS. KRUGER: We think that you could, so 18 long as the defendant has an adequate opportunity to 19 cross-examine that eye witness about the testimonial 20 statement. 21 But even if you disagreed with that, we 22 think that the Court can take due account of the fact 23 that there is a significant difference between the 24 kind of testimony that an eyewitness provides and the 25 kind of testimony that a forensic analyst provides.

1 The forensic analyst's lab report is not 2 merely a weaker substitute for live testimony. It is, 3 in fact, I think, as we see by the relative 4 infrequency with which analysts were called into court 5 before Melendez-Diaz, something that has been seen to 6 have equal value, regardless of the manner in which 7 it's presented. 8 And, for that reason, we think that, in 9 order to decide this case, all this Court needs to 10 decide is that, in the context of forensic lab 11 analysts, what the Court said in Crawford still 12 stands, so long as the government presents the analyst 13 at trial for face-to-face confrontation and 14 cross-examination. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why do we have to 16 say anything in this case? Why is this case here 17 except as an opportunity to upset Melendez-Diaz? 18 MS. KRUGER: I think that -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: This Virginia statute no 20 longer exists, does it? So we are pronouncing on the 21 validity of a Virginia statute that is now gone, 22 right? They have adopted a statute that complies 23 completely with Melendez-Diaz. 24 MS. KRUGER: That's true, and I think that 25 that's because Virginia was unwilling to stake the
58 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 validity of however many convictions in the interim 2 on the outcome of a case. But this -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not criticizing 4 Virginia; I'm criticizing us for taking the case. 5 (Laughter.) 6 MS. KRUGER: I think that this -- this case 7 presents, I think, an important opportunity for the 8 Court to provide guidance to States that are currently 9 grappling with how to respond to the practical 10 problems that have been presented in the wake of 11 Melendez-Diaz. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So do we say to them, 13 contrary to what Melendez-Diaz is, that subpoena 14 statutes -- when you read the statute, it says the 15 defendant has to subpoena the witness. On its -- on 16 the face of this statute, without the Commonwealth 17 court's gloss on it -18 MS. KRUGER: I don't mean to quibble, 19 Justice Sotomayor, but the statute does not in fact on 20 its face say the defendant must subpoena. It says the 21 witness shall be summoned. But I think to the extent 22 that you had any questions about whether or not the 23 Commonwealth's interpretation of that language were 24 correct, the appropriate course would be to remand to 25 the Virginia Supreme Court to allow them to address
59 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that question of State law in the first instance. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: That question of prior 3 State law, right? 4 MS. KRUGER: Thank you, Your Honor. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 6 Mr. Friedman, you have 4 minutes left. 7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 10 This is not a notice-and-demand statute. It 11 does not even provide notice to the defendant unless 12 he asks for it ahead of time. It doesn't give any 13 deadline as to when he should make a demand or take 14 any other action. It just says that -- and I invite 15 the Court's attention to the language of the 16 statute -- it says that the defendant may cause the 17 witness to be summoned. 18 There's no -- there's no deadline. It 19 doesn't put the burden of no-shows on the prosecution. 20 It's the defendant's witness, and it clearly doesn't 21 call -- it doesn't provide that the prosecution should 22 call the -- the witness. Virginia -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the -- just 24 the first one, the no-notice problem, that's kind of 25 silly, isn't it? Because if you are being prosecuted
60 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 for 50 grams of crack cocaine, you can expect the 2 government is going to try to prove that. 3 MR. FRIEDMAN: That's likely, of course. 4 But the fact is Virginia knows how to write a good 5 notice-and-demand statute and has done it, and 6 contrast the -- the new statute, which gives 28 days 7 notice. It's -- it's very glaring. If Virginia 8 wanted to write a notice-and-demand statute before, it 9 could have. 10 Now, I think I can explain what's different 11 about Virginia. And what happened is after the -12 after the defendants' -- after the defendants' trials 13 -- let me say, after the defendants' trials, the -14 the prosecution is saying, you could have subpoenaed. 15 And they said this isn't testimony. Okay? They were 16 wrong on both of those counts. 17 After the defendants' trials, in a case 18 called Brooks, the -- the Virginia Court of Appeals 19 suggested that the defendant could ask the prosecution 20 to bring the witness in. Many defendants did that, 21 including Grant, the defendant on whom -- in the case 22 on whom the Commonwealth relies so heavily. 23 The prosecution ignored those requests. It 24 was still taking the view that this is not -- this is 25 not testimonial. Up until the moment that this Court
61 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 decided Melendez-Diaz, the Commonwealth in Virginia 2 in -- in Grant said, we don't have to bring the 3 witness in; the witness -- the defendant should 4 subpoena the witness if he wants. 5 No court has ever held -- no court has ever 6 held in Virginia that the prosecution bears the risk 7 of -- of no-shows. 8 Now, the Commonwealth and the United States 9 suggest: Oh, it's okay to -- to transform the way 10 trials are conducted by allowing the prosecution to 11 present affidavits because you can backfill with the 12 Due Process Clause. I think that goes against 13 decisions of this Court that say when there's a 14 specific right addressed to a particular situation, we 15 rely on that, not on the Due Process Clause. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: But I take it your position 17 is it wouldn't matter. If the -- if Virginia said 18 that the -- the Commonwealth bears the risk of a 19 no-show, that wouldn't make any difference? 20 MR. FRIEDMAN: That would -- that would not 21 be enough, no. It's enough -- it's enough -22 JUSTICE ALITO: So we have to assume that 23 that's the case. 24 MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, that's -- that's one 25 problem. The no-show. But --
62 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, would you like us -2 MR. FRIEDMAN: -- but there are two -- they 3 are both problems. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you like us to grant, 5 vacate, and remand in this case and say because it's 6 unclear who has the risk of a no-show? 7 MR. FRIEDMAN: No, no, no, Your -8 JUSTICE ALITO: And then Supreme Court of 9 Virginia on remand could decide whether in fact the -10 the prosecution bore that risk? 11 MR. FRIEDMAN: No, Your Honor, because it's 12 sufficient that the statute is very clear and the 13 Commonwealth doesn't deny that it's the defendant's 14 burden under the statute to call the witness to the 15 stand. So whatever the no-show issue, however that 16 might stand under State law, what Melendez-Diaz called 17 the more fundamental problem, which is that the 18 statute imposes on the defense the burden of calling a 19 witness to the stand, is clearly provided for in this 20 statute. So there's no reason -21 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think Melendez-Diaz 22 addressed the question of the order of proof? Where 23 did it address that? 24 MR. FRIEDMAN: I don't think this is a 25 question of order of proof. This is a question of who
63 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 puts the witness on the stand. Melendez addressed 2 that very explicitly in part III-E and said that an 3 affidavit doesn't do, that the prosecution has to 4 present prosecution witnesses. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So is the proper solution 6 to grant, vacate, and remand in light of 7 Melendez-Diaz? 8 MR. FRIEDMAN: May -- may I respond to that? 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 10 MR. FRIEDMAN: Thank you. 11 Your Honor, I think that the -- the proper 12 response here is the Court has taken the case; there 13 is enough without any -- resolving any ambiguities of 14 the Virginia statute to say that the -- this procedure 15 is unconstitutional, because it imposes -- even 16 without worrying about the no-show point, it imposes 17 upon the defendant the burden of putting the witness 18 on the stand. Given that all these States and the 19 United States are contesting that this procedure is 20 acceptable, I think it's proper for the Court to say 21 right now that it -- that it is not. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 The case is submitted. 24 (Whereupon, at 12:41 p.m., the case in the 25 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
