But there is no reason to have the province of the legislature not intruding upon the province of the legislature and, therefore, you don't need to apply that strict a matter and should respect the congressional judgment that, in fact, there is unreasonable discrimination being exhibited in these States against handicapped people. I would like to get your response to that kind of an argument. Congress and the States, and that's why the section 5 inquiries are always different.  You've got a zero sum game.  Congress' gain is invariably the State's loss, and just as Congress gets a presumption of constitutionality in enacting these 30 Federal disability laws, so do the States get a presumption of constitutionality that when they pass these 50 State laws, 1) they're presumptively good and 2) they're enforcing them. Now, that can -- you know, that's not dispositive, of course.  Ultimately, if it turns out the States aren't enforcing them, they're just shams, well then they're got a problem and, you know, that's why the voting rights laws are --"

If one is concerned about the institutional capacity of the courts versus Congress in this area, the last thing this Court should be doing in this case is making ultimately these section 5 findings itself, okay. So if you're going to agree with Justice Breyer and the suggestion in your question, Justice Souter, that there has to be a little more deference to Congress in this area, the last thing the Court should be doing is in a situation where they don't ask the right questions, constitutional violations as opposed to violating a statutory standard, number 1, number 2, are the State laws, all 50 of them on the books being enforced, the last thing anyone's --"

Katzenbach and just has a sentence that says, embracing the broader version of Morgan saying that if there's an antidiscrimination issue out there, Congress can remedy under section 5, but that's not the inquiry, and as early as 1970 it was clear that was not the inquiry in Oregon v.

You emphasized that, but I didn't see the connection between that and the say that it's a proportionate and necessary tailored remedy when they're not only not imposing it on private business in many instances, but on themselves? That just doesn't stand.  It's not only the failure to lead by example, just direction, but it doesn't show proportionality.  I mean, it proves our very point. This was not needed.

But I will suggest this, Your Honor.  It is not decide what they wanted to do.  In fact, in City of Boerne this Court invalidated the RFRA.  They're back at it again.  They're entitled to do that. I will submit that there is a bright line here. It's constitutional violations.  U.S. Senators, U.S. House of Representatives Members are not going to lightly find States are violating the Constitution, but we want them to ask that question.  That's the very point of section 5.

In that sense it applies to State and local governments, and if it goes down under the Commerce Clause then State and local governments will not be governed by title II."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

I know the Ninth Circuit has said that all employment disputes under the ADA are covered only by title I, not title II, that title II addresses public services, and I know the grant of certiorari covered both, ostensibly, because the plaintiffs' cause of action appeared to address both, and I think this Court probably hasn't decided whether all employment cases fall under title I, but if we thought they did, do we have to address the title II issue? of appeals, that there would be an opportunity for briefing. In this case, the petitioners never raised an objection to title II's application to employment, so it never became an issue in this case. Now, I want to turn to the merits of the Fourteenth Amendment argument and we want to suggest as a preliminary petitioners have never really acknowledged an important body of Fourteenth Amendment decisional law, which is that even when we're dealing with groups or classifications that are covered by the rational basis standard, it is irrational for a State to act with a purpose that is irrational. A number of Supreme Court decisions have held that State action that rests on invidious prejudice, irrational fear, false stereotypes that have evolved from thing?  You look to see whether, indeed, there's a rational basis for what's been done.  If there's no rational basis, you say it must be motivated by, you know, irrational prejudice or stereotyping, or whatever."

Its membership consisted predominantly of State and local governmental officials, and it submitted a report to every Member of Congress while the ADA was under consideration recounting the findings of its own inquiries incapacity of people with disabilities to perform jobs, things that have been -- and the report goes on to say this.  Empirical studies over and over and over again have shown that these myths are false, that there is not a higher turnover rate among persons with disabilities."

And what this Court said in Cleburne is, we are not going to look first at the facial constitutionality or unconstitutionality of this statute.  We're going to require, in the unique context of a history of pervasive invidious discrimination against the disabled, what this municipality's reasons were.  And having looked at that, it concluded that the -- that it must have been motivated by an invidious intent, because the proferred reasons were not, in fact, rational. or action by States?"

I thought that the Cleburne decision was very much like Reed v. Reed in the gender area.  That is, the Court purported to apply rational basis, but came to a result that didn't square with any prior rational basis decision."

I consider all of this rational basis review. It just depends on how high the justification is and how great the reason there is to suspect that something unconstitutional may be going on. But it is clear that what Cleburne did was, in looking at the actual administrative bureaucratic decision, as opposed to the legislative choice, require an on the one hand a body of half-a-dozen or a dozen comprehensive studies detailing a widespread problem and historic unconstitutional practices, and over 5,000 narrative accounts that the congressional task force accumulated of individual instances of discrimination against the handicapped, 600 of which addressed State or local governments which for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment and State action have to be considered as one."

If the -- if in the area of discrimination against the disabled you apply heightened review, just consider the very problem of defining who is disabled and who is not under the law.   You're going to have underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness problems that would never survive heightened review, so let's hope it's rational basis scrutiny.  That was the very point of the law. Second, I've not heard anything today from the other side -- rational, it turns out they're not, they're irrational and driven by animus, they lose."

I always thought that was the job of the Government lawyer to come before the court -- the inquiry is not exactly what the Government did.  It's whether there's any rational explanation after the fact. inquiry.  There's nothing about proportionality and, as the Court said in Kimel, Florida Prepaid, and City of Boerne itself, the issue on proportionality is whether the statutory standard covers, quote, substantially more conduct than would be found unconstitutional.  That itself invalidates this law. Now, the question of discrimination, whether it exists at the society or the Government level, I think this Court's decisions from 1985, one of them written, by the way, by Justice Marshall in Alexander v. Choate, Justice Marshall says in a 9-0 decision, the main problem with disability discrimination is not one of intent.  It's one of either trying too hard, needless paternalism, or not trying hard enough, unintentional neglect.  That's the problem.
