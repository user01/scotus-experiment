    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We believe there are four independent grounds for affirming the lower court in this case. First, as the Court has just discussed, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act regulates the exercise of jurisdiction, not the underlying primary conduct of the parties. Therefore, the Act does not operate retrospectively."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, why doesn't it retro -- why -- why isn't it just as easy to say that it does operate retrospectively, because the question is, when should it exercise jurisdiction for a particular purpose? And on the one hand there's no point in exercising jurisdiction now if it's not going to adjudicate later, so so far as the court is concerned, presumably it's going to adjudicate on a substantive issue. That being the purpose, why can you -- why really does it make sense to draw that neat line?"

    "speaker": "SCHOENBERG",
    "speech": "Because the -- the operative event, the event that's being regulated by a jurisdictional statute, as the Court has said, is that exercise of the Court's power, regardless of when the underlying acts took place, the Court has differentiated between the primary conduct of the parties and the secondary conduct, which is the exercise of the Court's power. For example, just last term in the Dole Food case, the Court found that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is not intended to chill the conduct of the foreign state. Rather, it's there to decide whether now presently it would embarrass the conduct of foreign relations, and the -- 25 years ago, over 25 years ago, Congress decided that cases such as these should be allowed to go forward."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

In -­ the same district court judge who handled our case and granted jurisdiction in our case, Judge Cooper, also was given a class action case asserting World War II era claims against Austria, this is the Anderman case. And just last April, she threw out that entire class action, because the Government had come in and filed a statement of interest and asserted its interest in the -- in the case, and she found very similar to the Court's holding in Garamendi last term that the political question doctrine was implicated when the Government comes in and says that the prosecution of this particular case will interfere with foreign relations. But I've never heard any -- in any other case the Government say that a case that does not implicate foreign relations, as this one does, should be dismissed on jurisdiction grounds merely because we have justiciability concerns with other cases."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Could -- could I ask about the act of state doctrine? I mean, even -- why isn't that in play here? I mean, even if giving -- holding Austria here would not be acting retroactively insofar as the exercise of jurisdiction is concerned, why wouldn't holding Austria liable for an act of state which previously would not be a basis for -- for challenge in this country, why wouldn't that be acting retroactively?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHOENBERG",
    "speech": "Well, we haven't addressed the act of state because it hasn't been raised and it was an argument that was dropped. I -- I can answer the question though. The act of state doctrine, as I understand it, is designed to prevent courts from entering into situations where there is no settled basis for deciding the case. In other words, in the Cuban cases where there's a regime that has a completely different property system than ours, it would be unwise for the courts to venture into this political dispute over whether communism or capitalism is the appropriate way to adjudicate these cases. In our case, we have a treaty, article 26 of the Austrian State Treaty says Austria must return property taken from Jewish families during the Nazi era. So there's no dispute between the two countries as to whether or what type of law would apply in this case. And under Sabbatino, it's very much qualified by the absence of a treaty governing the rule of decision. So I -- I don't think this case could ever pose an act of state problem. Other cases do though. That -- and that's -- that's really the point. These cases against Mexico, against Japan, against Poland could potentially pose serious act of state problems. This particular case doesn't. We'd be happy to litigate it."

  {

    "speaker": "SCHOENBERG",
    "speech": "I -- well, yes and no. Yes in the sense that we do have to establish that -- that this property was taken in violation of international law, and I think that part of the statute clearly expects that the taking be adjudicated according to the state of international law at the time. So to that degree I think yes. But whether -- whether it's a public or private act I think doesn't determine the -- the retroactivity question."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHOENBERG",

I don't know how the Government explains The Santissima Trinidad case, which is a case concerning private property on a ship where not one, but several, sovereigns claimed an ownership interest, and Justice Story said that our courts, of course, have to adjudicate the ownership of that private property, regardless of whether it was taken as part of a public act. In the Santissima Trinidad, it's a confusing case, and I'm not sure, even having read it many times, how the ship came to be in its final location, but as I understand it, it went through many different, many different hands. And the question at the end was, because the sovereigns were claiming the ship, which was potentially a ship of war, does that mean that the Court could not adjudicate the ownership of cargo on the ship? And Justice Story said no."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but he -- isn't the -- the concern about the applicability of that case to this one is precisely the reason you said. It was -- it was a suit between sovereigns and we're talking here about the sovereign immunity defense in a suit by an individual, and it's rather a stretch to take that as -- as the basis for your law in this case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHOENBERG",
    "speech": "Well, I would -- I would think that the act of state doctrine, which is what we were talking about, would -- would be implicated even more strongly in a -- in a suit involving multiple sovereigns than it would with regard to just an individual against a sovereign. And I -- I -- the Government makes the position I think for the first time today that the expropriation clause sort of appeared from nowhere, but I don't think that's the case. The first section of 1605(a)(3) very clearly is the Santissima Trinidad case. That's the property is inside the United States in connection with the commercial activity. The second clause I believe arises out of the Cuban expropriation cases and the Government's experience in those cases, and it was the intention of the Government in 1976 when the executive branch proposed this law and when the Congress enacted it to allow our courts to adjudicate these types of claims."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, what -- what I'm looking for, I'm beginning to understand his answer better -- I think there should be a way, not in your case necessarily, but in general, for the Government to say, court, stay out of this case, because of the international implications. And what I was thinking is if we -- if this is jurisdictional, follow Justice Powell's distinction, that won't be a problem because there'll be other ways for them to do it. You're gradually closing those doors. One way I had thought of was act of state, but you correctly point out that the act of state doctrine does not bar anything when the claim rests upon a treaty or other unambiguous agreement, and your quoting the '55 treaty might not help you because it's post-'48, but a -- but 1907 might help you, so you're there with a treaty. And so they say, well, we can't use that one, and there'll be a lot of cases when we can't. So then I had mentioned this thing called a statement of interest, which I was looking for an explanation because I don't know what it is. And there's a third thing that you mentioned, which is called a letter about immunity. Well, that won't help them because that's what this statute is. See, so that now we're back to the statement of interest. Now, can -- what is this thing, a statement of interest? Can -- in other words, is the statement of interest sufficient to achieve the objective that I was thinking was important, that not necessarily your case, but in many other cases there has to be a way for the executive to stop the judge from deciding the matter where it really does interfere with foreign relations.

That action arose in 1975 and yet when it was brought under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act several years later, this Court directed the lower court to adjudicate jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

In Andrus, this is a case brought against the U.S. Government after the U.S. Government -- or while the case was pending, I think, the statute is changed to take away the amount in controversy requirement. So, in other words, very clearly before the suit could not proceed, now the statute's been changed without any suggestion of retroactivity in the enactment.

    "speech": "The -- the immunity consideration, yes, but I think the statute, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, was not intended to change the rules, for example, with the act of state doctrine or with the statute of the limitations or with any of the other doctrines that might bar an older claim from -- from entering court. Our third point, this I don't want to spend too much time on, but it's our view that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act merely codified the common law of sovereign immunity, and therefore, it did not substantially change the law. And this is not only my opinion. If one looks at the State Department circular that was sent out in 1976 to foreign states, it says, this enactment will not substantially alter the rules for deciding sovereign immunity questions in U.S. courts. So it was the position of the State Department at the time that they proposed this legislation that it merely codified what the State Department then considered to be the rules of sovereign immunity. And we have an interesting situation, I think an unprecedented situation, because the common law itself depended on the views of the State Department, so we have a little bit of a reflexive situation. The way I look at it, let us suppose, for example, that the -- that instead of enacting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act they issued another Tate letter, another letter that merely said, henceforth we want the courts to adjudicate things under this -- under this regime. So it's not a new statute, it's just a suggestion to the courts on how to decide cases. Under this Court's ruling with regard to common law, non-statutory law, of course that -- that approach would have to be applied retroactively, and I don't think it's any less retroactive just because the executive branch sent it over to Congress and said, we want you to pass the statute also.

    "speech": "It would be better, but that's not really how the Court's retroactivity analysis has gone over the last 10 years, and that's -- that's why I certainly favor some of the earlier arguments. I think it's easier to decide the case on those, rather than the way the Ninth Circuit did in evaluating the expectations, but if one doesn't decide in our favor on all of those other arguments, that the statute itself is jurisdictional, that Congress intended it to apply, that there's really no change in the law because it's the same as the common law of sovereign immunity, then really under Hughes one has to look at whether, as to the parties of this case, there is any retroactive effect, and that -- that's -- that's what the Hughes holding is. It's a statute phrased jurisdictionally, but let's look at what happened here. You have a new plaintiff with new incentives and a defense, substantive defense taken away. That's the Hughes case. And so it requires you to look outside the four corners of the statute to look at what was -- what are you comparing the statute to, when -- when in Hughes the Court said if it determines whether a cause of action can proceed and not where, the where question, of course, implies that you have to look and see if there are other jurisdictions where the case could be brought. And in this case, as we've made very clear, Austria could always have been sued, at least since it was re-established after World War II for these acts, and as a matter of fact, Austria was required by the United States to enact restitution laws that were designed to afford people like Mrs. Altmann relief. They have never asserted sovereign immunity in these claims in their own courts and they would not have been allowed to by the U.S. Government, and that sentiment, of course, is echoed in the subsequent treaty in 1955 and it's echoed in the Bernstein letter in 1948 that as to expropriations, as to property taken from Jewish families in violation of international law, this country does not recognize sovereign immunity anywhere, not in the states where -- where -- that were involved, and not in the United States, and that -- that's -- that's our last point and that's the Ninth Circuit's position.

So I would say as to Austria, the argument is, and I think we cited also in our brief a statement by an Austrian professor, Seidl-Hohenveldern, who said that the courts -- there's nothing in international law that prevents courts from adjudicating the rights and property taken in violation of international law. Thank you very much."

    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just on that last point, the Dralle case, which is one that we address in our reply brief, does not stand for the proposition that Czechoslovakia's expropriation could be second-guessed in Austria. Quite the contrary. Austria determined that the legality of Czechoslovakia's activities in their own -- in its own country were not subject to reconsideration in Austria. Austria concerned itself only with whether, given its own neutrality as between Czechoslovakia and Germany, whether Austria could give effect to an expropriation as an act of war. And it determined that it could not with respect to property located in Austria. That issue has nothing to do with what's before the Court today. Sovereign immunity isn't merely a form selection rule. It confers on the foreign state the right to choose whether and where to be sued. That's a substantive right. It's a right this country has always understood as a right in a sovereign. Austria's choice, if it did so choose, the circumstances under which it would provide remedies in its own country, either by statute or in its own courts, doesn't constitute a waiver of the sovereignty to which it had been accorded in this country throughout the current period up to 1976. So this country has always recognized the difference between a sovereign's right to create a remedy, and this country has done so in its own instances with respect to events that were claimed to be the subject of reparations, and by doing so it has never suggested that it thought it was subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of a foreign court for individual claims to be able to look for more than the statute of the United States provided for. In addition, with respect to the law immediately prior to the enactment of the FSIA, I think the suggestion was that somehow the United States had -- had eroded the expropriation rule or that Congress thought that it was adopting the -- codifying the law of the land with respect to expropriation in the FSIA, and that plainly is not true. The legislative history, and more importantly the statements of the State Department, in particular the -- the digest by John Boyd with respect to State Department decisions from 1952 to 1976 cited in our brief make it clear that the State Department considered this to be a fundamental change in the law. The conduct being regulated here is expropriation or at the very least possession that goes back to events in 1948 alleged in the complaint. It is not the mere question of the exercise of jurisdiction here or, worse yet, this mere substitution of another tribunal. This is something that Congress focused on in each of the expropriation exceptions. It identified the conduct that it thought the foreign sovereign had engaged in that justified one of our narrow exceptions to the general concept of foreign sovereign immunity. Whether that was an express waiver under (a)(1), whether that was the exercise of commercial conduct that any private party could engage in under (a)(2) or the -- or the expropriation of property in violation of international law in (a)(3), Congress identified the conduct that it thought justified the lifting of the generally applicable foreign sovereign immunity and decided that's the conduct we want to regulate. And that's what we think justifies the variance from our general rule with respect to sovereigns, and that is a change in the law that requires application of the retroactivity analysis to treat those sovereigns fairly. If there are no further questions, I have nothing."
