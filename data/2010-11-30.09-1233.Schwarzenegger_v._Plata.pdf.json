That said, the prisons weren't crowded. It was because there was a fundamental lack of attentiveness to medical care under those circumstances. And that's unfortunate, to be sure. More than that. But that was the reason. To go back to your point, Justice Kennedy, that's why the receiver, which is an extraordinary remedy. To confer upon a private individual the entire authority to run the California Department of Corrections, not just simply a facility or anything like that, but the entire Department of Corrections' medical and -- medical health provision, is incredible."

And that was the view of the judges who had been closest to the cases from the beginning and the view of the three-judge court generally. So how can we reach a result essentially without, you know, re-finding the facts that they've been dealing with for 20 years?"

First of all, remember that the receiver gets appointed, and then 3 months later you get a motion for a fundamental legal error I'm asking this Court to correct. But even if you get beyond that and you're looking at the primary cause analysis, it seems to me that's -- that's at most -- at best, a mixed question of law and fact, and it's the kind of standard that this Court ought to analyze to determine in the first instance and on an independent review whether or not the overcrowding is, quote, \"the primary cause of the violation.\" And what makes that inquiry particularly appropriate for this Court, as opposed to simply slavishly adhering -- deferring to the district court in this circumstance, is that the district court arbitrarily cut off the record in August of '08 and there have been enormous developments since then.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, there's a huge difference between not allowing formal tours and all of the rigamarole that goes with that, which is what the State specifically objected to. But what the State wanted to do and what the intervenors on our side in even greater vehemence wanted to do was to bring forward evidence that proved that in the interim period of time there have been, in fact, significant improvements. As I sit here today, Justice Kennedy, you said it's conceded that we're -- that we're in constitutional violation. It is conceded that we have been in constitutional violation. I don't know whether today we are in violation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But then don't you have the burden? If -- if you have -- you concede that you have been in constitutional violation, then it seems to me you have the burden of showing that's no longer the understand what the ordinary rule would be in a -- of a court of equity dealing with a constitutional violation. But we're talking about an order entered under the Prisoners Litigation Reform Act, and it's quite clear, the statute couldn't be any plainer, that it shifts the burden significantly onto the plaintiff when you are going to go for a remedy as extreme as insisting that somewhere between potentially 36,000 and 45,000 inmates be released within a -- within a 2-year period of time. Again, if you go back, you know, the receiver has not -- at the time that all of this took place, the receiver had been appointed. The receiver had devised a plan. The receiver is currently spending an enormous amount of money, $4 billion on health care, to get -- to get the system moving in the right direction, with the right attitude, in order to bring ourselves without question into constitutional compliance. The truth is we haven't really had an assessment of where we are in the constitutional compliance spectrum. much -- a much more serious problem. I don't doubt that. But it seems -- and if the Court were to conclude ultimately that Coleman ought to go back for another analysis based on the problems there, I could understand that. And it would be a very different prisoner release order under those circumstances because then you'd have to take out all of the evidence with respect to Plata and let that play out. But even that, it seems to me, would be a mistake under these circumstances where the special master and the receiver have been in a sense joined at the hip in a variety of ways. And it only makes sense, because the -- the receiver is controlling the provision of medical care in the CDCR and the special master is taking care of or trying to promote a very small slice of that. So in the scheme of things, as you might expect, the receiver consistently gets the ultimate authority to make the decisions to help provide the kind of resources, both in quality and quantity and staff and suicides happened post-trial, so you couldn't have proffered that pretrial."

And the court found that that was exactly true. Nothing else over 20 years in one case and will be able to provide those services that it can't provide now, so the doctors will have room to be able to work, which they don't have now.

It can either incarcerate 140,000 prisoners in a system built for 80,000, or it can incarcerate a -- a lesser number. If it chooses to incarcerate 148,000 prisoners in a space built for 80, it's going to incur certain obligations. And we believe, as I said in answer to Justice Breyer's question, the State could choose to use less restrictive punishments, alternative punishments, get a better bang for their buck, have more public safety. But that's -- if we -- if the court imposed choices surrounding -- surrounding the incarceration of these prisoners.

But the reality is that anytime you say you're going to release 30,000 inmates in a very compressed period of time, I guarantee you that there's going to be more crime and people are going to die on the streets of California. I mean that --there's no way out of that particular box."

That is a pulled-out-of-the-air number. Theirs was aspirational. None of that is based on what is the constitutional violation that exists at the time you adopt that particular percentage. And it seems to me that's the entire problem with this -- this exercise, which is to say we're going to fix this across the board, rather than what would make much more sense, which is to evaluate these matters facility by facility, to evaluate these matters on the basis of the various elements discrete elements of how you can reduce the prison population, and to do it in -­ in conjunction with a receiver who is in place who can help to implement this in a very systemic way and that will get us to where we want to get to."
