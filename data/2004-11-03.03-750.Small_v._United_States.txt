1 PROCEEDINGS

2 (10:01 a.m.)

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Boas, the Court will hear

4 argument in Small against the United States.

5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. BOAS

6 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7 MR. BOAS: Justice Stevens, and may it please

8 the Court:

9 This case presents the issue of whether, when

10 deciding the meaning of a statute, we will focus, as the

11 Government suggests, on two words only, any court, or

12 whether we will look at the statute as a whole, whether we

13 will consider the statute as a symmetrical and coherent

14 regulatory scheme and decide the meaning of the statute by

15 appreciating how sections relate to one another.

16 In this particular case, 922(g)(1) of 18 U.S.

17 Code is a -- represents a merger of two old sections,

18 title IV and title VII, that were passed in 1968 in the

19 Omnibus Crime Control Act. In -- in those -- in that

20 statute, we had two redundant and overlapping sections,

21 and one talked about prohibiting persons who have been

22 convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than

23 a year. One, title VII, talked about prohibiting persons

24 convicted in any court of the United States or a State of

25 a felony. There were different penalties, slightly

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 different classes of people. Title IV focused more on the

2 receiver; title VII more on the possessor. But nothing --

3 nothing about the -- these two titles, about the

4 legislative history suggests that Congress at any time

5 meant something different from the term, any court, in

6 title IV and any court of the United States in title VII.

7 And when these two were merged in 1986 in the

8 Firearms Owners' Protection Act, again, nothing suggests,

9 nothing in the comments, nothing in the statute, that

10 these two terms -- that the elimination of the language,

11 any court of the United States, was --

12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I guess we have held,

13 though, several times that Congress meant to define very

14 broadly when it enacted felon in possession of firearm

15 statutes. Did we not?

16 MR. BOAS: That's -- that's correct, Justice

17 O'Connor. However --

18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So it makes it a tougher case

19 when you use the word any because we've given the -- the

20 word any generally a broad definition.

21 MR. BOAS: Well, earlier this year in the Nixon

22 case, this Court said that when we look at any -- and that

23 was a case dealing with the meaning of any entity. Did it

24 mean any entity, public or private, or any private entity?

25 The Court said any can and does mean different things

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 depending upon the setting, and the Court said when using

2 it broadly would lead to strange and indeterminate

3 results, we'll give it a more narrow reading, which the

4 Court did.

5 Now, you're right, Justice O'Connor. This Court

6 has said that the purpose of the felon in possession

7 statute was to be broad and sweeping, but the Government

8 reiterates that view, citing repeatedly three cases,

9 Scarborough, Bass, and Lewis, and all three of those cases

10 in which the Court referred to Congress' comments and this

11 Court's own comments about the broad sweep of the statute

12 were 1202(a) cases. And so notwithstanding the fact that

13 the Court said this is a broad statute, each one of those

14 cases, Lewis, Bass, and Scarborough, were cases where by

15 definition the prohibition was against persons convicted

16 in any court of the United States or a State. So that

17 language doesn't help the Government at all because those

18 were 1202(a) cases which limited specifically the Court to

19 any court of the United States.

20 So to take the -- and I -- and -- the simplistic

21 view that as the -- as the Fourth and Sixth Circuit did

22 and as the Government does here, that any means any,

23 without regard to the rest of the statute, is simply -- is

24 -- is too narrow a focus.

25 Let's look at the statute. It's true that the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 word -- the term, the two words, any court, is not

2 defined. But if we look in the definitions section, the

3 term, crime punishable by more than a year, is defined.

4 And so what we should really be focusing on is the phrase,

5 convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than

6 a year. And that definition says the term, crime

7 punishable by more than a year, excludes any State or

8 Federal antitrust or business regulatory offense.

9 Now, if we exclude from the definition of crime

10 punishable by more than a year and the Government's -- if

11 we exclude from that any State or Federal antitrust law

12 and the Government's interpretation is adopted, then we're

13 left with the anomalous result that if a person is

14 convicted of an antitrust offense in this country, they're

15 allowed to possess a firearm. If they're convicted of one

16 in France or England, they can't.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Are there any such cases? I

18 mean, I never heard actually --

19 MR. BOAS: No.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- when people -- no. I mean,

21 are there any cases in which France or England has

22 convicted people of an antitrust violation punishable by

23 imprisonment for more than a year? I -- I didn't know

24 that their antitrust laws had a criminal aspect, though I

25 haven't looked it up.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BOAS: Nor have I --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Well, I -- I've never

3 heard if anyone in any foreign country, other than ours,

4 though I gather my law clerk found that in Japan, in fact,

5 Japan does have a criminal antitrust law. They may be the

6 only ones outside the United States, and I don't know that

7 anyone has ever been convicted under it because they're

8 not too -- or they didn't used to be too fierce on

9 antitrust enforcement.

10 MR. BOAS: Well, 921(20) or --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just wondering how

12 anomalous or your anomaly is.

13 (Laughter.)

14 MR. BOAS: Well, the -- the limitation not only

15 excludes antitrust offenses, it excludes any business

16 regulatory offense.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: And are there such?

18 MR. BOAS: Of course. I think --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, maybe.

20 MR. BOAS: Yes.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't -- I don't -- but I

22 just -- are we sure that there -- that, you know, that

23 this anomaly exists?

24 MR. BOAS: I'm certain that there are

25 business regulatory crimes throughout the world.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they say any State or

2 Federal? I mean, in -- in a way this provision -- you --

3 you may say that the -- that the substantive effect of the

4 provision supports your interpretation, but the text of

5 the provision supports the Government's --

6 MR. BOAS: Well --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because if any only means

8 State or Federal, there was no need to say State or

9 Federal in this provision. You could have simply said any

10 in this provision, just as you said it elsewhere. So one

11 would think that they said State or Federal because they

12 wanted to exclude foreign antitrust matters.

13 MR. BOAS: Well, this same limitation, Justice

14 Scalia, existed as a limitation under 1202(a) where any

15 court said any State or Federal court and the exclusion

16 said any State or Federal court. It's consistent --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't care how it got

18 there. I'm just saying there -- there -- if -- if any

19 means what you said it means, namely State or Federal,

20 there would have been no need to limit this other

21 provision to State or Federal because the whole statute

22 would only cover State or Federal.

23 MR. BOAS: Well, but at some point in the

24 statute, Congress has to give an indication of their

25 intent, and this is where it is.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 For example, there's another limitation

2 immediately following it which says it shall also not

3 include any State offense which is described as a

4 misdemeanor in the State and carries no more than 2 years.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Well, but -- but Justice

6 Scalia's point -- and I -- I think he's correct -- is that

7 this cuts at least as much in favor of the Government as

8 you and probably more because you would make Federal and

9 State unnecessary surplus.

10 MR. BOAS: Well, there has to be some

11 indication --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't -- you don't set

13 forth the main qualification to the main definition in a

14 -- in a later subsection.

15 MR. BOAS: Well, if we go further with 921(20),

16 there's another limitation that again clearly deals with

17 States, and that's the restoration of civil rights

18 provision. The Government concedes in their brief -- and

19 that was an effort to essentially statutorily reverse the

20 Dickerson v. Banner Institute case -- that that applies to

21 State situations. The idea that if a person receives a

22 State pardon or his record is expunged, that wouldn't be a

23 disqualifying factor. And they talk about the law of the

24 foreign state being what determines whether it's a

25 conviction or not. Now, clearly we're not looking at

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 going to some pardon process in Germany or Uruguay to

2 decide whether a person still has a conviction.

3 Another part of the statute that's very clear,

4 924(e)(1). That's the armed career criminal section.

5 That section says that if a person's who's convicted under

6 922(g)(1), our statute, and has three prior serious drug

7 convictions in a court described in 922(g)(1), then they

8 get 15 years. Now, that definition of serious drug

9 conviction is a State or Federal conviction.

10 Now, let's flip over to 21 U.S.C. 802(44), the

11 drug statute where you have a similar recidivist type of

12 statute where you go from a 5-year mandatory to a 10-year

13 mandatory if you have a prior drug conviction. There in

14 802(44), a serious drug offense is defined as a State,

15 Federal, or foreign drug offense. So we see that Congress

16 can differentiate when it wants to.

17 Now, they're --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would -- would you concede

19 that -- that this is at least sloppy drafting? Because

20 they said any in one place, they said State or Federal in

21 other places. Shouldn't they be -- be consistent in their

22 terminology?

23 MR. BOAS: Well, perhaps they should be more

24 consistent, Justice Ginsburg, but the overall -- I mean,

25 if you go down the list of the prohibitions in 922(g)(1),

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you can see that the thrust of this is -- is to deal with

2 domestic situations. There's one that says you can't own

3 a firearm if you're a -- a fugitive from law -- a fugitive

4 from justice. That's specifically defined as a fugitive

5 from another State within the United States.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Boas, I think you make a

7 strong argument that Congress probably didn't think of

8 this particular problem. Do you suppose if at the

9 hearings before the committee, the process of the

10 legislation, some witness came in and said, do you realize

11 this language is so broad it will cover the person who is

12 convicted of a felony in Japan, as well as person who's

13 convicted of a felony in Illinois, do you think they would

14 have modified the statute?

15 MR. BOAS: I think they would have. I think

16 that -- I don't concede that there was really a need to,

17 but I think they would have because they would have said

18 it's --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, there would have been a

20 need to under your view now.

21 MR. BOAS: That's right. But they would have

22 historically going back to '68 and before, we always

23 intended this to just cover domestic situations.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I suppose somebody on the

25 committee might have said, well, we don't want this kind

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of person to have a gun, and the fact he's convicted in

2 Japan rather than in Brooklyn really doesn't make any

3 difference with regard to the purpose of the statute.

4 MR. BOAS: If the individual is convicted in

5 Japan, Justice Stevens, then he would not be under our

6 immigration laws allowed to come to this country, and if

7 he did come --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but this person --

9 MR. BOAS: -- he'd be an illegal alien.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the defendant in this case

11 was convicted in Japan and he somehow got to the United

12 States.

13 MR. BOAS: Well, because he's an American

14 citizen.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well --

16 MR. BOAS: So -- but Congress can't cure every

17 problem that exists in the world, and this statute is

18 fairly comprehensive.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Are people really not allowed

20 to come in if they've been convicted of any crime?

21 MR. BOAS: Any crime that carries more than a

22 year basically. It's pretty --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it was a crime like not

24 wearing a veil if you're a woman in a country that --

25 suppose it was a crime like criticizing the government if

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you were in Soviet Russia. Suppose it was a crime like --

2 you know, there are all kinds of crimes that we -- we

3 would never consider crimes --

4 MR. BOAS: Well, that's --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and in other countries there

6 are -- we don't let anyone in if they've done any of those

7 things?

8 MR. BOAS: No. Well, those people will probably

9 be seeking political asylum. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn --

10 under the Government's interpretation, Nobel Prize winners

11 would be precluded from -- Solzhenitsyn did 8 years in a

12 Soviet prison because he said nasty things about Joseph

13 Stalin. Two American women in Afghanistan, before the

14 fall of the Taliban regime, were arrested and convicted

15 because they possessed Bibles. Now, the Government says,

16 well, these are anomalies. These don't occur often. But

17 Congress had to be aware of the possibility of tinhorn

18 dictatorships all over the world having court systems that

19 were so devoid of due process that we have to take a look

20 at whether we want to --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the court of

22 appeals here said what it would -- it read in a check. It

23 said it wouldn't read it to really mean any conviction.

24 It had to be in a system that was fundamentally fair.

25 Wasn't that what the court of appeals said?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BOAS: That's what they said, but -- but

2 when and how do we decide that? There's another offense

3 under 922(g) -- or under 922 that makes it a crime to

4 give a false answer on a -- a firearms questionnaire when

5 you go to buy the gun -- buy the gun. Now, what does the

6 individual do? Does he say to the firearms dealer, do you

7 have a list of countries where our Government has decided

8 it's a fair enough system that I can say no -- yes, I have

9 a conviction in view of the list that it's an unfair

10 system so I can say yes, I have no -- or no, I have no

11 convictions?

12 I mean, it -- one of the reasons where we

13 employ, for example, the rule of lenity, is -- is a person

14 put on notice of what it is that's criminal and what is

15 not. When does it come up that the system isn't fair

16 enough to count?

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think -- let -- let's

18 put, you know, the worst for you. If it were put to

19 Congress, which would you prefer, that -- that

20 Solzhenitsyn not be able to have a gun or that the worst

21 kind of violent criminal convicted and imprisoned and

22 escaped from a foreign country who manages to get into

23 this country can go in and buy a gun? Which -- which of

24 these two would you prefer? And I think I'd say, well,

25 you know, it's tough on Solzhenitsyn he can't own a gun,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 but he'll probably get over it.

2 (Laughter.)

3 MR. BOAS: Well, what I'd prefer and what the

4 statute means aren't necessarily the same thing, Your

5 Honor. I'd prefer violent criminals who are dangerous

6 not to have guns. But again, that --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you put the question to

8 Congress, which would you prefer? Would you prefer the

9 occasional person who's been convicted of a foreign court,

10 comes over here, that this statute doesn't apply to him,

11 or would you prefer that all the refugees from Eastern

12 Europe and people who come from Arab countries and people

13 who come from countries that have quite different systems

14 in places all over the world discover that suddenly

15 they're felons because of things they never would have

16 dreamt of because they were perhaps convicted of selling

17 gasoline on the open market or perhaps they were convicted

18 of any of these religious crimes we've talked about,

19 selling a Bible? Suppose you put that question to

20 Congress.

21 MR. BOAS: I think Congress would say the perils

22 and problems that exist by a blanket inclusion without any

23 method of determining which count and which don't count of

24 foreign convictions are too great. Now --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's a -- if it's a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 matter of notice and -- then that's a separate issue.

2 Plus the Government, it seems to me, should put on its

3 form that this includes foreign conviction, and that

4 solves that problem.

5 MR. BOAS: Well, but what if it's a foreign

6 conviction where there's no due process? Is there a

7 checklist that in that foreign conviction, did you have a

8 jury, did you have the right to confront your accuser, did

9 you have the right to remain silent? I mean, we all seem

10 to realize that the Government's position that any

11 conviction anywhere is too stark a place. And again --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May -- may we go back to the

13 -- the choice that you were given by Justice Scalia first

14 and then Justice Breyer? I thought that someone who comes

15 in here illegally and possesses a gun commits an offense.

16 MR. BOAS: That's right.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so there's not

18 -- Congress would say to that hypothetical, we've got a

19 third choice, much more sensible. Anybody who sneaks in

20 here without permission and has a gun --

21 MR. BOAS: That's correct.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- commits a crime.

23 MR. BOAS: That's one of the subsections of

24 922(g)(5). Anybody who's an illegal alien here illegally

25 can't have a gun. Anyone --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't cover Americans,

2 of course --

3 MR. BOAS: No. It doesn't cover --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- who go -- go and commit

5 crimes abroad, are convicted abroad, and -- and come back

6 to home sweet home and then get a gun. I mean, that seems

7 to me extraordinary.

8 MR. BOAS: That -- I didn't hear your --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to me extraordinary.

10 I don't think Congress would have wanted that.

11 MR. BOAS: Well, I don't think Congress can be

12 said to have intended or envisioned that they would cure

13 every problem in the world. It's a very, very narrow

14 category of American citizens convicted abroad who come

15 back here.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think if there was a problem

17 that -- that they were going to leave unsolved, it is less

18 likely the problem of having an American citizen killed by

19 a gun toted by somebody who has been convicted of a crime

20 abroad than it is the problem of somebody having been

21 convicted abroad of some silly crime like wearing a veil

22 or not wearing a veil or something else. If -- if it's

23 either of those two problems that they meant to leave

24 overlooked, I would say it's the latter. They might well

25 have said, well, the courts will take care of that.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BOAS: Well, Your Honor, it's unclear what

2 -- what their thought process was in this matter. But I

3 can say this, that the narrow category that escapes the

4 coverage of this statute -- there's nothing to indicate

5 anywhere in any of the debates, in the language of the

6 statute that that's what Congress intended.

7 And again, if you look at the overall view here,

8 I mean, fugitive from justice. It's limited to someone

9 from the State. Person -- let's look at 922(g)(9). Very

10 clear, incapable of misunderstanding. The same prefatory

11 language. A person convicted in any court -- exactly the

12 same, and it ends with the same language -- cannot ship,

13 possess, receive. And what does it say? Instead of

14 saying convicted of a crime punishable by more than a

15 year, it says convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic

16 violence. And that's defined as a State or Federal

17 misdemeanor.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is that defined?

19 MR. BOAS: That's defined in 921(a)(33), Your

20 Honor. It's specifically limited.

21 Now, here we are. A person who beats his wife

22 in England can have a gun in this country, but a person

23 who commits a business regulatory offense in Germany

24 can't. It makes no sense. The -- it -- it's a very clear

25 statement by Congress that a misdemeanor crime of domestic

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 violence -- they're only intending it to be a State or

2 Federal crime.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Once again, that -- that cuts

4 both ways. Why would they -- if the text reads the way

5 you say it reads, why did they have to say is a

6 misdemeanor under Federal or State law? Because it

7 wouldn't have mattered. The only courts -- the only

8 convictions that would be covered would be Federal or

9 State convictions. They would not need that -- that

10 qualification.

11 MR. BOAS: At -- at some point a person has to

12 be told what Congress was intending. This language goes

13 back to '68 where the language in the exclusion limiting

14 it to State -- excluding Federal and State convictions

15 matched the language in the term, any court, in 1202(a),

16 which was title VII. They were -- they were complementing

17 each other.

18 And -- and if you look at even as far back as

19 the Batchelder decision in the '70's from this Court, the

20 Court talked about these two being redundant, overlapping,

21 the only difference being that one uses the term felony,

22 one uses the term crime punishable by more than a year.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Boas, when they combined

24 these two --

25 MR. BOAS: Yes.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and ones -- the 1202 did

2 say Federal or State -- they made other changes,

3 harmonizations. In the explanation of their consolidation

4 of the two sections, to what extent did they discuss

5 changes and the reasons for them?

6 MR. BOAS: The -- they made no discussion of the

7 reason for taking out the language, of the United States

8 or of any State, and what they -- the only language was

9 that we're intending to merge these into one statute --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they did -- they did

11 explain other things --

12 MR. BOAS: Yes.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- other changes, but this

14 one -- there's silence --

15 MR. BOAS: Exactly.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as far as I understand.

17 MR. BOAS: And -- and by keeping in the

18 exclusions, by -- by looking at 924(e)(1) where it --

19 what's very important to me is that 924(e)(1) says if you

20 have three prior drug -- serious drug offenses in a court

21 referred to in 922(g)(1), you get 15 years. Those three

22 prior three drug offenses in a court referred to in

23 922(g)(1) are State or Federal drug offenses by

24 definition. It seems to me that it really couldn't be any

25 more clear.

20

1 And frankly, to the extent it's not totally

2 clear and it could go either way, I think then the rule of

3 lenity requires that it be decided with a more narrow

4 construction, that is, that any court meant any court of

5 the State or of the United States.

6 I believe it was in the -- in the '90's when

7 this Court's opinion, authored by Justice Thomas in I

8 think it was called Alvarez-Sanchez, dealt with a statute,

9 3105 dealing with the admissibility of confessions in

10 Federal cases and that they won't be inadmissible if

11 they're taken by any law enforcement official more than 6

12 hours after the arrest. And the issue what does any mean

13 in terms of any law enforcement official. And the Court

14 said it means any State or Federal law enforcement

15 official. Now, it didn't have to reach the issue of

16 whether it included foreign law enforcement officials, but

17 certain things are obvious without an -- an explanation.

18 And you're right. There was some sloppy

19 drafting here and it could have been more clear, but when

20 we look at the statute as a whole and try to harmonize the

21 various parts of that statute, it would be almost absurd

22 to think, when we look -- and -- and maybe these anomalies

23 won't occur all the time, as you point out, Justice

24 Breyer, but it would almost be absurd to think that with

25 all of these limitations, exclusions, when we run down the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 list under 922(g)(1), that Congress was talking about any

2 court in the world. Now --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me -- let me ask you the

4 question the -- the Chief Justice would ask, were he here,

5 because he always asked this kind of a question. What --

6 if you had to pick your best case of ours which

7 interpreted the word any in the way that you would like us

8 to interpret here, what's -- what's the best case you

9 have?

10 MR. BOAS: I'd say -- that's -- there's a

11 question --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a good question. He asks

13 good questions.

14 MR. BOAS: It's a good question.

15 (Laughter.)

16 MR. BOAS: I'd say the Nixon case decided this

17 year which said that any can and does mean different

18 things depending upon the setting and whether it works

19 strange and indeterminate results would be one of my best

20 cases. There's -- when I sit down, I'll probably think of

21 a better one, but --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe you can think --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how about --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe you can think of a

25 unanimous case.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BOAS: Well -
-

2 (Laughter.) 


3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And this is one I'm -- I'm


4 surprised that you didn't cite, but it -- I don't think

5 you did -- EEOC against Arabian American Oil Company,

6 where the wording of the statute was anyplace outside the

7 United States, title VII coverage, and this Court held

8 that anyplace outside the United States did not mean that

9 a U.S. employer operating abroad had to abide by the anti-

10 discrimination norms with respect to hiring in some place

11 abroad because Congress was thinking in terms of the

12 inter-State sitting -- setting and not

13 international.

14 MR. BOAS: Well, I -- I'm not familiar with that

15 case.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that was a decision

17 by the Chief. So --

18 (Laughter.)

19 MR. BOAS: That's a good one -- that's a good one

20 too, Judge -- Justice.

21 I -- I -- there's -- there's another case that

22 I'd refer to which is the -- the Gonzales case, which is

23 cited by the Government. Gonzales is interesting because

24 it deals with 924(c)(1), which is the section that says

25 you get 5 consecutive years if you're convicted of -- 5

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 years consecutive to any other sentence if you're

2 convicted of possessing a firearm during the course of a

3 serious drug offense. And in that case, the Court

4 concluded that any other sentence meant any State or

5 Federal sentence, not just a Federal sentence.

6 Now, the Government might argue that that helps

7 them because the -- the defendant in that case wanted it

8 to be limited to any Federal sentence because he was

9 serving a State sentence, and the question was would the 5

10 years for the 924 violation be consecutive or concurrent,

11 as the trial court gave it.

12 But it -- what the Court did was say any depends

13 on the context of the rest of the statute. And here, we

14 think it means State and Federal. They didn't talk about

15 foreign convictions.

16 You know, it's interesting. It's ironic that --

17 that while we're debating how American citizens should be

18 impacted by foreign convictions, the administration is

19 unwilling to sign the treaty that would make American

20 citizens subject to the International Criminal Court

21 because there's concern about what would happen to

22 Americans abroad, even in that court, not in a court in --

23 in Uruguay or in North Korea, but in the International

24 Criminal Court.

25 In fact, in the preliminary findings of the FOPA

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statute, the -- the Congress said -- and this Court

2 doesn't have to decide and I'm not asking the Court to

3 decide the Second Amendment issue, but Congress found the

4 Second Amendment was a fundamental constitutional right.

5 And the name of the statute is the Firearms Owners'

6 Protection Act. Congress had in mind protecting the

7 owners of firearms when necessary, and --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: You call that FOPA? That's the

9 name of the statute?

10 (Laughter.)

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's an unfortunate acronym,

12 isn't it?

13 (Laughter.)

14 MR. BOAS: That's right. The spelling is a

15 little bit different, Justice Scalia.

16 But Congress -- the -- the name of the statute

17 tells you something about Congress' intent. The otherwise

18 licit and blameless activity of possessing a firearm isn't

19 the equivalent of selling drugs. Now, maybe if you have a

20 prior drug offense and you're a drug dealer, under 802 of

21 21, Congress said you get your sentence doubled whether

22 it's a State, Federal, or foreign conviction, but under

23 924(e) for a conviction under a court defined in

24 922(g)(1), the prior only ups your sentence if it's a

25 State or Federal conviction. We can't ignore the overall

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statutory scheme here, which time and time again refers to

2 domestic matters.

3 The Government in their brief says foreign

4 convictions are used all the time, and they give three

5 examples. They say we recognize them for the purpose of

6 extraditing American citizens. They say we recognize them

7 because if you're convicted of a -- a sex offense in

8 certain foreign countries, you have to register here. And

9 they say we recognize them -- I forget what their third

10 reason is. But there's no example that they gave or that

11 they can give where a foreign conviction is ever used

12 anywhere else in this country as an element of the crime.

13 I mean, it's used for recidivist purposes and State courts

14 have debated back and forth whether we're going to double

15 somebody's sentence because of a foreign conviction, but

16 it's never used anywhere else as an element of the crime.

17 This -- this would be a first, and it's pretty

18 significant.

19 To me it's ironic that the Sentencing Commission

20 said you can't use a foreign conviction simply to up

21 somebody a few months in the guidelines. But the

22 Government here argues that we can use it to satisfy an

23 element of the crime --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Recidivism is an element of the

25 crime. If -- if you have a crime of, you know, repeated

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 felony, recidivism is an element.

2 MR. BOAS: Well, that -- that's correct, Your

3 Honor. Of course, the -- it's an exception under Apprendi

4 that the -- the prior crime. But what -- what I'm saying

5 is it's -- it's a slightly different situation in terms of

6 it being -- I know we have Blakely and the whole

7 sentencing factor issue. But it -- it's a slightly

8 different use of a prior and making -- in other -- in all

9 those cases, the -- it's a crime whether or not you have a

10 felony. The felony might make it a more serious crime.

11 In our case, this isn't a crime without this

12 felony. That's the thing that makes it a crime. And what

13 I'm saying is the only situation we have where something

14 that's otherwise blameless conduct becomes a crime is the

15 use of a felony. There's no other situation where a

16 foreign felony is employed or has been employed in that

17 situation.

18 If there's no other questions, I'd like to, if

19 it would please the Court, reserve the --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm sorry. You've exhausted

21 your time.

22 MR. BOAS: I have. Well, thank you.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Millett.

24 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

25 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. MILLETT: Justice Stevens, and may it please

2 the Court:

3 Justice Scalia, you asked about what case we

4 would want to adopt and be our strongest case on the

5 meaning of the word any in the statute, and my answer to

6 that question, although I take the liberty of answering

7 it, though you didn't ask me --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can ask it as well --

9 (Laughter.)

10 MS. MILLETT: -- is the Gonzales case where this

11 Court said that the word any in the gun control law, in

12 this context, in this framework means, read naturally --

13 I'm quoting here. Read naturally, the word any has an

14 expansive meaning, that is, one or some indiscriminately

15 of whatever kind.

16 This is not, Justice Ginsburg, a statute where

17 Congress wrote sloppily. In fact, in Barrett and

18 Huddleston, this Court specifically said and noted that

19 excruciating care with which Congress wrote title IV,

20 section --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- there's an

22 overarching concern and I'll -- I'd like to put it to you

23 right from the beginning. When a legislature legislates,

24 be it the State or Federal Government, it is generally

25 thinking in terms of its own domain, its own bailiwick.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 When Congress legislates, it's thinking about the United

2 States. Sometimes it's thinking about abroad, but most of

3 the time when it is, it says so.

4 And we have a number of cases, not just the

5 Arabian American Oil Company. I mean, that -- the

6 language of title VII was between a State and anyplace

7 outside thereof, anyplace outside thereof. And in that

8 very case, the Chief made the point that I'm putting to

9 you now, that Congress thinks about the United States, our

10 country, and if it means to say something that will take

11 in other places in the world, it says so clearly. And we

12 don't make the assumption that Congress was intending to

13 have any extraterritorial flip to its law unless it tells

14 us that.

15 That's my overall concern about the Government's

16 position in this case.

17 MS. MILLETT: Justice Ginsburg, this is not an

18 extraterritorial application of a statute. This regulates

19 a threat to American public safety within the United

20 States by someone within the United States based on their

21 conduct, possession of a firearm by a dangerous person

22 within the United States. That is not extraterritorial

23 application of the law.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --

25 MS. MILLETT: That's no more --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- but let me just interrupt

2 on your -- your best case suggestion. I don't think the

3 test is when has the word any been used in different ways,

4 but has the word any court ever been used by Congress to

5 include foreign courts.

6 MS. MILLETT: The -- the phrase convicted in any

7 court --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. I'm asking about just the

9 words, any court. What's your best case for the

10 proposition that that would normally be construed by

11 Congress to include foreign courts?

12 MS. MILLETT: I don't -- I don't have a case

13 that specifically talks about --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't have a case.

15 MS. MILLETT: -- that yet, but if I can -- if I

16 can explain why the phrase convicted in any court --

17 because any court -- the -- the problem is you're not

18 -- there's not a case for that. The word, any court, that

19 -- those two words appear in a lot of places in the United

20 States Code.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: And do they ever refer to

22 foreign courts? That's the question.

23 MS. MILLETT: The -- not -- not that I'm aware

24 of, but -- but they don't -- it -- it doesn't address it

25 one way or the other. Most of the times, the vast

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 majority of the times that you see any court in the United

2 States, it -- in the United States Code, it's followed by

3 qualifying terms.

4 What's very important here is that the phrase

5 convicted in any court without qualification. There's

6 lots of any courts in the United States --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the reason you often need

8 qualification is there's -- there's sort of a basic

9 question, does this include State courts as well as -- as

10 well as Federal, and it's often necessary to spell it out

11 one way or the other. But I don't -- I'm not aware of any

12 precedent for trying to decide whether it also embraces

13 foreign courts.

14 MS. MILLETT: Justice Stevens, if I could make

15 two points. Again, convicted in any court is rarely

16 employed by Congress. Rarely. And we've cited in our

17 brief on the occasions it has been employed, the context

18 and structure are wholly consistent with including foreign

19 judgments. The PATRIOT Act created a ban on the

20 possession of biological agents or toxins, and it -- it

21 picked up this same phrase and put it in there, and I

22 think it is -- would -- and that is also a statute that in

23 a separate provision has extraterritorial application.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: How many times have you used

25 this statute to go after people who were convicted in a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 foreign court?

2 MS. MILLETT: It -- it's -- I can't give you an

3 exact number because we --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: About, approximate.

5 MS. MILLETT: -- we don't know about the ones

6 that we never hear about.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: More like 100, more like 50,

8 more like 10, more like 5? About how many?

9 MS. MILLETT: It's -- it's not that -- I would

10 -- I would say there's probably 10 to a dozen, but I -- I

11 have to --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: 10 to a dozen over how long a

13 period of time? 20 years, 18 years?

14 MS. MILLETT: Since 1968. It's been on the

15 books since 1968.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: '68. Now -- so 35-40 years.

17 Now -- now, how many times do you think that

18 people -- I mean, the -- the -- if you've used it only a

19 dozen times or so in about 40 years, then it doesn't sound

20 like a major threat. What I'm weighing against that is

21 the possibility that people are really convicted abroad of

22 selling Bibles. That really does happen, and there really

23 were economic crimes in 1968 in all the Eastern European

24 countries, and these aren't fanciful examples I've been

25 giving you.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And so if you were in Congress -- or -- or why

2 do you think that Congress would have wanted to get the

3 courts into the mess of trying to decide why wouldn't

4 those crimes be covered and were the procedures fair? And

5 we start distinguishing one country from another. And

6 what are the procedures in the Ukraine or Kazakhstan

7 anyway? I mean, my goodness, what a mess for the sake of

8 a dozen cases in 40 years.

9 MS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer -- and Justice

10 Stevens, I do want to get back because I do have a lower

11 court case that interprets any court in the way you

12 discussed. I want to get back to that.

13 But Justice Breyer, I understand this being a

14 very important concern, and -- and there are no doubt

15 particular applications that could seem unappealing, just

16 as in Lewis v. United States where this Court held that an

17 invalid, a patently unconstitutional State conviction

18 counts for section 922(g)(1). The reason that the -- the

19 convictions are covered here is Congress was not --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which was it? Just -- what

21 was the case you just mentioned?

22 MS. MILLETT: Lewis v. United States, and that

23 is -- that's really our favorite case, although we like

24 the word of -- definition Gonzales has for any. But in

25 Lewis v. United States, this Court addressed the question

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 whether the ban on possession of firearms by someone

2 convicted of, I'll say, a felony, a term of imprisonment

3 of more than 1 year, applies to -- to convictions that are

4 allegedly unconstitutional under State law or may, in

5 fact, be unconstitutionally entered. They could have been

6 the product of a coerced confession. The allegation there

7 was lack of representation of counsel.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that -- that example,

9 which you gave in your brief, gave me this concern. The

10 problem that you've just been describing, the State

11 convictions that may be invalid but is being used under

12 922, I regard that as a kind of a venue question because

13 you can go back to the State that rendered the conviction

14 and say, State, I was convicted in violation of the

15 Constitution, give me my good habeas writ that I get --

16 can get from the State. Then I wipe out that conviction

17 and I don't have it anymore.

18 But the person who's been convicted, say, in

19 whatever examples -- take -- Zimbabwe would be another

20 example. Libya. To go back to that system and get a

21 conviction expunged. That's why you can't use a case

22 within the U.S. system where it's a question of where do

23 you go to wipe out your prior conviction. And for someone

24 abroad, there isn't that option.

25 MS. MILLETT: Justice Ginsburg, in Daniels v.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 United States, which dealt with 924, the sentencing

2 enhancement provision, but it has a -- the parallel and

3 incorporates 922(g)(1) convictions, this Court held -- a

4 plurality of this Court held in divided opinions that -- in

5 fact, that the -- the bar -- or that you still count an

6 unconstitutional or allegedly unconstitutional State

7 conviction, even if it was never appealed and that -- and

8 there is no more opportunity for appeal. The time has

9 passed. And under 922(g)(1), we also count.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- that's a

11 question of waiver or forfeiture. Those are the ordinary

12 rules that apply.

13 MS. MILLETT: Yes, but that --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but there's a basic

15 rule in civil as well as criminal procedure, that if you

16 want to attack a judgment, you go where that judgment was

17 rendered. And of course, you should abide by the timing

18 rules of that, but that's just a very sensible thing

19 within a federal union. If you're -- if you're attacking

20 what State A does, go to State A, don't tell State C.

21 MS. MILLETT: And --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that doesn't

23 operate internationally.

24 MS. MILLETT: Well, it does certainly in this

25 case. He could have appealed his conviction in Japan and

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 he did not. So he had a forum to do that in. But --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you're not building

3 that into your interpretation of the statute at all

4 because you have said in your brief -- and correct me if

5 I've got you wrong -- you don't like what the Third

6 Circuit did. You say just the fact of the conviction

7 counts. Don't investigate, court, whether it was a fair

8 system that comports with fundamental notions of due

9 process. Just see if there's a conviction anyplace in the

10 world. And so what -- what you're telling me is that it

11 doesn't matter that you didn't appeal because even if he

12 were precluded from appealing for some reason that we

13 would consider totally unfair, it doesn't matter on your

14 view of this statute.

15 MS. MILLETT: That -- that's right, Justice

16 Ginsburg, and that is -- you know, the -- the statute also

17 bars receipt of firearms by anyone who's under indictment.

18 And that application applies even though you can't appeal,

19 except for exceptional circumstances. You can't appeal an

20 indictment. And the 922(g)(1) bar, this Court's decision

21 in Lewis made clear, is that it still applies unless and

22 until your conviction is overturned. So you don't have to

23 have had a -- a conviction vetted through the appellate

24 process before the bar attaches.

25 In -- in the immigration context --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- that's standard

2 for judgments anyway. When the judgment is final, it

3 means you've gotten through the first -- it has preclusive

4 effect. Almost always, when a judgment is overturned on

5 appeal, then you go back to State 2 and say, look, it's

6 been overturned on appeal, and at least in the civil side,

7 almost always State 2 will say, okay, we'll give you post-

8 judgment relief because what we were relying on as our

9 sister State judgment is no longer on the books. I can't

10 imagine that in our criminal system it doesn't work the

11 same way.

12 MS. MILLETT: Well, certainly in immigration and

13 extradition, you don't get to appeal the validity of your

14 foreign conviction or the -- the processes that led to it.

15 So this is not an alien concept.

16 And it's very important to understand what

17 Congress was doing here. This isn't --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking if it's alien in

19 our criminal justice system, not in deportation, not in --

20 extradition is somebody who did somebody -- something

21 abroad, and we don't send people just to anyplace. Don't

22 we have to have a treaty?

23 MS. MILLETT: Right. We have treaties with more

24 than 100 countries and we don't -- and -- and the courts

25 do not examine the fairness of the proceedings or --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the person is going

2 to be tried in that other system, and we have bound --

3 within our international system, we say we're part of a

4 world community and we want Japan to extradite people who

5 have done bad things here to the United States, and so

6 similarly, we will extradite to Japan. We don't want them

7 to look at our system and judge it. We're sending

8 somebody to be tried there. So extradition is -- is

9 something entirely different than --

10 MS. MILLETT: Although we -- we do also

11 extradite, just to serve sentences, where there may have

12 already been a trial that could be as flawed as anyone

13 could conceive or articulate. So --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we have the check

15 already that these are -- these are places with whom we want

16 to do criminal justice business together. So --

17 MS. MILLETT: Well, what we have is the check

18 that the political branches have decided that it's

19 important to attach significance to foreign court --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then we have the -- we

21 have the document where it's very clear we want to have

22 extradition with the UK, with Japan. Here, you're relying

23 on the word court, and you don't have it all spelled out

24 like you do in an extradition treaty. And that's the

25 problem here. Sure, if Congress had said we mean foreign

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 court, then that would be it, but it hasn't said that and

2 we have to determine does it mean the same thing as it

3 means in the extradition context or the deportation

4 context where you have a clear statement that Congress

5 means a tribunal abroad.

6 MS. MILLETT: In fact, in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a) which

7 -- which -- admissibility criterion for aliens,

8 convictions of moral turpitude, there's no reference to

9 whether it's a conviction by a foreign court or a domestic

10 court.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if somebody is coming

12 into the country, somebody is asking to come in, any

13 conviction that you're talking about, of course, refers to

14 someplace abroad.

15 MS. MILLETT: No. No, it doesn't, Justice

16 Ginsburg, because frequently and throughout that same

17 statute, it refers to convictions in the United States. A

18 lot of times the reason for inadmissibility, including the

19 Mariel Cubans cases this Court heard last month, is -- is

20 convictions committed in the United States.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I interrupt this --

22 MS. MILLETT: Now, surely the context --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this colloquy to raise

24 another question, if I may? Would you concede that there

25 are some tribunals in the world that are comparable to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 what you might call a kangaroo court that Congress would

2 not have intended to include within the term court?

3 MS. MILLETT: Yes, Justice Stevens. And I think

4 that's an important thing here. There has been no

5 contest, for obvious reasons -- we're dealing with Japan

6 -- as to what Congress meant by court. And sometimes if

7 it's Saddam Hussein's --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: And how are we to decide

9 whether such tribunal should be treated as a court within

10 the meaning of the statute when there is no statutory

11 definition of the term court?

12 MS. MILLETT: Through traditional rules of

13 statutory construction. I think that would involve

14 looking at the other -- the -- the background that

15 Congress would have enacted the statute against, first of

16 all, and that -- that may well have -- it may not have

17 been courts of just the United States because, as we know,

18 Congress twice deleted that limitation from the statute.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if you concede that there

20 are some tribunals that are not courts within the meaning

21 of the statute, are you not conceding that the word court

22 is inherently ambiguous?

23 MS. MILLETT: I -- I am -- I am conceding that

24 -- that it has to be given meaning. I don't know that I

25 would call it ambiguous, if we have to figure out. But I

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- what I will say is that the phrase --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it's something less than

3 the all-inclusive term, any court, in a literal sense.

4 MS. MILLETT: Any -- it has to be -- it has to

5 be a court capable of entering convictions. I don't -- I

6 don't think it's ambiguous in a sense --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, it doesn't --

8 it's -- it's not a tennis court or an inner court.

9 (Laughter.)

10 MS. MILLETT: Right.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if somebody asked where

12 this man was convicted, they'd say in a Japanese court.

13 MS. MILLETT: Right. And -- and I think, in

14 addition, we don't decide that a word is ambiguous just at

15 looking at that word. We would look at the overall

16 structure of the statute, and we would decide that it has

17 to be a governmental entity capable of entering

18 convictions.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't really have a

20 chance --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that there's some

22 prosecutorial discretion in the application of this

23 statute. I mean, have you --

24 MS. MILLETT: Absolutely, Justice --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- have you prosecuted any --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 any woman who tried to buy a firearm because she had been

2 convicted of wearing -- not -- not wearing a veil?

3 MS. MILLETT: No, Justice Scalia.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think any United States

5 attorney would do that?

6 MS. MILLETT: I would hope not, Justice Scalia.

7 I think --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- or somebody who was

9 convicted of treason in Cuba? You -- you think that --

10 that that would be a -- a case that would be prosecuted

11 vigorously by a United States attorney?

12 MS. MILLETT: I -- I wouldn't think so. I

13 think --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you know any cases in which

15 we've construed a statute narrowly on the ground that

16 we're confident the prosecutor won't bring any such cases?

17 MS. MILLETT: That -- well, again, just last --

18 this isn't -- this isn't quite the same context. But just

19 this -- just last term in the Cheney case, this Court

20 recognized the limitations on prosecutors.

21 And in Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, in

22 determining the scope of the Fourth Amendment and the

23 capacity to arrest for misdemeanors, this Court recognized

24 that not all checks have to come from the courts. They

25 can come from the political process here.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And it's very important to keep in mind that

2 these hypothesized problems, bad applications, are that.

3 Purely hypothesized. This has been on the books for

4 almost 40 years.

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it's -- it's been on the

6 books for so long with very, very few prosecutions. So

7 it's one -- it's not exactly an urgent question. But it

8 does seem to me if this -- this problem had been brought

9 to the attention of Congress, they would have defined the

10 term court, and I don't -- they haven't done that but

11 probably because they didn't think of the problem. And

12 you can argue, well, they surely would have wanted to have

13 this particular person prosecuted, but would they have

14 wanted everyone with every foreign court all over the

15 world. That's the question.

16 MS. MILLETT: And in Beecham v. United States,

17 in Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court, this Court

18 recognized there -- it was dealing with another issue,

19 whether the jurisdiction that restores civil rights is

20 different from the convicting jurisdiction. It said we

21 don't have any way of knowing whether Congress thought

22 about that. That's not the question.

23 Congress passed a statute here. It passed a

24 statute that's been written very carefully. It's passed a

25 statute where the definition of the word any in the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statute has already been defined. And the -- what the

2 statute has been used for is to prosecute exactly the

3 people that Congress wanted to capture. It's

4 international gun smugglers --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. --

6 MS. MILLETT: -- violent assailants --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Ms. -- Ms. Millett, my --

8 my problem with that argument and I guess my basic problem

9 with -- with the case is Congress did not just sort of

10 stop when it got to the point that would support your

11 Lewis argument. It went a step -- it went several steps

12 further. But one of the steps further that it went to was

13 -- was in -- in a certain fussiness about the definition

14 of crime, and it said, well, we want to make sure that --

15 that no State or -- or Federal business criminals are --

16 are put at a disadvantage by this. It then accepted

17 anything that a State might call a misdemeanor if it

18 carried no more than 2 years. And it just seems very odd

19 to me that Congress would have been that careful in

20 putting these limitations on State and Federal crimes and

21 would totally have ignored any category of crime under

22 foreign law, any conviction under foreign law in -- in

23 light of some of the hypotheses that have been thrown out

24 this morning. It just seems strange that it would have

25 ignored foreign law and foreign courts if it thought they

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 were included.

2 MS. MILLETT: I don't think it's strange at all,

3 Justice Souter, and that is because that the business

4 exception, if I can call it that, is a carve-out. What

5 you have here, in this Court's word, is a sweeping

6 prophylaxis against the misuse of firearms. That's what

7 this Court called it in Lewis, a sweeping prophylaxis.

8 And what Congress did was back out --

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it called it that, but it

10 didn't -- it didn't have this issue in front of it.

11 MS. MILLETT: That's -- that's right.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I realize you've got the

13 language, but it -- it wasn't addressing this issue.

14 MS. MILLETT: Right, and -- and the language

15 should be what counts most. But beyond that, you're

16 talking about Congress --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I was talking about our

18 language.

19 MS. MILLETT: Right. You --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- and I think that ought

21 to count for a lot too.

22 (Laughter.)

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, not too much.

24 MS. MILLETT: But what Congress was doing there

25 was backing out. It was making an exception, and it was

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 doing this against a backdrop of a lot of violence with

2 guns. And so it makes sense that Congress would proceed

3 carefully and deal with matters with which it was familiar

4 and not want to carve out things that it wasn't familiar

5 with.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but how -- how familiar an

7 example is it that price-fixers would -- would be placed

8 in -- in a terrible position if they couldn't carry guns?

9 I mean, that was not a pressing problem, so far as I know.

10 And yet, Congress dealt with it.

11 MS. MILLETT: Well, the problem --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if it can deal with a

13 problem that is as little pressing as that, it seems odd

14 that it would not have averted in any way to equally non-

15 pressing problems under -- under foreign convictions if

16 that's what they had in mind.

17 MS. MILLETT: It dealt with that. I mean,

18 specifically at the legislative history level, it dealt --

19 it enacted that statutory exception because some States

20 had made these types of business crimes punishable by more

21 than a year. So that's what it was responding to.

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. What -- what --

23 MS. MILLETT: I can't -- I --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- finish your answer.

25 MS. MILLETT: I can't -- I'm not going to stand

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 here and tell you that Congress specifically thought about

2 this.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, there's no --

4 MS. MILLETT: Right, but --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: We both know there's no --

6 MS. MILLETT: But -- but what Congress did here

7 -- and it's very important to understand -- it was

8 throwing a broad net --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Millett.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Millett, there are many

12 lawyers in Congress and at least the law students of my

13 generation -- some of them are of that elder age. We

14 learned in law school one country doesn't enforce the

15 penal judgments of another. This is a kind of enforcement

16 of a penal judgment of another, not exactly, but something

17 like it. Another reason why I would expect a Congress,

18 knowing that background norm, would say, when it meant

19 foreign, foreign. Unlike the context of the immigration,

20 yes, there are some people who left and came back, but

21 many -- and -- and we have all this whole line of cases.

22 Is adultery a crime of moral turpitude, and you know,

23 those go back to the '20's.

24 But this, which came about only because of the

25 merger of two statutes, one saying Federal and State, the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 other not, and no explanation at all, in light of all

2 these anomalies that have been brought out. Shouldn't we

3 say to Congress maybe that's what you meant, but if you

4 did, you have an opportunity to say so before we read in

5 foreign?

6 MS. MILLETT: Two answers, Justice Ginsburg.

7 First, this was the second time in 1986 that Congress

8 refused to include that limitation on courts. The prior

9 law, before the 1968 act, specifically referred to courts

10 of the United States, States, and territories. It did not

11 pick up that language in title IV in 1968, and they took

12 it out --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: But neither did it give any

14 explanation for not carrying it forward.

15 MS. MILLETT: No, but I don't -- that --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's -- it's the silence at the

17 -- at the time it -- it apparently departed from the

18 practice of predecessor statutes that -- that seems to be

19 a problem for your argument.

20 MS. MILLETT: But -- but again, I don't think

21 this Court has ever characterized as silence Congress'

22 twice deletion of language from a statute in 1968 and

23 again in 1986. It had it. It looked at it. It took it

24 out. And in 1986 in the Senate report that you were

25 referring to, Justice Ginsburg, earlier, Congress said

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 they -- the conference report said we are rejecting the

2 Senate's definition of felony.

3 The other thing to keep in mind is when Congress

4 enacted this statute in 1968, it also enacted an

5 administrative mechanism for relief that would deal with

6 exactly the uncomfortable situations that have been

7 identified. 925(c) allows an administrative waiver in

8 cases where an individual comes and says I don't want

9 to --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: You know, this is a very

11 interesting case because there are three ways to answer

12 the question of what is a court. You can leave it up to

13 us to do it, and that would be judicial legislation to

14 fill in a hole in the statute. You can have the executive

15 do it, decide what case -- what cases to prosecute, or if

16 we should knock out this -- interpret the statute in the

17 -- in a different way than you urge, Congress would then

18 do it. Now, which of the three is the better lawmaker on

19 deciding which is the -- what should the meaning of the

20 word court be? The executive, the legislature, or the

21 judiciary?

22 MS. MILLETT: I think -- it's, of course, the

23 legislature and the President's signature. I'd like to

24 put a plug in for the executive in -- in that reference,

25 but --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That would save us a lot of

2 work. We --

3 (Laughter.)

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- we could just invalidate

5 all statutes that we don't understand.

6 (Laughter.)

7 MS. MILLETT: But, Justice Kennedy and Justice

8 Stevens, the important thing to keep in mind here is we

9 don't just have a statute that appeared out of nowhere.

10 It's been on the books for a long time and there was a

11 legislative --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but it is pretty clear

13 that Congress didn't really think about this problem.

14 MS. MILLETT: No, but it thought -- it --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: And it is also clear on your

16 side that they would like to prevent this guy from having

17 a gun.

18 MS. MILLETT: Exactly, and --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: So there are two competing

20 considerations, both of which are very powerful.

21 MS. MILLETT: Well, if nothing else -- and this

22 guy is squarely within what Congress wanted to capture.

23 If nothing else, you don't have to decide anything more in

24 this case than that it covers persons like this whose

25 convictions are fundamentally fair and it's not contested

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and could leave for another day -- but let's --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- I want to get you.

3 Now, I have a new question.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you finish --

5 would you finish please --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I have a new --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- telling us about the

8 administrative waiver proceeding? You were in the middle

9 of it and I never heard the --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what I wanted to

11 know.

12 MS. MILLETT: Right.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: And I -- can I -- that's

14 exactly what I wanted to know. When a person comes in to

15 get a gun -- because I hadn't focused on this, and it

16 actually to me it's relevant. Suppose one of these people

17 has been convicted in a foreign court and he doesn't have

18 a clue, you know, that this means he can't buy a gun over

19 here. So he comes over here. He goes into a -- a gun

20 store. Now, does he get notice that that -- this

21 conviction over in Japan or Lithuania or wherever it was

22 means that he can't buy the gun?

23 MS. MILLETT: Well, he got -- in this case, he

24 got -- and this is --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm asking -- I'm asking

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in general.

2 MS. MILLETT: You -- you go and you fill out a

3 form that says, as this case did -- and it's on page 4 of

4 our brief --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

6 MS. MILLETT: -- asked him, have you been

7 convicted in any court of --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: So it just says any court.

9 MS. MILLETT: In any court. And I think when

10 someone --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well --

12 MS. MILLETT: No. But when someone has a

13 conviction, when you have a felony conviction, you're on

14 some notice of inquiry.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: It'll work for -- yes. It'll

16 -- it'll work for this one, but -- but what I'm worried

17 about -- and really what led the Sentencing Commission to

18 exclude all this stuff even though clearly recidivists

19 should get a higher sentence, but we still excluded it

20 because it's just a nightmare. There are notice problems.

21 There are fairness problems. There are procedural

22 problems. There are problems of crimes that aren't crimes

23 here.

24 MS. MILLETT: Justice --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and all those come up,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and that's what I'm worried about. So I see this as a

2 possible out.

3 MS. MILLETT: Well --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: The one -- the procedure you

5 just talked about might help.

6 MS. MILLETT: And it's in 925(c), which is on --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: That he knows about it.

8 MS. MILLETT: -- page 65a of our brief. But let

9 me -- let me be --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it provides judicial review

11 of the Attorney General's failure to give the waiver.

12 MS. MILLETT: It does, and -- but let me be

13 candid up front. Congress stopped funding this

14 administrative mechanism in 1992, and that -- this Court

15 addressed that in the Bean case. It -- it doesn't exist

16 now, but that was 25 years after Congress wrote this

17 language and put it in the statute, and the fact that they

18 stopped funding it 25 years later doesn't mean the statute

19 doesn't mean what it said.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know why?

21 MS. MILLETT: And Congress --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know why they stopped

23 funding it? Why did -- because I think that's been

24 reenacted every year. No money for this. Why -- why did

25 Congress stop funding it?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. MILLETT: Because some of -- some of the

2 people who were getting waivers were going out and

3 committing crimes again. Congress here is very concerned

4 about public safety.

5 And this is not -- there was, you know, the

6 question, is there ever an element where you treat this

7 like an element of foreign crime. There aren't -- there

8 aren't crimes normally where you treat indictments or

9 someone being under a restraining order this way. This is

10 not punishing you for your foreign crime. This is a

11 global categorical, class-wide judgment that as a class

12 persons who have committed crimes overseas are more

13 dangerous and may pose exactly the public safety risk we

14 wanted to grab and stop. As a class, they do that. In a

15 particular case, it may not. In a particular case, an

16 indictment might not. Congress was speaking globally. It

17 did so. It threw a broad net. It did so at the time it

18 had an administrative check to deal with these problems.

19 Yes, that's gone. That doesn't retroactively change what

20 the statutory language meant.

21 This Court has said time and time again that

22 this statutory language in 922 was written, in Beecham and

23 Huddleston, with such care that Congress was focused on

24 the difference between the present perfect and the past

25 tense, this Court said in Barrett. This is not sloppy

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 writing. When Congress put any court in and did not carry

2 forward a limitation to the courts of the United States

3 and took that out in another part of the statute in 1986,

4 we have to assume that Congress knew what it was doing.

5 If there are problems here, there is a

6 political process to deal with it. The political process

7 has taken away the administrative waiver. But there has

8 not been -- this hypothesis of bad applications has not

9 arisen. It's hypothesized. And what this statute has --

10 has been used to do is capture exactly the people Congress

11 wanted to capture. It got exactly the ones who should be

12 disarmed.

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know anybody in the

14 Justice Department you might talk to to amend this form so

15 that the form says this includes convictions in foreign

16 countries?

17 MS. MILLETT: I -- I am confident that the ATF

18 would be happy to do that. As of now, the ATF has a

19 regulation on the books for someone to look at and see

20 that includes foreign convictions in this definition. And

21 I think when someone has been convicted, they're on

22 notice.

23 Thank you, Justice Stevens.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.

25 The case is submitted.
