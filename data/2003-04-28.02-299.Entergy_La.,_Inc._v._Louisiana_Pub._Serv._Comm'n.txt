 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 next in Number 02-299, Entergy Louisiana versus Louisiana
 5 Public Service Commission.
 6 Mr. Carpenter.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. CARPENTER
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. CARPENTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 10 please the Court:
 11 In multistate power systems, each retail rake -
 12 ratemaking body has incentives to impose cost allocations
 13 that benefit its residents, and the only way to assure
 14 that the power pool recovers a hundred percent of its
 15 generating costs is for a neutral body to referee disputes 16 among the States and to fix the allocations.
 17 This case arises in the energy system where five
 18 subsidiaries provide retail service in four different
 19 States, where FERC has found that Entergy's cost
 20 allocations generally can't affect its net revenues and
 21 where FERC has thus approved a tariff that gives Entergy
 22 authority to calculate the inter-company equalization
 23 payments that allocate costs with a FERC complaint as the
 24 sole remedy if the rates and allocations are believed to
 25 be unlawful.

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Though we --
 2 QUESTION: What is -- what is the source of the
 3 rule that this is the sole remedy?
 4 MR. CARPENTER: It's the sole remedy under the
 5 tariff itself, Your Honor.
 6 QUESTION: The -- so the tariff itself provides
 7 that.
 8 MR. CARPENTER: Yes. Under the tariff itself,
 9 the only right that is reserved to the -- this is section
 10 4.12, joint appendix 11a. The only right that is reserved
 11 to the operating companies is to seek amend -- if there's
 12 a dispute over the rates, is to seek amendments in the
 13 tariff or changes in the rate from the regulatory body
 14 that has jurisdiction.
 15 There's no question here that the LPSC doesn't 16 have jurisdiction to order amendments to the service
 17 schedule or changes in the rates. Their claim is only
 18 that they can disallow the costs that were incurred.
 19 QUESTION: Is -- is the tariff provision meant
 20 to preclude any sort of a judicial remedy?
 21 MR. CARPENTER: Yes, it would preclude a
 22 judicial remedy. It operates as a -- as a -- as,
 23 obviously, a limitation on the operating companies'
 24 remedies and as a forum selection clause in the event of a
 25 dispute.

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, there would be a judicial
 2 remedy if they disagreed with the -- with -- with FERC's
 3 determination. They could -- they could appeal that to
 4 the court.
 5 MR. CARPENTER: Oh, absolutely, Your Honor. I'm
 6 sorry. I --
 7 QUESTION: They just couldn't go straight to the
 8 court.
 9 MR. CARPENTER: Yes. No, I'm sorry, Your Honor. 
 10 I -- I meant that they can't go -- they couldn't go
 11 straight to court, and it means that -- for the same
 12 reason that a State retail ratemaking body can't disallow
 13 the costs because under -- under this rate schedule, the
 14 rate calculated by the energy system is the filed rate and
 15 binds everybody unless and until a complaint is filed with 16 FERC and FERC holds otherwise.
 17 And in fact, the Louisiana commission here
 18 brought a complaint for the period ending in August of
 19 1997, and FERC denied relief on the ground that although
 20 the tariff didn't authorize it, it was just and --
 21 nonetheless just and reasonable for Entergy to calculate
 22 equalization payments by including certain units that were
 23 in extended reserve status because FERC found that those
 24 units benefited Louisiana and the entire system.
 25 QUESTION: Can I ask? The -- the section of

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the -- of the agreement that you -- you referred us to,
 2 4.12. It says each company reserves the right to
 3 unilaterally seek amendments or changes from any
 4 regulatory body having or acquiring jurisdiction
 5 thereover. Why didn't they just say from FERC?
 6 MR. CARPENTER: Well, at the time this --
 7 QUESTION: I mean, if as you say it's only FERC,
 8 why didn't they just say from FERC?
 9 MR. CARPENTER: Well, it was -- it was fairly
 10 prescient because this -- this language I think dates from
 11 1953, when there was the Federal Power Commission. So,
 12 it --
 13 QUESTION: Oh, I see. I see. Yes.
 14 MR. CARPENTER: But the -- the key thing here is
 15 that it's undisputed that the LPSC can't amend the 16 service agreement.
 17 QUESTION: Got you. No. I was just wondering
 18 whether --
 19 MR. CARPENTER: Yes.
 20 QUESTION: -- that was so clear to the parties
 21 at the time, and you say it is and -- and what they --
 22 what they were anticipating is a change in the Federal --
 23 MR. CARPENTER: Yes.
 24 QUESTION: -- body that had jurisdiction.
 25 MR. CARPENTER: Right.

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Okay.
 2 MR. CARPENTER: But -- but in the aftermath of
 3 the FERC order that found that these charges were just and
 4 reasonable, despite a finding of the tariff violation, the
 5 Louisiana commission entered an order that said that
 6 FERC's determination bound it only for the precise period
 7 that FERC had addressed, and then entered an order that
 8 prohibited the petitioner, Entergy Louisiana, ELI, from
 9 recovering the same wholesale costs in retail rates for
 10 the immediately succeeding period, beginning August 5th,
 11 1977.
 12 QUESTION: Could -- could you explain one thing
 13 to me? And that is, why was the period so defined? Is it
 14 simply that it was, with respect to that period, that
 15 actual figures were introduced before FERC?
 16 MR. CARPENTER: That became the period because
 17 that was the date of the FERC order.
 18 QUESTION: The date of the --
 19 MR. CARPENTER: Yes.
 20 QUESTION: And so, in effect, that -- FERC was
 21 done with it at that --
 22 MR. CARPENTER: Yes. That was the -- that was
 23 the -- the theory --
 24 QUESTION: But -- but was there --
 25 MR. CARPENTER: -- of Louisiana Public Service

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Commission.
 2 QUESTION: Was there any question in the terms
 3 of the order that the order was intended to operate
 4 prospectively until FERC changed it?
 5 MR. CARPENTER: Oh, no. No question at all.
 6 QUESTION: So the difference is unlike a filed
 7 rate, which is a number, here is not a precise number.
 8 MR. CARPENTER: That's right. Here the filed
 9 rate is a formula that is --
 10 QUESTION: And it -- and it's going to change
 11 constantly.
 12 MR. CARPENTER: That's right. It can change --
 13 it can change I believe monthly, or the -- the rate
 14 calculated under the formula can change monthly. And --
 15 and FERC approves formula rates, you know, in 16 circumstances where it believes that it will better
 17 promote the overall goals of -- of the act, and it imposes
 18 terms and conditions that will assure that the overall
 19 goals of the act are promoted.
 20 And here a critical term and condition was that
 21 the determinations of the amount of the payments is
 22 centralized at FERC and the only remedy, if there's a
 23 disagreement, is to go to FERC and file a complaint. As I
 24 point out, that's clear from the terms of the tariff, and
 25 that's what FERC said in each of the orders in which it

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 authorized the formula rates.
 2 QUESTION: But it -- from the point of view of
 3 the public service commission, they have to approve the
 4 local rates periodically, and how does the timing of the
 5 thing work? If the public service commission has to go to
 6 FERC and then there's a proceeding, and by that time the
 7 year is over.
 8 MR. CARPENTER: Yes. But the -- if FERC were to
 9 agree with the public service commission that we violated
 10 the tariff, that the result was unjust and unreasonable
 11 and a refund was appropriate, all the interests would be
 12 protected because the -- they would order a refund at the
 13 wholesale level with interest that the Louisiana Public
 14 Service Commission could flow through to retail rate
 15 papers -- rate payers.
 16 QUESTION: Well, wait, wait. How would -- how
 17 would the Louisiana Public Service Commission have
 18 standing to come to FERC? I mean, to come back to the
 19 agreement, it says each company -- the companies who are
 20 parties to the agreement -- reserves the right to
 21 unilaterally seek amendments or changes.
 22 MR. CARPENTER: Yes. Well, they have standing
 23 under the act itself. Section 305 I believe it is.
 24 QUESTION: So this provision doesn't govern what
 25 they can seek then.

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CARPENTER: No. But -- but they -- but --
 2 but what it does mean is that they cannot premise a -- a
 3 prudence disallowance on the ground that -- that ELI could
 4 have refused to pay the costs or -- or required that the
 5 equalization payments be calculated on a different basis.
 6 QUESTION: Well, sure, they can. They could say
 7 the company was at fault for not going to FERC.
 8 MR. CARPENTER: Yes. But -- but -- sure, they
 9 could say that. It was imprudent not to go to FERC. But
 10 they can't speculate about what FERC would do in the event
 11 a complaint was filed. That's clear from the Arkansas
 12 Louisiana Gas case of this Court. So while it's
 13 theoretically possible they could say that it was
 14 imprudent not to go to FERC, no remedy could be predicated
 15 on that finding of imprudence because they can't speculate 16 about what FERC would do if a complaint were filed.
 17 QUESTION: But can they go to FERC as an
 18 intervenor? I --
 19 MR. CARPENTER: Yes.
 20 QUESTION: -- I take it that was their status.
 21 MR. CARPENTER: Absolutely, absolutely.
 22 QUESTION: So they could go in and say, look,
 23 they should have complained --
 24 MR. CARPENTER: Yes.
 25 QUESTION: -- and therefore you should do what

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 you would have done if they had complained.
 2 MR. CARPENTER: Absolutely. They can do that. 
 3 And the point I was trying to make to Justice Ginsburg is
 4 it -- when that procedure is followed, all legitimate
 5 interests are protected because if FERC agrees and orders
 6 a refund, it will be -- it can then be flowed through by
 7 the Louisiana Commission to the retail ratepayers.
 8 Conversely, under their procedure in which they
 9 can disallow costs pending a FERC determination on the
 10 precise -- on the precise issue, you have exactly the --
 11 the interference with commerce that the Federal Power Act
 12 was designed to prevent. You've got duplicative
 13 litigation of this issue. Here in -- could be in five
 14 different retail ratemaking bodies.
 15 And the effect can be a trapping of costs that 16 we never get back because if FERC -- you know, they --
 17 they trap the costs pending the FERC order. FERC then
 18 says -- reviews it and says what we did was fine, just and
 19 reasonable. Then obviously FERC doesn't do anything at
 20 the wholesale level. In the meantime, our costs have been
 21 trapped at the retail level, and we can't get the money
 22 back under the general rule barring retroactive ratemaking
 23 unless an exception were somehow made to that rule.
 24 QUESTION: Well, what is the function and
 25 province of the State commission's prudence review? 

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 What -- what can they do that's proper? And I assume they
 2 can do a number of things that increase costs and
 3 therefore change rates, or am I wrong about that?
 4 MR. CARPENTER: Well, what they -- what they can
 5 do is they can regulate the -- the prudence of -- of
 6 decisions that the -- the utility had to make. So in
 7 circumstances where a FERC tariff provides a choice to
 8 the -- to the retail utility, which was the situation in
 9 the Pike County case, then -- then the -- the State
 10 commission can find that it was imprudent to exercise the
 11 choice in one fashion or another.
 12 But the point here is there was no choice. The
 13 equalization payment bound the -- bound ELI unless and
 14 until it was found to be unlawful by -- by FERC. So this
 15 is a situation where under the filed rate doctrine and 16 under this Court's decisions in MP&L and Nantahala, the --
 17 the State commission was required to treat the resulting
 18 expense as a retail -- as a just and reasonable expense
 19 and pass it through to retail ratepayers unless and until
 20 FERC ordered otherwise.
 21 There's obviously a range of other issues that
 22 aren't -- aren't governed by FERC rate schedules at all,
 23 as to which State utility commissions can examine the
 24 reasonableness of the decisions of the -- of the retail
 25 body. But they can't say that -- that following your

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 duties under a FERC tariff is unjust and unreasonable. 
 2 That's a question for FERC.
 3 QUESTION: In -- in the course of that regular
 4 examination that they -- that they do, can they find
 5 certain actions that require refunds to the -- to the
 6 consumers?
 7 MR. CARPENTER: Oh, absolutely, Your Honor. 
 8 Absolutely, Your Honor. They can disallow -- they
 9 disallow charitable expenses. They disallow expenses all
 10 the time. There's a citation --
 11 QUESTION: But never if it's in violation of a
 12 tariff or a FERC policy?
 13 MR. CARPENTER: Right. They cannot, consistent
 14 with the Federal Power Act, say that it was imprudent to
 15 do -- to -- to do what the FERC tariff required the 16 utility to do. That's the clear teaching of MP&L and
 17 Nantahala and -- and other decisions.
 18 QUESTION: Would the State commission have
 19 authority to argue that the formula was incorrectly
 20 applied?
 21 MR. CARPENTER: In the context of the retail
 22 ratemaking proceeding?
 23 QUESTION: Yes.
 24 MR. CARPENTER: No, Your Honor. That's an
 25 issue exclusively for FERC because, as I pointed out

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 before, if the rate is believed to be too high, under
 2 the tariff, the -- the only remedy the operating company
 3 would have would be to go to FERC and -- and complain,
 4 and the operating company has -- has no -- no right to
 5 refuse to make a payment on the ground that there's an
 6 allegation that the equalization formula was improperly
 7 implied.
 8 But as I -- as I just said, the filed rate
 9 doctrine clearly, you know, prohibited the order here, and
 10 even if it didn't apply, this is an issue that -- the
 11 issue of the -- the reasonableness of rates and the
 12 practices affecting rates is an issue that the Federal
 13 Power Act clearly allocates to FERC. So even if the
 14 tariff here didn't, you know, clearly preclude ELI from
 15 doing what the LPSC found a prudent company would have 16 done, the -- the filed -- the Federal Power Act preempted
 17 the -- the State from addressing the issue.
 18 And the facts of this case sort of illustrate
 19 why States shouldn't get involved in -- in this because
 20 the decision that was made here sort of exemplifies the
 21 parochialism that the Commerce Clause and the Federal
 22 Power Act was designed to prevent. It was acknowledged by
 23 the Louisiana Public Service Commission that the -- the
 24 units in question, the out-of-state units in question,
 25 benefited Louisiana and the entire system, increased the

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 efficiency of the entire system. But it said that was
 2 irrelevant. In fact, it said that was evidence of
 3 imprudence because the effect was to increase the costs
 4 that ELI incurred and thus to increase retail rates, and
 5 that's a -- the kind of parochialism that the
 6 Commerce Clause prevents and the Federal Power Act was
 7 designed to draw a bright line that would eliminate any
 8 need to even adjudicate questions whether the conduct
 9 violates the Federal --
 10 QUESTION: Well, what's left of public service
 11 commissions then, if -- if you're right, so far as
 12 policing imprudent acquisitions and that sort of thing
 13 for a multi -- multistate company?
 14 MR. CARPENTER: Well, they -- they can't
 15 regulate issues involving, you know, the exchanges 16 of power within power pools, but there are a range
 17 of other issues that, as I said in response to
 18 Justice Kennedy's question, that the States can --
 19 can decide.
 20 QUESTION: Such as.
 21 MR. CARPENTER: Well, the -- you know,
 22 whether -- whether expenses not dictated by a FERC -- FERC
 23 rate schedule are just and reasonable. There's a whole
 24 range of other expenses that --
 25 QUESTION: The cost of -- the cost of power is

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 just one of the -- one of the --
 2 MR. CARPENTER: Yes, just one of the expenses
 3 that a retail utility would incur. And -- and so there's
 4 a range of issues that they can decide. What they can't
 5 do, though, is -- is decide that it was imprudent to incur
 6 a cost that a FERC rate schedule required the utility to
 7 incur, and that's the issue here.
 8 QUESTION: Am I -- am I correct in assuming,
 9 as I have throughout the -- reading the briefs here,
 10 that the -- the costs that a given operating company
 11 incurs within its power pool is essentially the same
 12 issue as the wholesale rate that a -- that a totally
 13 independent company might pay when it -- when it bought
 14 wholesale off the -- the grid? Is -- is that a -- it
 15 seems to me in -- in each case, the operating company 16 is buying power at wholesale, whether it does it within
 17 its group or whether it does it on an open market, and
 18 that's what in each case FERC is regulating. Is -- is
 19 that fair?
 20 MR. CARPENTER: Well -- well, FERC regulates the
 21 transactions within power pools --
 22 QUESTION: And when one of those transactions
 23 is the -- is the -- in effect, the acquisition of power by
 24 a local operating company, that transaction is
 25 economically, I guess, the equivalent of buying wholesale

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 by an independent company that is not part of a power
 2 pool.
 3 MR. CARPENTER: Yes, but FERC's jurisdiction
 4 depends on the fact that -- jurisdiction depends on the
 5 existence of wholesale sales which -- which exist in the
 6 context of a power pool because each retail utility is
 7 simultaneously, you know, providing power to the pool at
 8 the set rate. So it's --
 9 QUESTION: Oh, no, I understand that. And --
 10 and -- but FERC also has general authority over wholesale
 11 interstate sales.
 12 MR. CARPENTER: Absolutely, Your Honor. 
 13 Absolutely, Your Honor.
 14 QUESTION: So that -- so that in relation to
 15 what a -- the reason I'm getting at it is, in relation to 16 what a State utilities commission can do, the State
 17 utilities commission, I take it, is in the same position
 18 vis-a-vis ELI that it would be if ELI were a totally
 19 independent company buying wholesale off the grid. Is
 20 that correct?
 21 MR. CARPENTER: That's right. If it were -- if
 22 it were subject to the identical rate schedule.
 23 If there are no further questions, I'd like to
 24 save the balance of my time for rebuttal.
 25 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Carpenter.

1 Mr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.
 2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK
 3 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
 4 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
 5 MR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 6 please the Court:
 7 Under Nantahala and Mississippi Power & Light,
 8 the regulation of wholesale rates for electric energy in
 9 interstate commerce is exclusively within the jurisdiction
 10 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Federal
 11 jurisdiction is necessary to ensure that multistate
 12 utilities, like Entergy and other utilities, are able to
 13 carry out their FERC-regulated transactions, to plan and
 14 carry out those transactions without the interference of
 15 potentially conflicting State regulation.
 16 The facts of this case highlight the need for
 17 exclusive Federal regulation. The dispute in this case
 18 involves the correct allocation of costs incurred for the
 19 common benefit of five utilities in four different States. 
 20 The Louisiana commission believed that the costs allocated
 21 to Entergy Louisiana were too high, but the consequence of
 22 the Louisiana commission's rate decision would be to
 23 reallocate those costs to ratepayers in Texas, Arkansas,
 24 Mississippi or else to render them trapped and entirely
 25 unrecoverable.

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, does that -- is that a death
 2 sentence, so to speak, if you find that the costs are
 3 trapped and unrecoverable? May not that ever happen to a
 4 utility legitimately?
 5 MR. SCHLICK: That's correct, Your Honor. Under
 6 this Court's decision in Nantahala, a charge that is
 7 federally approved or that is within FERC's exclusive
 8 jurisdiction to approve may not be trapped and disallowed
 9 by the -- by the State regulatory --
 10 QUESTION: You're -- you're not talking about
 11 costs -- trapped costs generally. You're just talking
 12 about this particular kind of trapped cost.
 13 MR. SCHLICK: That's right. I'm -- I'm talking
 14 about costs that contribute to the wholesale rate that --
 15 that is within FERC's jurisdiction.
 16 QUESTION: So the -- the problem is that -- not
 17 that the costs would be trapped, but that FERC has said
 18 it's not trapped. That's -- that's the point. I mean,
 19 lots of utilities lose money because costs are trapped.
 20 MR. SCHLICK: That is -- I -- I think that --
 21 that --
 22 QUESTION: So the real point is here FERC has
 23 said they can do it. That's -- that's the only point that
 24 you're making, isn't it?
 25 MR. SCHLICK: There are two points. There --

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 there is the general prohibition on trapping, but also in
 2 this case we have a FERC-approved rate schedule that
 3 determines how the allocation should be carried out. 
 4 There's a question whether or not Entergy complied with
 5 that rate schedule, but the resolution of that question
 6 involves what the wholesale rate is or should be, and
 7 that's a question within FERC's jurisdiction.
 8 QUESTION: And that's a FERC question, period.
 9 MR. SCHLICK: That's right. Only FERC can
 10 decide that question.
 11 Unlike the cases on which respondent relies,
 12 this case does not involve a State contract action about a
 13 matter that is within the State's concurrent jurisdiction. 
 14 In the first place, there is no contract dispute between
 15 the parties in this case, the Entergy operating companies 16 and the holding company.
 17 Rather, this case arose in the same context as
 18 Nantahala and Mississippi Power & Light, a retail rate
 19 setting. And the dispute involves the correct division
 20 among the operating companies in multiple states of costs
 21 of operating the system. Just like Mississippi Power &
 22 Light, that's a cost -- that's a -- a question that only
 23 the FERC can determine.
 24 It's worth mentioning that --
 25 QUESTION: Could -- could this be

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 characterized as a question of a reasonable interpretation
 2 of the tariff, or you couldn't characterize the issue that
 3 way?
 4 MR. SCHLICK: There -- there is a -- an
 5 interpretation, an underlying question of interpretation,
 6 of the tariff, but beyond that, there's the question of
 7 whether the resulting charge was just and reasonable. And
 8 that's the important reasonableness question. That's the
 9 question that only FERC can decide.
 10 Here the Louisiana commission assumed both that
 11 there was a procedural violation of the system agreement
 12 in -- in the documentation of the operating committee's
 13 decision --
 14 QUESTION: But --
 15 MR. SCHLICK: 
 -- and that the resulting charge 16 was unjust and unreasonable.
 17 QUESTION: But what Louisiana is saying, they --
 18 they're conceding that FERC has the authority, the
 19 exclusive authority, to prescribe what the division would
 20 be. However, they're saying if, in fact, there's a
 21 violation of that division, the States ought to be able to
 22 adjudicate the violation. They're still giving FERC all
 23 of -- all of its power. They're saying FERC decides what
 24 the division will be, but the State agency can determine
 25 that the division has not been carried out the way FERC

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 prescribed.
 2 What is there in the act that -- that says that
 3 FERC is the exclusive adjudicator of whether its
 4 directives have been complied with?
 5 MR. SCHLICK: In the context of what the
 6 wholesale charge is or should be, the provision of the act
 7 is section 824d and -- and 824e. The underlying principle
 8 was established by this Court's decision in Attleboro,
 9 which is that States are entirely disabled from regulating
 10 wholesale rates. That was implemented through the Federal
 11 Power Act in 1935. It was confirmed in this Court's
 12 decision --
 13 QUESTION: They're not regulating the
 14 wholesale rates is what -- is the argument that will
 15 be made by the State. 
 They're -- they're leaving it to 16 FERC to regulate it, but they're adjudicating whether
 17 the rates prescribed by -- by FERC have, in fact, been
 18 the rates charged.
 19 MR. SCHLICK: Justice Scalia, in fact, they
 20 were regulating the wholesale charge. The necessary
 21 determination of the Louisiana commission's order was
 22 that the costs pass through under the Federal rate
 23 schedule to Entergy Louisiana. The specific costs
 24 allocated on the rate schedule were too high. It was
 25 imprudent in the Louisiana commission's judgment for

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Entergy Louisiana --
 2 QUESTION: I thought the Court said in
 3 Mississippi Power & Light that once FERC sets a wholesale
 4 rate, a State may not conclude in setting retail rates
 5 that the FERC-approved wholesale rates are unreasonable.
 6 MR. SCHLICK: That -- That's correct. The --
 7 QUESTION: So I guess that's the law, isn't it?
 8 MR. SCHLICK: -- the only additional step that
 9 need be taken in this -- in this case is to determine
 10 whether the fact that there is a dispute as to whether or
 11 not the FERC rate schedule was violated somehow puts the
 12 case within the State's jurisdiction. That was the
 13 question that only FERC can answer.
 14 QUESTION: But how is that different from the
 15 State determining that a retail rate is unreasonable? 16 MR. SCHLICK: We believe it's precisely the
 17 same.
 18 QUESTION: So then there is nothing extra.
 19 MR. SCHLICK: Our -- our answer to that question
 20 is there is no difference.
 21 QUESTION: So I have to see what the other side
 22 would say.
 23 MR. SCHLICK: That's correct, Justice Breyer.
 24 QUESTION: I -- I take it you agree with
 25 Mr. Carpenter that the State can be heard on this issue as

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 an intervenor who may raise the issue before FERC. Is
 2 that correct?
 3 MR. SCHLICK: Not just as an intervenor. Under
 4 section 825e of the act, the State could actually bring a
 5 complaint --
 6 QUESTION: I see.
 7 MR. SCHLICK: -- to FERC. It could bring the
 8 issue directly to FERC. And --
 9 QUESTION: In any case, it can get to FERC if it
 10 has a gripe.
 11 MR. SCHLICK: The order 415 proceeding in
 12 1997 -- that was resolved in 1997 -- shows exactly how
 13 this should happen. The --
 14 QUESTION: No, but the answer to my question is
 15 yes, isn't it?
 16 MR. SCHLICK: Oh, yes, absolutely.
 17 QUESTION: That's all I'm -- that's all I'm --
 18 QUESTION: Well, it seems to me it's quite a
 19 different question. Question one is whether the
 20 allocation was unreasonable, and the State here is saying
 21 we're -- we're not questioning the reasonableness of the
 22 allocation. That's up to FERC. But we don't think that
 23 we were charged that allocation that -- that was given to
 24 us. And that's -- that's not challenging FERC's decision
 25 of what the allocation should be. It's challenging the

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 factual question of whether the allocation was carried out
 2 the way FERC prescribed.
 3 MR. SCHLICK: Justice Scalia, the order 415
 4 proceeding shows precisely the problem with that. In that
 5 case, FERC said that there was a violation of the system
 6 agreement, analogous to the one that's being claimed here. 
 7 But it also said that the resulting charge was just and
 8 reasonable. In fact, ratepayers benefited overall from
 9 what was done by Entergy.
 10 QUESTION: Must be a section of the FERC rules
 11 or regs or tariffs which says the company may -- must --
 12 or must pass over to the company that has the higher
 13 number of generators a charge equal to the amount, da, da,
 14 da, that this particular thing we have before it gives the
 15 allocation for.
 16 MR. SCHLICK: Well, the -- the rate schedule
 17 has been approved --
 18 QUESTION: Yes.
 19 MR. SCHLICK: -- by FERC and --
 20 QUESTION: All right --
 21 MR. SCHLICK: -- there's a requirement --
 22 QUESTION: -- it says that in the rate schedule.
 23 MR. SCHLICK: -- and there's a requirement to
 24 the comply with rate schedule.
 25 QUESTION: So the rate schedule of FERC says

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 charge a rate --
 2 MR. SCHLICK: That's right.
 3 QUESTION: -- based on this allocation.
 4 MR. SCHLICK: That's right.
 5 QUESTION: All right. All right. I'll ask the
 6 other side. I don't see any room for the question that
 7 was just raised.
 8 MR. SCHLICK: If the Court has no further
 9 questions.
 10 QUESTION: I -- I do. I mean, what -- what
 11 happens if the -- the State says, they haven't charged it
 12 according to that allocation?
 13 QUESTION: Then Mississippi --
 14 QUESTION: Well, let counsel answer.
 15 (Laughter.)
 16 MR. SCHLICK: Justice Scalia, what -- what
 17 happens is then the question becomes was the resulting
 18 charge just and reasonable. In order 415, FERC determined
 19 the resulting charge after a violation of the rate
 20 schedule was just and reasonable. In fact, ratepayers in
 21 Louisiana benefited from what Entergy did, notwithstanding
 22 that it wasn't in compliance with the terms of the rate
 23 schedule at that time.
 24 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schlick.
 25 Mr. Fontham, we'll hear from you.

26

1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. FONTHAM
 2 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 3 MR. FONTHAM: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and
 4 may it please the Court:
 5 The issue in this case is the following. The
 6 FERC approved a contract amendment that established
 7 conditions, procedures before a utility could bill an
 8 affiliate for units in mothballs. The utility failed to
 9 follow the procedures, failed to consider the conditions,
 10 and failed to record the decision in its minutes, as it
 11 was required to do, and then said to the LPSC --
 12 QUESTION: We're -- we're within about 15 feet
 13 of you, Mr. Fontham. You don't have to speak up.
 14 (Laughter.)
 15 MR. FONTHAM: 
 Thank you, Your Honor. 16 And then said to the LPSC, you must take the
 17 charges anyway.
 18 QUESTION: Yes, I think that's right under the
 19 law, isn't it?
 20 MR. FONTHAM: No, it's not, Your Honor.
 21 QUESTION: Because?
 22 MR. FONTHAM: Because the issue in this case is
 23 a drastic departure from what this Court held in MP&L or
 24 in Nantahala. In that --
 25 QUESTION: Because? Okay, that's exactly --

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FONTHAM: In those cases --
 2 QUESTION: Yes. To get the question very
 3 precise, that is the question. In MP&L, it said once FERC
 4 sets a rate, which means, I take it, that they have the
 5 terms that we've just described in the tariffs, a State
 6 may not conclude in setting retail rates that the
 7 FERC-approved rates are unreasonable.
 8 MR. FONTHAM: That's correct.
 9 QUESTION: All right. Now, what's the
 10 difference between that and what you just said?
 11 MR. FONTHAM: The -- the difference is that the
 12 FERC set the rate. The utility couldn't bill for the
 13 units because it hadn't gone through the procedure under
 14 the FERC rate. The utility billed anyway. It says if the
 15 rate said 5, the utility sends a bill for 10. 10 shows up
 16 in the retail rate case.
 17 The question is, can the State agency, looking
 18 at the FERC tariff and looking at what the utility billed,
 19 make the decision, instead of the utility making the
 20 decision, in the State proceeding that it's wrong.
 21 QUESTION: That's the question --
 22 QUESTION: Maybe -- maybe it can if FERC has not
 23 previously adjudicated that very question.
 24 MR. FONTHAM: And it hasn't.
 25 QUESTION: I mean, here what -- what they're

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 contending is that FERC not only prescribed the formula,
 2 but that in order 415, it adjudicated that the formula had
 3 been properly applied or, if improperly applied, close
 4 enough for Government work is what they said. And once
 5 they decided that, their contention is, it's not up to the
 6 State to second-guess them.
 7 MR. FONTHAM: Well, Your Honor, I don't -- that
 8 may be what they're saying, but that's not what happened
 9 in the case. The -- in the case the FERC did refuse to
 10 order refunds. It held that the utility had invalidly
 11 exercised its, quote/unquote, discretion to violate a
 12 clear and ambiguous tariff for 10 years.
 13 Then it said, we're going to have a new tariff. 
 14 We're going to curb the utilities' discretion. We're
 15 going to require the utility to have a procedure. We were
 16 saying it is too -- it was too vague, but no, no. The
 17 utilities said, our discretion will be curbed. The FERC
 18 said, their discretion will be curbed. The Court of
 19 Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said their discretion will be
 20 curbed.
 21 QUESTION: Didn't FERC -- didn't FERC also say
 22 that the rates that had resulted during the period prior
 23 to the amendment were just and reasonable rates?
 24 MR. FONTHAM: The FERC said that looking
 25 retroactively, in effect, retroactively --

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Absolutely. They're looking
 2 retroactively.
 3 MR. FONTHAM: Yes, sir.
 4 QUESTION: And having done so, and having set
 5 the rate, how then is a State utilities commission, in
 6 effect, able to go behind that determination?
 7 MR. FONTHAM: Because the costs that were
 8 incurred and are at issue here -- actually, I lost that
 9 issue before the LPSC. The LPSC, as to all the charges up
 10 until August 1997, said since the FERC retroactively
 11 effectively changed the filed rate -- I don't know how
 12 they can do that, but they did -- they retroactively
 13 approved a new filed rate. You -- we can't touch that.
 14 Then the LPSC said, okay, now we've got a new
 15 contract amendment that operates prospectively. And what
 16 does it require? Take a look at what it requires. This
 17 was in -- litigated issue. And the LPSC says, well, they
 18 didn't follow the conditions again.
 19 QUESTION: But wait. Can you please go back and
 20 explain to me my question?
 21 MR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor.
 22 QUESTION: To use your example --
 23 MR. FONTHAM: Yes, sir.
 24 QUESTION: -- we have, I mean, it sounds to me
 25 that what you're saying is a revolution in rate conditions

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 or setting in the United States. I've always understood
 2 it to be, because of the sentence of MPL that I read to
 3 you, that if FERC says we have a piece of paper here that
 4 either directly or through a formula makes clear that $5
 5 of your cost, your total cost for the consumer, is correct
 6 way to determine an interstate part of it, then when the
 7 local commission looks at the $10 rate to the consumer, it
 8 can do what it wants, but it has to take that $5 as a
 9 given.
 10 MR. FONTHAM: We did that.
 11 QUESTION: Now, if the commission thinks that
 12 the $5 that the company put on its line as part of the
 13 interstate payment did not comply with every condition,
 14 did not satisfy the law because it was unjust and
 15 unreasonable, their remedy is to go to FERC and to say, 16 FERC, they didn't comply with your conditions. They
 17 let -- got an unreasonable rate. That the commission's
 18 remedy -- the local commission -- is not to readjudicate
 19 that itself.
 20 And the -- the legal authority for what I've
 21 just said I've always thought was the sentence I read to
 22 you out of MP&L. Now, where am I wrong in that?
 23 MR. FONTHAM: You are wrong, Your Honor, in
 24 this. MP&L says that the State commission has to take
 25 the 5. If the tariff says 5, it has to take the 5.

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: That's what I said.
 2 MR. FONTHAM: We're dealing with the
 3 extra 5 here. We're dealing with the overcharge, the
 4 overbilling, the violation of the contract.
 5 QUESTION: The extra 5. Now, I thought what we
 6 were dealing with here was a formula set out by what I
 7 used to call the FPC, which -- which formula said that
 8 the 5 is made up of many things. One of those things is
 9 a charge that the Louisiana company is to pay to a company
 10 in a different State to reflect the fact that that company
 11 in the different State has generators in reserve capacity
 12 that serve everybody, and among those generators are
 13 generators that were put in mothballs provided that they
 14 noted in the minutes of the joint company, et cetera that
 15 this is a mothballed generator available for reserve 16 capacity if necessary.
 17 All right, and if I understand it correctly and
 18 I've said it correctly, then the cost at issue here is
 19 part of the 5, not part of the other 5.
 20 MR. FONTHAM: I'll give you that, Your Honor. 
 21 The -- but the -- but the problem and the difference is
 22 that -- there was a little more in the tariff condition. 
 23 It said you have to have a plan to return the unit to
 24 service.
 25 QUESTION: Yes.

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FONTHAM: Did they have that? No. It
 2 said --
 3 QUESTION: No, but now we're repeating because
 4 I -- I just said that if you think that the minutes were
 5 not filled, if you think one of the other conditions that
 6 was put forth in that particular tariff, which I guess
 7 is -- what is -- page 57 or something of the -- of -- but
 8 if you think one of those was not fulfilled, then your
 9 remedy is to go to the FPC -- the FERC rather.
 10 MR. FONTHAM: And then -- and that poses the
 11 question beautifully because we're in a State ratemaking
 12 proceeding and now we know the question. Does the State
 13 get to interpret the tariff and decide what it means and
 14 what it says, or does the utility? Because the FERC is
 15 not here to tell us. 
 So the question is, what goes into 16 rates today? The utility's decision based on a violation
 17 of the tariff which was litigated through the Louisiana
 18 courts? They got to eat the cake, but now they're back
 19 because they didn't like the taste of the cake, to put
 20 it --
 21 QUESTION: Mr. Fontham, I'm a little confused on
 22 who is the they because my understanding was that the
 23 Louisiana company, ELI, had no say in this, that it was
 24 the Entergy, the -- the holding company -- the -- for all
 25 of these five companies, that gave the instructions. And

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 it wasn't as though ELI could say, well, we think you
 2 allocated too much to us. You're making us pay too much. 
 3 The -- each unit is bound by what Entergy says. So the
 4 they seems to me to be Entergy, but the Louisiana Public
 5 Service Commission has only ELI before it.
 6 MR. FONTHAM: That's true, Your Honor.
 7 QUESTION: So how can it say that ELI was at
 8 fault for something that ELI is locked into by virtue of
 9 being part of this multistate --
 10 MR. FONTHAM: What -- what the commission says
 11 is that ELI is at fault in the sense of any utility, going
 12 back to -- to Justice Souter's reference to two
 13 independent companies in a wholesale power transaction. 
 14 Now, we all know you can go to court to enforce a
 15 wholesale tariff, and that's where most people go. 16 In the case of a parent-subsidiary relationship,
 17 well, obviously the parent gets to tell the subsidiary
 18 what to do. That's true in everything. It's true of many
 19 cost allocations that we see. We see hundreds of millions
 20 of dollars of cost allocations coming into Louisiana based
 21 on Entergy's decisions under innumerable types of
 22 allocation schemes, including the Federal tariff.
 23 And ELI has an obligation, even though it's
 24 owned by a parent, to make sure the parent follows the
 25 terms of the tariff, just as the wholesale buyer of

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 power --
 2 QUESTION: I'm beginning to understand your
 3 argument. Is this what it is? That you'd -- imagine we
 4 have a Federal FERC rule, and it says you can include in
 5 your -- in your charge to the wholesale company the charge
 6 of sending a salesman to the foreign State to tell him
 7 about your product. All right? And now we have -- now we
 8 have -- you go before the State commission and the company
 9 says, and it costs me $117 to send Mr. Smith to do that.
 10 And you want to say, I, of course, am forbidden
 11 from arguing to you, the State commission, that they
 12 violated the tariff. But I can tell you that this
 13 salesman, named Murphy, actually spent most of his time in
 14 a chicken restaurant, and therefore, what he did for that
 15 117 fell outside the tariff. 
 It didn't violate the 16 tariff. It fell outside the tariff.
 17 And similarly, you want to say here that the
 18 cost of the generator in mothballs did not violate the
 19 tariff to include it, but rather fell outside the tariff
 20 because they never had the minutes, et cetera. Is that
 21 what you're arguing?
 22 MR. FONTHAM: I'm arguing both, Your Honor,
 23 because --
 24 QUESTION: Well, what's both? If you say --
 25 MR. FONTHAM: Well --

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: If you say you're arguing it violated
 2 the tariff, you have an additional problem which is that
 3 the Louisiana Public Service Commission itself said that
 4 the staff wants us to say this violated the FERC tariff,
 5 but we have no power to do that.
 6 MR. FONTHAM: No. That -- that was as to the
 7 refunds. That was as to the period going up to 1996.
 8 QUESTION: No. No.
 9 MR. FONTHAM: But -- but, Your Honor, let me --
 10 let me take this and put it in -- in context here. When a
 11 State commission decides issues of intrastate ratemaking,
 12 it decides all kinds of questions of Federal law. It has
 13 to decide what the Internal Revenue Code requires. It has
 14 to decide what the consolidated tax return provides for. 
 15 It has to decide SEC allocations that are filed with the 16 SEC.
 17 So along comes a situation that's completely
 18 within its expertise. What does a FERC tariff require? 
 19 And it makes so many decisions involving millions and
 20 millions of dollars in which it -- it decides as -- as any
 21 other State court. You apply Federal law, you apply State
 22 law. It's the whole body of law that you're dealing with.
 23 QUESTION: Except that FERC specifically
 24 addressed this question.
 25 MR. FONTHAM: No, Your Honor. The FERC did not

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 address this question. This is tariff 2. Tariff 1 the
 2 FERC did address and it said the utility violated the
 3 tariff.
 4 Now we're on tariff 2, and tariff 2 was
 5 designed, according to the FERC, to curb the utility's
 6 discretion. And -- and that tariff 2, designed to curb
 7 the utility's discretion, the utility then immediately
 8 proceeded to ignore. And even in their reply brief, they
 9 say, we did nothing more than we ever did before. That's
 10 on the first page of their reply brief.
 11 QUESTION: But isn't the way to look at the
 12 problem this way? FERC says you may charge a certain
 13 tariff. We're not coming up with the actual number now --
 14 MR. FONTHAM: No.
 15 QUESTION: 
 -- because it depends on facts that 16 will vary over time. You may -- we -- we are approving a
 17 tariff. You supply the number and you must supply the
 18 number according to certain conditions. And what the
 19 Louisiana commission is now saying is, the number that you
 20 supplied was a number that violates those conditions.
 21 MR. FONTHAM: Right. That's true.
 22 QUESTION: The fact remains that on the face of
 23 it, FERC has said, if you come up with the number, that's
 24 the tariff. So if you are going to challenge that number,
 25 aren't you, in effect, challenging a FERC determination? 

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 And to do that, don't you have to go back to FERC and say,
 2 they didn't follow your conditions, and therefore you,
 3 FERC, should tell them that that number is, in fact, wrong
 4 and they can't charge it?
 5 MR. FONTHAM: Your Honor --
 6 QUESTION: What's wrong with that analysis?
 7 MR. FONTHAM: -- I -- I don't think that's
 8 correct. I do think that your predicate is correct. 
 9 They -- they -- the FERC gave them a tariff. That's the
 10 tariff. The utility's decision doesn't become the tariff. 
 11 It's like any contract case. If I have a contract with
 12 you, and I can charge you 5, and I send you a bill for 10,
 13 that doesn't -- my 10 doesn't become the tariff.
 14 QUESTION: Right, except that in this case --
 15 and -- and maybe this is where I'm going wrong. Tell me
 16 if I am. In this case, I thought FERC did not say the
 17 number is 5.
 18 MR. FONTHAM: Yes. It said -- what it said
 19 was -- is, you go through this process, step 1, step 2,
 20 step 3 --
 21 QUESTION: Right.
 22 MR. FONTHAM: -- step 4. The utility did none
 23 of that.
 24 QUESTION: No, but -- but at the end -- but what
 25 FERC is saying is, if -- if you go through that process,

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the number you get at the end of the process is what our
 2 tariff guarantees you to charge.
 3 MR. FONTHAM: Yes, that's true.
 4 QUESTION: And in this case, you're saying -- so
 5 that -- so that the -- FERC is not saying what the number
 6 is in advance. It's setting the process in advance.
 7 MR. FONTHAM: Right.
 8 QUESTION: And what you're saying is, sure, they
 9 came up with the number, ostensibly what FERC told them
 10 they could do, but they didn't go through the right
 11 process to get it, and therefore the number's no good. 
 12 But in order to say the number is no good, you're still
 13 challenging something which, at least on its face, has
 14 been authorized by FERC. And therefore, why isn't the
 15 appropriate action for you to take, to go back to FERC and 16 say, the number they're claiming under your authority is
 17 the wrong number, tell them it's the wrong number?
 18 MR. FONTHAM: Okay. I'll -- I'll answer the
 19 last question first. The reason the appropriate action
 20 for the LPSC to take is not to go to FERC is because the
 21 LPSC has the authority as part of its State ratemaking
 22 authority, as part of State law to make --
 23 QUESTION: Yes, but that's the question here. 
 24 That's the question here.
 25 MR. FONTHAM: That's the question.

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Do they have it or is it preempted?
 2 MR. FONTHAM: Well, it wasn't preempted --
 3 QUESTION: And one question as to whether it's
 4 preempted, I would think, would be can they go back to the
 5 Federal ratemaker and -- and, in fact, get the relief that
 6 they want. That's something we ought to consider.
 7 MR. FONTHAM: And, Your Honor, the -- our
 8 position is -- and I believe it's correct -- that there's
 9 nothing in the Federal Power Act that preempts the State
 10 from doing this, that the only FERC jurisdiction to decide
 11 enforcement issues didn't even -- they created it in 1980
 12 approximately. They were told in 16 U.S.C. 825m that if
 13 they found a violation of a tariff, they had to go to
 14 United States District Court.
 15 And there's nothing in the Federal Power Act. 16 In fact, the Senate had a provision in the Federal Power
 17 Act that the FERC can award remedies for violations of its
 18 orders. It was pulled out.
 19 QUESTION: In other words, they --
 20 QUESTION: Okay. You're talking about the
 21 condition today, and what you're saying today is, whenever
 22 FERC sets a tariff that leaves the bottom line number to
 23 be filled in later, a State utility commission in a
 24 ratemaking proceeding may challenge that bottom line
 25 number in its own bailiwick.

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FONTHAM: No, Your Honor. We're saying that
 2 if there's a tariff --
 3 QUESTION: I thought that's what you were doing.
 4 MR. FONTHAM: -- and it sets forth objective
 5 requirements, and it -- and the utility doesn't follow
 6 those objective requirements, then they're not entitled to
 7 bill for the units. That's all we're saying. We're
 8 not -- this is not --
 9 QUESTION: All that you're saying is that
 10 Justice Souter was wrong to limit it to places where the
 11 Federal tariff is open. It's just as applicable to
 12 instances where the Federal tariff is specific. And
 13 you're saying that Congress in the Federal Power Act set
 14 up an act where you have a single central Federal body to
 15 provide tariffs for, let's say, the billions and billions 16 of kilowatt hours made every year, but that each State --
 17 50 or 51 different local service commissions are going to
 18 adjudicate whether or not those millions of words are, in
 19 fact, violated and what we will have is 51 separate
 20 decisionmaking bodies to determine when a FERC tariff has
 21 been violated.
 22 Now, I grant you Congress did not say in the
 23 act, and we don't mean to do that. But it would be an
 24 awfully surprising thing for them to want to do.
 25 MR. FONTHAM: They did say we don't want to do

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 that. It's in -- it's in the introduction.
 2 QUESTION: Well, if they said they don't want to
 3 do it, then why are you arguing to the contrary?
 4 MR. FONTHAM: I'm saying that they -- well,
 5 maybe I misunderstood what they don't want to do, Your
 6 Honor.
 7 QUESTION: I mean, don't want to do that is --
 8 means that they don't want 51 bodies --
 9 MR. FONTHAM: Okay, they didn't --
 10 QUESTION: -- adjudicating the correctness of
 11 the application of rules for wholesale rates that are
 12 contained of thousands or millions of words filed before
 13 the Federal Power Commission.
 14 MR. FONTHAM: They -- they --
 15 QUESTION: 
 I've always thought that the Federal 16 Power Act did not want to have 51 adjudicative bodies, but
 17 rather wanted to have one centralized body that States
 18 were free to use.
 19 MR. FONTHAM: Not -- not at all.
 20 QUESTION: No, okay.
 21 MR. FONTHAM: What the Federal Power Act says is
 22 there's one central body to make the rate, to establish
 23 the reasonable and just terms of the rate. All the courts
 24 in the United States can decide whether a tariff is
 25 violated, including the State courts, and that's the way

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 it always has been. In fact, the FERC wouldn't hear the
 2 cases until 1979.
 3 If there was a case of a tariff violation
 4 pending in State court, you had the potential, this
 5 potential of possible loss of uniformity, which never
 6 really happened. As a matter of fact, this is a
 7 high-profile case. Where are the conflicting decisions? 
 8 And the reason is we have an objective tariff. They
 9 violated the objective tariff. Nobody can really dispute
 10 that. It was litigated in the lower courts.
 11 QUESTION: Mr. Fontham -- Mr. Fontham, there are
 12 five States in this and there could be more in a regional
 13 organization.
 14 MR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor.
 15 QUESTION: 
 If each State's public service 16 commission can do what the Louisiana commission has done,
 17 you could have chaos.
 18 MR. FONTHAM: No.
 19 QUESTION: One will say, my utility was
 20 underpaid. Another one will say, ours was overpaid. And
 21 each one could do exactly what the Louisiana commission
 22 has done. It -- it seems to me that that just cries out
 23 for having the one decisionmaker, FERC.
 24 MR. FONTHAM: Well, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I
 25 will respectfully disagree that this as big a problem

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 as -- as you are suggesting. And I'll -- I'll tell you
 2 that literally billions of dollars of costs are split up
 3 by Entergy among its companies, only a very small sliver
 4 under the Federal Power Act. Now, they split up these
 5 costs from Energy Operations, which is a nuclear company;
 6 Energy Services, which is a service company, by allocating
 7 them into the jurisdictions. Anytime there would be a
 8 conflicting decision, you could have -- supposedly you
 9 could have chaos. What really happens is the utility
 10 tries to shove as much costs as it possibly can into the
 11 jurisdictions which are reviewing the rates frequently.
 12 QUESTION: But -- but your answer to Justice
 13 Ginsburg and your earlier answer to Justice Breyer, with
 14 reference to whether there is a preemptive effect in the,
 15 what we might call, the enforcement --
 16 MR. FONTHAM: Right.
 17 QUESTION: -- or interpretation phase of the --
 18 of the tariff, it seems to me is contrary to what we said
 19 in Mississippi Power. We -- we actually were quoting
 20 Nantahala. There we said the Mississippi Supreme Court
 21 erred in adopting the view that the preemptive effect of
 22 FERC jurisdiction turns on whether a particular matter was
 23 actually determined in FERC proceedings. We have long
 24 rejected this sort of case-by-case analysis of the impact
 25 of State regulation upon the national interest.

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor, and -- and bear
 2 in mind what Justice Stevens was addressing there. The
 3 issue of prudence -- and the Court were addressing, but
 4 the issue of prudence is an issue is that comes up in
 5 making the rate. The FERC in the Federal Power Act is --
 6 is authorized to establish just and reasonable rates. If
 7 you're going to raise prudence, you raise it in the
 8 proceeding where the just and reasonable rate gets
 9 established. We admit they have that.
 10 Then you have the next question. If they start
 11 violating their contract, is that something that the
 12 States can't look at? And there's nothing in the Federal
 13 Power Act that suggests that States --
 14 QUESTION: Well, but it was violating the
 15 contract in -- in a context where FERC had -- had looked 16 at that -- that specific violation, and it -- and it
 17 announced the remedy.
 18 MR. FONTHAM: No. The prior violation. This is
 19 the second tariff, Your Honor. This is a new tariff that
 20 sets conditions which were supposedly designed to curb
 21 their discretion.
 22 But going back to MP&L, this Court's decision
 23 affirmed the decision of the Mississippi Public Service
 24 Commission. It reversed the Mississippi Supreme Court. 
 25 It affirmed the Mississippi Public Service Commission. 

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 In -- in that decision of the Mississippi Public Service
 2 Commission, 327 million will be incurred under the FERC
 3 tariff. They -- they had to actually estimate what would
 4 be incurred.
 5 Now, if you hand the utility the right to tell
 6 the State public service commission that, oh, it will be
 7 500 million, do they have to pass it through? If this
 8 Court is going to give the sword of preemption to
 9 utilities, and basically, there's a test, you know. We've
 10 got concurrent jurisdiction. The test for concurrent
 11 jurisdiction or exclusive jurisdiction is unmistakable
 12 intent of Congress. Congress had it in there, pulled it
 13 out of the -- in the Senate report. The FERC can -- can
 14 hear violations. It was in the Senate version of the bill
 15 in 1935. 
 If you look on page 6 of our brief, you'll find 16 that the Senate pulled it out. The FERC had no -- no --
 17 jurisdiction to hear tariff violation cases. It could go
 18 to court. That's 16 U.S.C., section 825m.
 19 In about 1980, the FERC said, well, you know
 20 what? We're going to infer the power to do that. And for
 21 the first time ever, because up until then, the FERC had
 22 been refusing to hear cases that were pending in State
 23 court, wouldn't even exercise primary jurisdiction. Now,
 24 obviously, if you have exclusive jurisdiction, there's no
 25 need for a primary jurisdiction doctrine. They wouldn't

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 even exercise primary jurisdiction. They left it to the
 2 State courts, all the State courts.
 3 Now, if you leave it to the State courts, what
 4 is -- how can you possibly say a State ratemaking agency,
 5 which decides issues of Federal law, contracts, all the
 6 time, has to interpret allocations, has to decide if
 7 they're right -- how could the Federal Power Act have
 8 taken away their power when the Federal Power Act was
 9 passed --
 10 QUESTION: Well, I want to be sure I get a
 11 response to this, though, because you said before -- and
 12 this very interesting argument might be cut short if the
 13 paragraph that I read to you is applied to the 19 --
 14 post-1965 costs, which I -- aren't they the costs that
 15 were at issue when -- when the staff was talking about 16 disallowing costs?
 17 MR. FONTHAM: The post-1997 --
 18 QUESTION: No. The post -- the -- there's the
 19 post-'65 or -- what --
 20 MR. FONTHAM: August -- it's August 5th, 1997.
 21 QUESTION: But -- yes.
 22 MR. FONTHAM: You have -- you have costs
 23 incurred in '96, which interestingly enough, were incurred
 24 in violation of a FERC tariff as determined by the FERC.
 25 QUESTION: Yes, yes, that's right. I understand

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 that.
 2 MR. FONTHAM: As determined by the FERC.
 3 QUESTION: But they are -- but it's -- it's the
 4 '97 costs we're talking about here.
 5 MR. FONTHAM: Going forward. That's correct.
 6 QUESTION: And -- and when they're talking
 7 about this, it seemed as if they're talking about
 8 post-August 5th, 1997 costs on page 64a, 65a.
 9 MR. FONTHAM: Right. That's when the new
 10 tariff --
 11 QUESTION: Are you sure they're not?
 12 MR. FONTHAM: That's when the new tariff became
 13 effective.
 14 QUESTION: Yes. But you know what I'm thinking
 15 of on page 64a and 65a of your appendix.
 16 MR. FONTHAM: I don't, but I'll be happy to
 17 look.
 18 QUESTION: I'm a little puzzled by your
 19 reference to the new tariff. I thought the --
 20 QUESTION: It's -- it's -- they have a -- B, is
 21 this committee precluded from determining whether the
 22 operating committee's decision was in compliance with the
 23 amended section 10.02 of the system agreement?
 24 MR. FONTHAM: It's the amendment. Yes. The
 25 amendment took effect August 5th, 19 --

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Yes, and they're talking about the
 2 post-August 5th, aren't they?
 3 MR. FONTHAM: That's correct.
 4 QUESTION: All right. Then they say, LPSC staff
 5 argues that the MS-1 overpayment should be disallowed
 6 because the decision violated the FERC tariff. As ELI
 7 argues, this commission is preempted from determining
 8 whether the terms of a FERC tariff have been met, for the
 9 issue of violation or compliance with a FERC tariff is
 10 peculiarly within FERC's purview. Any allegation of a
 11 violation of a FERC tariff should, therefore, be brought
 12 before FERC.
 13 All right. I read that and thought they seem
 14 not to have decided this on the basis that you've been
 15 arguing it.
 16 MR. FONTHAM: Your Honor, I believe they did
 17 decide it on the basis that I've been arguing, but I'll
 18 concede that that language is sitting in there. It's
 19 wrong. And --
 20 QUESTION: You mean it's wrong as a matter of
 21 law? It's wrong at describing what they thought?
 22 MR. FONTHAM: It's wrong. I think it relates
 23 to the refunds, but it's wrong as a matter of this Court's
 24 law, the fact that there was a primary jurisdiction
 25 doctrine, the fact that the States have always had the

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 power to decide this, the fact that the FERC had to
 2 infer jurisdiction to decide tariff violations in the --
 3 in around 1979 or 1980. The FERC has never had
 4 exclusive jurisdiction to decide if a contract has been
 5 violated.
 6 The Arkla against Hall case. That case is a
 7 case that came through the -- this -- the Louisiana
 8 courts. This Court held there's a difference between
 9 establishing the just and reasonable rate and enforcing
 10 the contract.
 11 And if you go back to the -- the Pan American
 12 case decided by this Court, this Court held that with
 13 regard to contract enforcement issues, which somebody was
 14 arguing need to be decided by the FERC, there was a State
 15 proceeding pending.
 16 QUESTION: Why is this a contract enforcement
 17 proceeding? I don't follow.
 18 MR. FONTHAM: Because, Your Honor, the -- it's a
 19 contract. This is one of the sections of the contract. 
 20 This is the section that -- it's an amendment to the
 21 contract that was approved by the FERC. It's a contract
 22 between the parties --
 23 QUESTION: A contract between whom?
 24 MR. FONTHAM: Pardon?
 25 QUESTION: Who is the -- who are the parties to

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 this contract?
 2 MR. FONTHAM: The parties to the contract are
 3 the five operating companies, plus --
 4 QUESTION: But you agreed with me earlier that
 5 the operating companies have to follow the instructions of
 6 Entergy.
 7 MR. FONTHAM: Only by virtue of the fact that
 8 Entergy -- not under the contract, not because the
 9 contract says so. They don't have to take an illegal
 10 charge. But as a matter of practice, I admit that the
 11 big boss of Entergy can tell the operating companies
 12 what to do, and they're not going to lose their jobs
 13 over it. So they'll take the charge if it's an
 14 overcharge. You're darned right. But not because
 15 the contract says so, Your Honor. 
 Not at all. 16 QUESTION: Is this contract the contract that
 17 has been accepted by and approved by FERC and, in effect,
 18 incorporated into the tariff?
 19 MR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor.
 20 QUESTION: So that we're not talking about a
 21 freestanding contract.
 22 MR. FONTHAM: We're --
 23 QUESTION: We're talking, in effect, about a
 24 term which the tariff incorporates by its reference to the
 25 contract.

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FONTHAM: We are -- we are really -- the
 2 contract itself --
 3 QUESTION: Well, isn't --
 4 MR. FONTHAM: -- more or less becomes the
 5 tariff, Your Honor.
 6 QUESTION: Right. That's --
 7 MR. FONTHAM: There is no separate tariff. It's
 8 just a contract. It becomes a rate schedule filed with
 9 the FERC. But in Pan American, this Court said, you
 10 know, in -- in its nature -- by its nature, a contract
 11 like that is a State court contract. And the -- and the
 12 Court made the statement by the fact that everybody knows
 13 there's a scheme of Federal regulation doesn't change
 14 that. And the State courts -- and I think it implicitly
 15 means this --
 16 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Fontham.
 17 MR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor.
