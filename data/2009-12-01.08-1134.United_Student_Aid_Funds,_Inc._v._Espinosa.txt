1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Case 08-1134, United Student Aid Funds 5 v. Espinosa. 6 Ms. Wanslee. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MADELEINE C. WANSLEE 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MS. WANSLEE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Congress has precisely delineated three 12 types of debt in bankruptcy: those that are 13 dischargeable, those that are dischargeable unless the 14 creditor timely objects, and those debts that are simply 15 not dischargeable. Student loans fall within a subset 16 of this third category. Their exception from discharge 17 is self-executing unless a debtor proves that 18 repayment will cause an undue hardship on the debtor and 19 the debtor's dependents. The Ninth Circuit rewrote 20 Bankruptcy Code section 523 to reduce those three types 21 of debt down to two. Allowing debtors to discharge 22 their student loan debts by mere declaration opens the 23 door to recategorizing every category of 24 non-dischargeable debt, and that includes -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Only -- only -- only if the
3 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 bankruptcy court disregards the law. I mean, it's -2 it's clear that the bankruptcy court should not have 3 done what it did here. The only issue is, it having 4 made that mistake, can it -- can it subsequently be -5 be undone in the manner that's -- that's sought here? 6 They haven't reduced three to two. The 7 three -- the three remain three. The bankruptcy court 8 should not do this. 9 MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, this case turns 10 upon the effect of section 1328. And the -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before -- before we get 12 to that, the Ninth Circuit did say, now, bankruptcy 13 judges, we don't want you to -- to intermeddle in this. 14 So -- so the first step -- it wasn't clear to the Ninth 15 Circuit that bankruptcy judges should not say, now, I am 16 not going to let you do this until you prove hardship. 17 MS. WANSLEE: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 18 Ninth Circuit said that bankruptcy courts have no 19 business involving themselves in this dispute if the 20 creditor fails to object. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 22 MS. WANSLEE: And the problem here is that 23 1328 specifically says that the effect of the discharge, 24 the discharge that every debtor is looking for in a 25 chapter 13 case, that discharge shall not include
4 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 non-dischargeable debt. And the language is very, very 2 important, Your Honor. It prescribes the statutory 3 effect of the discharge order, and it says that after a 4 debtor completes their payments under a plan, open 5 quote, "the court shall grant the debtor a discharge of 6 all debts provided for by the plan, except any debt of 7 the kind specified in paragraph 8." 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was wrong. Let's 9 assume -10 MS. WANSLEE: Yes. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the circuit -- the 12 district court judge, the bankruptcy court judge, got it 13 wrong, legal error. Should not have been discharged, a 14 given. Neither -- the confirmation plan should not have 15 been approved, neither should the discharge order have 16 been entered. We will go back to what was entered 17 and -- and -- and the effect of that, because I'm not 18 sure of it -- it's an error. 19 How does that give you a right to undo that 20 judgment 7 years later -- was it 5, 6, 7 years later? 21 That's the question here. Why is something that's in 22 error become a void judgment? 23 MS. WANSLEE: Justice Sotomayor, it's not 24 mere error. It's in fact void because of the plain 25 language of these particular specific statutes. They
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 have very precise words, very precise meanings. 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But so does -- most 3 error committed by courts, inadvertently or otherwise, 4 are in contravention of some statutory command. This is 5 no different. 6 Voidness, as I've heard it described by many 7 others, appears to mean that the court is acting either 8 without jurisdiction over the people, and that's not at 9 issue here -- there was jurisdiction over the parties 10 here -- or without jurisdiction over the res. But the 11 bankruptcy court does have jurisdiction, albeit in 12 some -- in all circumstances, it had jurisdiction over 13 the student debt. The issue is what could it do with 14 it. But this is not a case involving a lack of 15 jurisdiction by the court over property. 16 So why is this more than mere error? 17 MS. WANSLEE: Because Congress's statutory 18 scheme must be enforced as written. And it's -- it's 19 unequivocal here what Congress wants. Congress has 19 20 categories of debts that are excepted from discharge, 21 important exceptions: Alimony, child support -22 JUSTICE BREYER: What's the strongest case, 23 I mean, that you can muster in favor of this 24 proposition, my question being the same as Justice 25 Sotomayor's? What's the strongest case where you can
6 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 find any court that said a matter is void -- it's void, 2 not -- not just legal error, so you can attack it 90 3 years later -- it's void just because the lower court 4 that made the error didn't apply a clear statute? 5 MS. WANSLEE: Rule -6 JUSTICE BREYER: Give me your strongest case. 7 MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, Rule 60 says that 8 void orders can be attacked, and the passage of time 9 does not transmute a void order into a valid order. 10 Once void, it -11 JUSTICE BREYER: But I'd like an answer 12 to my question, because I can -- I have read the 13 treatises, which I have in front of me, and they say 14 that it's void only if you show a -- the same thing that 15 Justice Sotomayor just said. And so, since I don't 16 think there is some kind of constitutional due process 17 error here, and there's clearly jurisdiction over the 18 parties, I guess you are saying there wasn't subject 19 matter jurisdiction, which is a little vague. 20 And so I want to know what's the clearest 21 case, strongest for you, where a court has ever said 22 that a failure of some -- of some other court to apply 23 the language of a statute properly, no matter how clear, 24 is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction? What is your 25 strongest precedent? That's all I'm asking.

1 MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, we did cite a 2 number of cases in the materials. One of them is the 3 Vallely case, in which -4 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 5 MS. WANSLEE: That was the insurance company 6 case. Congress said that insurance companies could not be 7 afforded the protections of bankruptcy. And in that 8 case, the president of the company, the secretary of the 9 company, all participated in the bankruptcy. But the 10 Court found that the bankruptcy court had no authority 11 to -- to issue orders and to have that insurance company 12 within the bankruptcy context. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that -- that goes back 14 to something more fundamental. There's no issue here 15 that the court had jurisdiction over these parties, 16 unlike the insurance company. And there's no issue that 17 the court didn't have jurisdiction over this res. They 18 could decide that a student loan was dischargeable. 19 They just had to follow certain procedures. It's a very 20 different set of circumstances in that case. 21 MS. WANSLEE: Well, Your Honor, if -- if 22 this order is merely voidable, then why do we have 23 section 523(c)? 523 -- a very specific code provision: 24 All debts not included in 523 are as a matter of course 25 discharged through bankruptcy. Those that are
8 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 specifically enumerated, except for (2), (4), and (6), are 2 excepted from discharge -- (2), (4), and (6), the 3 creditor must timely file objection. 4 Why do we have that scheme? Why do we have 5 the tripart ordering? 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can a -- can a creditor 7 say, oh, skip it, I know this bankrupt is going to be 8 able to prove hardship, why go through unnecessary 9 expense? Can a -- can a creditor waive the hardship 10 determination? 11 MS. WANSLEE: No, Your Honor, a creditor may 12 not waive the undue hardship determination. 523 says 13 that student loans are only discharged upon a finding of 14 undue hardship. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So he can't -- he can't 16 stipulate to -- he will say: I want the deal that is 17 being proposed; I think I am better off getting the 18 principal, skipping the interest. I can't make that 19 deal? We have to go through this hardship procedure, 20 whether the creditor wants it or not? 21 MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, within the proper 22 context of an adversary proceeding in which the issue 23 has in fact been raised. Here, there was never any -24 any allegation of undue hardship, never. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, would the case be
9 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 different if there had been such an allegation in the 2 petition? 3 MS. WANSLEE: I think not, Your Honor, 4 Because, once again 523, requires a finding. 5 JUSTICE STEVENS: It would not have been 6 different then? What if it had been not only an 7 allegation but an affidavit? Would the case be 8 different? 9 MS. WANSLEE: Once again, I -- I think you 10 go back to the language of 1328, Your Honor. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm kind of curious to 12 know what your answer to my question is. 13 MS. WANSLEE: I apologize. 14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would the case be 15 different if the Petitioner had filed an affidavit of 16 undue hardship with the papers? Same notice, everything 17 else exactly the same. 18 MS. WANSLEE: Certainly a harder case, Your 19 Honor. However, I don't -20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is it a harder case? 21 MS. WANSLEE: I don't think -- there would 22 not have been an adjudication of undue hardship, 23 however. Just because the debtor stated it doesn't mean 24 there was then -25 JUSTICE STEVENS: And I say it's supported

1 by an affidavit. 2 MS. WANSLEE: Correct, Your Honor. 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Supported by -- would then 4 the case be different? 5 MS. WANSLEE: No, Your Honor. There has to 6 be -7 JUSTICE STEVENS: There has to be an 8 adversary hearing under your view? 9 MS. WANSLEE: Under our view, the creditor 10 is entitled to the protections of 7001 to say -11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay. So if there's not 12 only an affidavit, but an offer of proof, and then 13 there's no answer filed and nothing in response to the 14 notice of the -- the lender did exactly what it did 15 here. 16 MS. WANSLEE: No, Your Honor. I -- I don't 17 believe that undue hardship would be established under 18 those facts. Our facts, of course, are a little bit 19 easier. There was never even an allegation of undue 20 hardship -21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 22 MS. WANSLEE: -- much less proof. 23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But your legal theory 24 would be the same if there had been an affidavit filed 25 and the same -- the same response by the -- by the

1 company? 2 MS. WANSLEE: That's correct, Your Honor. 3 And I would -- I would note -4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what if 5 the creditor is sitting in the courtroom and has 6 actually made arguments and appeared in some other 7 aspects of the case? Then they come to the student loan 8 and the -- and it's ordered discharged without any 9 hearing, with the creditor sitting there. The case 10 goes to judgment, there's a final decree of discharge. 11 Can the debtor -- pardon me. Can the creditor come in 12 10 years later and say, oh, this is void? 13 MS. WANSLEE: I think they can, Your Honor. 14 And I think we can look to this Court's own precedent in 15 the Stoll case. The Stoll case said that it's important 16 to know when litigation begins and when it ends. And 17 usually this Court's opinions talk about the ending of 18 litigation. What we are talking about here is the 19 beginning. We want to know -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about -- what 21 about my question? 22 MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, at that point the 23 litigation has not commenced. There is no summons, 24 there is no service -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. No, no, no. My
12 Alderson Reporting Company

1 hypothetical is there is -- it has commenced. 2 It's a big hearing. There's lots of issues. The 3 student loan creditor is there, actually participates in 4 some of the hearings on other issues. Then, while they 5 -- while they are still there, still represented, the 6 judge says: Now, I'm going to discharge the student 7 debt; I'm not going to have any hearing. The creditor 8 does nothing. Can the creditor come in 10 years later 9 and say this is a void judgment? 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's this case. The 11 creditor was there. The creditor put in a proof of 12 claim. The creditor knew that the plan gave the 13 creditor less than the proof of claim. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my case is just a 15 little different in that the creditor is there in the 16 courtroom represented. 17 MS. WANSLEE: Okay. And a proof of claim is 18 merely for distribution purposes under a chapter 13 19 finding. It's not for discharge purposes. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about my -21 MS. WANSLEE: It -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about my question? 23 MS.

WANSLEE: -- Congress -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's an astounding 7 -- an astounding conclusion, that there -- that you 8 simply are writing out the doctrine of -- of waiver 9 altogether. 10 MS. WANSLEE: Well, Your Honor, the 11 exception to discharge is self-executing. And if it's 12 self-executing, how can we waive it? If there is no 13 duty to object -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what provision 15 was this discharge under? 16 MS. WANSLEE: The debtor's discharge was 17 entered under section 1328(a)(2). 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And 1328 says: "The 19 court shall grant a debtor a discharge." That doesn't 20 sound self-executing to me. 21 MS. WANSLEE: Well, but 1328 further goes on 22 to say: "A discharge of all debts provided for by the 23 plan" -- as this debt was provided for by the plan -24 "except any debt of a kind specified in paragraph 8 of 25 section 523."
14 Alderson Reporting Company

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: (a), and section 2 523(a) does not refer to a discharge under 1328(a). It 3 refers to a discharge under 1328(b). 4 MS. WANSLEE: That's correct, Your Honor. 5 1328(a)(2) is the discharge in play here, and 1328(a)(2) 6 brings in the discharge provisions of 523. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. 8 1328(a)(2) brings in the definition, the kind of debt 9 specified in 523(a). It doesn't bring in the discharge 10 under 523(a), which is limited to 1328(b). 11 MS. WANSLEE: It brings in the enumerated 12 debts of 523. 13 And I think it's important to -- to remember 14 that back in 1990 student loan debts were fully 15 dischargeable in chapter 13 plans. In 1992, when this 16 plan was proposed, Mr. Espinosa sought to claw back what 17 Congress had taken away 2 years earlier. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- we're conceding 19 that they violated the statute, the bankruptcy judge. 20 The question is whether it's void. And void, as you 21 just said, was three categories: One, was there a 22 violation of basic due process for your client? I don't 23 see it. Two, did the bankruptcy judge have jurisdiction 24 over the parties? It seems the answer is yes. And, 25 three, did they have subject matter jurisdiction? Which
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we started by saying was vague. 2 So I asked you for your strongest case. You 3 said Vallely. I have only looked at it quickly, but 4 it's only four pages. And what that case seems to say 5 is that there is a statute which says there is 6 bankruptcy jurisdiction over all commercial businesses 7 except for insurance companies and two other categories. 8 This party here is an insurance company, and 9 and therefore they can attack it later, because there 10 was no jurisdiction over an insurance company. 11 Now, if that's your strongest case, I don't 12 know what the others are going to say, but it seems to 13 me you don't have much precedental support to put this 14 in a category of lacking jurisdiction. 15 MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, we are talking 16 about a statutory right here, and the fact that Congress 17 has specifically provided that certain categories of 18 debts, for very important public policy reasons, are 19 carved out from discharge. And the reason it's void is 20 because it violates the plain language of the statute. 21 Again, even if it's provided for by the plan, the 22 discharge this debtor got under 1328 -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- why should it be 24 void, looking at 1327? We have a confirmed plan. You  25 - you have -- 1328 does include -- except 523(a), as you
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 pointed out. But 1327 says "Effect of 2 confirmation," and that says, "The provisions of a 3 confirmed plan" -- the provision here is you get 13,000, 4 not 17,000 -- "bind the debtor and each creditor, 5 whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided 6 for by the plan" -- which it wasn't in full here -- "and 7 whether or not such creditor has objected to or has 8 accepted or rejected the plan." 9 That seems to say at the end of the line, 10 you get that final determination confirmed, that's it. 11 That's as final as you come and whatever mistakes were 12 made on the way there, you can't look behind at the 13 confirmation. 14 MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, I'd like to 15 reserve some time. 16 But, Justice Ginsburg, to answer your 17 question, 1327 is the more general -- general 18 provision. Statutory canons provide that the more 19 specific shall control. But there's three other quick 20 reasons I'd like to give you. 21 If this case relies just on 1327, it 22 deprives the Bankruptcy Code and the rules of a coherent 23 effect. There are four other provisions implicated: 24 1322, 1325, 1328, and 523. A ruling in Mr. Espinosa's 25 favor undermines the will of Congress in this regard.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if you'd 2 like to reserve time, it's probably time to wrap up. 3 MS. WANSLEE: Thank you. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Heytens. 5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS 6 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 7 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 8 MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 Section 1328 and section 523 are best 11 construed as self-executing limitations on the effect of 12 the bankruptcy court's discharge order rather than as 13 directives to the bankruptcy court. There are two 14 reasons for -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't -- sorry to 16 start -- stop you at the beginning, but I don't see 17 that. I see in 1328(a) it says the court "shall 18 grant" the debtor. And that is not self-executing. It's 19 a directive to the court. And I see that 523(a) is 20 referred to later on, but only for purposes of 21 definition, not for purposes of discharge. 22 MR. HEYTENS: Two responses to that, Mr. 23 Chief Justice. First, if we are looking just at the 24 language of 1328, which is reproduced at the page 3 of 25 the appendix to the blue brief, it states, as the Chief
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Justice notes, that: "The court shall grant the debtor 2 a discharge" of certain debts. There is then a comma, 3 and it says "except any debt" -- now, I can see that 4 that language is subject to a degree of ambiguity. But 5 I think even that language is susceptible to being read 6 as a legal limitation on the effect of the discharge 7 order that the provision has just told the court to 8 grant. In other words, the reason that ­9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then the key 10 distinction you draw in your brief is totally 11 meaningless. You say on page 18 that this -- the issue 12 is whether the provision is, quote, "framed as a 13 directive" to the bankruptcy court. And here it is 14 framed as a directive to the bankruptcy court, and 15 therefore doesn't -- isn't self-executing. 16 MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, I think the 17 provision before the comma clearly is framed as a 18 directive to the bankruptcy court. What I'm suggesting 19 is that the language after the comma is at least capable 20 of being read consistent with -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: There are a lot of commas. 22 What comma are you referring to? 23 MR. HEYTENS: Excuse me, Justice Scalia. I 24 am referring to the comma in -- in 1328(a), the last comma 25 right before the (1), "except any debt."
19 Alderson Reporting Company

1 And the reason that we think that has to be 2 construed as a limitation on the scope of the bankruptcy 3 court's discharge order is twofold. First and foremost, 4 there has been no suggestion whatsoever that there is a 5 different rule for chapter 13 plans, which is covered by 6 1328, than there is for chapter 7 bankruptcies, chapter 7 11 bankruptcies, or chapter 12 bankruptcies. But the 8 consequences of saying that 1328 alone is not a 9 limitation, that is the consequence that that would 10 have. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the 12 consequence of -- there happen to be -- well, I counted -13 14 different kinds of things that follow that comma, 14 including criminal fines, sentences. There are all 15 kinds of things. And is it the consequence of my 16 accepting your argument that anybody who is a creditor 17 in respect to any of those 14 things can come in at any 18 time and announce under Rule 60(b)(4), even if it's 10 19 years later, that the district court -- the bankruptcy 20 court made a mistake? 21 MR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice -22 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that would be quite -23 to me -- extraordinary. So I hope the answer from your 24 point of view must still be no. 25 MR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Breyer, it
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 wouldn't be under Rule 60(b)(4), because if you 2 understand this is a limitation on the effect of the 3 discharge order, the original discharge order never 4 covers it in the first place. And I think quite the -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Wait a moment. What would it 6 be in the case where you have a discharge order and it 7 says things in it which somebody feels fall within 1 8 of these 13 categories? Now, are you saying that that 9 somebody can come back and make his argument 15 years 10 later, because he will say that, since it falls in that 11 category, the judgment is void insofar as this language 12 covers what I don't want it to cover? 13 MR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Breyer, there 14 are three very specific categories of somebodies who 15 can't do that, and Congress has specifically identified 16 those three categories. 17 In 523(c), Congress specifically identified 18 three categories of non-dischargeable debt for which the 19 onus is on the creditor to request a hearing and obtain 20 a determination by the bankruptcy court. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not -- it's not 22 that it is not dischargeable. It's only dischargeable 23 under certain conditions. 24 MR. HEYTENS: That is true with regard to 25 student loan debt, Justice --
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So -- so 2 you're almost begging the question, because it's 3 possible to argue that if a debt is not dischargeable at 4 all under any circumstance, your argument might have 5 more legs because then the court has no jurisdiction 6 over that property. 7 MR. HEYTENS: That was -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's not the case 9 with these exceptions. They can all be discharged. 10 It's just a matter of whether the conditions have been 11 met or not. 12 MR. HEYTENS: That would certainly be the 13 argument that would be made in future cases, if the 14 Court were to accept Mr. Espinosa's argument. And to be 15 clear, the consequences of accepting it and not 16 accepting that limitation would be that this would not 17 be limited to student loans. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but you see, it's the 19 same problem that's bothering us. I would like a yes 20 or no answer. 21 MR. HEYTENS: The answer is -22 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it the case if somebody 23 feels the conditions were not met with in the 13 24 categories that -- or 14 -- that follow the comma, he -25 you feel that they were met. The other side says, they

1 weren't met. I sent him a notice, but it was in a 2 balloon, okay. You know, was the notice a real notice, 3 wasn't it? People argue about that. 4 So in any case where you have a person who 5 says, no, they weren't met, and the other side says, 6 yes, they were met, that first person can come back 7 13 years later and say that the judgment was void? Is 8 the answer of the government yes or no? 9 MR. HEYTENS: With the exception of the 10 three categories in (c), the answer is yes, Justice 11 Breyer, and we think that follows straightforwardly from 12 the -13 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Is there any -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is (c)? You have 15 been talking about 523(c). I can't find it in any of 16 the materials. 17 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Scalia, we discussed 18 page -- 523(c) on pages 13 to 14 of our brief. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you put it 20 in an appendix if it's going to be part of your case? 21 I've got to search through your brief for it? 22 What page in your brief? 23 MR. HEYTENS: Pages 13 and 14. I apologize, 24 Justice Scalia. 25 The language of 523(c), which I also have, I

It states "the debtor shall be 2 discharged from a debt of a kind specified in paragraphs 3 (2), (4), or (6) of subparagraph (a) ... unless, on request 4 of the creditor to whom such debt is owed, and after 5 notice and a hearing, the court determines" that such 6 debt is to be excepted under (2), (4), or (6). 7 So for those three categories of otherwise 8 non-dischargeable debt, Congress has specifically 9 provided that the onus is on the creditor to -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I just get your answer 11 to a similar question -12 MR. HEYTENS: Sure. 13 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- I asked your colleague? 14 If the facts of this case were changed by the -- the 15 creditor had come in and stipulated to the plan before 16 the court and explained at the time, we think it would 17 be better to get what money's available now rather than 18 waiting for the interest to be collected later on, if 19 they had stipulated to it, and then the order was 20 entered, you would still say, 10 years later, they could 21 charge it? 22 MR. HEYTENS: With -- with one caveat, 23 Justice Stevens, which I -- I don't mean to fight the 24 hypothetical. I just think I need to clarify. The 25 creditor can certainly stipulate to the underlying facts

HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, in that 5 situation, there has not been an undue hardship 6 determined -7 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you -- you would have the 8 same position then? 9 MR. HEYTENS: We would say yes, and we think 10 that follows naturally from this Court's decision in 11 Hood, where the Court clearly described 523(8)(a) as a 12 self-executing limitation. The Court specifically 13 said it -14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the only way to do it 15 is to go through an adversary hearing with full notice, 16 and every -- and nobody wants to incur that expense. 17 This is a bankruptcy. You are trying to save assets. 18 The bankruptcy judge thinks this makes no sense. The 19 creditor says, okay. But you -- you agree with your 20 colleague that, under this 523 whatever, you must have 21 the full adversary hearing, notice, complaint, the 22 works? 23 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Ginsburg, you don't 24 necessarily need to have the full adversary hearing. 25 What you have to have is what Congress provided for in
25 Alderson Reporting Company

1 523(a)(8). You have to have an undue hardship 2 determination that is made by the bankruptcy court. 3 Now, the parties can stipulate to the 4 underlying facts. But as this Court said in Hood, even 5 if the creditor does not show up for the adversary 6 proceeding, if the creditor completely defaults, this 7 Court said, on pages 453 and 454 of Hood, the bankruptcy 8 court still cannot discharge that debt -9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the irony of your 10 position is it's in the creditor's interest to get what 11 is available at this time, rather than waiting 10 years 12 hoping to get interest later on, and even though that's 13 the fact, you cannot give relief in this situation. 14 MR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Stevens, the 15 creditor certainly does have interests. But I think the 16 reason Congress would provide for this regime is that 17 there is an important public interest at stake here, 18 too, which is that the Department of Education is 19 reinsuring all of these student loans. 20 And there is a powerful interest in ensuring 21 the integrity of the student loan system as a whole, 22 that, regardless of the decisions that an individual 23 debtor and perhaps an individual creditor are willing to 24 make in particular cases, Congress has an overriding 25 policy that student loans should not be discharged

1 unless there is a determination that this is the 2 extraordinary case, rather than the ordinary. 3 Now, there's a very practical reason why 4 this matters. There were 374,000 chapter 13 filings 5 last year. There is no such thing as a standard form 6 chapter 13 plan. 7 The logical consequences of affirming the 8 Ninth Circuit's judgment in this case is to tell every 9 single chapter 13 debtor who has a student loan debt to 10 include a provision like this in his plan, in the hopes 11 that the creditor will not object and he will be able to 12 obtain a discharge in the absence of any finding by the 13 bankruptcy court. 14 It won't just be limited to chapter 13 15 debtors, either. It will apply to any debtor who has 16 a non-dischargeable -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't bankruptcy courts 18 read the law? 19 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Scalia -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you've got to assume that 21 every bankruptcy court is going to violate the 22 provisions of the statute. 23 MR.

HEYTENS: Well, it's not harmless, 12 Justice Stevens -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer, excuse 13 me -- because the question is: Who does it make sense to 14 put the onus on? Now, to your question -- the 15 bankruptcy judges can do it. 16 There were 374,000 filings last year. There 17 are less than 350 bankruptcy judges in this country. 18 That means more than 1,000 chapter 13 plans for every 19 single bankruptcy judge in the country. The idea that 20 bankruptcy judges are going to be policing every single 21 chapter 13 plan, it's just not realistic, and I don't -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why, of course, they 23 are supposed to police -24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the idea that they 25 have to have a charade hearing is -- is equally

It would be 4 consistent with the normal rules of civil litigation 5 that if a party wishes not to contest a factual issue in 6 a properly noticed hearing, they can make that choice. 7 Thank you. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 9 Mr. Meehan. 10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. MEEHAN 11 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 12 MR. MEEHAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 13 and may it please the Court: 14 Last term, in Travelers, this Court held 15 that, if the plain terms of a confirmed 11 plan 16 unambiguously apply to a particular issue, they are 17 entitled to their effect. That is this case, I submit. 18 Now, the case did go on to acknowledge that 19 there can be some situations in which the finality is 20 not going to be found -- it said subject matter per se 21 is not one of those -- but that if the court's action 22 was so plainly beyond its jurisdiction as to be a 23 manifest abuse of authority -- and this was not 24 necessary to the holding, I suppose, but it was 25 described in kind of where we would be in terms of

MEEHAN: I acknowledge that it did 6 violate the statute. And I would -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. And it should not 8 have done it, and future bankruptcy courts shouldn't do 9 it? 10 MR. MEEHAN: I think that -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: It makes a big difference 12 to how I'm going to look on this case. I mean, if you ­13 MR. MEEHAN: I would agree that that is 14 correct, Your Honor. The reason I hesitate is this: 15 Mr. Heytens said that there are, on average, 1,000 16 chapter 13 plans filed per bankruptcy judge every year. 17 The bankruptcy judges do and are entitled to have 18 creditors make objections. Indeed, I think that Justice 19 Stevens was right that if a creditor and a debtor wanted 20 to come in and stipulate that there would be a discharge 21 of a portion of the student loan without a finding of 22 undue hardship, then certainly they can do so. 23 I don't -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it easy for a 25 bankruptcy judge to identify a particular debt as a

1 student loan debt? I mean, would the bankruptcy 2 filing -- filing show it -- you know, student loan debt? 3 MR. MEEHAN: As far as I know, it would. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It would? 5 MR. MEEHAN: And there may be circumstances 6 in which there is student loan debt which is not one of 7 the two plans that are guaranteed by the Department of 8 Education because Congress -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 10 MR.

And I -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was the only debt. 14 This -- there was no other debt. 15 MR.

Because you -- your answer was you think 23 the bankruptcy judge does have the obligation to bring 24 out this requirement that -- of a hardship showing? 25 MR. MEEHAN: If I used the word
31 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 "obligation," perhaps I was a little imprecise. Let me 2 put it this way: Number one, I am not here to say, nor 3 have we ever said at any stage of this litigation, that 4 this plan complied with 523(a)(8). That's clear. 5 Number two, if there had been any objection 6 raised whatsoever at any time, then it would obviously 7 have been wrong for the bankruptcy judge to confirm the 8 plan. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: What if there's no 10 objection? The bankruptcy judge sees a chapter 13 plan, 11 and it -- it provides for the discharge of student debt; 12 it covers student debt. It's labeled "student debt." 13 Is it improper for the bankruptcy judge to 14 say you can't do this by this mechanism, you have to 15 start an adversary proceeding? 16 MR. MEEHAN: I do not think it is improper 17 for the bankruptcy judge to act that way, because under 18 section -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't hear. Proper -20 MR. MEEHAN: I do not think -- I'm sorry. I 21 do not think it would be improper. I think, under 22 section 105 of the code, indeed, the bankruptcy court 23 has what I would analogize as sort of the All Writs Act, 24 which says that the bankruptcy court may act sua sponte 25 to enforce --
32 Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's not enough for 2 me, that it's not improper for him to do it. I want you 3 to say that that is what he ought to do. 4 MR. MEEHAN: Well, Justice Scalia -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're not willing to 6 say that. You're willing to say that bankruptcy courts 7 can do that if they like, but, you know, if they have a 8 kid that has a lot of bankruptcy debts, he has a soft 9 heart for student loan debts, he sees this as a student 10 loan debt, all right, let's give this kid a break. And 11 he enters -- that's okay? 12 MR. MEEHAN: No, I balance -- I balance your 13 question against Justice Stevens's hypothetical, and 14 only in the circumstance where it is clear either 15 through extensive notice, and I say waiver here, or 16 through an actual stipulation -- only in those 17 circumstances would it be appropriate for a bankruptcy 18 court to confirm a plan. 19 And even then, I submit, under section 105, 20 if the bankruptcy court said I will not do so, the 21 bankruptcy court need not do so, and in fact -- in fact, 22 the bankruptcy judge here, Judge Hollowell, when she 23 denied United relief under Rule 60, said that she as a 24 bankruptcy judge would not have done so. And that is 25 certainly within their authority to do. And Justice

1 Scalia -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you would say it's wrong 3 for the bankruptcy court to do it without a waiver, and -4 but you're leaving open if there is a clear waiver, 5 despite the fact of no adversary proceeding -- you're 6 not -- you're not necessarily willing to say that the 7 bankruptcy court can't do that? 8 MR. MEEHAN: Yes, because -- let me back up 9 and talk perhaps a little more generally. 10 I mean, in litigation in general, parties are 11 free to stipulate away or to decide not to litigate an 12 element of a claim. If they, in fact, do that, most 13 judges would say that's fine. Now, in this instance, 14 again -- and I don't want to be too repetitious -- but 15 in this instance, the bankruptcy judge does have that 16 extra "well, no," I read this as being something that's 17 too important for me to let the parties stipulate away. 18 That's the only reason that I don't go completely with 19 your hypothetical. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: Was the Ninth Circuit 21 correct in saying that an attorney can't be sanctioned 22 under the bankruptcy rules' equivalent version of Rule 23 11, for attempting to sneak through a discharge of 24 student debt in a chapter 13 petition? 25 MR. MEEHAN: Justice Alito, number one, we

1 don't have a case here of sneaking through. I do want 2 to make that point. This was clear notice. 3 Number two, I think the bankruptcy court -4 excuse me, the Ninth Circuit was not wrong, because in 5 the Ninth Circuit, there was binding precedent, the Pardee 6 case. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that. But in 8 the absence of circuit -- controlling circuit precedent, 9 is it -- can an attorney be sanctioned for attempting to 10 get the discharge of student debt through a chapter 13 11 petition, knowing, as I assume every bankruptcy attorney 12 knows, that that is not the proper way to attempt to get 13 discharge of a student debt -- student loan? 14 MR. MEEHAN: I'm not able to tell you as a 15 matter of settled Ninth Circuit law that that is or is 16 not the case. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: I am not interested in what 18 Ninth Circuit law is. 19 MR. MEEHAN: Then, Justice Alito, I thought 20 that you had been asking me under Ninth Circuit law. 21 You're saying as a matter of -22 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I'm asking you -- I'm 23 asking you, under -- under Bankruptcy Rule 9011. 24 MR. MEEHAN: My position would be that if it 25 is up front, clear notice -- in effect, a proposal that we
35 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 just don't have a Federal case out of an undue hardship 2 determination for $4,000 -- that it does not violate 3 Rule 11 or 9011 to make that proposal. 4 If there is some sort of lack of candor or 5 if there's some sort of weaseling, one might say 6 perhaps. And I think it's interesting that those 7 courts which have said that this is not something that 8 bankruptcy lawyers should do have not, so far as I was 9 able to find, invoked Rule 11 or Rule 9011. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But did you -- the net 11 effect of this is if you have taken a debt that is 12 non-dischargeable and put it into the category that it 13 is dischargeable unless the creditor objects. 14 MR. MEEHAN: Yes. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the code puts the 16 onus on the debtor to raise the hardship question. 17 Your reading is, even if the debtor is 18 silent, totally silent, says nothing about hardship, 19 unless the creditor objects, then the discharge will be 20 proper; the plan can be confirmed. So you are taking a 21 burden that Congress has put on the debtor and switching 22 it to the creditor. 23 MR. MEEHAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I would 24 say that it doesn't shift the burden. It -- it does 25 shift the going forward, I suppose, in the sense of

1 making an objection. 2 But let's remember that this is something 3 that would obviously have been reversed on appeal had 4 the -5 JUSTICE BREYER: But why would it not be a 6 sanctionable matter under Rule 11? If -- the lawyer 7 knows that he is supposed to make this special claim to 8 get this kind of discharge -- he knows an ordinary claim 9 won't do it. He submits a paper that asks for the 10 ordinary discharge, but he has to sign it, and that 11 sign -- that signature, is a -- is a certification that to 12 the best of his knowledge, the claims and other legal 13 contentions are warranted by existing law. 14 So if he signs it knowing that that isn't 15 the way to do it -- indeed, there is not even an 16 argument for doing it that way, for modifying the law -17 then why isn't that a sanctionable matter under Rule 11? 18 MR. MEEHAN: I am not here to say absolutely 19 it is not, Justice Breyer. 20 What I'm saying, I think, is that some of 21 the bankruptcy courts in some of the circuits have said, 22 at least without invoking Rule 11, that it -- that it is 23 improper. Others have not had that difficulty. I, as a 24 lawyer who has litigated for 39 years and is very 25 conscious of Rule 11, have never thought that if --

1 again, if it was something that was plain and not 2 obfuscated, that a proposal to simply omit one element 3 of a claim violated Rule 11. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the reason I ask that 5 -6 MR. MEEHAN: I think it's debatable -7 JUSTICE BREYER: The reason I ask that is I 8 think the argument on the other side is that it's so 9 clear in the law that this is not the way to go about it, 10 that you have to make a separate piece of paper saying 11 you have special hardship; that that's so clear what 12 Congress wanted, that 40 years later you can come back 13 and attack it, if they didn't do it. I mean, that's 14 basically, in my mind, their argument. 15 But I think a simpler way would be to say if 16 it's that clear, if it really is that clear, the bar 17 itself will enforce the rule by not knowingly deviating 18 from the way that Congress set it out, to which there is 19 no legal objection. Now, is it really -- what do you 20 think of that? 21 MR. MEEHAN: I think that -- I think that, 22 again, in the context of what this case -- the issue of 23 this case, I think that's right. 24 I think -- and this Court said in Taylor v. 25 Freeland & Kronz that we are not going to adopt a rule

I think that -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's the price of 7 your winning this case, it's clearly worth it now -8 agreeing with Justice Breyer on that point. 9 MR.

But generally 15 speaking that is correct. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just wondering, 17 doesn't it happen all the time that creditors are not 18 listed and then they come in later and say the debt is 19 not discharged? I mean, doesn't that happen all the time? 20 MR.

MEEHAN: Justice Ginsburg, the child 14 support or domestic support has a number of additional 15 protections surrounding it.

Absolutely, unless there is an affirmative 22 waiver. But let's remember that when we talk about 23 "should," I think we're talking about appellate issues. 24 We're talking about error on appeal.

1 the point about the same effect occurring for taxes and 2 breaches of fiduciary duty et cetera, et cetera, proves 3 too much, is that if we are going to say that none of 4 those is finally put to rest, even though there was 5 notice, even though there was acceptance of benefits, as 6 occurred here, even though there was a submission to the 7 jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, as occurred here 8 -- even though there was, you know, just bypassing the 9 early, if I may say "early" Rule 60 remedies -- if we 10 are going to say that none of those -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your answer to me was 12 that if the creditor doesn't object, even to a 13 non-dischargeable debt -- if the creditor doesn't 14 object, it's discharged. That's what you answered, I 15 thought. 16 MR. MEEHAN: Yes. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it doesn't matter 18 whether it's child support, taxes, or student loans, 19 right?

MEEHAN: Well, my position, I think, 23 first is, is that, as I think Justice Breyer said, 24 this is a -- this is a clear waiver, and I think the 25 Court could rule on that basis. But, number two, I think

1 if this is a judgment -- a final judgment, proper 2 notice -- we do not have a due process concern, we do not 3 have a notice issue -- and the creditor has had plenty 4 of opportunity to -- to raise the error -5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure there 6 was proper notice. There was not a notice that there 7 would be a contested hearing. Or that there would be an 8 adversary hearing. 9 MR. MEEHAN: Justice Kennedy, I think -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm not sure that 11 there was a proper notice. 12 MR. MEEHAN: I think you must look at it 13 this way: The notice that was given was for the 14 confirmation of a plan. That is the notice then that is 15 required under the bankruptcy rules, and it was noticed 16 in accordance with the bankruptcy rules. 17 Is it right to do it in a bankruptcy plan 18 confirmation? If objected to, no, it's not. If not 19 objected to, the plan says what the plan says, and the 20 notice that must be given is notice of the plan. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course that's the 22 problem in the case. Sometimes we decide cases that 23 don't make a lot of difference and that once we decide 24 the rule everybody will know what the rule is. But in 25 this case, the Petitioners say that if we adopt the rule

1 that the Ninth Circuit adopted, it's going to be 2 extremely burdensome and costly on -- on municipalities, 3 on -- on those who give student loans, et cetera. And 4 that -- and that you are just creating a tremendous 5 burden on an already overburdened system. 6 MR. MEEHAN: Well, the argument that was 7 made by the Petitioner and its amici on that point, I 8 think, as -- as was pointed out in one of our amicus 9 briefs, overlooks the electronic notice, the 10 instantaneous notice, the fact that under Federal 11 regulations, which, by the way, do also require the 12 guarantee and lenders to do these things and to exercise 13 due diligence before they can get repaid -14 JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's what why 15 it's a -- this is actually -- the part that is a lack of 16 understanding or a complete understanding on my part, is 17 -- is how Rule 60(b) works, because -- because it does  18 - the law does have the three categories -- the three 19 categories that your friend described. And this third 20 category is supposed to prevent a discharge even where 21 the creditor doesn't object, unless certain things are 22 filled out, and they weren't. 23 So the three are there, made an objection. 24 If at any point the creditor had come in and objected, 25 not to the discharge but, you know, just said, hey, it's

1 the wrong form; you've got it wrong. It's like an error  2 - they win. 3 MR. MEEHAN: They win. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: But -- but they waited a 5 very long time. 6 MR. MEEHAN: They did. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: So now they have to come in, 8 I guess, under 60(b), and it must be either 60(b)(4) or 9 60(b)(6) -10 MR. MEEHAN: And it was only -11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and I take it there's a 12 time limit on that, and the time limit is "a reasonable 13 time." Is that how we are supposed to do, that we have 14 to say they didn't file -- if fact they never filed 15 60 -- it's your side that filed the 60(b)(4), I 16 gather. So this is good and mixed up. 17 MR. MEEHAN: They responded with a 60(b)(4). 18 JUSTICE BREYER: It's good and mixed up. So 19 what is -- how is it supposed to work? 20 MR. MEEHAN: Well, the crux of it is, is 21 that there are other subparts of Rule 60, of course, 22 as -- as we all know, that give broader potential relief, 23 but they have time limits on them. 24 And there is also the -25 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
49 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. MEEHAN: -- provision in section 1330 2 that allows revocation for fraud, but also has a time 3 limit upon it. But Rule 60(b)(4) does not have that 4 time limit on it, but Rule 60(b)(4), which is the 5 only basis upon which Petitioners sought relief in the 6 bankruptcy court -- and they made that very clear in the 7 district court -- the only basis would be if it is void, 8 and that means one of two things: Number one is the due 9 process issue, which we haven't spent a whole lot of 10 time taking about, but I submit is clearly not viable 11 because they had actual notice, and this Court has held, 12 and so have -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not -- their 14 position is that 528(a)(8) -- or 523(a)(8) makes this -15 it puts it outside the discharge order. The discharge 16 order does not cover this kind of debt. It doesn't 17 discharge student -- student loans absent a hardship 18 determination. 19 So, what they are saying is the discharge 20 discharged other things, but it could not discharge this 21 particular debt, so it's not discharged. 22 MR. MEEHAN: To be precise, if I may, 23 1328(a) says, "The discharge shall not" and then defines 24 the categories. And as Chief Justice Roberts said -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, may I interrupt
50 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 for just one moment, because I -- there is something 2 niggling at me that I do need an answer to before you sit 3 down -4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I'd like him to 5 answer the question that I asked him first. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. 7 MR. MEEHAN: 1328 is the operative statute 8 for the discharge of a chapter 13, and it says "shall 9 discharge" except for those categories that are listed. 10 The argument has been made that there is 11 some significance to the 523, which says "does not 12 discharge." But as -- as the Chief Justice observed, 13 that applies only to the subpart (b)'s in 1328, which is 14 discharges even if the plan has not been fully performed 15 by the debtor. And the -- and this is not that 16 circumstance. 17 So the "does not" language is simply not 18 applicable to our case, because it is not a 1328(b) 19 discharge that we are involved with. 20 And so, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I think your 21 question, again, comes back to an argument of law, of 22 procedure that would be dealt with on any appeal or 23 perhaps on the -- on the more expansive subparts of Rule 24 60 if they had been properly brought. But I do not 25 see -- I have always had a hard time grappling with the
51 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 argument that somehow the fact that a statutory 2 requirement was not followed falls into the category of 3 acting so plainly beyond the court's jurisdiction that 4 its action was a manifest abuse of discretion, and I 5 think that's what you would have to conclude ­6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: On the practicality point, 7 you talk about electronic notice. I suppose that 8 that -- that the creditors for student loans could have 9 the automatic electronic thing where they say, we insist 10 on a hardship hearing. But that doesn't solve the 11 problem, because they'd then have to go back and see 12 whether or not there was a hardship hearing in the case. 13 So that -- that means they have -- they 14 have -- they have to -- they have to inquire into every 15 case whether or not the proper hearing has been made. 16 MR. MEEHAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, they 17 have to inquire, in any event, because the Federal 18 regulations require them to, number one, determine that 19 there was a filing; and, number two, even before there is 20 an adversary proceeding, to make its own assessment, the 21 lender or the guarantee -- the guarantor to make its own 22 assessment whether it's likely that there would be an 23 undue hardship in the given case, and there are other 24 circumstances which are set forth in the -- in an amicus 25 brief --
52 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, you mean they can't ask 2 for a hearing unless there is a reasonable ground to 3 believe that there is no undue hardship -- can't even ask? 4 MR. MEEHAN: No, I don't mean to say that. 5 What I mean to say is that -- is that I submit that the 6 hardship argument is a little bit overblown because they 7 have the obligations -- even though they say they don't 8 have even an obligation to open the envelope, they 9 have an obligation to look at the petition, to see what 10 the situation is, to see whether there's likely an 11 undue hardship. 12 They don't have to forbear from making an 13 objection to a plan unless they have a basis to 14 determine that there was undue hardship. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if they had 16 come to the court at the time the discharge order was 17 about to be entered and said we object, there has been 18 no undue hardship found, would the court have been 19 obligated to alter the plan at that point? The 20 confirmed plan proposed a discharge, but at the time 21 that the discharge order was being entered, there's an 22 objection. 23 MR. MEEHAN: Justice -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would have 25 happened?
53 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. MEEHAN: Justice Sotomayor, I think that 2 the result would not change, because at that point we 3 have a long final plan, and we do have -- you know, the 4 issue that is real important that we don't spend a lot 5 of time talking about because it's sort of ingrained in us 6 is finality. There are chapter 13 -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that's the question. 8 What's final? Is it the plan that's final or is it the 9 discharge order that's final? 10 MR. MEEHAN: It's the plan, I submit, 11 because the plan is what determines what's going to 12 happen. The discharge is like giving the release after 13 the plan has been fully -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but -- but here we 15 have a discharge order that on its face appeared to be 16 proper. It excepted out the student loan from the 17 discharge. 18 MR. MEEHAN: The original -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And your other -- the 20 other side has sort of given up on that as a -21 MR. MEEHAN: They have. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- as a point, because 23 that, interestingly enough to me, would have been the 24 stronger due process argument, whether the Ninth Circuit 25 and the district court could have amended that discharge

1 order illegally to except something it didn't except, 2 that was -- shouldn't have been excepted to start with. 3 But that argument seems to have been put aside. 4 MR. MEEHAN: It definitely was put aside. 5 It was not raised. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- so, it might have 7 been the stronger due process argument. But having put 8 that aside, then your belief is that there is no point 9 in time between the confirmation in the plan and the 10 discharge order in which a party can object for -- to an 11 error -12 MR. MEEHAN: Well, of course -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- except as permitted by 14 60(b) and 1330? 15 MR. MEEHAN: Well -- and as permitted by just 16 simply appealing the order. They could have done that. 17 They could have appealed. They could have done 60 -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which order could they 19 have -- they could not have appealed -20 MR.

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, going back to 2 Justice Kennedy's point, I mean, some people are listed 3 in discharge orders that were never discussed in the 4 plan, or otherwise some people are excluded that should 5 have been included. Those people can't appeal? 6 MR. MEEHAN: Well, I am not prepared to say 7 that they cannot. I certainly, if I were representing 8 them, would try -- try it, but it's just something that 9 I have not seen, and in working up this case, I am not 10 familiar with it, but it may very well be an appealable 11 order. 12 My point is simply that, the bottom line, we 13 have something here that is very final; there are 14 literally billions of dollars of disbursements made by 15 chapter 13 trustees in reliance on the these plans; and 16 it would be very, very upsetting to the bankruptcy 17 jurisdiction, exceedingly upsetting, to make a very broad 18 exception to finality. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 20 Ms. Wanslee, you have 3 minutes remaining. 21 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MADELEINE C. WANSLEE 22 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 23 MS. WANSLEE: Briefly, just on this last 24 point, no upset whatsoever to bring this matter back 25 before the bankruptcy court. Mr. Espinosa is still free
56 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to come back to bankruptcy court and argue that he has 2 got an undue hardship. 3 The distributions that are made through a 4 chapter 13 plan are a matter of statutory right, every 5 single adversary -- every single plan that had this 6 illegal plan language could come back and it would not 7 upset anything, nothing would change, no distribution 8 whatsoever. I think that's an important point. 9 And to be clear, the chief judge's -- Chief 10 Justice's question, 523 by its terms brings in 1328(b), 11 which is a different kind of discharge. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 13 MS. WANSLEE: But 1328(a)(2) specifically 14 then incorporates 523. It is applicable. It is in play. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- my -- I'm 16 not -- I'm not sure it does. It refers back to 523(a) 17 to define the debt. I don't think it incorporates 18 all -- all of 523. It's simply referring to the kind of 19 debt that should not be discharged. 20 MS. WANSLEE: Certainly, 1328(a)(2) provides 21 the laundry list of exceptions to discharge. And that's 22 the point, is that student loans are within that 19 23 categories of debts that Congress said are excepted from 24 discharge. 25 In this case, there was really no basis to
57 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 appeal the discharge order. It was proper. It was 2 appropriate. It excepted the student debt, and that's 3 found at page 46 of the record, Your Honor. 4 In terms of what happened when the matter was 5 on its limited remand, it was a very limited remand, 6 and this issue was already teed up with the Ninth Circuit. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go back to the 8 fundamental part of my question to your adversary? The 9 plan order included a discharge of the student 10 interest -- of the interest on the student loan. 11 MS. WANSLEE: It did not so specifically 12 state, Your Honor. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It just proposed a 14 discharge of a certain amount lesser than the principal 15 plus interest. 16 MS. WANSLEE: It had a predicate of 17 discharge of interest, no predicate of undue hardship. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. That's the plan. 19 And then you have a discharge order. And the two are 20 not congruent. So what's the final judgment? 21 MS. WANSLEE: The final judgment, Your 22 Honor, is the effect of 1328. Think of bankruptcy as -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. Is it the 24 confirmation order or is it the discharge order? Are they 25 different judgments? What -- what controls? And what
58 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 were you -2 MS. WANSLEE: The controlling order here is 3 the discharge order. And the reason why is because 4 bankruptcy is a continuum of events all leading to the 5 discharge. The discharge is the goal. That's what the 6 debtor wants. But only Congress can tell a debtor what 7 he gets to discharge. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what does the notice 9 of -- the time for a notice of appeal run from? 10 MS. WANSLEE: Pardon me? 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What does the time for the 12 notice of appeal run from -- the discharge order? 13 MS. WANSLEE: Well, for the plan itself, 14 from the plan entry. Now, once again, we never got a 15 copy of the plan entry. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now -- now, just in the -17 in the general run of the bankruptcy, how do you calculate 18 when you have to file your appeal -- from the time of 19 the discharge order? 20 MS. WANSLEE: Well, if we were going to 21 appeal from -- from the plan, it would be the plan or -22 but there's no reason to appeal from the plan, because 23 once again, 1328 excepts our debt specifically from 24 discharge through the plan. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
