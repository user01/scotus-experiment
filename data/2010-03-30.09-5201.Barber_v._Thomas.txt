1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:02 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in case 09-5201, Barber v. Thomas, the 5 Warden. 6 Mr. Sady. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. SADY 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. SADY: Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may 10 it please the Court: 11 The phrase "term of imprisonment" appears 12 three times in the first sentence of the Federal good 13 time statute. The first two times the parties are in 14 agreement. "Term of imprisonment" means "sentence 15 imposed." The third use, which sets the rate for good 16 time credit, also means the "sentence imposed" when it's 17 used in the phrase "up to 54 days of good time credit 18 towards the service of the sentence." 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't always mean 20 that. I think you say somewhere in your brief that it 21 always means that. It surely does not always mean that. 22 Because in -- what is it, 3624 -- wait a minute, now. 23 3624(d) says that, "Upon the release of a prisoner on 24 the expiration of his term of imprisonment, the Bureau 25 of Prisons shall give him clothes, money and
3 Alderson Reporting Company

1 transportation." 2 Now there the expiration of his term of 3 imprisonment does not mean the -- the assigned term of 4 imprisonment. It means the assigned term of 5 imprisonment less all the good time credits he has had. 6 MR. SADY: Exactly. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless you think they are 8 supposed to give him his clothes, you know, several 9 months after he leaves. 10 MR. SADY: Your Honor, that is a perfect use 11 of "term of imprisonment" to mean actual time and any 12 good time credits earned. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 14 MR. SADY: And it uses the term "release." 15 "Release" is defined in 3624(a), which says that you are 16 released when you have your actual time served and any 17 good time. 18 The flaw in the Bureau of Prisons system is 19 that they do not give credit towards the term of 20 imprisonment as this statute in 3624(b) dictates. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not addressing that. 22 All I'm -- look, it -- the text says "upon the release 23 of a prisoner on the expiration of his term of 24 imprisonment." My only point is that that -- you have 25 to acknowledge that that is a use of the phrase "term of
4 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 imprisonment" that does not mean the sentence he was 2 given, but rather means the sentence that he served. 3 MR. SADY: I respectfully disagree because 4 it expires. A term of imprisonment, a ten-year 5 sentence, expires. When you have 311 days 10 times, 6 that means it has expired, because you also are giving 7 those 54 days of good time credits 10 times. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: But why isn't the term of 10 imprisonment most reasonably understood to mean the term 11 that is imposed viewed at the time when it is imposed? 12 So that if someone is sentenced to a term of 360 days, 5 13 years, and begins serving his sentence on January 1st, 14 year 1 of the term imposed ends on December 31st of that 15 year; year 2 of the term imposed begins on January 1st 16 of the following year, and so forth. 17 MR. SADY: Justice Alito, that would be the 18 end of the time served for 1 year, but for the term of 19 imprisonment, because if we assume at the end of the 20 365 days that person has earned maximum good time 21 credit - 22 JUSTICE ALITO: Right. 23 MR. SADY: That he should receive credit 24 towards the service of the sentence. That means on the 25 365th day he should move back on the calendar a
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 adjustment for good time and a reset for the next year. 2 That way, if you have a ten-year sentence, you have ten 3 opportunities to - 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, hang on. I understand 5 what you are arguing, but I don't understand why the 6 term of imprisonment changes. We look at the -- we look 7 at the term of the imprisonment on the day when it is 8 imposed and the day when the defendant begins serving 9 the sentence, and you can say: Year one ends at the end 10 of 2010; year two ends at the end of 2011. 11 Why do you think that the term -- the phrase 12 "term of imprisonment" has to change as -- the 13 understanding of the "term of imprisonment" has to 14 change as the prisoner progresses in serving the 15 sentence? I totally fail to understand that. 16 MR. SADY: It doesn't change. It's still - 17 the two components of a term of imprisonment are actual 18 time and good time credits. So the way we are 19 presenting it is the first year of the term of 20 imprisonment is the 311 days of actual service and the 21 54 days - 22 JUSTICE ALITO: But you don't know whether 23 that -- you don't know whether that prisoner is going to 24 be eligible for the 54 days until the 365 days are over. 25 MR. SADY: That's fine. We -- if the Bureau
6 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of Prisons determines that the person should receive up 2 to 54 days at day 365, then they receive credit towards 3 the service of their sentence. That means moving it 4 back 54 days because they didn't have to serve those 5 days. And then you reset - 6 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm not sure where you 7 get that -- I'm not sure where you get that out of the 8 statute. But I still don't think you have answered my 9 question. I don't want to belabor it too much. 10 On the day when the prisoner in my 11 hypothetical begins serving his sentence, if you said, 12 When will your first year of imprisonment -- first year 13 of your term of imprisonment end? You would say 14 December 31st, 2010. When will the second year of the 15 term of imprisonment end? December 31st, 2011. That's 16 what you would have to say at that point, because you 17 don't know whether the prisoner will earn any good time 18 credits. So why do you think that the meaning of the 19 year of the term of imprisonment changes as the sentence 20 goes on? 21 MR. SADY: I do -- do not think it changes. 22 I think that it is adjusted for good time, which is 23 exactly what Congress intended. They said that every 24 day, you get credit beyond time served. They use the 25 phrase "beyond time served" for credit towards the

1 service - 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm -- perhaps 3 I can, if you will permit me, rephrase Justice Alito's 4 question in sort of the more simplistic way I looked at 5 it. 6 Why is it that we have to do the calculation 7 that you're talking about, which is start at 311 days 8 and take back days, which makes no sense to me, or their 9 very complicated ten-page number? 10 Why can't they just take 54 days at the end 11 of every year that there is actual service, and that the 12 time served, plus whatever number of days have been 13 earned, you subtract it from the term of imprisonment? 14 So if he was imprisoned for 10 years, he got 540 days 15 for whatever it is. At the end of the 9th year, he made 16 up whatever -- you added up 9 times 54, and you took it 17 away from 10. He serves 9 and that. That would make 18 sense of "beyond the time served" language that's in 19 this provision. 20 MR. SADY: Justice Sotomayor, we are not 21 asking -- 311 doesn't have to be the magic day of when 22 they determine whether they should receive it. We are 23 saying, go ahead, assume exactly what they are doing 24 now. Go up to 365 days. 25 But they do make a determination. At that
8 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 point of making the determination, that's when they go 2 back to 54 days and have to reset. That way on a 3 10-year sentence you have 10 blocks that Congress 4 intended to give prisoners to be able to earn 54 days in 5 each of those blocks. 6 Now, the way that we were hearing it posited 7 from Justice Alito, if we have the 54 days on top of 8 time served without any adjustment, then we end up with 9 a 419-year first day -- first year, and you can only fit 10 8 opportunities to earn the 54 days. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: No, not at all. No. At the 12 end of -- at the end of 2010, in my hypothetical, you 13 would take the 54 days off the end, just as Justice 14 Sotomayor suggested. 15 MR. SADY: And the - 16 JUSTICE ALITO: And -- but it doesn't mean 17 that the service doesn't -- your -- your argument is 18 predicated on the idea that service of year two begins 19 on the 311th day. 20 MR. SADY: If there is an adjustment for 21 good time, because "term of imprisonment" is a term of 22 art that doesn't mean time served only. It can mean - 23 JUSTICE ALITO: But I don't understand that. 24 I will not belabor it. I don't understand why the 25 parties have spent so much time sparring over that
9 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 issue, which seems to me to be totally unnecessary and 2 irrelevant. 3 MR. SADY: Justice Alito, if I could refer 4 you to 3621(a), 3624(a), and 3624(b), each of those 5 refers -- when they are talking about a term of 6 imprisonment, each refers to it as "less good time." 7 And -- and unless you do that, the reason - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, do you do it if 9 you take (a), and (a) says: A prisoner shall be 10 released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the 11 expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment -- 10 12 years, we are assuming, an imprisonment -- less any time 13 credited towards the service of the prisoner's sentence, 14 as provided in subsection (b). 15 MR. SADY: Exactly. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So each year that he 17 served, you add up the number of days he has served, the 18 good time credit, and you subtract them from the 19 120 months that you have given him, and you figure out 20 when he's going to get out. You work backwards, not 21 forward, the way everyone seems to be doing. 22 MR. SADY: If you do that, you only end up 23 with eight opportunities to -- to have 54 days. That's 24 why it's the difference between -- I think anybody 25 reading -
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's the way the 2 language is written. So I mean you may want the greater 3 opportunity, but it says by its explicit phrase: Terms: 4 At the date of the prisoner's -- expiration of the 5 prisoner's term of imprisonment, take that day and 6 subtract from it time credited towards the service of 7 the prisoner's sentence. 8 MR. SADY: We are going to -- the rate 9 phrase is: Up to 54 days at the end of each year of the 10 term of imprisonment. 11 If there is a 10-year term of imprisonment, 12 that means there's 10 opportunities to earn 54 days. 13 The Bureau of Prisons' math ends up with 470 days, 14 70 days less. And the reason for that is that they do 15 not interpret "term of imprisonment" to encompass the 16 possibility of good time. 17 That is the only -- because you should have 18 10 blocks of 365 days. Each of those blocks, you may be 19 able to get 54 days. Then it's 311. But maybe you 20 didn't earn any time. Then it would be a 365-block. 21 But the -- actually, the very good idea that Congress 22 had was that you had an incentive at every stage of your 23 term of imprisonment for good behavior. 24 Even if you were misbehaving early in your 25 prison term, at the end you still have the opportunity
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to earn 54 days against that last 365 days. It counts 2 for every word in the statute. It gives every statute 3 meaning. And it doesn't put us in the position of 4 giving two -- two phrases the exact same meaning in the 5 same sentence. 6 This Court has never found that phrases - 7 two phrases, uses of "term of imprisonment" in the same 8 sentence, mean different things. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you do with - 10 if -- it's a very short sentence? A year and a day, in 11 your view, is a year and a day less 54. 12 MR. SADY: Yes. 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But 360 days, what do you 14 do with that? 15 MR. SADY: With 360 - 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. If -- suppose it's 17 for -- just -- the whole sentence is 360 days. 18 MR. SADY: If it says 366 days, so that the 19 year - 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, 360. In other words, 21 short of a year. 22 MR. SADY: Then it -- a 360-day sentence 23 would not be eligible, because we -- the parties are 24 agreed that "term of imprisonment" means a sentence of 25 more than a year. So it has to be more than 365 days.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the person that gets a 2 year and a day serves less than the person that gets 3 less than a year? 4 MR. SADY: That is correct. And district 5 courts frequently address that problem. When you have a 6 relatively short sentence, you say: Judge, could you 7 give us -- instead of an 11-month sentence, could you 8 give us a year and a day sentence, so that you could 9 earn the good time on that? 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you earn the good 11 time? I mean you only earn the good time if -- if you 12 are a good prisoner for a year. 13 MR. SADY: That gets us to the - 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you are going to let him 15 out 54 days before the year, even though he hasn't 16 earned the good time in the year? 17 MR. SADY: He has. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: What did he do? How has 19 he? 20 MR. SADY: He has because of the last 21 sentence in 3624(b) that says that for the last year or 22 portion of the year, that you go ahead and establish the 23 two-step process. First, you figure out the projected 24 release date, which is a release date with maximum good 25 time. Then you make the decision about whether the
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 prisoner should receive that within six weeks of that - 2 of that projected release date. 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but that still 4 couldn't give him the full 54 days, because there's only 5 42 days in six weeks. 6 MR. SADY: That's only a measure when you 7 make the determination. They -- they were recognizing 8 that for the last period of time, or for a year and a 9 day sentence, that you are not going to be able to do 10 the time all the time, but you will, so that's why there 11 is a special mechanism at the end. 12 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm saying the special 13 mechanism can't give the full 54 days. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. 15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because they don't make it 16 until 42 days before the end of the sentence. 17 MR. SADY: They make it until 311 days at 18 the end of the sentence, because what they do is they 19 make the -- they figure out what the maximum good time 20 would be, which would be 312 days on a 300 and -- on a 21 year and a day sentence, and they make that 22 determination earlier. 23 They say, okay, you have been good for that 24 period of time. We recognize that this is going to be a 25 problem, the same problem you would have on a sentence
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of 10 years and 6 months, where you have to prorate the 2 credit, 27 days instead of 54, half, and then figure out 3 the projected release date with 180 days, subtract the 4 27 days, and then make the determination sometime within 5 the 6 weeks up to that last point. 6 So that there is a mechanism for 7 understanding that it is -- that in the last year there 8 is going -- going to be an assumption that if you are 9 behaving all the way up to -- in the full sentence - 10 day 311, you should get the full 54 days. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sure there is 12 something wrong with this predicate to this question, 13 but the -- the statute allows the Bureau to make a 14 determination of good time credit within 15 days after 15 the end of each year of the sentence. 16 MR. SADY: Yes. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They cannot make 18 that determination within 15 days of the 311 days. And 19 so "each year of the sentence" must mean each -- the 20 full year, the 365 days. 21 MR. SADY: Our position is that the Bureau 22 of Prisons can make its determination as it pleases. 23 We -- we are asking the Court to do -- to construe a 24 statute, not write a policy statement. So we understand 25 that there are going to be some mechanics of it. But
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the mechanics in this work very easily with the 2 assurance that they are receiving good time credit 3 against the period of the sentence imposed by the judge. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You treat each year 5 of the sentence as the 311 days if there has been good 6 behavior, no? 7 MR. SADY: Not necessarily. We are -8 I'm -- if the Bureau of Prisons wants to make that 9 determination at day 365, that's fine, as long as they 10 adjust by doing exactly what the statute says: Credit 11 towards the service of the sentence, move it back 40 - 12 54 days, and then reset. If you do that, you have 10 13 blocks of 365 days. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why do you do have to 15 do that? I mean you read it. It so complicated. Just 16 reading this, I -- I think the language should say this: 17 10 years, he's got a 10-year sentence. At the end of 18 the first year you write the number 54 on a piece of 19 paper if he has done well. 20 Suppose he comes in on January 1, okay? So 21 January 2, after the first year, you write the word 22 50 -- the number 54. And you do that each year. And by 23 the time you get to the year 8, what you have done is 24 you have got 432 days. 25 So then you subtract the 430 days from 10
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 years, and what you get is you are 67 days short of 9 2 years. So now you look at the last sentence, and what 3 you do is you take 67 days, subtract that from 365, and 4 you've got 298, and you simply prorate for those 298. 5 And you subtract that, too, so he gets another 10 days 6 or so, or 15 days credit, and that's it. 7 And that's following the statute, it seems 8 to me, absolutely literally. And it also seems to me to 9 make sense, because you don't want to give him credit 10 for time he never serves. 11 MR. SADY: Justice Breyer, I think it 12 doesn't make sense, because what it does is it creates 13 an 87.2 minimum sentence that is served, and we note 14 that the sentencing table upon which every Federal 15 sentence is predicated is based on 85 percent. That 16 being - 17 JUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't what the - 18 if you want to know what the sentencing commission did, 19 I think the best evidence of that is you read the 20 introduction to the guidelines. And what the 21 introduction to the guidelines says is that, roughly 22 speaking, many of the sentences approximate the time 23 actually served before. 24 Now, what to me that suggests is that the 25 sentencing commission never considered this question.
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 And if there's something more specific than that, that 2 shows they did, I would like to know what it is, because 3 I don't trust memory. 4 MR. SADY: Your Honor, we are relying very 5 heavily on the supplemental report at -- at page 140 of 6 the joint appendix that says we -- we divide it by .85 7 in order to calibrate the sentencing table to include 8 good time. That means that every sentence has been 9 calibrated based on assuming 10 opportunities to earn 10 54 days, which - 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the government 12 contends it's none of the sentencing commission's 13 business. It's up to the Bureau of Prisons. Isn't that 14 the government's position? 15 MR. SADY: That is their position. And our 16 position is that it's -- administering the statute is 17 the Bureau of Prisons's business, but deciding what the 18 minimum sentence that can -- minimum time that can be 19 served to satisfy a term of imprisonment is a policy 20 decision, and that the policy is properly placed - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: But there is nothing in 22 there -- that's not a policy statement; that's not a 23 guideline. That's a staff conclusion. And the staff 24 conclusion, I think, is conflicting with what it says in 25 the -- in the introduction to the guidelines, which is
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that all of this was very approximate. I don't see 2 how -- how -- a court would be bound by that. 3 MR. SADY: I think that the court could be 4 advised by it in terms of knowing that we are looking at 5 a harsher sentence. Everybody is serving more time than 6 -- the sentence that the judge imposed was -- whether it 7 was advisory guidelines or mandatory guidelines, the 8 sentencing table provided the initial baseline. 9 And that initial baseline was boosted by 2.2 10 percent, which is not an insignificant amount, and there 11 is a very simple way for the court to construe the 12 statute consistently throughout to conform the two, so 13 that people are not serving 2.2 percent more time in 14 custody than the sentencing table that every judge uses 15 in imposing their sentence. 16 We are institutionalizing a harsher system 17 in a way that doesn't meet the statutory language, 18 because the statutory language says "term of 19 imprisonment." 20 And if it's term of imprisonment, 10 years 21 of a term of imprisonment, I think a reasonable plain 22 meaning is that you have 10 opportunities to earn 23 54 days. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Sady, you -- you said 25 something about 15 percent or 85 percent is a more
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 workable system than -- was it 12.9 percent? 2 Do we have any information on, (A), the 3 number of Federal prisoners who get good time and in 4 that universe, the ones who get good time, how many get 5 the full credit and how many get something less than the 6 full 54 days? 7 MR. SADY: Justice Ginsburg, there are 8 approximately 200,000 prisoners, and of those about 9 195,000 of them are eligible for good time credits. 10 My anecdotal experience is that most 11 prisoners get most of the -- the good time credits, so 12 it's not at all unusual for prisoners to achieve most of 13 that. There is some that have minor amounts, and there 14 is a relatively smaller number, at least in my 15 experience, who do not get a lot of it. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: Is this right? I'm -- I'm 17 sorry to ask you this question, but I get lost in the 18 math of this sometimes. 19 Do you remember my example I just gave, you 20 know, with the 9 years you go and put it on a piece of 21 paper? 22 MR. SADY: Yes, the 419 - 23 JUSTICE BREYER: I take it what you want is 24 you, in -- in essence, want him to get credit for 25 54 days for that tenth year?
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. SADY: Yes. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And the argument 3 against that, reading the language and so forth, is, 4 well, look this is an imaginary 10th year. He is not 5 actually in prison for 10 years. He is going to be 6 released sometime late in year 8. And so why should we 7 add 54 days? I mean maybe it would be a nice thing 8 because sentences are awfully long, but -- but why would 9 anybody want to add 54 days in respect to a year that's 10 never going to be served? 11 MR. SADY: Each year is served in the -- if 12 you take away the 54 days, if you credit it towards the 13 service of the sentence and do the adjustment and reset 14 that we are asking the Court to do so that you have 10 15 opportunities, then in the last year, you are -- when 16 you are in -- you go to the last sentence that 17 acknowledges that you are going to have to make some 18 arbitrary time that you are going to, say, okay, we are 19 going to decide that you have done well enough that you 20 are going to be able to get the full credit for the last 21 year. 22 But the flaw in the Bureau of Prisons is by 23 having the 54 days and actual time and that that's what 24 happens at the first year, that's a 419-day first year. 25 You can only squeeze 8 of those in. The prisoners look
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 at it and they see, plain statute, what was your term of 2 imprisonment, how many ends of each year of a term of 3 imprisonment should you have in a 10-year sentence. Ten 4 years. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the statute says that 6 it is -- the credit, it can be received, quote, at the 7 end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment 8 beginning at the end of the first year of the term. 9 MR. SADY: Yes. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, when does -- when is 11 that point, in your opinion? 12 MR. SADY: The Bureau of Prisons probably 13 has discretion in administering. I'm accepting as a 14 proposition on the day 365 they make that determination. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So the -- day 365 is 16 the end of the first year of -- of the term of 17 imprisonment? 18 MR. SADY: That's -- that's when they are 19 making the determination. If they make a determination 20 that he is -- should receive credit, then the end of the 21 first year becomes day 311, because he has received - 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And then what do - 23 MR. SADY: -- 311. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: The statute says that 25 they -- that the prisoner may receive credit at the end
22 Alderson Reporting Company

1 of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment 2 beginning at the end of the first year of the term. 3 MR. SADY: No. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: And what I'm asking is, when 5 is the end of the first year of the term within the 6 meaning of that language? 7 MR. SADY: The meaning of that language is 8 day 3 - 9 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it day 3 - 10 MR. SADY: Excuse me. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it day 365, or is it day 12 311? 13 MR. SADY: It depends. And the reason it 14 depends is because the language of the statute says 15 "credit toward the service of prisoner's sentence beyond 16 time served," so if you do it beyond time served and you 17 give him credit towards that sentence -- the Bureau of 18 Prisons is making a determination. Once we -- they make 19 their determination, and we respect that determination, 20 we then have to go -- from the 365th day, back, because 21 for 54 of those days he doesn't have to be there. He 22 has earned that time and you can - 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the next year - 24 MR. SADY: -- adjust and reset at the next 25 365.

SADY: Yes, that is -- that is certainly 7 one way of mechanically doing it so that you have 10 8 blocks of 365 days each as a term of imprisonment. 9 Because term of - 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you -- and you think 11 that their system is easier? 12 MR. SADY: Yes. 13 (Laughter.) 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That their system is - 15 MR. SADY: No, absolutely not. Their - 16 their system makes -- nobody can understand the math. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Another way to think, and I 18 think probably you'll -- if you look through the records 19 of the commission, they even thought about this problem, 20 and the -- the -- you will see a lot of talks given by 21 various people who were there, which say that for this 22 reason you are bringing up, that it might have been 23 thought there was no credit for the first year. 24 In other words, you don't cut the sentence 25 in the first year. You don't begin cut until the second

1 year has been served, so he has to serve 365 days. Now 2 when you point that out, that is not the Bureau of 3 Prisons's interpretation, that's nobody's 4 interpretation. They're all going to let him out if 5 it's a year and a day. They are going to let him out 6 several weeks before the end of the first year, aren't 7 they? 8 MR. SADY: Yes. There was a technical 9 amendment. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Everybody's going to do 11 that. Oh -- there was a technical amendment. 12 MR. SADY: To address that first year, to 13 make sure that they did that. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what happened. In 15 other words, the statute made before - 16 MR. SADY: Exactly. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, I better get that - 18 MR. SADY: -- when it was at 36 days. And 19 it's interesting, so page 56 of the -- of the Senate 20 report on this, they used the term "adjust for good 21 time." Now that -- then it was 36 days. But Congress 22 was using exact same thought as the language here that 23 says that the time is -- that you give credit towards 24 the service of a sentence. 25 And with the Court's permission I will

1 reserve the remaining time. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 3 Mr. Wall. 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL 5 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 6 MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 7 please the Court: 8 Justice Breyer, I think you stole my 9 thunder. I wanted to explain how the bureau does it, 10 and you laid it out exactly right. If you have -- and I 11 think just looking at the language of the statute, it 12 tracks perfectly. If you have a prisoner serving a 13 10-year sentence and he comes in on January 1st, the end 14 of his first year of imprisonment is December 31st, and 15 on that date he gets 54 days taken off the back end of 16 the sentence. That cycle repeats itself for the next 8 17 years. And - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: But the trouble with that, 19 and I'm glad to know about that technical amendment, 20 because then - 21 MR. WALL: Right. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: -- we never considered it 23 when I was on the -- nobody thought about it at that 24 time because the language was different. 25 But now that you had have got this language
26 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 now, it's hard to reconcile with that first year. He is 2 sentenced for a year and a day, you see. So literally, 3 it says calculated on January 2 of the next year. But 4 he's already been in for longer than he should be by 5 that point. So you really have to calculate it before 6 the year ends; you have to calculate it at least by 7 October. 8 And -- and -- and once you start calculating 9 it before, the statute literally says, we are into a 10 more complicated thing than I thought. 11 MR. WALL: Well, and that's why they have 12 the sentence at the end, as you pointed out about the 13 proration. So when the -- when the statute says, what 14 it says -- starts by saying is, if you are serving a 15 sentence of longer than a year you are eligible for good 16 time credit. So you are earning credit as you go 17 through that first year. 18 Congress knew then if you had have a year 19 and a day sentence, you wouldn't be actually serving a 20 full year because of the credits bringing you below the 21 year mark. So what it does in the last sentence, it 22 says if you are in your last year and that's a partial 23 year, we prorate. So on your 319th day you have earned 24 47 days of good time credit. Those combined equal a 25 sentence of a year and a day, and you are out after your
27 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 319th day. On the hypothetical - 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is a premise flaw 3 there. And that premise flaw is that you have told us 4 that you don't earn the credit until the end of the 5 year. 6 MR. WALL: Well - 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your answer about 8 this probation is not an answer, because it's -- your 9 premise is not the same. 10 MR. WALL: That's why for each full year 11 served, so for a 10-year sentence, you are right that 12 you are making a determination at the end of the year 13 for the first 8 years, but when you get to that ninth 14 year, as Justice Breyer pointed out - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not worried about 16 sentences that are more than 2 years. I'm worried about 17 the prisoner who is sentenced to a year and a day. How 18 does that proration help that individual, since they are 19 not going to get the good time credit until they've 20 served a year? 21 MR. WALL: So, the way this works is that 22 for the prisoner sentenced to a year and a day or 23 13 months or 14 months, because they are receiving 24 credit through that first year, their good time credit 25 brings them below a year. They'll never serve a full

1 year. 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I - 3 MR. WALL: And what the law - 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I'm saying 5 to you. The whole brief says to us, they measure the 6 entitlement to good time credit at the end of the first 7 year. 8 MR. WALL: Except for the last year or 9 partial year. And what the final sentence of B1 says 10 is, credit for the last year or portion of a year of the 11 term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited 12 within the last 6 weeks. So for the prisoner who has a 13 year and a day sentence, his sentence is literally all 14 proration. He is just serving a partial year. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He is not going to get 16 54 days? He's going to get - 17 MR. WALL: That's right. On the 319th day 18 he has come through about nine tenths of the year, he 19 has accrued 47 days. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I just want to make 21 absolutely sure because I hadn't done the math forward; 22 I did the math backwards. 23 MR. WALL: Right. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which was the one that 25 Justice Breyer and Justice Alito set forth -
29 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. WALL: Right. 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is 54 days are 3 earned back for each year, and you take it off the full 4 term of imprisonment. 5 The -- you are representing to me that the 6 math that is in your program statement is accomplishing 7 that result? 8 MR. WALL: Absolutely. Which is to say when 9 the prisoner gets to his last year, if that's a partial 10 year, he is not going to get the 54 days, he's going to 11 get some portion of the 54 days, based on what part of a 12 year he served. And that is prorated and credited 13 within the last 6 weeks. Now, it's normally done on the 14 release date. So in that 9th year for the 10-year 15 prisoner - 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just interrupt with 17 one question? If he got a total of 540 or whatever it 18 is, he should never enter the 9th year because he would 19 finish the 10-year sentence in less than 8 years. 20 MR. WALL: Well - 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Or less than 9 years, 22 rather. 23 MR. WALL: That's -- that's right. 540 24 wouldn't be quite 2 years, but setting that to the 25 side -

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: So how does he -- how does 2 he get his 10th block of good time? How does he ever 3 get it under your - 4 MR. WALL: Well, under the government's view 5 he can only earn good time credit when he is actually 6 incarcerated. And what Petitioners are coming in and 7 saying - 8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. I understand. But 9 explain to me how -- how he can get more than a year of 10 good time credit before the 10th year begins? 11 MR. WALL: Well, so, if you take a 10-year 12 prisoner -- a prisoner with a 10-year sentence, the way 13 it currently works, at the end of the 8th year he has 14 accrued 432 days of good time credit. 15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is more than a year. 16 MR. WALL: Right. So he knocked off his 17 full 10th year and he's knocked off a part of his 9th 18 year. Now we are at that final 9th year, which is a 19 prorated year. He has got 298 days left and by the 20 260th day he earned 38 days of credit. So he is 21 released after the 260th day of his 9th year. 22 And as Justice Breyer pointed out, that 23 precisely tracks the language of the statute. You do it 24 at the end of each full year until you get to the last 25 partial year, and then you prorate and you do it in the
31 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 last 6 weeks. 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And each of those 4 years 3 included 54 days of credit? 4 MR. WALL: That's right. So the -- the 5 Petitioners here, Petitioner Barber, for instance, has 6 been incarcerated for over 17 years. At the end of each 7 of his 17 years in prison, he has gotten 54 days of 8 credit. What Petitioner Barber is here saying is, I am 9 going to get 3 whole years knocked off the end of my 10 sentence; I want the 54 days for those years, too. 11 I want 54 days for every year of my sentence 12 as imposed by the court, not as served by me behind 13 bars, and that's what doesn't track the language of the 14 statute. Because the only way you can do that, as 15 Justice Alito pointed out, is to read "year" to mean 16 311 days, and it is no answer to say, as Petitioners do, 17 well, you can do the determination whenever. What they 18 are saying is at the end of a 311-day period, you should 19 determine whether the prisoner gets the credit. 20 But what the statute says is the 21 determination itself has to occur at the end of the 22 year. So you can't fold the 54 days into the year 23 because you haven't made the determination yet. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I didn't understand 25 them to be saying that. I understood them to be saying
32 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that the determination could be made at the end of 2 365 days, but if it's determined that the prisoner is 3 entitled to 54 days of credit, then year 1 should be 4 regarded as having begun on the 312th day, rather than 5 the 366th day. 6 MR. WALL: I think that's right, which first 7 it is inconsistent with the language of the statute, 8 which says at the end of each year, so that reads "year" 9 to be an 311-day cycle. But it also sets up a very odd 10 system. What happens if the prisoner misbehaves during 11 days 312 and day 365? 12 On Petitioner's approach, it seems to me, 13 the new year has started on day 312. Now, but take the 14 example, he says, well, you can do it on the 365th day. 15 Well, if the prisoner's misbehaved on day 340, is that 16 coming out of the first year or out of the second year. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think that they 18 would say you won't know when the second year has begun 19 until the full calendar year has been completed. 20 MR. WALL: And I guess the -- the difficulty 21 with that approach is that it seems to me that once the 22 311-day cycle is finished, you have to start a new 23 311-day cycle on day 312. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they are just not 25 vested until the year has -- the full year has passed.
33 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. WALL: Well, so vesting is a little bit 2 unique, Justice Kennedy, under the statute, because none 3 of the time vests under (b)(2) until they are actually 4 released. But - 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I use it just 6 in the calculating sense. 7 MR. WALL: I see -- I see what you're 8 saying. They could do the bookkeeping determination on 9 day 365. But I don't think that's what's important. 10 What is important is that on Petitioner's view, the 11 second year, for credit purposes, has to start on day 12 312. You have to have 10 blocks of 311 days and you 13 have to be measuring after every 311th day. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, you don't 15 measure -- I don't think that -- you -- you begin 16 measuring on 311, but you measure 365 days from -- from 17 311. And if he has behaved well during all -- all of 18 those 365 days, then you knock off another 51 days or 19 whatever it is. And you begin the third year from then, 20 but you give him another 365 days to determine whether 21 he has behaved well. 22 MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, if you are 23 measuring 365 days from day 311 - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 25 MR. WALL: -- then you should equally be
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 measuring 365 days from day 1. Which is to say, if 2 you're doing - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: He did. He did. You 4 didn't give him the credit until he served the whole 5 365 days. At that point, he gets the credit and you 6 count the second year as though it begins on day 311. 7 MR. WALL: Well, the -- I was half with you 8 there. 9 The bureau does do it by looking at what 10 they do during the full year, from January 1 to 11 December 31, and then it determines whether you get 12 54 days knocked off the end of your sentence. What 13 happens between day 311 and day 365 is not different 14 than what happens during the rest of the year. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. 16 MR. WALL: What the -- what the statute asks 17 the bureau to determine is, at the end of each year, 18 has, during that year, the prisoner demonstrated 19 exemplary compliance with institutional regulations? So 20 the prisoner has got to go a full year, a full 365 days, 21 and be well-behaved. Then he gets 54 days taken off the 22 back end of the sentence. And if that's the way that 23 you're saying it should work, that is precisely how the 24 bureau interprets the statute. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that they're not
35 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 taking it off from the back end. They are taking it off 2 from the next year. So that in the second year, if he 3 -- if he behaves well for 365 days from 311 -- okay? He 4 behaves well for the next 365 days. The next year will 5 begin at 622. 6 But then he has to serve another 365 days 7 before he gets good time credit. And then the next year 8 will begin three times 311: 933. And so forth. 9 MR. WALL: Justice Alito, I think that sets 10 up an odd system. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that right? See, he 12 agrees with me. 13 (Laughter.) 14 No, I'm not saying that's right. I'm saying 15 that that's -- that is what he is proposing. 16 MR. WALL: No, I -- I agree. That is the 17 difference. Petitioners think that you measure credit 18 over these 311-day cycles, and if you -- you know, you 19 get to the 311th day, you take the 54 days of credit, 20 and together, they equal a year of the sentence imposed. 21 But what the statute says is you make the 22 determination at the end of the year. And we don't read 23 "year" to be a 311-day period. We read it to be a 24 365-day period. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but as Justice Scalia
36 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 says, you know, you do make the determination on the 2 365th day, but what you determine is that the -- having 3 been a good prisoner, his first year expired 54 days 4 earlier, and then you start over. 5 MR. WALL: But what -- that's right. But 6 what the statute -- the statute doesn't just say, 7 Justice Stevens, you make the determination at the end 8 of the first year of the term. The determination is 9 that during that year, the prisoner has displayed 10 compliance. So he has got to display compliance through 11 day 1 through day 365. 12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me interrupt and get 13 one thing off my mind that I just -- supposing he 14 misbehaves in year 3. Does that just affect his good 15 time credits in year 3, or does it mean he is canceled 16 for years 1 and 2? 17 MR. WALL: No. He can lose credit that he 18 has accrued up to that point, but he can't lose credit 19 that he has -- that he is eligible for in future years. 20 So let's say that we are coming up on the end of the 3rd 21 year. He's earned his full 108 days for his first two 22 years, and he has earned some prorated portion. He can 23 lose any of that, but he is still eligible going forward 24 to keep getting 54 days at the end of each year. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: But he can lose his
37 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 108 days? 2 MR. WALL: Yes. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can he do that? 4 I'm looking at page 14A of your appendix. It says: 5 Such credit toward service of sentence vests at the time 6 that it is received. Credit that is vested may not 7 later be withdrawn. 8 MR. WALL: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. I 9 should have been more clear. 10 For prisoners sentenced subject to the SRA, 11 which was in effect from 1987 to 1994, you are right. 12 And that is the SRA according to your brief. 13 Their credit vests. That vesting 14 requirement was eliminated in the PLRA, which governs 15 prisoner's sentences since 1986. So for the vast bulk 16 of prisoners in the Federal system who are subject to 17 the PLRA, their credit does not vest until they are 18 released. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wall, the -- if we 20 consider both methods plausible, the number comes out at 21 15 percent -- 85 percent, 15 percent. It's a more 22 workable number, and there are some hints in the 23 legislative history that Congress thought 85 percent, 24 not 87.2 or whatever it is. 25 So in choosing between those two methods,
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 why not take the easier number to work with? 2 MR. WALL: Well, two reasons. I think to 3 the extent that you are suggesting the statute is 4 ambiguous, the Bureau of Prisons is charged by Congress 5 with administering the statute in both Reno v. Koray and 6 Lopez v. Davis. This Court deferred to the bureau's 7 interpretation of other prisoner credit statutes. We 8 think the bureau is equally entitled to the same 9 discretion here to interpret this statute. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We -- if we disagree with 11 that, if we disagree that the BOP has authority in this 12 area, then -- as Justice Ginsburg's question, I think, 13 suggests -- does not the Rule of Lenity apply? 14 MR. WALL: Well, this Court's been clear - 15 and I -- I can't put it any better than Justice 16 Sotomayor did in her first opinion in Sash -- that this 17 is not a criminal statute. It neither imposes a 18 criminal prohibition on conduct nor - 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how do you explain 20 the Granderson case? 21 MR. WALL: I'm sorry? 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Granderson case. 23 MR. WALL: I'm not familiar with that case, 24 Justice Kennedy. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought that in that
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 case, Justice Ginsburg, for this Court, established the 2 proposition that the Rule of Lenity is applicable. I 3 know it wasn't cited in the Petitioner's brief, either. 4 That was a parole revocation case. 5 But in -- in any event, the -- shouldn't the 6 Rule of Lenity apply? If the Rule of Lenity is thought 7 of as a notice requirement insofar as giving you warning 8 to what conduct is punishable, that's one thing, but 9 doesn't the Rule of Lenity mean more than that? It's a 10 check against the power of the State, so that you simply 11 mitigate the -- the power of the State in favor of the 12 individual. In a case like this, apply the Rule of 13 Lenity. 14 MR. WALL: I think it's a check against the 15 power of the State when it's penalizing conduct or when 16 it's putting forth a penalty for a criminal prohibition. 17 But in both Koray and Lopez, this Court was considering 18 what prisoner credit statutes meant, other prisoner 19 credit statutes. 18 U.S.C. 3585 and 3621. And in both 20 of those, it deferred to the bureau's interpretation. 21 And in both, it specifically rejected application of the 22 Rule of Lenity. 23 And I think the notion there is that this 24 statute is not a criminal statute. It's about an 25 administrative reward for compliance with institutional
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 regulations. And that's different from setting forth a 2 prohibition on conduct where the penalty that someone is 3 sentenced to by a court once they have been convicted of 4 a criminal offense - 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the Granderson case 6 is cited in the brief for the National Association Of 7 Criminal Defense Lawyers, and as I read it, it applies 8 to this area and it seems to me that it ought to. 9 I mean, you tell us this is not a criminal 10 statute. I -- I certainly think it has -- it has all 11 the impact and force of the State detaining a person for 12 a criminal act. 13 MR. WALL: Well, it is a statute that 14 determines in some sense how long you will be in prison, 15 so I take your point. But it does so not by extending 16 the penalty applicable to the conduct, but by offering 17 an administrative reward; sort of relieving you of part 18 of the burden of that -- that penalty. 19 And I am not aware of any case -- and I am 20 obviously not familiar with Granderson, but I am not 21 aware of any case from this Court, or indeed any lower 22 court, finding that section 3624 is a criminal statute, 23 as this Court's cases uses the term. 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but isn't there 25 another consideration? It's not the Rule of Lenity, but
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it's something else we should take into account. 2 In the -- in their reply brief, they say it 3 costs about 25 or $26,000 to house a particular 4 prisoner, and the number of prisoners involved is - 5 something like $100 million in taxpayers' money is at 6 issue in this case. It -- is -- you don't disagree with 7 that general figure, do you? 8 MR. WALL: I'm -- I think the basis for that 9 is just math that the Petitioners have done. I don't 10 have any independent basis for confirming or denying it. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in any event, it's 12 clear it's a lot of money. And -- and is that not a 13 factor that we should be aware of in this case, because, 14 all other things being equal -- assume the statute is 15 totally ambiguous, and if you -- if one -- one -- one 16 version will save the -- the government $100 million a 17 year and the other version will cost it, is that - 18 isn't that a factor we -- we should take into 19 consideration? 20 MR. WALL: I think it's a factor that the 21 bureau could, should and has taken into consideration in 22 the developing its interpretation as the agency in 23 charge of administering the statute. But what the 24 bureau has found is that it's method allows you to earn 25 good time for all the time you are incarcerated, so you
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 always have incentive to follow prison regulations. 2 And what Petitioners haven't responded to 3 and the government's point in our brief that if you 4 start measuring by 311-day cycles, you are assuming that 5 they getting the full 54 days of credit. And to the 6 extent that they don't, no matter how they calculate it, 7 Justice Scalia, no matter what their matter of 8 bookkeeping is, if they don't get the 54 days of credit 9 for each cycle, there will be some corresponding period 10 at the end of the sentence when they are serving time 11 and they have already had their ten -- you know, their 12 reviews and they are no longer eligible for the - 13 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true. But the 14 strongest argument -- I -- I don't want to put words in 15 his mouth because this is complicated. But I see it as 16 this. Let's call that time you are talking about, that 17 tenth year, phantom time. 18 MR. WALL: Okay. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you are saying don't 20 put in any phantom time. And he's saying let's put some 21 in. 22 Now, the strong -- a strong argument, I 23 think, for his is the following -- think about that 24 first year. That first year we are going to calculate 25 54 days, subtract it, everybody seems to agree we get to
43 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the number 311, right? 2 But if you were to apply the last sentence 3 to that first year, the prorating sentence, you wouldn't 4 get 54. You would get like 45 days, or 47 or something 5 like that. But everybody agrees under the Bureau of 6 Prisons system that it is 54. And, therefore, in 7 respect to the first year, they are calculating phantom 8 time, i.e., not the first year, but a person who had a 9 sentence to a year and a day. If you had a sentence to 10 a year and a day, you agree it's 54 days, and everybody 11 agrees with that, and that includes phantom time. 12 So he said, well, if you include it for the 13 first year, since the statute says nothing about the 14 first year, why not include it for the other years, too? 15 How can you possibly justify phantom time being included 16 in the first year but not in the other years? 17 MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I disagree with 18 your premise. Someone sentenced to a year and a day is 19 eligible for credit, but because that person is accruing 20 credit as he serves, he will never actually get 54 days. 21 By the time he gets to the 319th day, he has accrued 22 47 days of credit, those combine to equal his 366-day 23 sentence. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, they 25 don't let him out under 311?

1 MR. WALL: That's -- that's exactly - 2 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, the Bureau 3 of Prisons for a person whose has a sentence of a year 4 and a day does not let him out 54 days short, rather 5 they let him out 47 days short, because they apply the 6 last sentence in the prorating of that sentence? 7 MR. WALL: And that's exactly our difference 8 with Petitioner's view. Exactly. What Petitioner - 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- is that what 10 happens? 11 MR. WALL: Yes. Yes. He is released after 12 the 319th day. 13 And I think what Petitioners actually want 14 is phantom time even in the first year. What they are 15 saying is fine, he may only serve 311 days, 312 days, 16 319 days, we want the full 54. So, instead of letting 17 him out at 319, back him up to 312, we want the phantom 18 week in the first year. 19 And, so, I think the way the bureau 20 interprets it, there is no phantom time in any year. 21 The way the Petitioners interpret it, there is phantom 22 time in every year, no matter the length of the 23 sentence. As I said I think it creates a gap in 24 coverage. It rests on this assumption that prisoners 25 are always getting 54 days. That is just not the case.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you disagree with your 2 colleague that that is the case most of the time, that 3 most Federal prisoners get good time credit, and of the 4 ones who get credit, most of them get the full 54 days? 5 MR. WALL: There are no statistics on this, 6 but, yes, Justice Ginsburg, I think the majority of 7 prisoners do earn the full credit, certainly these 8 Petitioners have. But I would say that there are, say, 9 15 to 20 percent Federal prisoner who tend to be repeat 10 offenders, and they are often being docked to good time 11 credit. 12 So, I think what you will see is that the 13 ones getting 54 days do it consistently, and the ones 14 not getting 54 days, often do that pretty consistently. 15 And, you know, the difficulty on Petitioner's method is 16 that no matter when you want to do that calculation, 17 Petitioners at bottom are saying what you should be 18 looking at is a 311-day period, and you take the 19 311 days served, you take the 54 days of credit, and 20 together they give you a year of the sentence imposed. 21 And not only does that not serve penological 22 interest, as the bureau has found, but it just doesn't 23 track the language of the statute, which says during 24 each year you have got to comply with the regulations. 25 The statute cares not just about your conduct from days

1 1 to 311, but your conduct from day 312 to 365. All of 2 those days are equal in the statute's eyes. If you want 3 54 days of credit knocked off the back end of your 4 sentence, you have got to behave and comply with the 5 rules for a full year each time you want the credit. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this 7 explanation that has been given in your brief and the 8 one you are giving to us now as to why BOP chose what it 9 did, is there any statement outside of the penned 10 affidavit that explains why this choice was made? 11 MR. WALL: Other than the positions - 12 positions that the bureau has taken before the 11 courts 13 of appeals in which it has prevails, no, the - 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But in each one of them 15 they have taken the position that the statute was 16 unambiguous. Assuming that that is not accepted by us, 17 that it's ambiguous, what and where are we giving 18 Chevron or Skidmore deference to what set of facts or to 19 what - 20 MR. WALL: Two points, Justice Sotomayor. I 21 don't think the bureau has always taken the position 22 that the statute is unambiguous. It has taken the 23 fallback position, and it has prevailed on this position 24 in a number of courts of appeals. And it is worth 25 pointing out the bureau has prevailed in the First
47 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 through the Eleventh Circuits. It has won in 11 court 2 of appeals. And it has often prevailed on the ground 3 that it had discretion to interpret the statute to the 4 extended it was ambiguous. 5 Your second point, what would you defer 6 to - 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, did they exercise 8 discretion when they took the position that it was 9 unambiguous? 10 MR. WALL: As the pen declaration makes 11 clear, and this is at page 154 of the Joint Appendix, 12 when the bureau promulgated its rule in 1997, it did 13 that based on the statutory language and on making a 14 policy choice to accommodate penological interest, 15 ensuring that credit would always be an incentive to 16 good behavior and providing clear notice to inmates of 17 their projected release dates. So, I think -- you know, 18 the government has - 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have never given 20 deference, have we, to an affidavit submitted in 21 litigation to explain something that on its face is not 22 explained either in an agency's regulation or in its 23 policy statement that -- that -- this is giving 24 deference to an affidavit. 25 MR. WALL: Well, it's giving deference to
48 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the rule, because the affidavit informs the court that 2 the rule is an exercise of the bureau's discretion. So 3 far as I know, the court has never faced that question 4 but the lower courts have. And a number of courts of 5 appeals faced with rulemaking and informal adjudication 6 have accepted supplementation of the record with 7 affidavits and declarations very much like this one. 8 Because what we are talking about here is an affidavit 9 from one of the agency's original decisionmakers. 10 If this was just a post hyperactualization, 11 I grant you it might not be enough. But this is one of 12 the bureau's lawyers involved in the decisionmaking in 13 the mid-1980's coming in and saying, here is why we 14 adopted the interpretation - 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Subsequent legislative 16 history, so to speak, right? 17 (Laughter.) 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we wouldn't 19 allow that -- those of us who use legislative history 20 don't allow a congressman to come in several years after 21 the bill has passed and say, oh, by the way, the reason 22 we voted for that is thus and such. We would kick that 23 out. 24 Why is it any different for an agency's 25 subsequent statement?

1 MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I think it is 2 different because that would be broadside in Overton 3 Park. And what this Court said is if there is not 4 enough in the agency action itself to enable judicial 5 review, the right answer is not to set it aside, the 6 right answer is to send it back to the agency to let the 7 agency decision makers explain why they did what they 8 did. 9 And while that might normally be the right 10 course here, the agency has already done that. It has 11 put forward its explanation, so I think this is one of 12 the rare circumstances where we don't need to remand on 13 Overton Park. We know why the agency adopted the rule, 14 and it did it both because of the statutory language and 15 because they thought it was the most sensible policy 16 choice. 17 And I guess I would turn it around a little 18 bit and say you have a rule promulgated by the agency 19 charged with administering the statute, an agency to 20 which this Court has twice deferred in the 21 interpretation of similar statutes. That rule has been 22 upheld as a substantive matter now in 11 courts of 23 appeals. 24 The Ninth Circuit set the rule aside on a 25 procedural basis, which has now been corrected by the
50 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 agency. It's a republished rule which corrects the 2 infirmities that the court of appeals identified. 3 And, so, the question is, faced with those 4 facts, what would be the point of asking the government 5 to recalculate 195,000 Federal sentences? 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think we sent cases 7 back under Overton Park for an agency's description of 8 history. I think we sent it back for the agency to give 9 a reason for its rule, whether that's its current reason 10 or its past reason. It -- it's the current reason that 11 counts. 12 MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, even -- even if 13 you thought as the court of appeals did that the rule 14 was procedurally invalid, you would still, as the court 15 of appeals did, defer to the program statement under 16 some level of deference, at least Skidmore. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to worry 18 about me. 19 (Laughter.) 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm willing to 21 accept the -- the government's assertion here that 22 that's the government's position. 23 MR. WALL: And I - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you are 25 lying.

1 MR. WALL: I -- I - 2 (Laughter.) 3 MR. WALL: My only point, Justice Scalia, 4 was that whether you get there by deferring to the rule 5 or by deferring to the program statement, as the court 6 of appeals did, every court of appeals to consider it 7 has come out in the same place, which is that by hook or 8 by crook, the bureau has exercised its discretion to 9 answer this question. And I - 10 JUSTICE STEVENS: You say there are 195,000 11 sentences affected by this rule. I don't know which way 12 that cuts. If there are 195,000 people spending more 13 time in -- you know, significantly more time in jail 14 than they should, that's kind of troublesome. 15 MR. WALL: Justice Stevens, I think what I 16 would say is the bureau has been doing it the same way 17 since 1987. Congress has amended this statute five 18 times in the last 20 years. It has never moved to alter 19 the bureau's methods. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the cumulated - 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Probably they didn't 22 understand it because it's an awfully hard statute to 23 understand. 24 MR. WALL: Justice Stevens, with all 25 respect, Justice Breyer got it in the first 5 minutes.
52 Alderson Reporting Company

1 So I think the - 2 (Laughter.) 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he's a lot smarter 4 than I am. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even Justice Breyer has got 6 it! Whoa! 7 (Laughter.) 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what -- what we 9 were -- what we were saying, is this is 36,000 years of 10 prisoner time, I mean -- 36,000, that is older than 11 Marbury versus Madison. 12 MR. WALL: Justice Kennedy, that's true. I 13 think the point is that the language of the statute has 14 remained unchanged, and for the last 20 years the bureau 15 has interpreted that in a reasonable way. The language 16 is unambiguous, but even if it weren't, at least the 17 bureau's interpretation is reasonable, which is why 11 18 courts of appeals have deferred to it. 19 And so I take your point that they are 20 serving more time than under Petitioner's 21 interpretation, but I don't think that that policy 22 rationale is properly before this Court. It is properly 23 before the bureau, which has found that policy 24 consideration outweighed by other penological interests, 25 and I think that's the judgment to which this Court
53 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 should defer, not its own judgment about how much time 2 these prisoners should -- should be serving. 3 And I do think it's important in that regard 4 that Congress has returned the statute several times. 5 And I take your point that it is complicated, Justice 6 Stevens, but - 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish 8 the - 9 MR. WALL: -- but Congress has made a number 10 of technical amendments and I don't think there is any 11 evidence it did not understand of how this longstanding 12 system works. 13 Thank you. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Wall. 15 Mr. Sady, you have 4 minutes remaining. 16 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. SADY 17 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 18 MR. SADY: Thank you. 19 The -- the idea that there could be time at 20 the end of the sentences is premised on "term of 21 imprisonment" mean "time served," which it cannot mean 22 in the same sentence where it says "beyond time served." 23 If you make the adjustment for good time 24 credit that is earned at the end of the year, it is 25 credit towards the service of the sentence; that means
54 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that it's blocks of 365 days, that at the last day of 2 Mr. Barber's sentence if it's properly computed, he 3 would be looking at 365 days. If he behaved well until 4 close to the end, if we go to the last statute that says 5 prorate the remaining period of time, the 30 - 6 remaining 36 days he could earn, and credit it in the 7 last 6 weeks, because they are doing that simply as an 8 administrative technique. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so -- in your 10 system they do the measurement at the end of the 11 365 days. He misbehaves on the 340th day. And they say 12 for that reason, I'm only going to give you 10 days of 13 full time -- of good time credit. 14 MR. SADY: Yes. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now your year starts 16 at 350? 17 MR. SADY: 355. Yes. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, they said they are 19 only giving you 10 days of good time credit. Because at 20 the end of -- 355. 21 MR. SADY: Right. And so the 355 - 22 (Laughter.) 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That was pretty bad. 24 (Laughter.) 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 355. Now, your year
55 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 starts again on 355 days - 2 MR. SADY: 365, and if he behaves very badly 3 he has to go all the way to the end of that 365 and 4 doesn't get any adjustment, but if he -- next year he 5 starts all over again for 365 days, and if he is very 6 good he gets the 54 days. 7 If I could address the question that was 8 raised by Justice Ginsburg on the Rule of Lenity. I 9 would like to point out that in the -- we have relied on 10 both R.L.C. and in -- on Granderson for your 11 articulation of the Rule of Lenity as it would apply in 12 this case. Which, if after we're looking at all the 13 other -- the statute, the history, the context, and if 14 we cannot -- if we apply the Rule of Lenity, if the 15 government's position cannot be shown to be 16 unambiguously correct, we have at least ambiguity here, 17 and then we go to Chief Justice Marshall's seminal 18 discussion of lenity. 19 And what he said was that we look at lenity 20 for the proposition -- to back the principle that the 21 power of punishment belongs to the legislative 22 department; and the tenderness of the law for the rights 23 of individuals, both of - 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the argument -- one 25 of the arguments is it is not punishment at all. This
56 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is a reward; this is a reward for good behavior. 2 MR. SADY: The Court in -- in Lynce and in 3 Weaver used the term "increase in punishment" when there 4 was no longer available good time credit. For -- to say 5 that somebody has to serve 87.2 percent of the term of 6 imprisonment imposed by the judge instead of 85 percent, 7 that is imprisonment. 8 For Mr. Barber that's over 6 months' 9 additional time behind bars in a prison. That's - 10 that's penal; that is affecting individual liberty, it's 11 the type of liberty that was intended to be covered by 12 the Rule of Lenity; and especially in the situation 13 where the initial sentence was imposed based on a grid 14 that was calibrated assuming 85 percent, he's ending up 15 serving 2.2 percent more time than the sentencing judge, 16 in imposing the sentence. So that aspect of punishment. 17 And in actual raw time behind bars in a prison. 18 Unless there are further questions, I would 19 reserve my - 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Sady. 21 MR. SADY: Thank you. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 The case is submitted. 24 (Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the 25 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
