1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:05 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first today in case 05-1508, Zuni Public School 5 District, et al. vs. Department of Education. 6 Mr. Van Amberg. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. VAN AMBERG 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. VAN AMBERG: Mr. Chief Justice and may 10 it please the Court: 11 In 1994, Congress enacted the equalization 12 formula under the Impact Aid Act. It did so clearly and 13 decisively, and described a methodology which was 14 unambiguous, was self contained, reflected a recognized 15 statistical standard, and assisted in actually 16 promulgating -- and -- the intent of the Impact Aid Act, 17 which is to benefit impacted local educational agencies 18 or school districts and not fund the general educational 19 program of the States. 20 In so doing, Congress removed from the 21 Secretary the previously delegated authority to 22 establish by regulation the equalization formula. The 23 Secretary in turn in 1996, in enacting his regulations 24 in response to the 1994 legislation, disavowed that he 25 was engaging in any rulemaking or in fact in any

1 interpretations of statutes. Instead, the Secretary 2 sought and announced that he was proceeding under an 3 exception to the public notice and comment laws, 4 5 U.S.C. 553(b), by stating that his regulations merely 5 reflected changes in legislation, refining regulatory 6 language. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Van Amberg, they were 8 essentially the same as the prior regulations, were they 9 not? And those regulations had gone through the notice 10 and comment process. 11 MR. VAN AMBERG: Yes. That is correct, 12 Justice Ginsburg -- Ginsburg. Those were essentially, 13 except for a few words here and there, those were the 14 same regulations. But they were in response to a 15 congressional directive back in 1974 that the Secretary 16 is to create the equalization formula. In 1994, 17 Congress came in with legislation and established that 18 formula. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the 20 formula was proposed to Congress by the Department of 21 Education, which is not something that Congress did in 22 other words, to stop the Secretary from whatever he was 23 doing. But it was indeed -- wasn't it the Secretary's 24 own language that Congress enacted? 25 MR. VAN AMBERG: The contention is made that

1 this 545-page omnibus education bill -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, just as to that, 3 the provision that we're talking about, do you say, you 4 say it wasn't drafted by the Department of Education? 5 MR. VAN AMBERG: I don't think we know 6 exactly who it was drafted by. I think there is -7 there is some references in the Congressional -8 Congressional Record that this is an administration 9 bill. But I would, I would like to respond, Justice 10 Ginsburg, based on the assumption that this was the 11 Secretary's bill. 12 Under the statutory formula, the language is 13 clear that what is disregarded in -- in ranking LEAs and 14 eliminating percentiles of LEAs is those LEAs which fall 15 above the 95th percentile -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get into the 17 substance let's -- let's finish with this, this problem, 18 whether it was indeed the other Secretary's own bill. 19 Was the Secretary who proposed the -- the '94 20 legislation, the same Secretary who had promulgated the 21 prior regulations? 22 MR. VAN AMBERG: No. This -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: The prior regulations were 24 promulgated when? 25 MR. VAN AMBERG: The former regulations were
5

1 promulgated in 1976. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: My goodness, that's a long 3 time before. 4 MR. VAN AMBERG: That's a long time. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: With a different Secretary 6 now. 7 MR. VAN AMBERG: And a different agency. 8 There wasn't even -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: So there's no reason to 10 believe that the same Secretary -- that the Secretary 11 continued to have the same view of what was proper, is 12 there? 13 MR. VAN AMBERG: We view that it did not 14 and, and also, Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, we 15 also view that if this was the chief educational officer 16 of the Federal Government, he was more than capable of 17 developing a statute which reflected his methodology 18 of -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed he could have copied 20 the regulations that were on the book and just put them 21 in the statute, couldn't he? 22 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, even in the same act, 23 Your Honor, under when they had the EFIG statute, there 24 Congress was able to reference the regulations of the 25 Secretary. They didn't do so when they were, when they
6

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 enacted the impact aid part of it. So -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, as -- as far as the 3 difference in time, it was the Secretary's decision, the 4 later Secretary's decision to retain, as you 5 acknowledged, the, almost the identical regulation. You 6 said it didn't go through notice and comment the second 7 time, but the text was basically the same in '76 and in 8 -9 MR. VAN AMBERG: He didn't -- if I could, 10 Your Honor, he did not retain the second regulation. 11 This was supposed to be a new regulation which was 12 promulgated by the Secretary because the Impact Aid Act 13 had been repealed -14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes -15 MR. VAN AMBERG: -- and re-enacted. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and I appreciate that. 17 But the text of it, what the regulation said was not 18 significantly different from what the earlier regulation 19 said. 20 MR. VAN AMBERG: No. But it -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was this the same 22 Secretary, by the way, as the Secretary who issued the 23 new regulation, the same Secretary that was in office 24 when the new legislation had been proposed? 25 MR. VAN AMBERG: The new legislation was
7

1 '94. Secretary enacted it in '96. I think it probably 2 was. I -- I -- it was the same administration. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why, why would the 4 Secretary, if indeed it was his bill, why would he 5 deprive himself of the power to decide what the formula 6 should be? Which is the power he had before. I mean, 7 one must think that there must have been some pressures 8 from elsewhere when the Secretary goes in and says take 9 some power away from me, please. 10 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, that, and I would 11 agree, Justice Scalia, that that is not a, a usual event 12 where an administration intentionally disgorges from 13 itself its own authority. And, and I would also point 14 out the fact that again, there is a dramatic difference 15 between what, what the statute proposed and, and the 16 methodology described in the regulation. And what's, 17 what's very significant is if you go back to 1976 when 18 the original regulation was promulgated, there was a 19 debate that went on in the public notice and comment 20 portion of these proceedings where they discussed 21 whether you eliminate percentile of LEAs directly or 22 whether you add this extra step of eliminating 23 percentage, percentages of pupils and then eliminating 24 LEAs as these pupils are eliminated. 25 I mean, it's a totally different process,
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 totally different philosophy behind them and as we can 2 see in this particular case, in New Mexico and in 3 Alaska, totally different results. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Van Amberg, is the 5 statutory language really as unambiguous as you suggest? 6 It says above the 95th percentile or below the 5th 7 percentile, but it doesn't say above the 95th percentile 8 of local education agencies or below the 5th percentile 9 of local education agencies, does it? 10 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, Justice Alito, I, I 11 think what you, I think it is clear and unambiguous. 12 And the reason is that if you, in order to run a 13 percentile calculation you need units against which to 14 run that, and then you need these, an identified set of 15 variable standards such as they provided here, the 16 average per pupil expenditures of each set of these LEAs 17 or districts. 18 So you rank the, the LEAs. You've got the 19 variable values and then it, it's, the statute provides 20 that you find that you eliminate those LEAs which are 21 above the 95th percentile. And then if you go back to 22 what "such" means and referencing back to other portions 23 of the statute, it's 95th percentile of the revenues and 24 expenditures of the LEAs in the State. It's a very 25 similar process for --

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but what do you 2 distribute? 3 MR. VAN AMBERG: Pardon? 4 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you distribute? I 5 mean, I agree you have a, some kind of, let's put 6 something on cards, so you have thousands of cards and 7 each one has a number on it. What are you distributing 8 -- the cards? Are you, are you -- what's distribute -9 a 5th percentile refers to some kind of distribution. 10 What's it a distribution of? 11 MR. VAN AMBERG: It's the distribution of 12 the percent of the, what is -13 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it a thing? 14 MR. VAN AMBERG: Like a thing. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Like a -- like a set of 16 things that you're distributing, what are they? 17 MR. VAN AMBERG: The thing that you're 18 running the percentile against is the total number of, 19 of expenditures and revenues in the State. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, you take 21 all the -- there is a set of numbers, each number is a 22 different number and the characteristic of each number 23 is there some school district that spends per, or takes 24 in per pupil, revenue equal to that number. So we write 25 each one on a card. Is that what we're, is that our
10

1 distribution? We have like, let's say we have a, a 2 thousand cards. Is that what it is? 3 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, you know, in New 4 Mexico's case you have -5 JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. I'm not, I'm 6 saying what do you think it has to be? What do you 7 think it should be? What are, what is it we are 8 distributing? A simple question, I guess, for a 9 statistician. I unfortunately am not one and can't find 10 one, so I have no idea what this statute means. 11 (Laughter.) 12 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, the, the -- the value 13 against which -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Not a value. I want to 15 know what I'm distributing. And if you don't know I 16 would say that this is, I have never seen a case so much 17 better fitted for relying on the views of an agency. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I thought you said 19 that you did know what it was. I thought you simply 20 quoted the statute, the 5th percentile of such 21 expenditures or revenues in the State. That's what's 22 being distributed. 23 MR. VAN AMBERG: Yes, but -24 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry, I don't know how 25 --
11

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Such revenues or 2 expenditures in the State consist of, the word "such" 3 obviously refers you back to some prior reference to 4 revenues in the State, and that prior reference in 5 subsection A is a reference to district by district, not 6 pupil by pupil. 7 MR. VAN AMBERG: That, that's correct. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: So, so in other words we 9 are distributing those cards, it's a set of numbers? If 10 you're certain, isn't it fair to say that this statute 11 is not clear as to what it is you're distributing? 12 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, I'm sorry, Justice -13 I'm -- Breyer; I'm having a little trouble understanding 14 -15 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- I thought not. 16 Is there a -17 MR. VAN AMBERG: -- the question. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not certain 19 about the hypothetical but you're certain about the 20 statute, aren't you? 21 MR. VAN AMBERG: I'm certain about the 22 statute. You're provided the variable values that are 23 attributed to each of the LEAs; you rank them; and you 24 provide a percentile. It's a methodology which was 25 described in 1976. It's a methodology employed every
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 day in ranking students and schools. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah -- that -- right. But 3 I unfortunately don't know enough about this subject, so 4 I thought, not being an expert on it, that when you 5 referred to a percentile, you have some group of things, 6 a set of things that's being distributed in a certain 7 order and there is a top of that and a bottom of that. 8 MR. VAN AMBERG: Correct. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: And if that's what 10 percentile refers to, I just want to know what those 11 things are that are being distributed. And - and that's 12 where I find the ambiguity. And if there is an 13 ambiguity, I guess we are going to take the view of the 14 agency at least as I understand it. So -- so that's why 15 I asked the question. 16 MR. VAN AMBERG: All right. And, and I 17 think I understand the question now, Justice Breyer. 18 Thank you. 19 The units that are ranked or distributed are 20 the LEAs or the school districts. And they are ranked 21 in order of their per pupil expenditures and revenues. 22 Those are the units and the component parts of this 23 calculation that are provided for us by Congress. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: And does the statute say 25 you have to do it that way? It has to be the group
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that's distributed? 2 MR. VAN AMBERG: It's my understanding under 3 -- under Brown and Williamson is if Congress speaks to 4 an issue, Congress is to be obeyed. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Clearly. 6 MR. VAN AMBERG: There is nothing mysterious 7 about this type of a methodology. And this is the one 8 that Congress chose. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: No, you could do it that 10 way and the reason the Government, I think, says that 11 you shouldn't do it that way is that it would produce an 12 absurd result. 13 MR. VAN AMBERG: All right. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: That the object of the 15 statute is to catch the outliers. And if you, for 16 example, had one giant school district like New York 17 City which was at the top of the list and another giant 18 school district that was at the bottom of the list you 19 would cut those two out, and you might have cut out half 20 the pupils in the whole State, and those wouldn't be 21 outliers would they? I mean, that's the problem. 22 MR. VAN AMBERG: And you have a similar 23 infirmity associated with the other methodology. That 24 is, if you have a number of LEAs which are small in 25 numbers, as in New Mexico, particularly if you had a
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 number of small LEAs at the bottom, which is I think a 2 huge problem policy wise, you were to cut them out and 3 let them to float off in their poverty. I think, I can 4 understand where there is -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't, doesn't 6 subsection b(ii) address outliers? I was surprised 7 there wasn't more discussion of that in the briefing and 8 maybe it's, it's because of some reason I'm unaware of. 9 That says that the Secretary in making this 10 determination can take into account particular types of 11 LEAs where there is extra, additional costs. I would 12 have thought for example if you had a very small LEA 13 with only 20 students and the cost is particularly high 14 because you don't have economies of scale, that you 15 haven't -- that would, could be knocked out for that 16 reason. Is that not how that works? 17 MR. VAN AMBERG: Yes. And this is the, the 18 whole problem, that we can argue philosophically how 19 whether Congress's methodology or the Secretary's 20 methodology is better, but the backdrop of this is that 21 the, the statute and also the regulation allows for 22 school, for the States to back out all these 23 disequalizing expenditures so that you, you make an 24 adjustment to more or less end up with a baseline per 25 pupil expenditure. And there is really no reason after
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you do that for having a wide disparity, even between 2 the top and the bottom LEA. 3 The Secretary's formula, and I don't think 4 we should be arguing whose formula is better, because if 5 they are different, Congress wins, but nevertheless, the 6 Secretary's formula, it eliminates 26 percent of the 7 school districts. And under New Mexico, if you, if you 8 look at the top and the bottom school district even 9 after the eliminating of these funding differentials, 10 you've got a 244 percent disparity. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: It, it eliminates 26 school 12 districts but those 26 school districts account for 5 13 percent or 10 percent of the pupils. And I guess what 14 we are interested in here is not school districts; they 15 are not a thing -- they are a thing of a kind, but we 16 are interested in students, real people who get money. 17 And so that it, that it -- it eliminates 26 percent of 18 the school districts would see, to be a good thing, not 19 a bad thing, because what we are really interested in 20 are the pupils and it keeps in 90 percent of the pupils. 21 MR. VAN AMBERG: And Justice Breyer, I think 22 Congress and in its methodology has disagreed with that 23 view, because it does not rely strictly upon pupils, and 24 pupils are not necessarily the driving force in how we 25 work this formula.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the problem was 2 disparity in school districts. Since much of the 3 funding for education is local funding, in some places 4 there are very rich school districts and very, very 5 poor, poor school districts. And I thought that the 6 purpose of this was to make sure that there is not an 7 enormous disparity, not pupil to pupil but district to 8 district. It makes perfect sense, it seems to me. 9 MR. VAN AMBERG: And that is correct. 10 Because these districts particularly in New Mexico serve 11 a unique purpose. New Mexico has pockets of, of urban 12 and populations, and then they have got small 13 traditional villages; they have got farming communities; 14 they have got Indian lands; they have got military 15 bases. And a school district whether it educates 100 16 children or 1,000 children or 5,000 children has a 17 special value in the State and in our educational 18 process. And simply because a child in New Mexico 19 attends the school district that does not have 20 particularly many students in it doesn't mean that he 21 has to suffer a poorer education than his brethren and 22 brothers and sisters in the metropolitan area. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Van Amberg, if there 24 is any ambiguity in the statute, one relevant 25 consideration might be how would this work across
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 States, and I think it's true, is it not, that your 2 reading would lead to wildly different, wildly different 3 results from State to State depending on whether they 4 have large districts or small districts at the top and 5 the bottom, whereas the other way, counting pupils 6 rather than school districts regardless of size, you 7 would get uniformity going from State to State. 8 MR. VAN AMBERG: Justice Ginsburg, the 9 Secretary recognized in 1976 that both methodologies 10 have their problems, depending on how your districts, 11 the number of districts that you have in a State, their 12 relative populations, how they line up. And -13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct in 14 understanding that at the end of the line here, if you 15 win the Federal money will go to your two districts, 16 whereas if the other side wins the Federal money will go 17 to the State? Is that what the bottom line is? 18 MR. VAN AMBERG: That's the bottom line. 19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 20 MR. VAN AMBERG: And I would point out, 21 Justice Stevens, that Congress has made it clear that 22 the impact aid is supposed to go to the impacted 23 districts. It is not supposed to fund the general 24 educational program of a State. The money that the 25 State, that the State of New Mexico seeks to retain is
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 under a limited exception that has been created and it 2 is, it is not that we are trying to take the State's 3 money as the bottom line. It is that the State has 4 taken the impact aid dollars and doesn't have an 5 equalized system. New Mexico could equalize if it wants 6 to. It established its equalization formula. 7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask another general 8 question. If it were true, and I don't think it is in 9 this case, that the biggest district was the one that 10 got the most per pupil money -- the two biggest 11 districts that were at the opposite ends of the 12 spectrum, they would all be taken out, wouldn't they, 13 under your view? 14 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, it actually 15 depends -- you get into statistical approaches, but if, 16 let's say, there were less than 20 districts, you just 17 had let's say 18 districts or 19 districts, then if you 18 do the percentile against, if you work the percentile in 19 that particular setting, nobody gets eliminated. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have the same 21 problem if it's students, I take it? You'd have the 22 same statistical question whether you, you use districts 23 or students? 24 MR. VAN AMBERG: Correct, because you would 25 run -- because if you had districts, big districts at
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 both ends, you run your 5 percent on both ends with the 2 students, you end up not eliminating anybody. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: That's all right. I 4 wouldn't think that was a problem. But what about 5 Justice Stevens' question. There are 20 districts in 6 our State -- it's exaggerated, let me exaggerate it -7 and the rich district has 20, has a quarter of the 8 students, and the poor district has another quarter. So 9 our outliers in that situation which we're eliminating 10 from our calculation are the rich district and the poor 11 district. One's at the top, one's at the bottom. And 12 now we're left with 18 districts to figure out whether 13 they're equalized. But those 18 districts account for 14 less than half or about half of all the students. 15 That's the problem. It seems that isn't very 16 representative and we're trying to get 17 representativeness. 18 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, Justice Breyer, I, I 19 would respectfully like to go back, not to what we are 20 trying to accomplish through judicial decision, but what 21 Congress accomplished through its decision. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. If the 23 language doesn't permit it you can't do it, they can't, 24 and you win. But if the language does permit it, the 25 reason -- you have to stretch the language, I suspect,
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in my view to get to the Government's result. It might 2 just barely permit it. But one of the things on their 3 side is that if we take your view it produces an absurd 4 result, because of what Justice Ginsburg said, because 5 there is such variation in the number of pupils among 6 school districts in different states. 7 MR. VAN AMBERG: Right. If I could address 8 that, Your Honor. The only argument I see the State has 9 is the argument about absurdity. This debate that we're 10 having now is the debate that took place in 1976 in 11 front of the Secretary. He recognized that there were 12 two methodologies that he was considering. He 13 recognized that they both had their problems. But in 14 1994, Congress had before it at least or had available 15 to it information as to the, whether, what, how this 16 particular formula would work. There were only three 17 and perhaps -- three States, Kansas, Alaska, New Mexico, 18 and perhaps Arizona -- that had -- that were trying to 19 take advantage of the, of this narrow exception. So 20 they knew the configuration and the composition of these 21 school districts. 22 And so they could look if they wanted to -23 and there's no legislative history to this, but they 24 could have looked if they had wanted to, to exactly what 25 the practical effect would be of these two formulas.
21
Alderson Reporting Company

1 And the practical effect is that in New Mexico the 2 formula which the Respondents contend is absurd reduced 3 only 11 percent of the LEAs. And with the backdrop that 4 this, that these LEAs should have been more or less 5 equalized anyhow because of removing the disparate 6 funding, that's, that's much more reasonable and 7 certainly doesn't reflect an absurdity, and when you 8 compare that to the Secretary's approach which 9 eliminates 26 percent and cuts loose 23 school districts 10 out of 89 from any consideration and you end up with 11 kind of a core block in their 14 or 15 percent 12 disparity, I think there may be those who could argue 13 forcefully that that's an absurdity. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I see your white light is 15 on. I don't want to take -- would the other States make 16 that same answer that you just made? 17 MR. VAN AMBERG: Kansas equalizes under any 18 formula, as New Mexico did, could do. Alaska, you 19 eliminate 22 percent in order for them to just kind of 20 squeak by. If they applied Congress's formula they 21 would just equalize. This is an option I contend that's 22 available to every State that wants to take advantage. 23 If you give them a 25 percent disparity allowance, you 24 allow them to back out disequalizing expenditures. 25 There's really no explanation that's been offered why

SRINIVASAN: The question, the question 20 before the Court is whether the Secretary's formula is 21 unambiguously foreclosed by the statutory test, not 22 whether it's the better reading, but whether it's 23 unambiguously foreclosed. And we happen to think it's 24 the better reading, but we certainly think it's not 25 unambiguously foreclosed. And maybe the clearest

SRINIVASAN: Well, Brand X says that, 6 but it's a characterization of the step one inquiry 7 under Chevron. And we can use "foreclosed" if you like, 8 Your Honor. 9 But the clearest indication that the statute 10 does not foreclose the Secretary's methodology is a 11 provision that I think hasn't been addressed thus far in 12 the argument and that's that in the very same act in 13 Congress in which Congress enacted Section 7709, the 14 provision at issue here, Congress also explicitly 15 endorsed and incorporated the Secretary's -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You begin with an 17 argument that directly cuts against your position. They 18 knew how to do it under the -- I assume you're referring 19 to the education finance and incentive grant program? 20 MR. SRINIVASAN: I am. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they did it 22 there, they didn't do it here. To me that suggests the 23 opposite of the inference you're trying to draw. 24 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Mr. Chief 25 Justice, with respect. There are two education finance

1 incentive grant program, or EFIG, provisions that we 2 identified in the briefs and one of them I would 3 acknowledge is susceptible to that line of argument, 4 although I don't think it's persuasive. But it's the 5 other one that I'm focusing on, and what the other one 6 does is to explicitly incorporate the Secretary's 7 regulations and so what Congress said in 1994 is that 8 for purposes -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which they did not 10 say in this act. 11 MR. SRINIVASAN: They didn't, but I think it 12 would be very odd to attribute to Congress the intention 13 on one hand to say, we like your regulation, so much so 14 that we want to use it and we want you to continue to 15 use it for purposes of the EFIG program -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Different purposes. 17 MR. SRINIVASAN: They're not -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: They're for different 19 purposes. 20 MR. SRINIVASAN: They're not different 21 purposes at all, Justice Scalia, with respect. They're 22 the exact same purpose. In both programs what Congress 23 wanted to do was to get an assessment of the extent to 24 which education expenditures were equalized in a State 25 among school districts. They're the very same purpose.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But for different 2 purposes. In the one case, in this act we're worried 3 about an extensive Federal presence that has an effect 4 on the tax base available for schools and under the EFIG 5 program it's an entirely different question of 6 equalization. 7 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, at that level of 8 generality you might be right, but with respect to the 9 purpose of the equalization provisions of both of those 10 acts the purpose is exactly the same. In impact aid, 11 just like in EFIG, the question is to what extent has 12 the State equalized expenditures across school 13 districts. It's the very same question. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe let me 15 ask it directly. If they could so easily just say we 16 incorporate the Secretary's regulation in EFIG, why 17 didn't they do it here? 18 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, because -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They instead went to 20 the trouble of mimicking part of the regulation, but not 21 mimicking the appendix, which is where your calculation 22 methodology is. 23 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, they didn't mimic it. 24 They incorporated it. And so far as the argument is 25 that they incorporated just the regulation qua
26

1 regulation and not the appendix to the regulation, I 2 don't think that that argument can be squared with the 3 statutory text or the regulatory text. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask, is there 5 a difference legally between a regulation and an 6 appendix to the regulation? 7 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, at least 8 not in the circumstance of this case, where the 9 regulation by its own terms incorporates the appendix. 10 And so when Congress incorporated the regulation it 11 necessarily incorporated the appendix. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you say 13 "incorporated," though. What it did was it took the 14 language and it did not take -15 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No? 17 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't think so, Your 18 Honor. The text of the statute in 1994 is set forth at 19 the top of page 30 of the Government's brief, and I'm 20 quoting from the second line of page 30 and what 21 Congress said in the EFIG statute in 1994, again in the 22 very same act that enacted this language -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the EFIG statute? 24 MR. SRINIVASAN: In the EFIG statute. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in this statute
27

1 the regulation says look to the, look at the appendix. 2 Congress as I understood when it enacted our statute, it 3 took language from the regulation; it didn't take the 4 part that said look to the appendix. 5 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it didn't take the 6 part that said look to the appendix because I don't know 7 that that would have been a sensible thing to do when 8 you're enacting a statute. But the point I'm trying to 9 make is that when Congress in the EFIG statute 10 incorporated the regulation it specifically referred to 11 the regulation that the Secretary had in place at that 12 time. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it didn't do 14 that here? 15 MR. SRINIVASAN: It didn't do that here, but 16 it didn't have to. It makes sense -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I still think it cuts 18 against you rather than for you, the fact that they 19 could have done the same thing here and we wouldn't have 20 this case. 21 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, let me just make one 22 more point on this, Your Honor, and then I'll move to 23 the text of Section 7709, because I do think that this 24 point has a great deal of force. The reason that 25 Congress would have incorporated the regulation
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 specifically in EFIG but not in impact aid is because 2 we're dealing with an impact aid regulation. So the 3 Secretary ordinarily wouldn't have thought that he 4 should apply the impact aid regulation for purposes of 5 EFIG unless Congress told him to do that and that's what 6 Congress did. But with respect to impact aid, there's 7 no reason to incorporate the regulation. The regulation 8 already existed, and the question is did Congress in 9 this act foreclose the Secretary from continuing to 10 apply that longstanding regulatory methodology. And I 11 would suggest that if Congress really wanted to -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Srinivasan, if we could 13 come to the, to the text that you're talking about. 14 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: What I don't understand 16 about the Government's position is why you use this, 17 this per pupil theory for purposes of (B)i), but don't 18 use it for purposes of (A). You, you don't -- in the 19 major computation portions, namely for purposes of 20 paragraph 1, a program of State aid equalizes 21 expenditures among local expenditures, if in the second 22 fiscal year is made the amount of per pupil expenditures 23 made by or per pupil revenue available to, you do it 24 agency by agency, don't you? You DON'T apply this, you 25 know, it depends on how many pupils in each agency. Why
29

1 don't you do for both? 2 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if you look at 2(a), 3 Your Honor what that says is that the disparity, the 4 disparity standard at its broadest level deals with 5 whether the per-pupil revenues for the highest ranked 6 local educational agency exceeds the per pupil revenues 7 for the lowest one by 25 percent. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 9 MR. SRINIVASAN: It would make no difference 10 if you take into account pupils for that part of the 11 analysis, and here's the reason why. When you take into 12 account pupils with respect to a local educational 13 agency and you weight the local, the figure by the 14 number of pupils served by the local educational agency, 15 the per pupil figure that you're going to attach to each 16 of those individual pupils is the same. It's the same 17 per pupil figure for each one. It's just that you 18 multiply it by the number of pupils. 19 So for purposes of this part of the statute, 20 where you're comparing the highest to the lowest, 21 whether you took into account the number of pupils or 22 not you'd still be dealing with the same two figures. 23 You'd be dealing with a figure that applies to the 24 highest ranked local educational agency and you'd be 25 dealing with a figure that applies to the lowest ranked

1 local educational agency. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying it comes to 3 the same, but the fact remains you don't use that 4 methodology in A, because you don't think the language 5 requires that methodology. And it is the same language 6 in B. 7 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, there would be -- I 8 don't know that we use one or the other. It's just that 9 there would be absolutely no purpose served by using 10 pupils with respect to -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the purpose would be 12 to follow the language of the statute, and if you think 13 that the language in B requires this kind of an approach 14 you should take the same approach in A, especially if it 15 makes no difference. 16 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, no; especially 17 because it makes no difference, because with respect to 18 the B part of it, the 95th and 5th percentile 19 exclusions, it makes all the difference in the world 20 whether you take into account -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have a conceptual 22 difficulty, and it may be my limitations with the way 23 you do it. You take students and you assign a per-pupil 24 number to each individual student. 25 MR. SRINIVASAN: Effectively.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I would have 2 thought the per-pupil concept only makes sense if you're 3 dealing with LEAs. They have a per-pupil number because 4 they've got a bunch of pupils. You take individual 5 students, and you know for example in that school 6 district you don't spend the same amount of money on the 7 kindergartner that you spend on the eighth grader. And 8 yet, you give the kindergartner a per-pupil number and 9 the eighth grader a per-pupil number that is the same. 10 It's an artificial association. It makes sense to speak 11 of per-pupil numbers when you're referring to the LEAs 12 because they have so many pupils, they get so much 13 money, you can do the calculation. It doesn't make 14 sense to say, you know, John Smith the kindergartner has 15 a per-pupil expenditure of a thousand dollars. He may 16 have $200 and the eighth grader 2,000, so why are you 17 creating this artificial association and then using, 18 using that methodology? 19 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's an approximation 20 to be sure, and per-pupil revenues by definition deal 21 with approximations across the swath of students that 22 are covered by local educational agencies. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's only -- the 24 reason is to rank them if you have an entity that has a 25 swath of students, the district, that's the way it
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 should be ranked. When you're ranking it by pupils, 2 maybe if you ranked them by pupils and you have the 3 actual numbers of course, which nobody does, your 4 methodology would make sense. 5 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think what we're 6 really doing, Your Honor, is weighting each figure by 7 the amount of pupils in the school district, and the 8 reason we're doing that is to get a more accurate 9 picture of the extent to which any one school district's 10 per-pupil revenue figure contributes to the overall 11 revenue pictures in the State. And if I could use one 12 example which I think might help to crystallize why it's 13 necessary to do this sort of weighting and why education 14 finance practitioners routinely prescribe that you have 15 to do this sort of weighting in order to avoid distorted 16 results, if you consider the example of a State that has 17 two school districts, and I'll use real examples from 18 New Mexico. One would be the district that has the 19 highest per-pupil revenues in the state, the Mosquero 20 district, in which there's 57 pupils. And the other 21 would be the Albuquerque school district, the largest 22 school district in the State, which serves 84,000 23 pupils. 24 Now the per-pupil revenues for Albuquerque 25 are roughly $3,000 and the per-pupil revenues for
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Mosquero, the smaller school district, are roughly 2 $7,000. And if you imagine a State that consists of 3 just those two districts, and you ask the question to 4 pair with the statutory language, what is the 50th 5 percentile, and I'll use 50th just for ease of analysis, 6 what is the 50th percentile of such per-pupil revenues 7 in the State? One answer would be that you take the 8 number for Mosquero, the 7,000 and you take the number 9 for Albuquerque, the 3,000, you split the difference and 10 you say the 50th percentile of per-pupil revenues in the 11 State is $5,000. But I think that would present a very 12 misleading picture of what's actually going on in the 13 State. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No -15 MR. SRINIVASAN: Because -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, because it's 17 an absurd hypothetical. What is the -18 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't -- I -- it is not 19 -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the 21 smallest number of districts, what is the smallest 22 number of school districts in a State? 23 MR. SRINIVASAN: One. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which State has one 25 school district?
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. SRINIVASAN: Hawaii. Hawaii has one 2 which is a special case but there are states that have a 3 relatively small number of school districts. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the, in the 5 hypothetical you posed why couldn't the Secretary 6 address that disparity under (b)(ii)? In other words, 7 the school district which has only 57 students, it seems 8 to me could be taken out of the calculation under 9 (b)(ii), and then you would be dealing only with more 10 representative school districts, not the special case of 11 the particularly isolated school district or whatever. 12 MR. SRINIVASAN: Two points on (b)(ii), 13 Mr. Chief Justice. The first is that by -- by the 14 statutory text, (b)(ii) is over and above what you do in 15 (b)(i,). The 95th and 5th percentiles exclusions. So 16 you first have to do that. But the more relevant 17 point -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you have to 19 do that? Why do you have to do it first? It says you 20 can take into account this -- extent to which the 21 program reflects additional costs in particular 22 districts. 23 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, my point is simply that 24 under (b)(i) the statute says the Secretary shall 25 disregard local education agencies that are above the
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 95th and below the 5th percentile. So I think the 2 Secretary has to do that. Now (b)(ii) in some sense 3 could be seen as an additional option for the Secretary 4 over and above the exclusion, but there is a more 5 fundamental point which is that with (b)(ii), it says 6 take into account the extent to which a program of State 7 aid reflects the additional costs. 8 And so what that does is a piggyback on the 9 way that the State approaches the situation. So this, 10 as -- this provision as the Secretary understands it 11 allows it to give effect to a State that gives effect to 12 those sorts of considerations, but it's not an 13 independent grant of authority for the Secretary himself 14 to take those considerations into account. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you 16 may have convinced me. I'll stipulate that you have 17 convinced me that the argument that you're arguing for 18 would probably be a better method, but you haven't 19 touched the text of (b)(2)(b)(i) yet, and that's where 20 some of us at least are, are having our -- our problems. 21 Do you agree that in the absence of the 22 other program, I forget the, the acronym for it -- that 23 you really would not have any argument that there is 24 ambiguity in the text here? 25 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. No. Absolutely not.

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then would you 2 address the text? 3 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure, I will. 4 It's at page 4a of the appendix of the 5 Government's brief, b -- (b)(i). And what the text says 6 is disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil 7 expenditures or revenues above the 59th percentile or 8 below the 5th percentile of such expenditures or 9 revenues in the State. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 11 MR. SRINIVASAN: Now one point I make -12 JUSTICE SOUTER: So what is supposed to be 13 disregarded are educational agencies? 14 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And the agencies 16 are identified how? How do we identify the agencies 17 that would be disregarded? 18 MR. SRINIVASAN: You identify the agencies 19 to be disregarded by first identifying the 59th and 5th 20 percentiles of per-pupil revenues in the State. And 21 then you disregard -22 JUSTICE SOUTER: And we identify their 23 per-pupil revenues, too, don't we? Agencies with 24 per-pupil expenditures or revenues above or below, 25 right?
37

1 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, but -- and -- but the 2 critical test is the 95th percentile and 5th percentile 3 of such expenditures or revenues in the State. 4 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that critical test is 5 being applied to an agency which is being identified by 6 reference to per-pupil expenditures or revenues, 7 correct? 8 MR. SRINIVASAN: It is. I mean there is no 9 doubt that the per-pupil revenues or expenditure figures 10 that lie on the spectrum are associated with the local 11 educational agencies. That's how -12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's not merely that 13 they are associated with. The very definition, the very 14 identification of LEA here is exclusively in terms of 15 per-pupil expenditures or revenues. It's not merely in 16 association. It is a definition, isn't that so? 17 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so. The -18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then, then what does the 19 phrase with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above 95 20 or below 5 mean? 21 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's true that each 22 local education agency has a per-pupil expenditure or 23 revenue. But the critical part of the statute which has 24 59th percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures 25 or revenues doesn't foreclose weighting. And I think
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the point that Justice Alito made bears, which is -2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why doesn't it? It 3 seems to me that the only identification of an entity or 4 person, if you want, to be disregarded is the 5 identification of an LEA, and the LEA is described in 6 terms exclusively of its expenditures or revenues. So 7 why doesn't that foreclose your position? 8 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, we -- two parts to 9 the answer, Justice Souter. First the Secretary's 10 formulation, no less than Petitioner's formulation, does 11 disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil 12 revenues above the 95th and 5th percentiles. 13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. Obviously -14 MR. SRINIVASAN: Where we disagree is in 15 identifying the 95th exactly. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: After identifying them in 17 terms of the expenditures or revenues. That's what 18 you're supposed to do. 19 MR. SRINIVASAN: Exactly. And I'd -20 exactly. And I'd reiterate the point that Justice Alito 21 made earlier, which is that Congress could have 22 compelled the approach that Petitioners compelled -23 contend, if it would have said -24 JUSTICE SOUTER: There are lots of things 25 that Congress could have done differently from what it
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 did do, but it, that doesn't seem to me to inject an 2 ambiguity in the identification in, in this subsection 3 of the LEA that we are talking about. And it doesn't 4 create an ambiguity in, in the clear provision that what 5 is to be disregarded is an LEA as so defined. 6 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think it does, Your 7 Honor, because there are two different ways of ranking 8 the LEAs. One is to take the per-pupil revenues 9 associated with each LEA and simply take that list into 10 account. Another is to take the same list but then 11 weight it by the number of pupils in each LEA. 12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, that's another way to 13 -14 MR. SRINIVASAN: Nothing in the statute 15 forecloses that approach. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- do it, but tell me why 17 that is consistent with the text. 18 MR. SRINIVASAN: Because the text refers to 19 the 95th and 5th percentiles of such expenditures or 20 revenues in the State, and the list that includes the 21 weighting does represent a list of expenditures or 22 revenues in the State. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would such be -- of such 24 expenditures or revenues. That refers back to local 25 educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 revenues. It's referring you back not to the totality 2 of students but to, to agencies with per-pupil 3 expenditures or revenues. 4 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. And I don't, I don't 5 dispute that the per-pupil revenue figures belong to a 6 local educational agency. But again that doesn't mean 7 that you can't take into account the relative extent to 8 which a particular school district contributes to the 9 overall State picture, and the way you do that -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn't the statute 11 have told you, though, to, to disregard pupils according 12 to the ranking? It does tell you to disregard LEAs, 13 which suggests the ranking -- at least to me, that the 14 ranking ought to be of LEAs and not pupils. 15 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it is, it is a 16 ranking of LEAs in the first instance and then it's, 17 each of those LEA figures is weighted by the number of 18 pupils the way we do it, and we do end up disregarding 19 LEAs. But as Justice Souter pointed out the first step 20 is identifying the 5th and 95th percentiles, and on that 21 step we take into account the number of pupils. It's 22 only at that step that we take into account the number 23 of pupils. 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -25 MR. SRINIVASAN: And nothing in the statute

What do you think I should do? 13 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think in that 14 situation you sort of have the sliding scale that we 15 often confront with textual analysis. And if you really 16 think that Congress would have compelled an absurd 17 result, and I think it does verge on that, then you 18 would -19 JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think it has to be 20 absurd, it's just, I would measure it by what Congress 21 actually intended. Assume there two permissible 22 readings, and two -- both of them make sense.

Thank you. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 5 Mr. Manasevit. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEIGH M. MANASEVIT, 7 ON BEHALF OF STATE RESPONDENT 8 MR. MANASEVIT: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 9 please the Court: 10 I'd like to begin with Justice Ginsburg's 11 question, because I think that that is very illuminating 12 to where we are today. This statute began against a 13 history, an 18-year history where the agency had been 14 delegated by Congress virtually carte blanche authority 15 to devise equalization tests. That was the earlier 16 statute. The agency had three tests at the time. One 17 was the 25 percent disparity test that we see today and 18 there were two other tests. 19 In 1994, what happened was the Secretary 20 proposed to the Congress and the Congress following the 21 Secretary's lead eliminated the two other tests. 22 That's, that's what was happening. And Justice Scalia 23 asked well, why would the Secretary tie his hands? What 24 happened was the Secretary no longer was satisfied or 25 liked the other two tests and eliminated those and

1 proposed the test that he had been using for 18 years to 2 the Congress. Congress adopted that test and that's the 3 test that we have today, the 25 percent disparity test. 4 The difference is that whereas the Secretary 5 had the free rein to develop that disparity test, 6 however he wanted, previously, the Secretary -- the 7 Congress now told the Secretary in disparity, do the 8 following things. First of all 25 percent is the 9 maximum disparity that we are going to allow you, number 10 one. And number two, take out the outliers in a range 11 of 5 to -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't it -- I'm 13 sorry. Go ahead. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I really don't 15 care what the Secretary thought he was doing. I mean, 16 it seems to me we have to ask the question, what would a 17 member of Congress who voted on this thing have thought 18 he was voting for, who had, you know, didn't have this 19 history you're giving us. And more importantly, what 20 would a citizen to whom this language is promulgated 21 think the language means? I don't care what the 22 Secretary had in the back of his mind. Why should that 23 make any difference to us? 24 MR. MANASEVIT: Fair question, Justice 25 Scalia, and that brings us back to the language of the
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 statute, where of course we begin, and we have to look 2 precisely to the language of the statute. The language 3 of the statute, what Petitioners mistake is that the 4 language of the statute here has a two-part process. We 5 don't look at LEAs first. It doesn't say 5th percentile 6 of LEAs. We have to first rank expenditures or revenues 7 in the State. It's above 95th percentile or below 5th 8 percentile of the expenditures. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of such expenditures or 10 revenues. 11 MR. MANASEVIT: Of such. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you've got to find out 13 what "such" refers to. 14 MR. MANASEVIT: And "such" would refer just 15 to the previous usage of that precise term, which is 16 disregard local education agencies with per-pupil 17 expenditures or revenues. So it's that "with per-pupil 18 revenues" that the "such" would refer back to, the most 19 immediate prior reference, so we're still looking at 20 per-pupil revenues or expenditures in the State which we 21 have to rank first. We don't identify LEAs first. It 22 doesn't say 95th percentile of LEAs. It tells us rank 23 per-pupil revenue. The only difference -24 JUSTICE SOUTER: It says disregard LEAs; it 25 then identifies certain LEAs which are to be
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 disregarded. Nowhere does it say disregard pupils. 2 MR. MANASEVIT: No. It says -- it says -3 we are disregarding the LEAs. That's the end of the 4 process. But we have to identify the range of value 5 that 5 percent and 95 percent applies to. The range -6 the percentiles apply to a range of values. We have in 7 New Mexico, we have 89 amounts of per-pupil revenue per 8 district, we have 89 of those. But we also have 377,000 9 per-pupil revenues, because a per-pupil revenue repeats 10 for every time that there's a student, and -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. See, 12 that's my conceptual difficulty. It is only per pupil 13 when you're dealing with an aggregation of the pupils. 14 If you're going to break it down pupil by pupil, which 15 is what you do, you don't have a per-pupil number 16 associated with each pupil. You have a number. Nobody 17 knows what it is because nobody knows how much you spend 18 on each individual. We know how much you give to this 19 district, and therefore, the district has a per-pupil 20 number, and therefore, I would have thought a reference 21 to per-pupil numbers suggests you're grouping according 22 to district. 23 MR. MANASEVIT: Mr. Chief Justice, we are 24 not saying that it can't. We're -- all we're saying is 25 that it equally carries both meanings. School finance

1 is an extraordinarily technical area, which is precisely 2 why Congress left this issue to the agency to work this 3 out. When Congress -- when Congress used the terms 5 4 percent and 10 percent, and again I'm not, I'm not 5 reading Congress's mind to say that when Congress used 6 those terms, those percentiles, Congress must have 7 intended some national uniformity. This is a national 8 program and Congress expects these programs to be 9 applied somewhat uniformly across -- across the country. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ask you the same 13 question I asked -- I asked the Government. Why don't 14 you, if this is a natural reading, why don't you apply 15 it to, to 2.A? You don't even think of doing that in 16 2.A. In 2.A you just look at the individual agency, but 17 it's the same language in 2.A. 18 MR. SRINIVASAN: In 2.A, 2.A calls for a 19 different type of comparison. And I also note that in 20 2.A it refers to percent instead of percentile, which 21 refers to two numbers being compared. Percentile refers 22 to an entire ranking of value, so the processes are 23 somewhat different. Now we're not, I'm not contending 24 that this statute is absolutely clear and a model of 25 draftsmanship, but certainly the meaning of 95th
50
Alderson Reporting Company

1 percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures or 2 revenues is a broad enough term. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: To include the words 4 per-pupil revenue for each pupil, is that what you're 5 saying? 6 MR. MANASEVIT: Well, to -7 JUSTICE BREYER: How do you want to say it, 8 per-pupil revenue attached to each pupil? 9 MR. MANASEVIT: Well, I believe -10 JUSTICE BREYER: Or how do you want to say 11 it then? 12 MR. MANASEVIT: I believe simply that the 13 word per-pupil revenue can mean the dollar amount per 14 each agency 89 times, or it can mean repeated each time 15 a student generates -16 JUSTICE BREYER: What is attached to each 17 pupil? You say the word such is broad enough to include 18 per-pupil revenue as attached to each pupil? 19 MR. MANASEVIT: Yes. Correct. Remember -20 JUSTICE BREYER: And I don't know where to 21 look to discover if you're right or wrong. 22 MR. MANASEVIT: Well, bear in mind -- bear 23 in mind the nature of many education -24 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any statistical 25 text that you could look at to see it that's the way
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 people use the words? 2 MR. MANASEVIT: That answer I couldn't 3 answer, but I can tell you that typically in an 4 education statute, funding is distributed on the basis 5 of numbers of pupils. So if the statute says $3,000 per 6 pupil shall go somewhere, the -- the statute means you 7 take that dollar amount and you -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that must not 9 be right, because otherwise we wouldn't have any 10 disparity to worry about equalization in the first 11 place. Right? 12 MR. MANASEVIT: Well, we always -- we always 13 will have disparity in the real world and that -- and 14 that's because lots of things cause disparity. In this 15 case actually, local tax revenues are not the cause of 16 disparity because there are no significant local tax 17 revenues at issue here. But disparity happens -- in the 18 top three or four districts in New Mexico you have under 19 100 students, or slightly over 100 students. In a 20 district that small, minor things, an insurance recovery 21 for example, a couple hundred thousand dollar insurance 22 recovery in a district of 87 students will generate 23 $3,000 of revenue per member for that year. It's a 24 distorting figure. That's precisely what Congress is 25 trying to get rid of.

1 But when Congress says 5 percent, presumably 2 Congress intends that 5 percent to have some uniform 3 applicability across the country and not vary with a 4 State like New Mexico where it would just eliminate five 5 districts. Or in our -- in our neighboring State of 6 Maryland, Montgomery County has the highest per-pupil 7 revenues in the State. It has 16 percent of the 8 population. Under petitioners' view, that -- and it has 9 24 districts, so that district would be eliminated under 10 petitioners' view. It would completely be eliminated. 11 Yet under our view, the 10 percent would fall within 12 that and we would keep it in. So -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you think 14 Congress, if Congress is concerned about the, in this 15 provision, about the impact of the Federal presence, and 16 your reading prevents the money that Congress meant to 17 go to those particular districts from actually reaching 18 the districts, I mean, wouldn't we be inclined to read 19 it the way that, let the money get where Congress meant 20 it to go? 21 MR. MANASEVIT: Thank you, Mr. Chief 22 Justice, because that was on the list of things that I 23 wanted to cover, and I'm sure that petitioners 'counsel 24 inadvertently misspoke. Impact aid never ever gets 25 diverted from the district. Impact Aid goes from the
53
Alderson Reporting Company

1 Federal Government pursuant to a formula -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, but then 3 the question is whether the State can consider it when 4 they're figuring out how much money to give it. So in 5 effect it's diverted. 6 MR. MANASEVIT: Well, remember, the State 7 figures a total cost of program for every district 8 starting from zero, number of students and dollars 9 needed to manage those number of students, and the State 10 supplies that amount of money. So where the district 11 gets some of that necessary money from another source, 12 the State under equalization is allowed to just consider 13 that that amount of money, in addition to what the State 14 is going to provide, will provide the entire amount. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 16 MR. MANASEVIT: Thank you very much. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Van Amberg, you 18 have three minutes remaining. 19 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. VAN AMBERG 20 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 21 MR. VAN AMBERG: Mr. Chief Justice had a 22 question as to whether or not the, an appendix is 23 something different from a regulation or carries a 24 different weight, and I haven't found anything 25 determinative. But I would refer the Court to Young
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 versus Community Nutrition Institute where it identifies 2 something similar to an appendix as an example, and the 3 Court says an example is just that, an example. 4 And I don't think we need the argument to 5 prevail, but we would submit that it is at best 6 confusion, it's confusing that the Secretary would take 7 the body of the methodology proposed by Congress, put it 8 in his, in the body of his regulation, and then refer 9 the public to an appendix in order to, how to work the 10 methodology. And in this appendix, he then flips what 11 Congress intended and what he had in the body of his own 12 regulation. 13 I would also suggest that Congress cannot be 14 presumed even in this instance to not be, at least have 15 some input as to what was happening. In the Senate 16 bill, my understanding is that there was a suggestion 17 that the disparity figure would only be 10 percent and 18 not 25 percent. That didn't make it through but the 19 statute as it was written, and I think lasted for about 20 a year or so, had the disparity amount going from 25 21 percent to 20 percent. That was subsequently amended 22 and kept back up at the 25 percent level. So the idea 23 that this was not a bill where Congress paid attention, 24 I think, is not a warranted assumption. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Van Amberg, could a
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 State get to the same result? Let's say your reading of 2 the statute is the only permissible one. By combining 3 school districts, it's no longer going to be the X 4 school district and the Y school district, it will be 5 the XY school district, and then the population would 6 increase. Still only one LEA. 7 MR. VAN AMBERG: There is a provision, 8 Justice Ginsburg, in the Impact Aid Act, and I think 9 it's 7113, in which it basically says that if the 10 Secretary of the Education perceives that a State is 11 manipulating its LEAs in a way in which to take 12 advantage of the, of this limited exception, it can 13 disregard that action. So I think there is built -- I 14 think Congress was one step ahead of us and recognized 15 that possibility and addressed it. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you. 17 MR. VAN AMBERG: Thank you. With that, 18 thank you very much. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 20 The case is submitted. 21 (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the 22 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 23 24 25
