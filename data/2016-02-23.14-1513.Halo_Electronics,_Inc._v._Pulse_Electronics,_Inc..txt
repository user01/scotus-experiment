3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

7             Mr. Wall.

8             ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

9               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10             MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11 please the Court:

12             The Federal Circuit has developed such a 

13 a rigid test for enhanced damages in patent infringement

14 cases that a large number of the worst infringers, even

15 badfaith copiers, are not  are immunized from any

16 enhancement.

17             The Federal Circuit has done that by moving

18 away from historical practice in two key ways.

19             First, it's made the test all about

20 recklessness rather than also intent.

21             Second, it judges recklessness based on

22 legal defenses developed in litigation rather than the

23 facts at the time of the infringement.

24             The net result, now that this Court in

25 Octane and Highmark set aside a similarly artificial

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 test for fees is a oneofitskind, good for

5

2 patentdamagesonly framework that does not track the

3 enhancement statute's text, history, or purposes.

4             It was not always this way.  For nearly 150

5 years, district courts conducted a totality inquiry

6 subject to deferential review.  And as part of that,

7 they said the nature of the infringement has to be more

8 than negligent if it's going to be an aggravating factor

9 that counsels in favor of an enhancement.

10             That 

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is that  is that

12 what you're advocating, to return to that, just as a

13 matter of discretion, for the district court and that's

14 it?

15             MR. WALL:  In a word, yes.  We do think that

16 there are principles to guide district courts'

17 discretion, because historically, district courts said

18 certain things.  But the one agreedupon principle I

19 think we all agree on, or at least Petitioners and the

20 PTO do, is the court said in the totality, if the

21 patentee wants to point to the nature of the

22 infringement and say that pulls you out of the mine run

23 of cases and that warrants an enhancement, it had to be

24 more than negligent.  Had to be intentional or reckless

25 infringement, but based on the facts at the time.

6 1             It was a traditional, willfulness inquiry. 2 It was not the willfulness inquiry that the Federal 3 Circuit conducts, which looks at afterthefact defenses 4 and not what were the facts facing the infringer at the 5 time of its  6             JUSTICE ALITO:  You  you referred to the 7 nature of the infringement.  Is that the only thing 8 that's involved here?  Are any of the Petitioners asking 9 for enhanced damages based on litigation misconduct, for 10 example? 11             MR. WALL:  Well, I think there was some 12 litigation misconduct here, and we cited in the district 13 court's opinion that Zimmer did conceal some things in 14 the run up to trial.  So I think there  there were 15 some other factors.  But I think the major one here, for 16 instance, in Stryker, was the nature of the 17 infringement; that they hired an independent contractor, 18 they handed the contractor a patented product; they 19 said, essentially, Make one of these for us. 20             So  21             JUSTICE ALITO:  We have to decide whether 22 enhanced damages can be awarded solely based on 23 litigation misconduct.  That would seem to be a separate 24 question.  Or you said that the main thing involved is 25 the nature of the infringement.  So what is the issue
Alderson Reporting Company

1 before us?

Official

7

2             MR. WALL:  Yeah.  I  I don't want to say

3 that you have to.  And I want to be careful about

4 litigation misconduct, because in a number of the older

5 cases, it was something like concealment, which was post

6 infringement but prelitigation, so it was a broader

7 category of misconduct.

8             But no.  I think the only reason that we and

9 the PTO have pointed to the compensation cases and the

10 misconduct cases is just to show that for 150 years it

11 was a totality inquiry, and district courts were looking

12 at a lot of different things.

13             These cases are primarily about the nature

14 of the infringement.  Most cases will be like that.  I

15 think if the Court wanted to provide guidance to the

16 Federal Circuit about how to run the statute, it should

17 say go back to doing a totality inquiry, and here's some

18 of the principles that historically guided your exercise

19 of discretion.  But I don't think you have to do that,

20 Justice Alito.

21             MR. WALL:  I think you could 

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is the 

23             MR. WALL:   ordinarily 

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is the nature of

25 the infringement so determinative under your view?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1             Yes, they copied it, but perhaps they had a, 2 you know, goodfaith belief that this wasn't patented. 3 So the fact that they copied it doesn't seem to me to 4 automatically make it something which is suitable for 5 sanctions. 6             MR. WALL:  So the products here were marked. 7 I mean, they were marked as patented.  But I take your 8 point, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think  9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or they could have 10 had, you know, a goodfaith belief that the patent 11 wasn't valid. 12             MR. WALL:  Sure.  And that's exactly 13 historically how cases played out, and it's how they 14 should play out once this Court takes care of Seagate, 15 which is both parties come in at the enhancement stage; 16 most of the evidence has come in on infringement for 17 liability or damages. 18             And the patentee will say, you copied a 19 patented product and haven't shown any evidence that you 20 had a reasonable belief in invalidity. 21             And the defendant, if the patentee has 22 carried its burden, will say, no.  I did some 23 investigation.  I thought I wasn't infringing.  Or I 24 thought it was invalid. 25             And a district court will make a judgment

1 call faced with those competing narratives about what

9

2 the right answer is based on the facts.

3             Our point is that that judgment call that

4 district courts were making for a very long time has

5 essentially been stripped from them because it no longer

6 matters.  Even if you acted intentionally at the time,

7 as Zimmer did, what the Federal Circuit says is, if you

8 can hire good lawyers and come up with defenses in

9 litigation, you'll be off the hook.

10             And as Justice Breyer pointed out in the

11 Octane litigation  and I now know it's true from

12 preparing for this case, you can  a patent lawyer can

13 virtually always come up with some nonfrivolous defense

14 in litigation.  And that's why, in effect, what you have

15 is almost a per se bar.

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  That may be.  But this is

17 my question on this.

18             The statute doesn't say anything.  The

19 statute just says:  In either event, the Court may

20 increase the damages up to three times the amount found

21 or assessed.

22             I don't get too much guidance from that.

23             Let me assume against you, assume against

24 you, that the history does not favor you.  The history

25 insists upon willful.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1             Let me assume with you that there isn't good 2 ground for clear and convincing.  Nothing suggests that. 3             But now, the hardest part for me  and it 4 is hard.  I don't have a clear answer  is there are, 5 indeed, some preliminary in tests.  If, for example, the 6 patentee has a flaw in his patent  not enough to kill 7 it, but enough to make it pretty uncertain, a weak 8 patent.  There are all kinds of things wrong with it. 9 No willfulness damages, irrespective, almost, of the 10 state of mind of the infringer. 11             So what could be said for that?  You've read 12 their excellent briefs on both sides, and you know 13 perfectly well what can be said for that.  And if I 14 summarize it  and that's what I want your answer to. 15 Today's patent world is not a steamengine world.  We 16 have decided to patent tens of thousands of software 17 products and similar things where hardly anyone knows 18 what the patent's really about.  A company that's a 19 startup, a small company, once it gets a letter, cannot 20 afford to pay 10,000 to $100,000 for a letter from 21 Counsel, and may be willing to run its chances. 22             You start saying, little company, you must 23 pay 10,000 to $100,000 to get a letter, lest you get 24 willful damages against you should your bet be wrong. 25             We have one more path leading us to national

11 1 monopoly by Google and Yahoo or their equivalence, and 2 the patent statute is not designed to create monopolies 3 throughout the United States.  It's designed to help the 4 small businessman, not to hurt him.  So leave those 5 words for interpretation to the expert court, and in 6 this area it may well be the Federal Circuit. 7             MR. WALL:  I  8             JUSTICE BREYER:  Have I stated the 9 argument  10             MR. WALL:  I  11             JUSTICE BREYER:   pretty much the way it 12 is? 13             All right.  If I have, I would like your 14 response to it. 15             MR. WALL:  I think you have stated the best 16 possible version of Respondents' argument, and I'm happy 17 with your assumptions.  The PTO embraces them, and we 18 are not living in a steamengine world. 19             It's a high bar to carry, and I don't think 20 patentees are often going to be able to do it.  And what 21 you  you rightly said, I think that is what 22 Respondents have  that's been their strategy in this 23 Court, is that  24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Not just their strategy. 25             MR. WALL:  It's 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  We have all kind of amicus 2 briefs that say that's the truth.  And indeed, thousands 3 and thousands and thousands of small businessmen are 4 trying to break into businesses that they just can't do 5 without software.  And when you have tens or hundreds of 6 thousands of patents on software by other companies, 7 that means we can't break in. 8             MR. WALL:  Justice Breyer, the sky didn't 9 fall for a century and a half, and it's not going to 10 fall if you reverse the Federal Circuit's framework, 11 just as it didn't fall after Octane and Highmark in the 12 fees context. 13             You've got to show as a patentee, you've got 14 to  15             JUSTICE BREYER:  It hasn't fallen.  Go look 16 at the market shares of the different companies that are 17 seriously involved in software. 18             MR. WALL:  Justice Breyer, showing intent or 19 recklessness based on the facts at the time is not going 20 to be easy.  The intent box is copying patented 21 products.  And I don't think we have a lot of dispute, 22 that where people are copying patented products in 23 absence of a reasonable belief in invalidity, it doesn't 24 matter whether they're making softwares  25 software or

2 satisfied 

3             MR. WALL:   carraigeware.

4             JUSTICE BREYER:   with this?  You've just

5 used a word that might help:  "reasonable belief."  We

6 say that where a company is small, where it is small and

7 wants to run the risk, follow the Fed Circuit rule, in

8 order to show willfulness  because it's reasonable 

9 in order to show willfulness, you have to show that that

10 infringer not only didn't know it was faulty, but also

11 was a big company that was pretty used to getting these

12 lawyers' opinions, and also pretty used to asking their

13 own experts whether it really was a good patent or not.

14 And they didn't do it here.  What about something like

15 that?

16             MR. WALL:  Justice Breyer, we tried in

17 opening brief to embrace the full totality of

18 circumstances, including the strength of the patent, the

19 kind of notice, what's commercially reasonable in the

20 industry.

21             The one point I just want to make, because I

22 think it's very important, is to get into the

23 recklessness box at common law, and traditionally, you

24 had to show an objectively high risk.  So as a patentee,

25 you've got to show to the judge, not just that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 infringement occurred, but that a reasonable person

14

2 looking at it would have said there is a very high risk

3 that what I am doing is unlawful because it trenches on

4 someone else's valid patent.

5             That's a pretty high bar.  You're not going

6 to be able to satisfy that.  You shouldn't be able to

7 satisfy that in a lot of cases.

8             I think the strength of the PTO's argument

9 is when you can show that, the district court should be

10 able to make a judgment call about enhancement.  And the

11 fact that it can't shows you that you've really skewed

12 the incentives.  Because on the other side of the parade

13 of horribles you're worried about are the people who can

14 infringe, knowing that they can discount by the

15 probability that they'll be found to have infringed in

16 litigation with virtually no backend penalty, even if

17 they were a very bad infringer, as Zimmer was here.

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Tell me how you

19 articulate this.  And I ask because the SG is talking

20 about describing it as egregious conduct.

21             You're saying something about willfulness

22 and recklessness.  And I don't know if this is all a

23 matter of semantics, but I think the SG is right.  Even

24 if you give discretion to the district courts to make a

25 judgment of when to enhance penalties, we have to give

Alderson Reporting Company

1 them some guidance.

Official

15

2             MR. WALL:  Yes.

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It can't be that they

4 can give enhanced penalties on whim.

5             MR. WALL:  That's right.

6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  So if it's

7 not whim, what is it?  How do we articulate a test that

8 protects what Justice Breyer is concerned about, which I

9 think is a legitimate concern, but doesn't entrench a

10 position that just favors you?

11             MR. WALL:  No.  No, I 

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And by that, I mean, you

13 know 

14             MR. WALL:  Right.

15             No, I think there's a little bit of daylight

16 between us and the government, in the sense that we

17 think the statute was invoked for various purposes and

18 not just to punish infringement.  But to the extent that

19 you invoke the statute to punish infringement, I think

20 there is no daylight between our position and the

21 government's.

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do 

23             MR. WALL:  And I think what you can say 

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Help me 

25             MR. WALL:   that the guidance is, in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 lion's share of cases, what the parties are really

16

2 debating is the nature of the infringement.  That needs

3 to be intentional or reckless based on the facts as they

4 were known to the infringer.  And as part of whether the

5 infringer 

6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but that  that 

7             MR. WALL:   is acting 

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   you know, that these

9 tests understands life a little  is more 

10             MR. WALL:  Sure.

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   complex than that.

12 Okay?  Because you can often use the conduct of someone,

13 after the time, to reflect what they thought.  And so if

14 you're seeing that someone is withholding information,

15 you might be able to infer that there wasn't good faith

16 at the beginning.

17             MR. WALL:  Sure.

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your articulation

19 doesn't really give life to the complexity of this

20 inquiry.

21             MR. WALL:  So  and to add, then, a little

22 more, I think what you ought to be taking into account

23 is, for instance, the strength of the notice.  Some of

24 these letters are just form letters.  They really are

25 nothing more than a license.

Alderson Reporting Company

1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is all the Read

17

2 Corporation factors that the district court here did in

3 the Stryker case.

4             MR. WALL:  I think that's right.  I think

5 some of them will matter more than others.  But some

6 claim letters are very fulsome.  They have a 

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's very nice, but I

8 don't want to adopt that test.  How do I articulate this

9 in a more generalized way?

10             MR. WALL:  I think what you would say is

11 that in judging whether a reasonable person would have

12 thought that there was a really high risk, you've got to

13 take account of both the strength of the notice, what

14 kind of notice were they on of the patent, and what

15 would have been commercially reasonable in the industry

16 as it exists.  And I think that  those factors and

17 those limitations are going to take account of the vast

18 bulk of what Justice Breyer and what Respondents are 

19 are concerned about.

20             JUSTICE ALITO:  Are courts going to be able

21 to assess the state of mind of the infringer at the time

22 of the infringer's conduct without getting into

23 communications with the  with the company's attorneys?

24             MR. WALL:  Yes, Justice Alito, and they did

25 historically.  And I mean, I would  I would point the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Court to a case like Consolidated Rubber and Judge

18

2 Learned Hand's opinion.  He said, look, you know, the

3 patent was open to doubt for a period of time, and so no

4 enhancement.  But at some point here, the facts changed

5 and the infringer knew about them.  It reasonably should

6 have known the patent was valid.  We start the

7 enhancement running, and then we get some misconduct on

8 the back end like we had in this case.  And so he says,

9 I'm rolling it all in.  This was more than negligent,

10 and here's the enhancement I'm going to give.

11             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this  you see, you

12 had the case where at the time when the  the question

13 of enhanced damages is decided, the judge can see that

14 the defense was able to  with the help of good

15 lawyers, was able to put on an objectively reasonable,

16 although unsuccessful, defense.  How are you going to be

17 able to show that the infringer did not have that same

18 information at the time of the conduct in question?

19             MR. WALL:  Well, I think in the typical 

20 the  the intent cases are  are fairly easy because

21 they're generally copying.  I think in the typical

22 recklessness case, the infringer will come in and say,

23 here's the fulsome claim letter I sent you.  It's

24 actually got a claim chart.  It maps on the infringement

25 to the patent.  I reached out to you.  You never

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 responded and you continued to infringe.

19

2             And I think at that point, then, the

3 defendant has got to say, okay, I did something, but it

4 isn't in talking to a lawyer.  I talked to my engineers.

5 I looked at the  the specifications in the patent.

6 You're  you're limited to devices with four wheels,

7 and I have three.  I think there are lots of things that

8 are commercially reasonable depending on the

9 circumstances, and I honestly do think if you  if you

10 go back and look through the cases historically, that's

11 what good judges and courts were doing for a long time

12 before the Federal Circuit essentially stripped

13 discretion from them, and having taken the bar too low

14 in Underwater Devices overcompensated in Seagate.  We

15 think the bar ought to be high.  We just don't think it

16 ought to be arbitrarily high as it is now.

17             If I could reserve the rest of my time.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

20              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ

21           FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

22                 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

23             MR. MARTINEZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

24 please the Court:

25             We agree with the Federal Circuit and with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
20 1 all the parties to this case that mere negligence is not 2 enough to trigger enhanced damages.  But the 3 Federal Circuit is wrong to categorically bar such 4 damages whenever an infringer presents an objectively 5 reasonable defense at trial.  That role creates an 6 arbitrary loophole that allows some of the most 7 egregious infringers to escape enhanced damages. 8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The enhanced damages that 9 we're discussing really is almost entirely punitive if 10 the octane standard for attorneys' fees remains in 11 effect.  In other words, an octane standard is  gives 12 a judge much more latitude to impose  to award 13 attorneys' fees when there's been unnecessary 14 resistance.  So all we're talking about is punitive 15 damages. 16             MR. MARTINEZ:  I  I  17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you  and you want to 18 just basically dismantle the willfulness structure that 19 the court of appeals has established; is that correct? 20             MR. MARTINEZ:  No.  I think that's not 21 correct.  I think the Federal Circuit, in our view, took 22 the law in a good direction or a better direction when 23 it reversed its Underwater Devices standard which it 24 said was akin to negligence, and it tried to tighten the 25 law versus  about willfulness up to make it harder to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 get enhanced damages.

21

2             We think that was a step in the right

3 direction, but we think that they made two important

4 mistakes when they did that.  The first one is

5 essentially that they said that in a case where you have

6 subjective intent, that, in and of itself, is not enough

7 to establish a case for enhanced damages.  Essentially

8 that you have to prove recklessness under an objective

9 standard in each and every case.

10             We don't think that's consistent with the

11 history of the statute, with the purpose of the statute,

12 with the way punitive damages have  have always been

13 considered, with the way willfulness has always been

14 interpreted.  So we think that's wrong.

15             The second mistake we think that the

16 Federal Circuit made is with respect to how the

17 recklessness inquiry is supposed to happen.  So

18 recklessness, everyone agrees, is an objective inquiry.

19 And in every other area of law where courts are

20 conducting an objective inquiry, what you  what you're

21 supposed to do is you're supposed to take a reasonable

22 man, and you put him in the  the actual person who is

23 accused of wrongdoing, in his shoes.  And you take what

24 that actual person knew, and you figure out whether a

25 reasonable man in that person's shoes would have thought

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that there was a very high risk that the conduct at

22

2 issue was unlawful.

3             And what the Federal Circuit does is not

4 that.  What they are essentially doing is taking the

5 reasonable man and giving him the benefit of

6 omniscience, giving him the benefit of hindsight and

7 saying, what facts do we know at the time of trial?  And

8 now that we know these facts at the time of trial,

9 should we retroactively sort of 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't think they were

11 doing that.  I thought what they were doing was saying,

12 we are not going to allow punitive damages in a case

13 where the patent is so weak.  And so we're really not

14 looking at state of mind.

15             And the reason that we're doing that is the

16 reason I said previously.  And the reason that we're not

17 leaving it up to 475 trial judges is because those 475

18 trial judges don't see patent cases very much.  And

19 where they have a pretty good idea of how employment

20 law, tort law, and all kinds of other law works, they

21 don't have that, a good idea in respect to patent law.

22             And we, the Federal Circuit, do.  That's why

23 we are created.  And we are afraid that if we do not use

24 this objective standard, what we will see is a major

25 effect discouraging invention because of fear that if we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 try to invent, we'll get one of these letters and we

23

2 can't afford $100,000 for an opinion.

3             Now, I've just repeated the same argument.

4 But we did create the government, that expert court to

5 make such determinations in the face of language that

6 seems to allow it, and so what is wrong with they're

7 doing what they were paid to do?

8             MR. MARTINEZ:  I think there are  there

9 are a couple things that are wrong with  with that.

10 Because I think the first thing that they're paid to do

11 is to look to the text and history of the statute.  And

12 the text is  as you said, doesn't provide a

13 categorical  is silent.  It doesn't provide the kind

14 of categorical bar that the Federal Circuit is asking

15 for.

16             And the history of the statute affirmatively

17 undermines that categorical bar because the history

18 makes clear that subjective bad intent, the  the

19 wanton and malicious pirate that this Court talked about

20 in the Seymour case, that is a sufficient basis to

21 enhance damages.

22             With respect to the recklessness standard,

23 the fact that  that recklessness is objective, we all

24 agree with that.  But there's no reason to conduct the

25 objective analysis in a different way in this context

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 from the way that it's conducted in every other context. 2             And imagine a police search.  A police 3 search  4             JUSTICE BREYER:  But I just gave you the 5 reason.  Now, you can say that you don't agree with that 6 reason and give me a reason why it's wrong, but just to 7 say it's no reason is disturbing. 8             MR. MARTINEZ:  Well, I think  I think that 9 the reason you gave is that  I think, of concern that 10 we share, which is that we think it's important in cases 11 where a patent is of questionable validity.  We think 12 it's important to encourage people in certain cases to 13 challenge the patent or to make sure that innovation is 14 not being stifled.  And we think that the ordinary 15 standard test for recklessness in our test accommodates 16 that concern because it would treat a reasonable 17 goodfaith belief that a patent is invalid or that 18 infringement is not occurring as a reason to conclude 19 that enhanced damages are off the table. 20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As I read your brief 21 and the Petitioner's brief, I got the sense that there 22 was quite a bit of difference between the two.  The 23 government seems to be taking a much higher standard 24 before these punitive damages, or however you want to 25 describe them, would be allowed.  You use terms like
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 "egregious" a lot.  Your friend uses terms like, you

25

2 know, "intentional," more than mere negligence.  Is that

3 perception  do you think that perception is an

4 accurate one?

5             MR. MARTINEZ:  I think there's some minor

6 differences.  Let me explain how we see our standard and

7 maybe what the differences are.

8             We think our standard covers three different

9 buckets of cases.  The first bucket  and this is borne

10 out by the history  the first bucket are cases in

11 which there's intentional conduct or badfaith conduct

12 under a subjective standard, a subjective analysis.

13 That's bucket number one.  But 

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just a  for one

15 just brief moment.  By "intentional," you mean

16 intentional infringement, not intentional 

17             MR. MARTINEZ:  No.  Intentional conduct by a

18 person who believes that he is infringing a valid

19 patent.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.

21             MR. MARTINEZ:  In other words, if you have a

22 goodfaith belief that the patent is not valid and that

23 belief's reasonable, we don't think you're an

24 intentional infringer.

25             The  the second bucket covers recklessness

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1 cases.  And we all agree that recklessness is judged by 2 an objective standard.  Where we disagree with the other 3 side is we think it's judged based on the facts and the 4 circumstances that are known to the actual infringer at 5 the time of infringement. 6             And then the third bucket that we think 7 is  would qualify for enhanced damages are cases 8 involving other types of egregious misconduct not having 9 to do with the infringement itself.  For example, if 10 there's corporate espionage, if one of the parties 11 destroyed evidence. 12             I think the difference between us and 13 Petitioner is very minor.  I think they would also allow 14 enhanced damages for certain purely compensatory 15 purposes, even when a case did not fall into the other 16 three buckets. 17             We  we can have a  a interesting 18 historical discussion about whether or not that  that 19 basis for damages is warranted or not.  I don't think 20 the Court needs to resolve that in this case, because 21 it's not presented.  But we do think our test is limited 22 to those three buckets:  Essentially, intentional 23 conduct, reckless conduct, and other types of egregious 24 litigation misconduct. 25             We think that  that that test is 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That avoids the use of 2 the word "willfulness." 3             MR. MARTINEZ:  Excuse me? 4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That avoids the use of 5 the word "willfulness." 6             MR. MARTINEZ:  Right.  And I think  we 7 think there is  8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the bucket is there. 9             MR. MARTINEZ:  There's a sort of semantic 10 element to this case.  I think if you wanted to use 11 that  those three buckets to encompass willfulness, I 12 think we wouldn't stand in the way of that.  I think the 13 problem that we see with what the Respondents are trying 14 to do is that they're looking to the history, the 15 pre1952 cases, and they're taking the word "willful" 16 out of that.  They're plucking that word out, and then 17 they're defining it in a way that's at odds with the way 18 in which willfulness or the way in which the standard 19 was applied before 1952. 20             We think if  if history is the 21 justification for imposing a willfulness requirement in 22 the first place, history has to provide the guide for 23 interpreting what willfulness means or what the standard 24 is. 25             And I think that  that one of the ironies
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of the Respondents' position is that they agree that

28

2 this statute is  Section 284 is trying to get at

3 culpable infringers.  It's  the touchstone is

4 culpability.

5             And they agree that recklessness is culpable

6 enough to get you into enhanced damages world.  And yet,

7 everyone agrees, everyone in the civil law and the

8 criminal law, intentional misconduct has always been

9 considered worse than reckless conduct.  And yet, their

10 test would allow a class of intentional infringers to

11 essentially get out of jail free based on their ability

12 to hire a lawyer and come up with a  a post hoc

13 defense and present that defense at trial.

14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why isn't that post hoc

16 defense necessarily  you're almost reading it as

17 unreasonable, by definition.

18             MR. MARTINEZ:  I think it's possible to

19 imagine  let me  let me make it concrete.

20             Imagine a case in which there's intentional

21 violation or a reckless violation based on the facts

22 known at the time.  And later the  the person is sued,

23 the infringer is sued, and he hires a law firm that

24 scours the world, and they find the library in Germany

25 that has a Ph.D. dissertation that has some patents that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 arguably anticipated the invention at issue.  So that's 2 a new fact.  It wasn't in anyone's head.  No one was 3 aware of it at the time the infringement occurred. 4             And maybe that law firm then puts together a 5 reasonable but wrong theory under which the patent is 6 invalid in light of that prior art.  We think that's a 7 case in which the  the conduct was culpable at the 8 time of  of infringement, and we think that's a case 9 that would warrant enhanced damages. 10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan, did 11 you have a question? 12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask:  If you were 13 doing this just on policy  very odd, but you know, we 14 have a text that everybody's off of at this point. 15 And  and maybe some viewed that what happened in 1952, 16 for some of the reasons that Justice Breyer gave, is 17 perhaps not the most relevant thing.  If you were doing 18 it just on policy, would you come up with this same 19 test? 20             MR. MARTINEZ:  Yes.  We would, and the PTO 21 would.  We think that the  the policy concern that 22 Congress had in mind of ensuring deterrents and 23 punishment is  outweighs some of the considerations 24 that have been raised by Justice Breyer and others. 25             As long as we realize that as long as you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1 have a goodfaith and reasonable defense, that will be a 2 defense to liability.  And as long as we realize that 3 you need to have the kind of intentional or reckless 4 conduct that  you know, it's a very high standard  5 you need to have that kind of conduct in order to 6 warrant enhanced damages. 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 8             Mr. Phillips. 9            ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 10               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 11             MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 12 and may it please the Court: 13             Before I get into the substance of my 14 argument, one point that seems to me to cry out, at 15 least in response to the characterizations by my  from 16 Mr. Wall where he repeatedly described Zimmer's conduct 17 as copying the invention in this case, what  what the 18 Zimmer Corporation copied was the product itself. 19 The  the patent wasn't released or issued until two 20 years of that initial copying. 21             There's nothing inherently wrong with 22 finding that a competitor has built a new product, not 23 know anything about the patents or any patentability, no 24 evidence of any patents, and think you're going to copy 25 it 
Alderson Reporting Company

31 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought you 2 said  3             MR.

PHILLIPS:  After 2000, it was marked. 8 But the  but the actions taken by Zimmer at the time 9 were 1998, two years before the patent even issued.  I 10 just want to clarify that. 11             I also want to go back to the point that  12 that  13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There had been a patent 14 application, though? 15             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But there was no 16 evidence whatsoever that  that Zimmer at that time had 17 any knowledge of anything in the patent  in the  18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Doesn't the 19 statute exempt out enhanced damages for pending 20 applications? 21             MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, it does. 22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why are you here? 23             MR. PHILLIPS:  If  no, no, no.  It's  24 all I'm suggesting is that  that it's a 25 mischaracterization of the  of the facts to say that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1 this involves purely copying, beginning from the very 2 outset of the process. 3             That's not to say that there couldn't be an 4 argument somewhere along the line that they  that 5 there  there might have been an argument of 6 willfulness.  But this is not a classic copying case.  I 7 mean, in a lot of ways this case comes down to sort of 8 trolls versus pirates in terms of how you want to 9 analyze it.  And our view is  and  and I thought the 10 example that the Solicitor General's office just offered 11 you tells you everything you should know about this. 12             His  his criticism is that a good lawyer 13 is hired and goes off and searches in the German 14 libraries and finds some basis upon which to challenge 15 legitimately the validity of that patent. 16             Now, if it had turned out that in those 17 German sources they had, in fact, demonstrated that that 18 patent was invalid, the position of the world would be 19 that's great, because this patent should be declared 20 invalid and the monopoly that attaches to it should be 21 declared null and void and unenforceable. 22             The fact that they found it and it turns out 23 not to get you over the hump shouldn't be, by any 24 stretch of the imagination, lead to a  to a standard 25 of the law that discourages us from going out and trying
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 to find both the limits of the metes and bounds of the 2 patent itself as  as defined by the  by the patent 3 holder, and to challenge the invalidity of those patents 4 under all circumstances. 5             And Justice Breyer, I mean, that goes to the 6 core point that you were making.  We're not talking 7 about a situation here where it's obvious when something 8 is infringed.  There are thousands of patents, hundreds 9 of thousands of patents.  There are lots of entities 10 creating new products every day, new services, if you 11 want to go beyond the products and the patent law, 12 and  13             JUSTICE BREYER:  My empirical information  14 I mean my empirical information  ha, ha, ha, laughs 15 slightly  is  is coming out of the briefs, which you 16 do have to admit has an interest. 17             The  the  I have  I have assumed, and 18 is there stuff that I could look at to back this up  19 that in a world of patent and copyright protection, I 20 think it's unfortunate that Congress hasn't passed a 21 special regime for those kinds of patents, but they 22 haven't. 23             In that such  in that a world like that, 24 we're seeing more and more companies that have more and 25 more, and continuously more patents.  And if all that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 happens is you send a letter to somebody who has

34

2 something that's trying to break into the industry, and

3 they don't have enough money to hire many lawyers, that

4 becomes a serious barrier, and that the government's

5 rule in your view, and the opponent's rule in your view,

6 will raise those barriers to entry.

7             Now, that's a very elementary kind of

8 assumption.  And I do admit it's supported by the briefs

9 on your side.

10             And is there anything you would refer me to

11 that would suggest that maybe I have a point, and your

12 briefs have a point?

13             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the  the briefs that

14 I thought were particularly effective, Justice Breyer,

15 are the amicus brief of public knowledge and 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course.  I've looked

17 through them, and I understand they're effective.  I

18 just feel a little bit more comfortable when I can read

19 something that isn't participating in the litigation,

20 and it, too, bears out this view.

21             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, Professor Lumley has

22 written on the subject repeatedly, and he 

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  Lumley has also said quite

24 a lot that he's worried about lawyers coming in and

25 inventing various things that make the patent look weak

1 after the event.  You see?  I mean, he 

35

2             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But 

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  He is not totally with you

4 on this.

5             MR. PHILLIPS:  But there are  but there

6 are two separate issues here.  Let's  so, and I'll

7 take those in turn.

8             The first one is, is there empirical

9 evidence that there is a significant amount of activity

10 out there in which patents are asserted in  in more or

11 less specific ways.  You'll recall the example given

12 by  by my friend was you receive a letter that

13 identifies the precise claims, identifies exactly how

14 you infringe it, and it's ignored.  Well, I can assure

15 you, that is not the standard letter, and that's not the

16 kind of letters that are involved in this case.

17             The letter we got said, we have patents,

18 would you like to  would you like to pay a royalty for

19 those patents.  It didn't identify the claims.  It

20 didn't tell us anything about them.  We handed them to

21 an engineer.  The engineer looked at them and said, "It

22 looks the same as the product we're already producing."

23 Put it aside.  We went forward with it, and we find out

24 later we 

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there a way of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 compromising this in this way?  To say to the circuit, 2 we see your point.  Okay?  And by and large, we accept 3 it, but there can be very big companies that make a 4 habit of getting those letters and giving the things to 5 engineers, as we saw right now in this case.  And where 6 something like that goes on normally, then a refusal 7 deliberately to do it for fear it comes back with the 8 wrong answer.  Or you do do it and you get the wrong 9 answer and you go ahead anyway. 10             That may be worth willful damages even 11 though, in fact, there was a slight flaw with this 12 patent. 13             MR. PHILLIPS:  Justice Breyer  14             JUSTICE BREYER:  What about that?  Giving 15 them some leeway around the edges? 16             MR. PHILLIPS:  Justice Breyer, I understand 17 the desire to always be in a position where you can sort 18 of catch that one party that's out there, and I think 19 the real issue there is twofold.  One is, is it worth 20 the candle to go  I mean, you really need to go find 21 that one  22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, leave it to the 23 circuit to decide. 24             MR.

37 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I have  they have 2 that squarely facing them, where they had  where 3 they  and they did?  Did they have that issue that  4             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, they had the 5 facts in this case where the  where if  if you  if 6 you accept, obviously, the plaintiffs' version of it, 7 there  there was a fair amount of information  8             JUSTICE BREYER:  And your other point.  You 9 were just about to make a second point.  Do  do you 10 remember?  See, for one thing it's easy  it was a good 11 point, too. 12             (Laughter.) 13             MR. PHILLIPS:  I always  I always 14 appreciate it when you anticipate I'm going to make a 15 good point before I make the good point, but  16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Phillips, I  I  17 there's a whole lot of worry articulated by 18 Justice Breyer and reflected in your briefs about 19 protecting innovation. 20             MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, Your Honor. 21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there's not a whole 22 lot of worry about protecting the patent owner.  I can't 23 forget that historically enhanced damages were 24 automatic, and they were automatic because of a policy 25 judgment that owning a patent entitled you to not have

1 people infringe willfully or not willfully.  And I

38

2 accept that at some point there was a different judgment

3 made that  that goodfaith infringers should be

4 treated differently than other infringers, willful

5 infringers.

6             But I don't know that that swung things so

7 far the other way that it can only be that, if you come

8 up with something, any defense whatsoever in the

9 litigation that's not frivolous, that that gets you out

10 of enhanced damages.

11             MR. PHILLIPS:  But let me just say 

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If I'm there 

13             MR. PHILLIPS:   I think that  but I

14 guess 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If I'm there 

16             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   and I don't think

18 that the Seagate test is  is  is appropriate but I

19 am still in the balance of how do we get 

20             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   a similar protection

22 without an artificial test that I don't think is

23 right 

24             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   where  where do I

1 go?

39

2             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, let  let me at least

3 correct one portion of the statement because you said

4 that  enough to put forward that it's not frivolous.

5 I  I don't think that's the appropriate standard.

6             Objective reasonableness is the requirement

7 that the Federal Circuit has looked at, and I think

8 that's more than simply the ability to satisfy Rule 11.

9 I think there has to be a substantial defense.  And

10 substantial defenses were put forward in both of these

11 cases.  Indeed these were, in both instances, close

12 cases.  So I would hope that that's where the Court

13 would  would focus its attention.

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the different

15 court called it differently in the second case.

16             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But again, I think

17 it's important to look at the  the way the court of

18 appeals analyzed it.  And the reality is I think if

19 you  and it's the reason why you have to have an

20 experienced, an expert court of appeals looking at these

21 issues on an objective  on the  on the basis of an

22 objective analysis because they are the ones who have

23 seen these kinds of claimconstruction issues, have seen

24 these kinds of infringement issues.  They're in the best

25 position to be able to say, this is objectively

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 reasonable and, therefore, not something on which

40

2 enhanced damages should be added.

3             What I think it's important to put in

4 context, because you're going through the history of

5 this, is to  is, again, to look at the difference

6 between Section 284 as it evolved and the  and the

7 meaning of Section 285.

8             I mean, this Court last term said

9 Section 285 has now  has now  it's not essential or

10 effective.  It has completely made the enhanced damages

11 purely punitive because every other piece of conduct

12 goes into the portion that talks about whether you get

13 the attorneys' fees.

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you are 

15             MR. PHILLIPS:  That's what makes an

16 extraordinary case.

17             Yes, Your Honor.  I'm sorry.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We are, after all,

19 dealing with statutory language.  And I'm not sure it's

20 been quoted yet.  It says, "The Court may increase the

21 damages up to three times the amount found or assessed."

22 Period.

23             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And yet the Federal

25 Circuit standard, you've got  you know, you've got

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 heightened burdens of proof, particularly articulated. 2 I mean, the way we  the  courts have been used to 3 dealing with discretionary standards for a long time. 4 And the way it works is, historically, you know, the 5 exercise of discretion in a lot of cases that, you know, 6 wears a channel which kind of confines the exercise of 7 discretion.  And I think the other side's argument is 8 based on that history. 9             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And  10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Over time, this is 11 what discretion has  has given us in this area, and 12 therefore, you get beyond that, it's an abuse.  But to 13 erect this fairly elaborate standard on the basis of 14 that language I think is surprising. 15             MR. PHILLIPS:  I  I  I understand that, 16 and that's why I think you have to take it one step at a 17 time. 18             First of all, you  you quoted one portion 19 of the language of  of 284.  The portion that I focus 20 on particularly is the  you begin with damages 21 adequate to compensate for the infringement.  So the  22 284 is now  and, you know, since 1952, has been 23 focused exclusively on the infringement.  It's not any 24 other kind of ancillary conduct.  It's only enhanced 25 damages for the infringement because those are the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 only  you know, that  those damages are one and the 2 same. 3             Then you get to the point where Seagate 4 says, if we don't have a strong enough standard of 5 recklessness and willfulness and an objective standard 6 that can be examined by us independently, the downside 7 risks and the harm to the economy is  is very 8 substantial.  There have been  there are huge numbers 9 of these letters being sent, litigation.  It skews every 10 aspect of it. 11             And then Congress comes back in the America 12 Invents Act, and through the process leading up to the 13 America Invents Act, Seagate comes into being, and  14 and the  and the Federal Circuit takes a very hard 15 look at it. 16             Congress looks at that and says, we're not 17 going to change Section 284 because, in light of 18 Seagate, that willfulness standard, which is the 19 standard the Court was very explicit about, that helped 20 solve the problem that all of us had been concerned 21 about. 22             The Congress didn't just leave it at  at 23 where you have to infer this from silence or inaction by 24 Congress.  Congress passed the Section 298.  And in 25 Section 298 it talks about opinions of counsel and what
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 role they play in the willfulness determination.

43

2             It seems to me, in order to give Section 298

3 any significant meaning, you have to have concluded,

4 then, that 284 necessarily incorporates a standard of

5 willfulness even though, obviously, it's not in the

6 language, but that's 

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I don't know how far

8 that gets you, Mr. Phillips, because Mr. Martinez just

9 told us that he'd be happy to call willfulness his test.

10             And willfulness has meant different things

11 to different people here.

12             MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.

13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And there's nothing that

14 Congress did that suggests that, when it used that word

15 "willfulness," it really meant the Seagate test.

16             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the only test in front

17 of it at the point  at that point in time was Seagate

18 because Seagate was the definition of what 284 was about

19 and what the standard of willfulness was about.

20             But I think what's equally important,

21 Justice Kagan, is  I'll  I'll concede that

22 willfulness can have a lot of different meanings, but

23 the meaning that the Seagate court adopted was the 

24 was the meaning this Court adopted in Safeco.  And it's

25 interesting because my friends did not  didn't say the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 word "Safeco" at all in their 25 minutes of

44

2 presentation.

3             But  and this is why it's not such a big

4 jump, Mr. Chief Justice, because what  what Seagate

5 said is what's  what's the best source for trying to

6 come up with a sensible way of applying willfulness?

7 And  and they looked at Safeco, and they said, you

8 know, the  the best way to do it is with a

9 recklessness standard.  That's an objective

10 determination.  And the fact that there may be

11 subjective, bad  bad intent is off the table.  I mean,

12 that's footnote 20 of the Safeco opinion, and the Court

13 said 

14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we  can we 

15             MR. PHILLIPS:   that's the best way to

16 enforce this statute.

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we at least peel off

18 the clear and convincing evidence that seems to come out

19 of nowhere and the  the  the standard is de novo

20 review rather than abuse of discretion?

21             MR. PHILLIPS:  I would  I would

22 desperately ask you not to take out de novo review

23 because it  we're talking about an objective standard;

24 it's really almost  it's essentially a question of

25 law.  The issue is, is there an objectively reasonable

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 basis for what's been done here?  I don't believe that's 2 a  that's a  3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But  4             MR. PHILLIPS:   standard that you can 5 deferentially  6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   how about clear and 7 convincing evidence?  You've been  8             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the  the clear and 9 convincing standard, I don't think is  is  is 10 particularly relevant to the  how this case got 11 decided.  Because at the end of the day, it's not 12 because it was clear and convincing.  At the end of the 13 day, it was because there was objectively reasonable 14 defenses that were put forward in both of these cases. 15             In a proper case, obviously you  you'd 16 have to fight that fight.  The only thing I can say  17 well, that's not the only thing.  There's two things you 18 can say in defense of clear and convincing.  First, it 19 was in existence in 1985.  Congress passed The America 20 Invents Act, didn't modify it, and so may have, in that 21 sense, either acquiesced or ratified it under those 22 circumstances. 23             And second, we're talking about punitive 24 damages.  And therefore, under normal circumstances, 25 it's certainly not a matter of indifference when you're
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 talking about allowing a plaintiff to go forward and  2 and just skew completely the entire litigation process 3 as a consequence of having access to treble damages.  In 4 that context, some heightened standard might make sense. 5 In this context, it's hard for me to get excited about 6 it one way or the other, because these are not really 7 factual questions.  If you were in a subjective intent 8 standard, that would be a different issue. 9             In the context of objective  10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you can't have abuse 11 of discretion. 12             MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry? 13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You  you care about 14 de novo review in the Federal Circuit rather than 15 testing the district court's determination for abuse of 16 discretion. 17             MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  I 18 think it is critical  there are two elements of this 19 that are absolutely critical.  And I suppose, in some 20 ways, it goes to the question you asked, 21 Justice Sotomayor.  What are you  what are the 22 absolute critical elements that you need to take out of 23 Seagate to apply in these cases?  And candidly, both 24 would lead you to affirm in both instances on the facts 25 of these cases.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             One, you need to have an objective

47

2 assessment of whether or not there is a reasonably

3 objective set of circumstances that allow the defendant

4 to say this  either these patents are invalid, or we

5 do not infringe those patents.

6             And two, you have to have that reviewed

7 nondeferentially by the Federal Circuit in order to

8 ensure that the 500 or 400  I forget how many district

9 court judges there are  do not sort of go off on a

10 tangent and  and that we get the consistent review by

11 the objective and expert body that the Federal Circuit

12 is.

13             JUSTICE ALITO:  The recklessness decision

14 here seems different from those that generally come up.

15 But maybe you can provide an example where this occurs

16 outside of this context.

17             Usually, to determine whether someone was

18 reckless, you have to assess the  the nature of the

19 risk, the severity of the risk.  And in the typical tort

20 case, the severity of the risk may seem greater at the

21 time of trial than it did at the time of the

22 tortfeasor's action, because someone has been harmed.

23 But in this situation, the  the degree of the risk

24 seems smaller at the time of the determination of

25 enhanced damages than it may have been at the time of 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1 of the infringement.  And I can't think of another  2 because it's a legal risk.  And the first determination 3 may not have been made with the assistance or very 4 intense analysis by attorneys, and then the latter time, 5 the attorneys are very much involved. 6             Is there any other situation where a 7 recklessness determination has those characteristics? 8             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think  I think the 9 copyright would probably be the other one that sort of 10 attends to it in the same way, because it's essentially 11 the same kind of an inquiry.  I mean, part of the 12 problem is it's the nature of the continuing tort 13 action, and it's also the fact that the infringement 14 determination is  is a matter of strict liability. 15 So  but, you know, there are a thousand obviously 16 different ways of  different situations that can 17 arise. 18             But, you know, if you're in a situation 19 where you've  you've come out with a product, you 20 think it's a perfectly good product.  You may or may not 21 have been looking at patents.  You didn't see anything 22 that creates a problem for it.  You  you put the  23 you put it in the market.  Two, three years later 24 somebody sends you a letter.  And then  and the letter 25 is not very specific.  Maybe  and then  so you say,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 I don't  I don't see anything here.  I don't envision 2 a problem.  You keep going forward.  You get  and then 3 you get a very specific letter.  And you look at that, 4 and you say, well, gee, okay.  I see that. 5             I mean, part of the problem with the notion 6 of looking at these things and saying we're not going to 7 have a post hoc analysis is it's almost impossible to 8 define post hoc from win. 9             JUSTICE BREYER:  How does it work in tort 10 law? 11             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, in tort law  12             JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, you can imagine 13 situations where when the actor takes a risk, it looks 14 tremendously great.  But by the time trial is over, it 15 was pretty small.  It happened, but, you know, the 16 eggshell skull.  He thought almost certainly he had one. 17 And he did, but the chances of his having one were a 18 million to one against it.  Punitives, how does the 19 reckless  do you have any idea? 20             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, you take  I mean, 21 obviously, you take the  the plaintiff as you  22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  But it turns out as 23 you found it, it wasn't very bad.  And what you thought 24 you were going to find, then, was just terrible.  This 25 must come up.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but I  my guess is 2 in those circumstances, Justice Breyer, there aren't 3 punitive damages. 4             JUSTICE BREYER:  There are? 5             MR. PHILLIPS:  There are not, because  6             JUSTICE BREYER:  There are not. 7             MR. PHILLIPS:   normally act reasonably 8 on  9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then we would have 10 a  an analogy on your side, because the other way, it 11 would be an analogy on the other side. 12             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, let my friend on the 13 other side come forward with tort cases in which the 14 eggshell plaintiff gets punitive damages because the 15 defendant overreacted. 16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there any way to allow 17 some consideration for a subjective intent to infringe 18 in an egregious case, as an additional element for  as 19 an additional way to define willfulness without 20 completely wrecking the Seagate standard? 21             MR. PHILLIPS:  I  I think if you  if you 22 are in a situation where you're past recklessness, that 23 is, there is no defense, there's no objective, they have 24 no  you know, this is a true pirate.  No objectively 25 reasonable argument.  They  they saw the product; they
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1 built it.  Maybe they don't operate within the United 2 States.  They just sell here.  They operate outside the 3 United States, think they'll never get caught, et 4 cetera.  And in those circumstances, they don't have a 5 defense.  And then you also can prove that they acted 6 with absolute intent and knowledge of the patent, et 7 cetera, you know, then the question  would you take 8 that to the  to the max, to three times?  Because 9 that's where the discretion lies in this report. 10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  But take a case 11 where  take a case where there's somebody who 12 absolutely wants to copy a product.  He says, 13 Mr. Jones  14             MR. PHILLIPS:  Copy a product or copy a 15 patent? 16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  A patented product. 17             MR. PHILLIPS:  Okay. 18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  All right?  So same thing, 19 let's call it. 20             Mr. Jones sells a product that involves a 21 patent, and it's selling very well.  And Mr. Smith comes 22 along and says I want to copy that patent and that 23 product and sell the same thing so that I can reap those 24 profits too, and  and does that. 25             Now, the Seagate's test says that as long as
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1 his lawyer can come along at the end and raise some kind 2 of doubt about the patent's validity, the fact that  I 3 forget whether it was Mr. Smith or Mr. Jones  but the 4 fact that  5             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, one of them. 6             (Laughter.) 7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  The fact that he went and 8 said I am going to copy this patent so that I can reap 9 the benefits of some other person's work, that doesn't 10 make a difference.  And that's, I think, the question 11 that Justice Kennedy was asking.  It seems to stick in 12 the craw a bit. 13             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Well, one answer to 14 Justice Kennedy is there is a role for that kind of 15 subjective bad faith, but it's only after you make the 16 determination that  17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  But that's not 18 enough.  Because, you know, if I'm Mr. Jones and I'm 19 saying is it worth my while to go copy this patent, and 20 I think, you know what?  A lot of patents are not valid. 21 I'll take this risk.  I will  I will make a lot of 22 money selling this patented product, and if somebody 23 calls me on it, I'll go hire myself a lawyer, and that 24 lawyer will come up with some kind of argument about why 25 the patent is not valid after all.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. PHILLIPS:  Okay.

53

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  That seems like it's a

3 bad  that seems like a bad incentive.

4             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Justice Kagan, the 

5 two basic points I would make to that.  First of all,

6 the  I don't remember if it's Mr. Jones or Mr. Smith,

7 but the bad actor, we'll call it  the bad actor in

8 that circumstance obviously has to pay the full

9 compensation for the infringement, which is in some

10 instances, tens of millions of dollars, will almost

11 certainly be subject to attorneys' fees under

12 Section 285.  So it's not as though you're getting a

13 pass under that  in that situation.

14             Now, I understand the desire to  to have

15 enhanced damages against that particular bad actor.

16 That's why I say in a lot of ways, this case comes down

17 to what do you worry about more, pirates or trolls?  My

18 assessment of this, and I think it's borne out by the

19 way the Federal Circuit has looked at this problem, is

20 that there are not that  there are not very many

21 pirates out there.  And if you keep a rule that is

22 designed simply to get the one in a million pirates  I

23 would call them unicorns  but one in a million

24 pirates, you'd end up with a rule that will allow the

25 trolls to go after every legitimate producer of products

Alderson Reporting Company

1 and services in this country.  And that's the price

54

2 you'd have to pay to get at the  at the really bad

3 actor.

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  See, the question  I know

5 this is not exactly a question that we've seen in your

6 briefs, but we see countering in your brief, is there

7 was a company.  And the company made, I think, cotton

8 goods.  And an individual thought that he could make a

9 lot of money by taking those cotton goods and the

10 machinery that they were used and selling it all over

11 the United States.  And so he did it.  I think it was

12 Alexander Hamilton.

13             (Laughter.)

14             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not sure.  And as a

15 result, New England grew rich.

16             Now, supposed he'd gotten a letter one day

17 that said, we have a patent.  We have a patent.  And it

18 would have cost him $10 million to look into it, and he

19 didn't have all the money so he thought he'd run his

20 chances.  Suddenly I'm not so sure which way the

21 equities would work out.  That's your point.  Both of

22 you have a point.

23             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's why I'm looking

25 for is there some way we can get the real worst ones

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
55 1 without destroying what you don't want to have destroyed 2 and yet, where he's really worried about the real worst 3 ones? 4             MR. PHILLIPS:  And I think the answer, at 5 the end of the day, is Congress made the choice, I 6 think  7             JUSTICE BREYER:  They just used the word 8 "willful."  I'm not  9             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, no.  But it did it 10 against the backdrop of the  of the Seagate standard. 11 Because Seagate clearly made a judgment that as between 12 a raft of claims by nonpracticing entities arising out 13 of a raft of letters and everything that goes with that, 14 between that and the risk of a true pirate out there, 15 that Congress  that it thought the better answer 16 clearly was that we should  we should protect and  17 and limit the  the scope of the patents and make sure 18 that they are being properly challenged in a  19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the  the  20 the choice is reflected in the statute, which leaves a 21 lot of discretion to the district courts.  And I 22 think  and a lot of the arguments we've heard today 23 are the sort of arguments that can be made to the 24 district court's discretion in a particular case. 25 Saying, you know, this  this is one of those pirates

56 1 or, you know, trolls, and it is a serious one or it's 2 less serious one.  And you have these standards to 3 apply, and  and the district court will exercise the 4 discretion. 5             And if it's out of the channel of 6 discretion, then the Court can review it on that basis. 7             MR. PHILLIPS:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think 8 the problem with that is  is that it  unless you 9 come up with  I mean, I  you know, recklessness  10 I  or egregiousness  I don't know what 11 "egregiousness" means, and I don't know how you  how 12 you evaluate that on review. 13             I do know what it means to  to take an 14 objectively reasonable position.  More than simply 15 something that's beyond frivolous, it is a substantial 16 argument that either the patent doesn't extend to  to 17 my particular product or the patent itself is invalid. 18 And circumstances where  where that is true, my hope 19 would be that the Court, recognizing the extraordinary 20 importance of limiting patents and the monopolies that 21 flow from there, would drive the legal decision in this 22 context  of the legal standard in this context exactly 23 where the  where the Court adopted it in Seagate. 24             That's the court that has the experience and 25 expertise, and I would hope under these circumstances,

57 1 in this very unusual situation, because patent law in 2 this context I do think is very different than almost 3 any other tort context, I would hope in the one  in 4 the  in the decidedly onesided approach that 284 is, 5 where it only gives to the plaintiffs the ability to do 6 what they can do and what they want, that the Court 7 would adopt the kind of rigorous objective standard that 8 allows both for the  both for the determination that 9 the  that the patent is invalid or doesn't infringe, 10 and that that's examined on an objective basis. 11             If there are no further questions, Your 12 Honors, I urge the Court to affirm. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 14 Mr. Phillips. 15             Mr. Wall, you have four minutes remaining. 16           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL 17               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 18             MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, I have two 19 fairly simple points. 20             The first is, as we and the PTO and many of 21 Respondents' amici recognize, the system as it currently 22 stands is out of balance.  And we have tried, and I 23 believe we have succeeded, in crafting an approach that 24 balances the Court's concerns with the need to respect 25 the rights of patentees, including small companies like
Alderson Reporting Company

1 Halo.

2             And we've done it in a couple of different

3 ways.

4             Reasonable, goodfaith efforts to  to

5 challenge patents are not going to result in enhanced

6 damages.  And intent and recklessness are not going to

7 be and should not be easy to show.

8             Now, the Federal Circuit hasn't adopted a

9 contrary approach based on its expertise.  It thought it

10 had to in light of this Court's decision in Safeco,

11 which it has misread.  Safeco says if you adopt a

12 reasonable view of the law at the time, you're not

13 acting willfully.  It doesn't say if you subjectively

14 and correctly believe that you are violating the law,

15 you are held not to be willful because you have hired a

16 good lawyer and come up with a defense later.

17             And that approach is what has skewed the

18 incentives in the patent system and taken us out of

19 balance.

20             Our approach incentivizes good, commercially

21 reasonable behavior under the full set of circumstances

22 at the discretion of the district court.  Their approach

23 is incentivizing good litigation.

24             And the second point I just want to make

25 quickly is we do have the evidentiary burden and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 standard of review in this case.  I think it's clear

59

2 that the  there isn't any basis for the clear and

3 convincing standard.  On the standard of review, I think

4 Highmark resolves and I think Pierce v. Underwood

5 resolves it.

6             These are determinations bound up with the

7 facts, and just as the Court said in Pierce, whether a

8 litigating position is substantially justified is a

9 mixed question of fact and law.  So too the questions

10 here.  These should be reviewed for abuse of discretion,

11 and it's very important for the Court to say that.

12             Halo should go back to the district court

13 and be analyzed under the right standard so the

14 evidentiary burden matters.

15             In Stryker the district court actually got

16 to the discretionary way, did it, and on appeal, Zimmer

17 never challenged that as an abuse of discretion.  It

18 just argued about the objective prong.

19             When this Court takes that out of the

20 analysis, as it should, there's no basis to disturb the

21 district court's discretionary ruling.  As the Court

22 knows from looking at it, it's a thorough and reasonable

23 opinion.  So 

24             JUSTICE ALITO:  One point Mr. Phillips

25 brought up that you didn't address in your initial

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 argument, maybe you could say a word about it, is

60

2 Section 298 of the American  America Invents Act.

3             Under your  under your reading, could

4 evidence of the failure to obtain or introduce advice of

5 counsel be used to prove that the defendant infringed in

6 bad faith?

7             MR. WALL:  No.  The patentee cannot put that

8 at issue affirmatively.  All 298 does is it dealt with

9 a  that very narrow problem.  And when the patentee

10 comes in and wants to show intent or recklessness, it

11 can point to your copying of the patent.  It can point

12 to the fact that it gave you really extensive, very

13 detailed notice.  It tried to license with you.  You

14 didn't do anything.  It cannot put at issue whether you

15 talked to counsel.

16             Now, the defendant maybe 

17             JUSTICE ALITO:  How do you get to that point

18 under the language of 298?

19             MR. WALL:  Because 298 just says when you're

20 proving of willfulness, whether it's a factor as it is

21 in our approach, whether it's the endall, beall as it

22 is in their approach, whenever the patentee is trying to

23 prove that up, you can't affirmatively put that at

24 issue.

25             And as Pulse candidly, and I think honestly,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
61 1 concedes in its brief, you can read 298 to have effect 2 on either side's view of the  how you ought to treat 3 the enhancement statute.  So I don't think 298 cuts 4 either way. 5             And I would just stress for the Court that 6 Congress at the time looked at putting "willfully" in 7 the statute, and it looked at putting something 8 virtually identical to Seagate in the statute.  It 9 didn't do either one, so I don't think it can be taken 10 to have ratified the Federal Circuit's current approach. 11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 12             The case is submitted. 13             (Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the 14 aboveentitled matter was submitted.) 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
