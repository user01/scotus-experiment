1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:06 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Case 11-1175, Marx v. General Revenue 5 Corporation. 6 Ms. Zieve. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MS. ZIEVE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Rule 54(d) provides a standard for an award 12 of costs to a prevailing party that, by the Rule's 13 express terms, does not apply where Federal statute 14 provides otherwise. The Fair Debt Collection Practices 15 Act provides otherwise because it states a different 16 rule for awarding costs than does Rule 54(d). Whereas 17 Rule 54(d) gives district courts wide discretion toward 18 cost-prevailing defendants, the FDCPA limits courts' 19 discretion to cases brought in bad faith and for the 20 purpose of harassment. 21 The text of the Act provides that, on a 22 finding that action was brought in bad faith and for the 23 purpose of harassment, the court may award attorneys' 24 fees of reasonable relation to the work expended and 25 costs. That's a matter of grammar. The unmistakable

1 meaning of that sentence is that an award of costs, like 2 an award of attorney's fees, is subject to the condition 3 that the plaintiff's suit be brought -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Under -- under that 5 provision, that's certainly true. You can't -- you 6 can't get costs under that provision unless there has 7 been that prerequisite. But it's -- you know, it's 8 ancient law that repeals by implication are not favored. 9 And what you're arguing here is that that provision 10 effectively repeals another provision which allows costs 11 in all cases, whether or not there has been misbehavior. 12 Now, why -- why is this an exception to our 13 general rule? I just don't -- this doesn't seem to me 14 like a clear repealer. 15 MS. ZIEVE: Well, there's no need to 16 consider repeal by implication in this case, Your Honor, 17 because Rule 54(d) expressly states that its presumption 18 does not apply for a Federal -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, indeed, but -- but 20 you are assuming a conflict. You're saying either 21 the -- the statute applies or Rule 54(d) applies, but 22 the statute can be read to say, we're describing one 23 category of case, we are describing the worst case, the 24 bad-faith harassing plaintiff, and the statute deals 25 with that category of person and no other.

1 So if you're not a bad-faith harassing 2 plaintiff, but you, nonetheless, lost, then you're under 3 54(d). 4 MS. ZIEVE: Well, Your Honor, if you look at 5 Section k(a)(3), as a whole, the two sentences together 6 confirm that this is not a provision about bad-faith 7 plaintiffs, that rather, the provision is addressing 8 both fees and costs to -- to plaintiffs and defendants. 9 And if -- if the Congress merely wanted to state in that 10 second sentence that fees were available and didn't mean 11 to say anything about costs to defendants, there would 12 have been no reason for Congress to have put costs in 13 that sentence. 14 If -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there are a number 16 of reasons. One is symmetry because they have costs in 17 the part about defendants. And the concern that, well, 18 if we leave out costs for the bad-faith harassing 19 plaintiff, then it -- it may be assumed that they get 20 only attorney's fees and not costs. 21 So the statute's provisions like this may be 22 redundant, but one can see that a drafter might very 23 well want to say, well, we said we're dealing with the 24 defendant costs, we want to put the same thing in with a 25 plaintiff.

1 MS. ZIEVE: Well, you've made a few points, 2 and I'll try to address each of them. 3 First, there -- there would be no reason to 4 include costs in the second sentence, just because it 5 was in the first sentence, because the first and second 6 sentences are not parallel. The first sentence makes an 7 award of costs mandatory, and, therefore, it does do 8 some work beyond 54(d). It clearly has -- has a 9 function in that sentence. Whereas the second sentence, 10 the award is subject to the "may," that is, that it's 11 not mandatory that the court award them. 12 If -- if Congress was -- Congress would have 13 no need to be concerned that if it left costs out of the 14 second sentence there would be some negative implication 15 because there are several statutes that mention fees 16 without costs. And GRC has cited no instance in which a 17 court has read a negative implication into that. 18 We, in our reply brief, cited a couple cases 19 that do the opposite. If -- so, therefore, if 20 Congress had omitted costs, left it out of the sentence, 21 then Rule 54(d) would have continued to apply in cases 22 where the defendants. 23 One more example -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Didn't -- don't district 25 courts always have the authority to award costs for

1 sanctionable behavior like bad faith? So this provision 2 is duplicate, no matter how we read it. It's either 3 duplicative of a power the court already had to award 4 costs for bad faith, or it's duplicate of Rule 54. 5 MS. ZIEVE: Well, if you read this sentence 6 as a misconduct provision, then it does repeat the 7 Court's inherent authority; although, as this Court has 8 mentioned in a couple cases, sometimes, statutes want to 9 reiterate authority that exists elsewhere. 10 If you read it our way, however, the 11 statute -- this provision does actually do some work 12 that it wouldn't otherwise do; that is, it limits cost 13 awards to prevailing defendants of these circumstances. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It limits Rule 54. 15 MS. ZIEVE: Right. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think your -- your 17 answer is always that Rule 54 obligates courts to give 18 costs. And this rule, as you read it, is a permissive 19 grant only. Even in bad faith litigations, the court 20 could choose not to give costs. 21 MS. ZIEVE: Well, Rule 54 doesn't obligate a 22 court to give costs. It establishes a presumption -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: True. 24 MS. ZIEVE: -- and this says the presumption 25 is limited to cases brought in bad faith and for
7

1 purposes of harassment. There are other statutes that 2 do -- similarly, do what we've -- what's done here. 3 Congress could have omitted -- if GRC is correct, 4 Congress could have just omitted the words, "and costs," 5 leaving the costs to be determined under Rule 54. 6 An example of that is 15 U.S.C. 15c(d)(2), 7 which is actions by state attorneys general and provides 8 that the court may award attorney's fees to a prevailing 9 defendant upon a finding that the action was in bad 10 faith. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Zieve, if we look at 12 other statutes, it seems to me we would want to look at 13 statutes involving lenders, so we would look at the -14 the Truth in Lending Act and the -- what is it, the 15 Credit Organizations Act -16 MS. ZIEVE: Fair Credit? 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and those do not 18 provide for attorney's fees. They are covered only 19 under 54(d), which is costs, not fees. Why should we 20 read this Act in a way that -- so -- so that a defendant 21 under this Act who can get attorney's fees is worse off 22 with respect to costs than defendants under the other 23 lending legislation, the ones that have only 54(d)? 24 Congress gave defendants something more 25 here. Why -- why would -- why should it be that 54(d)

1 would apply to the lender under the Truth in Lending 2 Act, but not to the lender under -- under this Act? 3 MS. ZIEVE: Well, first, Your Honor, the -4 Congress' purpose was not simply to -- this isn't just a 5 defendant-friendly provision. Congress had dual 6 purposes in enacting k(a)(3). On the one hand, Congress 7 wanted to deter nuisance suits. But on the other hand, 8 Congress wanted to ensure that meritorious suits by 9 impecunious debtors were not deterred by the prospect 10 that an award of costs would exceed the value of the 11 damage that could be recovered in a successful suit. 12 And the two provisions of k(a)(3) show the line Congress 13 drew -- drew and how it balanced those two objectives. 14 As to the other statutes, the Truth in 15 Lending Act, the Credit Repair Organizations Act, they 16 were enacted at different times by different Congresses. 17 They have different sorts of provisions, some better for 18 plaintiffs, some better for defendants. 19 And -- but this category -- in -- in 20 enacting this statute, Congress emphasized that the 21 widespread and national serious problem of collection 22 abuse that Congress said inflicts substantial suffering 23 and anguish, and noted specifically in the Senate report 24 this Court has cited to in the Jerman case, that 25 consumers, the impecunious -- the people who can't even
9

Official
1 afford to pay their debts, are the primary enforcers of 2 the statute. 3 The FTC got about 120,000 complaints from 4 consumers about debt collectors last year, more than any 5 other industry. So Congress may reasonably have decided 6 that the primary enforcers of this statute weren't going 7 to be doing that work if they were -- if they were at 8 risk of significant cost awards in cases that have 9 frequently small value. 10 There are other ways, if Congress wanted to 11 preserve Rule 54(d), that it could have done it, that 12 did not happen here. For instance, in 49 U.S.C. 13 14707(c), Congress has a similar provision about 14 attorney's fees to prevailing -- attorney's fees to 15 prevailing parties, and then states expressly that fee 16 is in addition to costs allowable under the Federal 17 Rules of Civil Procedure. Congress didn't do that here. 18 Or Congress could have made it clear that it 19 was not displacing Rule 54(d) as to cost awards by 20 stating that the Court could award attorney's fees as 21 part of the cost, therefore, distinguishing fees and 22 costs. Congress has done that sort of thing frequently, 23 including in a statute that provides for an award in 24 cases of bad faith. 25 I'm looking at 28 U.S.C. 1875, that provides
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the courts may award fees as part of costs if an action 2 was frivolous or in bad faith. 3 So -- but Congress did none of those things 4 here. Instead, what it did was draft a sentence that 5 links the term "cost" to the term "attorney's fees" with 6 the conjunction "and" and subjects both of those objects 7 of the sentence to the same condition, the condition 8 that the plaintiff suit was brought in bad faith and for 9 purpose of harassment. 10 GRC suggests that the reading -- that the 11 statute the Justice mentioned -- benefits plaintiffs. 12 But what Congress wanted to do here -- I mean, would 13 benefit plaintiff -- what Congress wanted to do was to 14 help defendants. There's actually no legislative 15 history about why this provision was put in there. 16 What we have instead, for what it's worth, 17 is a markup later where this provision is discussed in 18 response to concerns that frivolous suits -- suits 19 should be deterred, and this provision, which is now 20 already in the statute, is discussed as one means of 21 deterring frivolous suits. 22 But the bad faith and harassment standard is 23 the dividing line that Congress drew between nuisance 24 suits and other suits. This case is clearly on the 25 non-nuisance side of the line, and cases on that side of
11

1 the line are not subject to an award of costs. 2 If the Court has no further questions? 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I would assume that, if 4 Rule 54, instead of saying what it currently does, said 5 something like, "except as expressly repealed in another 6 statute," would what happened here meet that express 7 requirement of repeal? It was Justice Scalia's question 8 to you, but reformulated in a different way. 9 MS. ZIEVE: If Rule 54(d) incorporated a 10 requirement that a statute expressly referred to Rule 11 54(d)? 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Expressly repealed 13 54(d). 14 MS. ZIEVE: That would be a very different 15 case. But of course, Rule 54(d) doesn't do that. 16 Instead, when Rule 54(d) was adopted, the Rules 17 Committee actually -- the advisory committee notes list 18 25 statutes that it says will not be affected by the 19 rule. 20 Those are statutes that allow fees, forbid 21 fees, condition fees, allow fees in a broader scope of 22 cases than Rule 54(d) does. And, of course, none of 23 those would have mentioned Rule 54(d) because they 24 preceded adoption of the rule. 25 I would reserve the balance of my time.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 2 Mr. Feigin. 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN, 4 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 5 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 6 MR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 7 and may it please the Court: 8 Rule 54(d) expressly codifies in absolute 9 form the well-established principle that a specific 10 provision displaces a more general one. And I think 11 that principle is very helpful here in answering a 12 couple of the questions that have come up. 13 First of all, it makes clear that no express 14 textual conflict is necessary. This Court's never 15 required one, and the specific governs the general 16 cases. 17 That's made even clearer, if you look at the 18 pre-2007 version of the rule, which is meant to be 19 substantively identical to the current version of the 20 rule -- this is at page 12 of the government's brief -21 and the original version of the rule said, "Except when 22 express provision therefore is made either in a statute 23 of the United States or in these rules, costs shall be 24 allowed as of course to the prevailing party, unless the 25 Court otherwise directs."

1 I think that makes quite clear that 2 when, as the FDCPA does, there is a specific statutory 3 provision that addresses an award of costs incident to 4 the judgment, that specific statutory provision prevails 5 over the default rule that Rule 54(d) contains. 6 Another point about the specific governS 7 the general principle is it would apply here, even if 8 the Court believed that Section 1692k(a)(3) covered some 9 type of circumstances that Rule 54(d) and other things 10 don't. 11 And that's made quite clear by this Court's 12 recent eight-Justice unanimous opinion in RadLAX Gateway 13 Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank, in which the Court said -14 and I quote -- "We know of no authority for the 15 proposition that the canon," -- they're talking about 16 the specific governs, the general canon -- "is 17 confined to situations in which the entirety of the 18 specific provision is a" -- quote -- "'subset' of the 19 general one." 20 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, my problem with 21 this is I don't -- I mean, I read the whole statute, and 22 they have a good claim until I think you read the whole 23 statute. And I don't know what to say, other than the 24 impression -- the impression is that subsection 3, which 25 is what's at issue, the whole thing is meant to say that
14

1 the winner, when it's the plaintiff, is going to get 2 attorney's fees. 3 You know, it mentions costs, but that's the 4 background rule. And then when you get to the second 5 sentence of that, it means, and if you're in bad faith, 6 the plaintiff, then the defendant gets attorney's fees. 7 It doesn't really mention costs. That's the background 8 rule. 9 So -- and I look at the legislative history, 10 there's some staffer, at least, who's tried to find that 11 interesting; the -- they're talking about what the point 12 of this is, and say the whole point of this section is 13 to help prevent frivolous suits. 14 Well, so there we are. That's -- that's 15 where I am at this moment. 16 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Justice Breyer, I think 17 it does expressly mention costs, both in the first and 18 the second sentence. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say, on some 20 technical linguistic basis, it may do that, that's 21 correct. But perhaps I'm unique in this, but I don't 22 just look at the language, I look at the context, I look 23 at the purpose, and -- and I don't see anything in the 24 language that gets rid of the background rule, and I 25 don't see anything in the purpose that gets rid of the
15

1 background rule, and I don't see anything in the history 2 that gets rid of the background rule. 3 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor -4 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see anything in the 5 consequences that suggests that you get rid of the 6 background rule. I don't see anything in our traditions 7 that says you should get rid of the background rule. 8 So what -- what do you do with some 9 obstreperous judge who doesn't just look at the 10 language? I mean, I know who uses it, but that's not 11 the only thing. 12 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, if Congress 13 were satisfied with the background rule, then I think 14 it's strange that they added the words "and costs" to a 15 sentence that is expressly -16 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, why? A person who is a 17 drafter says -- you know, you get your costs and you 18 also get the attorney's fees. They don't -- they don't 19 know every statute, the people who draft this. They -20 they -- they just say, Senator, what are we trying to 21 do? He says, we're trying to give them attorney's fees. 22 They say, okay, we'll give them the costs and the 23 attorney's fees. 24 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I think that gets 25 back to Justice Ginsburg's question of why weren't they
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 just saying "and costs" here, just to make clear that 2 not only fees would be available, but also costs. And I 3 think that's an implausible hypothesis of what Congress 4 was trying do for the following reason: A 5 congressperson who is concerned that a reference to fees 6 alone in the second sentence of Section 1692k(a)(3) 7 would preclude application of the default rule in -- in 8 Rule 54(d), couldn't possibly have thought that the way 9 to make clear that Rule 54(d) applies in full was to add 10 the words "and costs" in a sentence that's expressly -11 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's if you had been 12 drafting it, perhaps. But the people who actually draft 13 these things are a whole section over in Congress, they 14 don't know every statute, and you give them a general 15 instruction. 16 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor -17 JUSTICE BREYER: And the -- the general 18 instruction would be add attorney's fees on the 19 plaintiffs and add attorney -- Alright. You 20 understand the point. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we have to assume 22 ignorance of the drafter. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, ignorance of other 24 laws. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: As a general principle.
17

Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE BREYER: That's right, general 2 ignorance. 3 (Laughter.) 4 MR. FEIGIN: Let me -- Your Honor, let me -5 let me address that directly. If we're presume that 6 Congress is aware of Rule 54(d), then I think it's quite 7 peculiar and, in fact, quite counterproductive to have 8 added the words "and costs" to a sentence that's 9 expressly conditioned on a finding of bad faith and 10 purpose of harassment. 11 But if I accept your hypothesis that 12 Congress was not aware of Rule 54(d). Again, it's quite 13 strange that, when thinking about the cost-shifting rule 14 that should apply in FDCPA cases, what Congress decided 15 to do was put the words "and costs" into a sentence 16 that's expressly -17 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then they shouldn't 18 have put those words in. But we're talking about the next 19 sentence. And the next sentence doesn't put the words 20 in. So you're -- you're -- you're assuming from that 21 fact that, in a pro defendant -- this is a pro-defendant 22 provision they put in, that was their whole point 23 apparently reading it -- that what they decided to do is 24 take away from defendant's costs, which they normally 25 get, without saying anything about it.

1 I mean, that's -- you understand the 2 problem. 3 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, the words "and 4 costs" appear in both sentences. I agree with Ms. 5 Zieve, that the legislative history does not indicate 6 that this is a uniquely pro-defendant division -7 provision, and that's what the Court found in Jerman. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't -- where does it 9 say that? Where was the -10 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, first of all -11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I would like to read it. 12 MR. FEIGIN: -- you can look at -- there is 13 no legislative history directly addressing the sentence 14 we're trying to interpret today. But I think, if you 15 look at the Court's opinion in Jerman and the hearing 16 cited at page 31 of the red brief, it reflects that 17 Congress was trying to balance deterrence of nuisance 18 suits and incentivizing good-faith consumer enforcement. 19 If I could, I would like to address the 20 policy reasons why Congress would have found it 21 particularly useful not to have plaintiffs pay costs in 22 these circumstances. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a 24 pretty odd way to balance. I mean, if you're -- if 25 you're trying to balance, then you say, well, here's an

1 idea, let's give them attorney's fees, but let's not 2 give them costs. 3 MR. FEIGIN: Well, the reason not to give -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a very 5 curious way to dilute what was otherwise a 6 defendant-friendly provision. 7 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I don't think 8 the provision is uniquely defendant-friendly. I think 9 it draws a dividing line between nuisance suits and 10 non-nuisance suits, premised on a finding of the suit 11 being brought in bad faith and the purpose of 12 harassment. 13 And the reason why Congress thought it was 14 necessary to shield good-faith plaintiffs from costs 15 here in order to incentivize enforcement, is, first of 16 all, these are particularly low-value suits, especially 17 when compared to other statutes in the CCPA. They're 18 the kind of suits that can be incentivized by a mere 19 $1,000 in statutory damages. And as this case 20 demonstrates, the cost of a suit, if taxed against the 21 plaintiff, can do much more than 1,000 -22 JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look up -- did you 23 try to do any sampling on that? Because I did, 24 actually, and -- and I discovered something that I think 25 is not as strong for you, but it isn't too much against

1 you. 2 We just did a random sample of 28 successful 3 cases, and I think the average recovery -- except for 4 one outlier, where it was very high, -it was around 5 $4,000 -- 3 to 4, and the average costs on the ones that 6 the defendants won, I guess, was around a thousand. So 7 you have a point -8 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor -9 JUSTICE BREYER: But it isn't quite as good 10 a point, as you seem to suggest. That is, it's a not so 11 low value and the costs are not so high -12 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, plaintiffs -13 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in order to make it. 14 MR. FEIGIN: Plaintiffs here are uniquely likely to 15 be deterred because they're the kind of people who have 16 been pursued by debt collectors. They're going to be in 17 debt themselves. They're not going to be able to pay 18 costs. That's why attorneys -- and that's why the 19 statute provides for attorneys generally to take these 20 cases on contingency, on the hope that they'll recover 21 fees when the plaintiff is successful. 22 Now, if plaintiff's looking to bring this 23 kind of case, the only out-of-pocket expense the 24 plaintiff is facing is the potential that if it loses 25 the case for some reason that it can't be aware of
21

1 initially, such as a bona fide good-faith defense or the 2 law being interpreted against them in an area where the 3 law is unclear, they're going to have to pay out of 4 pocket against the plaintiff himself, not the 5 plaintiff's attorney, who are the people the defendant 6 claims is -- are responsible for the abuses they allege 7 in FDCPA cases. This is going to come out via judgment 8 directly against the plaintiff. 9 It's difficult to believe that Congress 10 enacted a provision specifically because it believed 11 the -- the debt collection industry was forcing, among 12 other things, personal bankruptcies and wanted the kind 13 of plaintiffs who were going to be in a position to 14 enforce the FDCPA to have to face the risk of incurring 15 thousands of dollars in costs if they lose a suit that 16 they bring in good faith. 17 And the reason -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I to understand your 19 simple position to be that what Rule 54(d) does -- says 20 is if another provision deals with costs, you're 21 relegated to that other provision? 22 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unless, and this -24 you're inverting the express -- unless that provision 25 refers you back to 54?

1 MR. FEIGIN: Well, no, Your Honor, I'd 2 qualify that a little bit. I think what -- we just 3 think it codifies an absolute form of the 4 specific governs the general principles. 5 So the first question you asked is whether 6 they're covering the same territory, and they are here. 7 Both 1692k(a)(3) and 54(d) cover awards of costs 8 incident to the judgment. 9 The second question you asked is the scope 10 of the displacement. So it's possible that you might 11 have a provision, as the first sentence of 1692k(a)(3) 12 does, that only governs in certain circumstances and 13 mandates an award of costs in those circumstances. 14 We don't think a sentence like that, 15 standing alone, would displace a court's discretionary 16 authority under Rule 54(d) to award costs in other 17 circumstances. But we don't think there's any need -18 may I finish the sentence, Your Honor? 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish that 20 sentence. 21 MR. FEIGIN: We don't think there's any need 22 to adopt some new special rule for Rule 54(d) that's 23 different from how this Court normally applies the specific 24 governs the general principle. 25 Thank you.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 2 Ms. Blatt. 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT 4 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 5 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 6 and may it please the Court: 7 Our position is that the second sentence of 8 section 1692k(a)(3) is a pro-defendant provision that 9 does not strip courts of their discretion under Rule 54 10 to award costs to prevailing defendants. We think that 11 first because of the text and structure and, second, 12 because of the statutory history and purpose. 13 As to the text, the second sentence states 14 that a court may award an affirmative grant of power, 15 rather than the court may award attorney's fees and 16 costs if a plaintiff files a lawsuit in bad faith. The 17 text doesn't say that a court may not award costs in the 18 absence of bad faith. The text doesn't say or even 19 address a court's discretion to award costs to 20 prevailing defendants as an ordinary incident of defeat. 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Blatt, it -- it seems to 22 me that the -- the most natural way to read this 23 statute, and it's not -- it's not your way, it's, look, 24 we have this Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that -25 that contemplates that Congress sometimes doesn't
24

1 write -- it writes statutes authorizing lawsuits without 2 providing a cost provision. 3 And because we know that about Congress, we 4 provide a default rule. And the default rule is what's 5 laid out in subsection (d) as to costs and then also 6 later as to attorney's fees. 7 But, we know that Congress sometimes does 8 address costs and fees, and where Congress in a 9 particular statute has addressed costs and fees, we look 10 to whatever Congress has said -- you know, unless 11 Congress has otherwise provided. And here, this is -12 1692k is a provision that addresses costs and fees. It 13 addresses them comprehensively and specifically. 14 MS. BLATT: Yes. I disagree with everything 15 you said for the following reasons -16 JUSTICE KAGAN: I expected you might. 17 (Laughter.) 18 MS. BLATT: This is not a field preemption 19 case. Rule -20 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's not a question of field 21 preemption. 22 MS. BLATT: Yes, it is. You're saying that 23 if it addresses costs, that it trumps it. And it is 24 a -- you would never think -- this -- Rule 54 doesn't 25 say, don't award costs if a statute can be plausibly

1 read to address it. It says, unless it provides 2 otherwise, which means Congress actually intended to 3 displace. 4 And unless you actually think that this 5 provision intends to take away a cost authority -6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Maybe I'm -7 MS. BLATT: -- you don't get there. 8 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- not in the business of 9 trying to figure out what Congress's intent is. All I'm 10 trying to figure out is whether this Federal statute 11 provides otherwise, and this Federal statute does 12 provide otherwise. 13 MS. BLATT: Okay. Here's why it doesn't: 14 It doesn't displace it. It doesn't in terms of the 15 plain text. It just doesn't. It doesn't say any -16 there's no disabling aspect about it. It's an 17 affirmative grant to protect a defendant. And when you 18 say to a court it has sanctioning power to award 19 attorney's fees and costs, that doesn't say anything 20 about what happens in the ordinary case, where the 21 defendant has prevailed at trial and been found to be 22 completely innocent. 23 There -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in that respect, it 25 is different from RadLAX, in which the two provisions -

1 where we held the specific covers the general -- but we 2 held that because the two provisions contradicted each 3 other. 4 MS. BLATT: Not only do they not contradict, 5 this is not a specific -- when you said -- the other 6 thing I disagreed with, when you said this 7 comprehensively addresses costs, no, this 8 comprehensively is about attorney's fees. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's both, you know? 10 MS. BLATT: It is -11 JUSTICE KAGAN: And if I might say, I mean, 12 you object to this statute; it's perfectly reasonable to 13 say Congress should have written a separate provision 14 about costs and attorney's fees, but for whatever bad, 15 good, or indifferent reason, Congress didn't, and so 16 this statute basically says, here's what prevailing 17 plaintiffs get as to both costs and fees, here is what 18 prevailing defendants get -19 MS. BLATT: That's not correct. It doesn't 20 mention prevailing -21 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- under what circumstances, 22 as to both costs and fees, and those are the rules. 23 MS. BLATT: Yes. Unlike -- unlike the whole 24 statute that talks about prevailing plaintiffs, this 25 doesn't. What is fascinating about this case is, in all

1 50 titles of the U.S. Code, there are specific 2 provisions that say, plaintiffs shall not be liable for 3 costs, or a plaintiff shall not be liable for costs 4 unless a certain condition occurs. 5 There's only one statute -- we looked at all 6 50 titles -- there is one statute that says, a court may 7 award costs if a certain condition occurs. That's 8 the -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: By all 50 titles, 10 you don't mean each title, do you? 11 MS. BLATT: We've -- we've looked for all, 12 we've looked at all the cost provisions. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean, like in 14 Title IX -15 MS. BLATT: Yes. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And Title XI? 17 MS. BLATT: Yes. That's what's so funny 18 about this. Nothing in this -- this case -- I don't 19 mean to trivialize it, but there's only one other 20 statute, that Electronic Fund Transfers Act, that talks 21 about the court shall award attorney's fees and costs if 22 there is bad faith. 23 And there is one other statute that says, 24 for a prevailing defendant, the court may award costs if 25 the lawsuit is frivolous. And in those three
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 significant ways, I think it shows why we win, and 2 that's a statute they relied on to say it's just like 3 our statute, on page 18 of their brief, page 29 of our 4 brief. 5 First, it only refers to costs. The statute 6 is about costs. Our statute is about attorney's fees 7 being the main event upon a finding of bad faith. 8 Second, it mentions prevailing defendants; 9 ours doesn't. 10 And, third, which I think is missing from 11 the entire 30 minutes that you heard, their argument is 12 plaintiff -- Congress sat down and wanted to incentivize 13 frivolous suits and nonfrivolous -- nonfrivolous suits 14 alike. At least in the Pipeline Safety Act, Congress 15 said, if it's frivolous, the defendant gets its costs. 16 Here -17 JUSTICE KAGAN: This statute is very -- is 18 very normal if it were just about fees, right? It would 19 be just like the civil rights fees statutes, where it 20 said prevailing plaintiffs get fees, but prevailing 21 defendants only get fees upon some higher standard, 22 here, bad faith. What makes this statute different -23 and it is different -- is that this statute twice says 24 not only fees, but also costs. 25 MS. BLATT: Right.

1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Now, you might say that's 2 very uncommon, but in both sentences, it says, we want 3 the same rule for costs as we do for fees. 4 MS. BLATT: Well, I mean, a couple things 5 about that, it's both very common -- fee shifting 6 provisions routinely refer to both fees and costs, just 7 like salt and pepper, peanut butter and jelly, they go 8 together as a set. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And with that, is that 10 there are some statutes that don't? 11 MS. BLATT: Yes. Yes. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not always 13 peanut butter and jelly. 14 MS. BLATT: Okay. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's peanut butter and 16 honey sometimes. 17 (Laughter.) 18 MS. BLATT: Yes. And here -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Love and marriage. 20 (Laughter.) 21 MS. BLATT: I don't know about that one. 22 But here -- here, I think Congress -- first 23 of all, it's just wrong that the reference to "and 24 costs" is grammatically inexplicable and devoid of 25 practical function; and that is the fundamental point of
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the blue brief, that this is just grammatically 2 inexplicable, and that's just not true. 3 What "and costs" does is it -- basically, 4 the word "and" is being used to mean "in addition to." 5 "And" means "in addition to." And so what Congress is 6 saying is, when courts fee shift -- attorney's fee shift 7 upon a finding of bad faith, courts additionally may award 8 costs in addition to and over and above the attorney's 9 fees that were measured in relationship to the work 10 performed. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you're right. What 12 about their policy argument here, that you're a -13 you're a potential plaintiff, you've borrowed a lot of 14 money, you don't have a lot of money, and the deal is 15 this, under your interpretation, if you win, you're 16 going to get 2 or $3,000; if you lose, it will cost you 17 about a thousand. 18 That's -- that's under your interpretation. 19 MS. BLATT: Right. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: And under theirs, it's if 21 you win, you get 2 or $3,000, and if you lose, at least 22 you don't lose anything. 23 MS. BLATT: Yes. I think their policy 24 argument is -- I mean, it could not be worse. A 25 homeless person -
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, it could be worse. 2 MS. BLATT: No, it couldn't be worse, and 3 here's why: A homeless person filing a civil rights 4 case has to pay costs, and at least that person has to 5 pay -- has to prove damages. This plaintiff gets $1,000 6 for free. Second of all, the plaintiff in this case 7 never asks for relief. Well, 54 is discretionary. If 8 this woman was in pain and suffering, why didn't she 9 say, district court, I can't afford this? 10 It is the law in every circuit that the 11 district courts don't have to award costs. It's just 12 discretionary. So Rule 54 has a built-in safety valve; 13 it accommodates all the policy concerns on the other 14 side, and every other informal paupers litigant, every other 15 consumer protection plaintiff, every civil rights plaintiff, 16 every plaintiff in the country faces the risk of a cost 17 award, but doesn't get $1,000 thrown in for free. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, we do have in 19 this case the views of the government regulators, the 20 FTC and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and we 21 have heard the government's position on the relationship 22 between these two provisions. Should we give any weight 23 to the interpretation of the government administrators? 24 MS. BLATT: Obviously not. I don't even 25 know where they would get a basis for deference. I'm
32

1 sorry -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: We have a lot of cases that 3 say that -- that the agency's views about what courts 4 should do are not entitled to deference. This is -5 this is a matter -6 MS. BLATT: Yeah, but that would be 7 Ledbetter, and I don't want to cite that to Justice 8 Ginsburg. 9 (Laughter.) 10 MS. BLATT: So I think the better answer is 11 what's so mystifying about their policy argument is that 12 they enforce -- they enforce 20 consumer protection 13 statutes, and all of them, their -- their plaintiffs 14 have to pay costs. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what about the -- how 16 does this work, the canon? I'm very interested. 17 MS. BLATT: They're -18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Sorry. I'm sorry. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm very interested in 20 canons, and I want to know on the canon, the traditional 21 thing, which you've probably looked up, what about the 22 specific governs the general?

Well, I don't think -8 canons -- you know, don't trump common sense, context, 9 history -10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that -- that's a 11 different matter. 12 MS. BLATT: But let's go to canons. Let's 13 go to canons, specific versus the general. It's all 14 word games. It turns on what you think "specific" 15 means. This is not specific to the question presented 16 about prevailing parties and costs. This is about 17 attorney's fees. That -- and costs are on top of 18 attorney's fees, is essentially how -19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you say that, but it 20 says to both. It says the costs, together with the 21 reasonable attorney's fees, and then the next sentence, 22 it says fees and costs. So you might wish that they 23 were a different statute, and it might be good policy to 24 have a different statute -25 MS. BLATT: I don't wish for a different

1 statute. I think what you're saying is that Congress 2 passed a firewall. Congress said, we need to encourage 3 frivolous suits and nonfrivolous, but let's put a 4 firewall in and give them fees and costs, that, God 5 forbid, there is bad faith and harassment. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not in the business -7 I'm not in the business of trying to figure out exactly 8 what Congress is doing. I'm in the business of just 9 reading what Congress did. And what Congress did is it 10 created a set of rules that applies to attorney's fees 11 and costs at the same time. 12 MS. BLATT: It -- it affirmatively gives 13 district courts emboldening power to sanction. So -14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that sounds very 15 terrible. 16 MS. BLATT: But not if you file a lawsuit in 17 bad faith and for purposes of harassment. So, I mean -18 I think even -- I think the history is obvious; this was 19 trying to make defendants better off than the 20 defendant's suit under the Truth in Lending Act, which 21 is part of the same umbrella Consumer Credit Protection 22 Act. 23 And they're -- inexplicably, somehow, by 24 trying to make them better off, made them worse than 25 every other creditor that they serve and immunized these
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 plaintiffs from the universal risk of cost shifting that 2 every other litigant has to face. And so -- and you 3 don't get there from -- all they have is a negative 4 inference. 5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Blatt, you say 6 it -- it's supposed to make defendants better off by 7 focusing on just part of the provision, but the 8 provision is -- as a whole, it does a set of things. It 9 treats plaintiffs and prevailing plaintiffs in a certain 10 set of ways. And it treats prevailing defendants in a 11 certain set of ways. 12 MS. BLATT: It doesn't speak to prevailing 13 defendants. 14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Prevailing defendants, but 15 when -- prevailing defendants are treated worse than 16 prevailing plaintiffs because they have to show that 17 there is a bad-faith lawsuit. 18 MS. BLATT: Yeah, I'm going -- I'm going to 19 keep repeating it because it's my position. This 20 doesn't -- the fact that this doesn't refer to 21 prevailing defendants speaks volumes that what was not 22 on Congress' mind, was Rule 54. What was on Congress' 23 mind is victimized debt collectors who were sued in bad 24 faith. 25 Now, I understand this is a pro-plaintiff
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 statute, but this would be extraordinary to think that 2 they gave them attorney's fees when they -- but it's 3 basically saying -- this is a -- this is a defendant who 4 went to trial and won, was law-abiding, didn't do 5 anything wrong, and Congress in that situation said, not 6 only might -- might not the suit be -- be -- have merit 7 or good faith, it might have even been frivolous. 8 When under Rule 54 -- again, this is what I 9 find so mystifying about this case. If the petitioner 10 thought, oh, I had a really hard case in the law, or, 11 oh, I'm really poor, she could have asked for 12 discretionary relief. Instead, the lawyer went into 13 court and said, I have a recent Ninth Circuit decision, 14 and I don't have to pay costs at all. 15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Blatt, let me try it a 16 different way. 17 MS. BLATT: Okay. 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Let's just suppose that 19 54(k) didn't exist at all. Okay? 20 MS. BLATT: 54(d)? 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: 54(d) didn't exist. 22 MS. BLATT: Okay. 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: And all you had was this 24 provision. Okay? 25 MS. BLATT: Uh-huh.
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE KAGAN: So this provision says, on a 2 finding by the court that it's brought in bad faith, the 3 court may award to the defendant attorney's fees and 4 costs. So suppose a defendant wins, but there's not a 5 finding that it was made in bad faith, would then the 6 person be entitled to either attorney's fees or costs? 7 MS. BLATT: Well, we wouldn't -- certainly, 8 we sought costs here under Rule 54. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: So I'm saying that -10 MS. BLATT: I know. Okay. And you've took 11 it up. So that takes out my route seeking for costs 12 under Rule 54, it doesn't exist in your world. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: In my world, you would not 14 get fees or costs. 15 MS. BLATT: Now, we would -- I'm imagining 16 then the world in 1936, and we rely on 1920 or 1919 or 17 the long-standing practice of courts awarding costs. 18 Now, a court might -19 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm just asking you a simple 20 question. 21 MS. BLATT: We would not get costs under 22 this provision, you're correct. 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: You would not get costs 24 under that provision. 25 MS. BLATT: Because this -- in that sense, I
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 think this was a question that another Justice asked. 2 If you just look at this provision, the only basis for 3 costs and fees in this provision is the bad faith and 4 finding of harassment. 5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So if you would not 6 get costs under that provision -7 MS. BLATT: Under 1692. 8 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- under 1692, a provision 9 that talks about fees and costs, generally, as to both 10 plaintiffs and defendants, then how does a rule that 11 says what -- where you would get costs unless a Federal 12 statute provides otherwise change matters? 13 MS. BLATT: Because -- because, again, 14 Rule 54 is not preemption -- a field preemption. It's 15 saying if Congress intended to displace -- the proviso, 16 unless otherwise provided, it was recognition that other 17 statutes might displace Rule 54. And if you look at all 18 the statutes that we cite on pages 19 and 20, they 19 actually do prohibit costs. 20 And then if you look at the statutes on 21 pages 24 and 25, where, time and time again, Congress 22 has said, a prevailing party may recover attorney's fees 23 and costs. Well, the "and costs," in their view, I 24 guess those statutes are inexplicable. I mean, it's 25 clearly they're redundant, and they overlap with Rule
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 54. They don't displace it. 2 And even the practice guides that we cite on 3 page 22, which is basically Wright and Miller and Moore, 4 say something that merely overlaps with Rule 54 doesn't 5 displace the court's discretion. 6 And again, I think you have to ask yourself, 7 what was Congress doing? To me, this is -- this is a -8 the attorney's fees are the main show, it goes with bad 9 faith. Congress was not thinking about Rule 54, and I 10 think you can be quite confident Congress was not 11 thinking, we want plaintiff lawyers to go around saying, 12 not only Congress, but the government wanted us to file 13 frivolous suits. 14 JUSTICE KAGAN: You might be right, but 15 suppose Congress wasn't thinking about Rule 54. Suppose 16 it didn't occur to the drafters what Rule 54 said or 17 what the default provision was. They just wrote a 18 statute about fees and costs. And then -- it doesn't 19 really matter whether they were thinking about Rule 54 20 or not. 21 MS. BLATT: Yes, if you -- right. And so 22 there's like that Oncale case, with same-sex harassment, 23 Congress can write a very -- can write a plain language 24 provision, and regardless of what Congress intended, if 25 the language covers it, that's tough, we're going to
40

Alderson Reporting Company

1 construe it. That's your law. 2 This is not that. This -- this doesn't say 3 anything about prevailing parties. This is talking 4 about bad faith and attorney's fees. It doesn't say a 5 court can't act in the absence of bad faith. It doesn't 6 say anything about prevailing parties. It doesn't 7 reveal any intent to displace it, especially when you 8 compare it with all the other statutes, you look at the 9 history -- sorry. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, it was thinking 11 about prevailing parties because the predecessor 12 sentence -13 MS. BLATT: Prevailing defendants -- I 14 agree, sorry. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it was talking -16 no, prevailing parties. The provision is geared towards 17 prevailing parties in some form. The first sentence 18 says, "a prevailing plaintiff," not whether it's on a 19 substantial basis or any exception. 20 MS. BLATT: Yeah. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It says you get fees or 22 you can get fees and costs. 23 MS. BLATT: Right. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it then decides to 25 limit what a prevailing defendant can do. Isn't that
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the natural reading? 2 MS. BLATT: No, because it says expressly, 3 in a case of successful action, it talks about 4 prevailing plaintiffs. And then it says if there's -5 to me, it's just -- it's natural when you just read it 6 in light of sort of common sense in context in what 7 Congress was doing. If a plaintiff files in bad faith, 8 the court is empowered and emboldened -- it's like a 9 neon light -- courts, you have authority to award 10 attorney's fees and costs. 11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's -- that's just 12 a different way of saying the following: The first 13 sentence says, when you're a prevailing plaintiff, you 14 get costs and fees. How about defendants? Well, 15 prevailing is not enough for defendants. Defendants 16 have to show -17 MS. BLATT: Yeah. 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- that the suit was filed 19 in bad faith -20 MS. BLATT: Yeah. And I think -21 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and then they get costs 22 and fees. 23 MS. BLATT: Right. But I think you have to 24 keep this in mind, that there are completely 25 diametrically opposed background presumptions in our
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 legal system. It's an extraordinary event to get 2 attorney's fees, and it's an extraordinary event not to 3 get costs. 4 And so the court -- the Congress has to use 5 explicit language to over -- overturn the American rule. 6 And so what Congress did here, that is the most natural, 7 even if I drew you to a tie -8 JUSTICE KAGAN: I completely agree with 9 that. But that's what it comes down to, that if you 10 think that Congress has to use super extraordinary 11 language to over -- to -- to get out of 54(d), then 12 you're right. But 54(d) doesn't say that. It just 13 says -14 MS. BLATT: Right. And -15 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- unless the Federal 16 statute provides otherwise. 17 MS. BLATT: And I think you can look -- the 18 Petitioner did -- did a valiant job of trying to drudge 19 up as many statutes as they can. All the statutes on 20 point are explicit. Now, there's one statute that might 21 not be, the pipeline safety one. 22 And so the question is: Do we think that 23 Congress actually tried to displace a court's authority 24 under that statute? And that's a statute that just says 25 a court may award costs if a lawsuit is frivolous. This
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 one just doesn't say that. 2 You at least -- even if you don't think of 3 it as magic language or an explicit statement, the fact 4 that Congress repeatedly has used explicit language 5 casts considerable doubt that this was done by mere 6 implication. 7 And then you look at the fact that it 8 doesn't mention prevailing parties. It's talking about 9 bad faith, it has attorney's fees, what was Congress 10 doing, you look at the legislative history. It shows 11 that it was -- it was trying to make them, better, off 12 than a class of defendants, but their view inexplicably 13 makes them worse off. 14 And then you look at the result that they're 15 actually advocating, that the government thinks it's a 16 good idea that plaintiffs can file lawsuits cost-free 17 that are frivolous. I mean -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess, in the first 19 sentence of 3, the phrase "the costs of the action" is 20 really superfluous in light of 54(d)(1). You really 21 don't know that. I mean, that would have been the case 22 anyway. 23 So there's no reason to think that it isn't 24 frivolous in the second sentence -- or superfluous in 25 the second sentence, right? Why did they have to say
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the costs of the action in the case of a successful 2 action? 3 MS. BLATT: Successful action to enforce it. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The costs of the action, 5 together with a reasonable -- as determined by the 6 court. 7 MS. BLATT: Why isn't -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they have the costs 9 anyway, if Congress didn't write anything, right? 10 MS. BLATT: I mean, I think that -- again -11 I mean -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm trying to help you. 13 (Laughter.) 14 MS. BLATT: Yeah, I know. And I was going 15 to say there's so much is superfluity in here, I don't 16 know where to begin. It's all over the place. The 17 whole thing, obviously, overlaps with the Court's 18 inherent authority. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think that 20 there's a serious argument that the first sentence does 21 away with the discretionary nature? 22 MS. BLATT: No, it's clear, "shall." It's 23 clear "shall," obviously. The first sentence does -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's a command. 25 54(d) is permissive, according to your earlier argument?
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MS. BLATT: Oh, yes, that's right. Yes. 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so this does -- it's 3 not superfluous because it went to mandatory? 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Gotcha. 5 MS. BLATT: That's true. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well-taken. 7 MS. BLATT: Yeah. The question, though, 8 was, in the case of any successful action when, 9 obviously, they prevailed to begin with, so the question 10 is whether that's superfluous. But the whole provision 11 overlaps with the Court's inherent authority. And I 12 know it hasn't come up, but I just think it's strange 13 that it says, for the purposes of bad faith and 14 harassment, Congress was obviously using belt and 15 suspenders there, so it's not surprising that Congress 16 added "and costs" here. 17 If you look at Rule 54 -- let me just say 18 one other thing, Justice Kagan -- if you look at Rule 19 54, it also says, "unless the statute provides 20 otherwise, costs other than attorney's fees." So why -21 they didn't have to say that because, in the next 22 provision, it talks about attorney's fees. They just -23 they wanted to make clear for whatever reason or maybe 24 they just wrote some really excess, redundant, silly 25 language, but they said costs, meaning anything that's

1 not costs -- it's just that Congress sometimes uses 2 these. 3 And I guess this was the honey and peanut 4 butter thing, is that a lot of fee-shifting statutes 5 talk about both attorney's fees and costs. And so they 6 went together and -- they also mentioned it. Obviously, 7 it's different. I agree that there's a verb in the 8 first sentence that's mandatory, so it trumps Rule 54. 9 But with respect to the two objects, 10 Congress was already thinking about attorney's fees and 11 costs anyway, and so there's nothing wrong with them 12 saying, in addition to the attorney's fees that you can 13 get in bad faith, once you calculate the attorney's fees 14 reasonable in relation to the work performed, you also 15 get costs. 16 And the only thing I would say is -- when we 17 define "and" as in addition to, they seem to think that 18 that was an extraordinary reading of the word "and," 19 citing something -- from something called 20 dictionary.com, and if you just went to dictionary.com, 21 which I had not done before, and you type in "and," the 22 first definition is "in addition to." 23 If there are no further questions -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 25 Ms. Zieve, you have six minutes remaining.

1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE 2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 3 MS. ZIEVE: Thank you. 4 First, the FDCPA doesn't just encourage 5 frivolous suits. Ms. Blatt repeatedly referred to 6 plaintiffs getting a free $1,000. If the -- if the 7 plaintiffs win their suits, that means both that they're 8 not frivolous and they're not in bad faith. 9 In cases that are frivolous, but a court 10 makes a finding that it's not in bad faith, defendants 11 have other means of recovering fees and costs using 12 Rule 11 or Section 1927. And there are cases in which 13 courts have denied fees and costs under the FDCPA and 14 granted them under Rule 11 or 1927. 15 Ms. Blatt suggested that -16 JUSTICE GINSBERG: Would you explain why we 17 would look to other rules? You wouldn't look at the 18 Rule 54(d), but we might look at Rule 11 and we might 19 look at something else? I thought your -- your position 20 was that this statute governs all requests for fees and 21 costs under this particular Act. 22 MS. ZIEVE: Our position is that this 23 provision, k(a)(3), discusses the allocation of fees and 24 costs that come at the end of the case, based on who won 25 and who lost. And if you read it as a whole, as I think

1 Justice Kagan suggested, that's what Congress was doing. 2 It was carefully calibrating the allocation of fees and 3 costs at the end of the case. And, in fact, in 4 instances in which -- which defendants have asked for 5 fees and costs in FDCPA cases based on bad faith, they 6 do always come at the end of the case, which also shows 7 this is not a misconduct provision. 8 If it were a misconduct provision, it 9 wouldn't just be about bad faith in bringing the action. 10 The Fair Credit Reporting Act, for example, has a 11 provision that provides for fees, but not costs, that 12 speaks to conduct throughout the case, but with respect 13 to bad faith filings of pleadings, motions, or other 14 papers, that's a misconduct provision; this one isn't. 15 The main -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it -- isn't it the 17 case that, in order to appeal to the proposition that 18 the specific governs the general, you -- you have to 19 read the second sentence of 3 as containing a 20 negative -- a negative implication? As saying -21 MS. ZIEVE: Yeah. We do read the "court may 22 award" to mean "and, in other circumstances, it may 23 not." 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: It may not. So you are 25 reading in a negative -

1 MS. ZIEVE: Just as this Court -- just as 2 this Court read "may" in Cooper Industries or Crawford 3 Fittings and said, "If you don't read 'may' to define 4 the scope of what Congress is authorizing the Court to 5 do, then that provision has no meaning." 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: I understood Ms. Blatt to 7 actually agree with that, that if you put Rule 54 aside, 8 this does say, you may, under a certain set of 9 conditions, which implies you may not, under -- if those 10 conditions are not met. 11 MS. ZIEVE: Right. She did agree that, 12 without Rule 54, this provision -- that -- that no costs 13 could be awarded to a defendant, unless they had acted 14 in bad faith. 15 I mean, I think, at some points, GRC and 16 Ms. Blatt here today asked you to just ignore that "and 17 costs" exists in the sentence at all, although the fact 18 that this sentence is not replicated numerous times 19 throughout the U.S. Code doesn't seem to me reason for 20 ignoring it, but, rather, for giving effect to it. 21 Congress obviously thought it was doing 22 something when it enacted this sentence and when it 23 added these words to the statute. It does not say, "The 24 court may award fees in addition to costs" or "as part 25 of costs" or "together with costs."

1 Again, grammatically, it treats the two 2 terms, "fees and costs," on a par -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose the 4 words "and costs" were left out in the second sentence? 5 Would not the argument be made that you cannot award 6 costs even in an action brought in bad faith? 7 Wouldn't -- that this sum argument you're making -8 MS. ZIEVE: No, I don't think so. There 9 are -- no. There are statutes that provide for fee 10 awards and don't -- don't say anything about costs, and 11 these cases are -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying "negative 13 implication." If it -- if it says only "attorney's fees 14 in reasonable relation to the work expended," the 15 implication would be you -16 MS. ZIEVE: Justice Scalia, other -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you cannot -- you 18 cannot, even in the case of a frivolous action, award 19 costs. Wouldn't that be the reading of it? 20 MS. ZIEVE: In other cases, under other 21 statutes, that argument has been made occasionally and 22 rejected. It's also rejected in the treatises that we 23 cite, that if you don't mention costs -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I'm suggesting if 25 that argument is rejected, so should yours be.

1 MS. ZIEVE: No, because -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because it seems the two 3 are parallel. 4 MS. ZIEVE: If the -- if the statute does 5 not mention costs, then it doesn't provide otherwise 6 with respect to costs. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: So she says if I -- if I 8 tease -- if you tease your sister, I'm going to give 9 you -- give her your allowance and her allowance, that 10 that doesn't mean that the sister loses her allowance if 11 you don't tease her. 12 I mean, there are a lot of instances -13 MS. ZIEVE: Well -14 JUSTICE BREYER: -- where you put the "and" 15 in and it doesn't mean that that's the exclusive place 16 for giving it. Sometimes, it does; sometimes, it 17 doesn't. That's her point. 18 MS. ZIEVE: Well, put -- well, putting aside 19 that I hope that Congress drafts a little more carefully 20 than a mother may threaten her child -21 (Laughter.) 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I doubt that it does. 23 I'm sorry. I mean, they're human beings over there; 24 they're not necessarily all -25 MS. ZIEVE: But they're -- the presumption

1 behind that hypothetical is that the one child is going 2 to get their allowance no matter what. The presumption 3 here is that Rule 54(d) will apply unless a statute 4 provides otherwise. This statute doesn't. 5 Thank you, Your Honor. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 7 The case is submitted. 8 (Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the 9 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
