3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 148358, Lockhart v.

5 United States.

6             Mr. Zas.

7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD S. ZAS

8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MR. ZAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11             This case concerns the tenyear mandatory

12 minimum prison sentence that Section 2252(b)(2)

13 sometimes requires Federal judges to impose.

14             The statutory language in dispute reserves

15 the severe punishment for a defendant with a prior State

16 conviction for an offense relating to any kind of sexual

17 abuse involving a minor or ward.  Because Petitioner's

18 prior offense did not involve a minor or ward, the

19 statute's mandatory minimum penalty does not apply to

20 him.

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the conviction

22 had been, under Federal law, the  the conviction for

23 sexual abuse of an adult and we have the same question:

24 Does the mandatory minimum apply?

25             I take it if it had been under Federal law,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 then the mandatory minimum would apply.

4

2             MR. ZAS:  That's correct.  If the conviction

3 had been under Chapter 109A of Title XVIII, which covers

4 sexual abuse offenses, then it would trigger the

5 mandatory penalty.  But Congress, in this statute, since

6 the time it was first enacted in 1978, has never sought

7 to create symmetry or parity between the Federal

8 predicates and the State predicates.

9             This may be most clear now in

10 Subsection 2252(b)(1), where you can see that a prior

11 Federal conviction for sex trafficking of anyone, which

12 is a violation of Section 1591, the corresponding State

13 analogue, is textually limited to sex trafficking of

14 children.

15             So this decision to treat prior State and

16 Federal predicates differently is inescapable, and it's

17 been true ever since the first statute.

18             So from 1970 

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I don't  why  why

20 is it in this case  it  it does seem to me that

21 Congress, eight years later, when it wrote the  the

22 second statute, used the  the  the same style and

23 that this very much favors the government.  But then you

24 say that that's inapplicable, because?

25             MR. ZAS:  Because when this language was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 first added  first, it was added in 1994.

5

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.

3             MR. ZAS:  The Federal predicates.  At that

4 time there were still no State law predicates at all.

5             In 1996, when the language was first

6 introduced, and it was then introduced in Section 

7 Subsection (b)(1), which applies to the distribution and

8 receipt offenses, even then the penalty for simple

9 possession of child pornography was the only Federal

10 predicate.

11             So someone in Mr. Lockhart's position at

12 that time would not have faced the mandatory minimum

13 penalty even if people who  who committed the

14 distribution offenses would or even if  even if he had

15 a conviction for  under Chapter 109A.

16             So  and then in 1998, when this language

17 in dispute was then added at the government's urging to

18 Subsection (b)(2), even at that time Congress clearly

19 wasn't aiming for parity because then they added a new

20 Federal predicate, Chapter 117 offenses, which are

21 violations of the Man Act:  Transportation for illegal

22 sexual activity.

23             But at that time it didn't add any State

24 law  State offense analogue for that offense.

25             This has continued up to the present day.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 So in 2003, there were amendments to add the obscenity 2 offenses, the Federal obscenity offenses in Chapter 71 3 to the list of Federal predicates, but no corresponding 4 State crime for obscenity offenses. 5             The  6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you say it works 7 now for the manufacturing and distribution offenses?  We 8 have your position on the possession  well, you said 9 there's a disparity between a Federal conviction and a 10 State conviction.  How about a conviction, either the 11 manufacturing or distribution? 12             MR. ZAS:  Yes.  So  so that offense is 13 covered by the different provision of Section 2251(e). 14 That's the penalty provision for the much more serious 15 crime of actually using minors or children to produce 16 this material. 17             The language in 2251(e) as amended in 2006 18 is  it does seem to track, to qualify the predicates 19 to include Statelaw abuse offenses that involve adults 20 as well as children.  But that's because there's an 21 important textual difference between Section 2251(e) and 22 the statute we're talking about. 23             So if you go back to Section 2252(b)(2), 24 you'll see an important textual point here, which is the 25 word "or."  This may be easier to follow if you actually
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 look at the statute if you don't have it open in the

7

2 statutory appendix to the blue brief at pages  at

3 page 10A.  You'll see that the list is written as

4 aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abuse of

5 sexual  I'm sorry, or abusive sexual conduct involving

6 a minor or ward or a bunch of other offenses.

7             The "or" before abusive sexual conduct would

8 not be there on the government's reading.  That is, if

9 abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward were an

10 independent standalone offense, the "or" does no work.

11 It's unnatural to be.  Then the list would just read,

12 aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual

13 conduct involving a minor or ward, or  and it would

14 continue.

15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there's another

16 possible explanation for that, because the last item in

17 the list itself involves a great many  itself involves

18 a list.  So the second "or" could be a substitute for a

19 semicolon.

20             But let me ask you another question about

21 the language that you just read.  As I understand your

22 argument, this provision would apply to sexual abuse

23 involving a minor and also abusive sexual conduct

24 involving a minor.

25             Is there any difference between those two

Alderson Reporting Company

1 things?

Official

8

2             MR. ZAS:  No, Your Honor.  We 

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  So why did Congress put them

4 both in?

5             MR. ZAS:  Well, because I think the first

6 point here is it must be for the same reason it used

7 aggravated sexual abuse at the beginning of the list,

8 which  which I think both sides agree does no

9 independent work.  It's already covered.

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there's something that

11 jumps out.  It's a strange list, aggravated sexual

12 abuse, sexual abuse.  Sexual abuse would include

13 aggravated sexual abuse.  So that seems to be  the

14 reference to aggravated sexual abuse seems to be

15 redundant.  And abusive sexual conduct, if understood in

16 ordinary  in the terms of ordinary language, does seem

17 to duplicate sexual abuse.

18             But there's an explanation that jumps out,

19 and that is that this  almost this precise terminology

20 appears in Sections 2241, 2242, and 2243.  And in those

21 provisions, all those terms are defined so that they

22 mean something different.

23             So it seems to jump out at the reader that

24 that's what Congress was doing in this list.

25             Why is  what is wrong with that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
9 1             MR. ZAS:  Well, first, if you go back to the 2 time this  this language we're talking about was first 3 added in 1996, that Congress not only knew how to  how 4 to do what Your Honor is suggesting, that is, to be 5 tracking the Federal predicates exactly.  Because in a 6 different provision, the provision that became 2241(c), 7 it did exactly that.  It  it describes State offenses 8 whose conduct would constitute a Federal crime if 9 committed within Federal jurisdiction. 10             So they didn't do that here, and they didn't 11 do it again when they added the particular language in 12 1998 to (b)(2)again. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, I don't 14 follow that.  I  15             MR. ZAS:  Yes. 16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As I see it, they 17 did, as Justice Alito said, track pretty much exactly 18 2241, 42, and 43 in developing the list that they  19 they add  that's before us today.  I didn't understand 20 your response. 21             MR. ZAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, there are 22 really two responses.  One, the one I gave to Justice 23 Alito is that this Congress, in 1996 and '98, knew how 24 to track when they wanted to track.  They did so 25 explicitly in other provisions of the same legislation.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 In 1996, the other provision was 2241(c).  In 1998, the 2 other provision was 2426(b).  So it knew  it knew how 3 to do it, and didn't do it, and has never done it. 4             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it could have done it 5 more clearly.  That's certainly the answer to this whole 6 case.  They could have handled this issue a lot more 7 clearly. 8             But that is the  the idea that they were 9 picking up the definitions in the Federal provisions is 10 one explanation for this rather strange  this list. 11 The other makes the list terribly redundant, and I 12 haven't heard your explanation as to why they would do 13 that. 14             Why include both sexual abuse and aggravated 15 sexual abuse?  Why include sexual abuse and abusive 16 sexual conduct? 17             MR. ZAS:  Two responses, Your Honor. 18             First  and this goes to the Chief 19 Justice's question as well  this list does not track 20 the Federal predicates as precisely, I think, as some 21 have suggested.  The Federal list of predicates has four 22 crimes, sexual  aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, 23 sexual abuse of a minor or ward, and abusive sexual 24 contact.  If Congress had meant to track those, they 25 surely would have used the same fourprong list.  They
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 didn't do that.  Instead, they used a different term, 2 "abusive sexual conduct." 3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't understand how 4 that answers the redundancy question.  There's 5 redundancy in both interpretations, but much more in 6 yours than in the government's. 7             MR. ZAS:  Well, I  I disagree with that. 8 I think the government reads the modifying clause out of 9 this statute in terms of doing any operative work at 10 all.  But  but let me respond  11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not sure how your 12 answer was responsive to Justice Alito's redundancy 13 question. 14             MR. ZAS:  It wasn't.  But that's the second 15 part of the answer. 16             The redundancy here was meant to go very 17 broadly, to pick up, not the Federal predicates, but any 18 terms or crimes that the States might create. 19             So we cited this in the yellow brief in 20 reply.  You'll see that the States call sexual abuse a 21 variety of different things, including aggravated sexual 22 abuse of a minor, sexual abuse of a minor, abusive 23 sexual misconduct.  So Congress is using these redundant 24 terms as it sometimes does to emphasize inclusiveness. 25 Whatever the label is, Congress wanted to protect
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 children by picking those up.

12

2             But it limited.  It limited the reach of the

3 terms by setting a bright line floor.  And that floor

4 was at children.  The statute, after all, its principal

5 purpose as its title, as the title of Chapter 110

6 suggests, is about protecting against sexual

7 exploitation and other abuse of children.

8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Zas, is it possible when

9 you read these three terms, as you say, Congress might

10 have meant to be just trying to pick up every

11 conceivable State statute it could think of.  But it's

12 possible also to think of these as the aggravated sexual

13 abuse is the worst offense; the sexual abuse is the

14 medium offense; and the abusive sexual conduct is

15 actually somewhat a more minor offense, in other words,

16 might include things that are not sexual abuse

17 themselves.  Let's say indecent exposure or something

18 like that.

19             And if you understand the provisions in that

20 way as sort of going from the top to the bottom and

21 meant to pick up everything, then it would seem that the

22 involving a minor or ward really ought to refer to all

23 of them.  Right?  That there's no reason why the

24 involving a minor or ward would  would refer only to

25 the most minor offenses as the others.

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Maybe I said that wrong.  I

4 think I said the exact opposite of what I meant.

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It makes sense to me,

7 though.

8             (Laughter.)

9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  What?

10             If you read  if you read them going 

11 going down, right  well, what do you think would

12 follow?

13             (Laughter.)

14             What do you think would follow from that

15 understanding of this list?

16             MR. ZAS:  Well, Your Honor, we have tried to

17 figure out what  what in the world the difference is

18 between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct when you

19 give these terms their ordinary meaning.  There is no

20 meaningful difference.  Sexual abuse, as ordinarily

21 defined, is just the misuse, physical or nonphysical, of

22 another 

23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But just presume with me

24 that abusive sexual conduct is supposed to be  is

25 supposed to include some things that sexual abuse would

Alderson Reporting Company

1 not.

Official

14

2             What do you think follows from that?

3             MR. ZAS:  Well, again, first, even with that

4 assumption, you have this prefatory language to the list

5 here, "relating to," which this Court has described 

6 has defined, has interpreted, to be very broad.  It only

7 means "to stand in some relation to."

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  When I think  what I

9 think you would say is that if it's in descending order

10 like that, you don't have to make the third one, which

11 is already less than the second, which is less than the

12 first.  You don't have to make the third one a teeny,

13 teeny, teeny third one by tagging on children only to

14 the third and not to the other two.

15             It seems to me much more regular to assume,

16 as you do, that the limitation to children applies to

17 all three of these descending crimes.  And  and isn't

18 that the answer?

19             MR. ZAS:  Yes, Your Honor.

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your answer.

21             MR. ZAS:  It  it is the answer.  And 

22 and it is essentially an instance of the principle that

23 has  that has come to be known as the series

24 qualifier.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But  but the  the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 problem with that is  maybe I'm wrong, but I think you 2 have conceded that there is no difference between the 3 last two, that it  it's  it's not descending.  I 4 mean, it's  it's Justice Kagan who's suggested that 5 abusive sexual conduct could mean exposure, for example, 6 indecent exposure, which would probably not fit the 7 second  the second term.  Haven't you conceded that 8 the two are the same? 9             MR. ZAS:  Yes, we have, but we don't view 10 it  11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What did you do that for? 12             MR. ZAS:  We do not view it as  we don't 13 view it as a concession.  We have allowed for the 14 possibility, as  as Justice Kagan, I think, is trying 15 to do, of trying to come up with some fine distinction 16 in meaning between the last two terms, but whether there 17 is or isn't a little bit of daylight between those 18 terms, it's all overcome by the terms "relating to." 19 Anything relating to one is going to relate to the 20 other. 21             And pity the poor district judge who would 22 have to decide in cases around the country, does this 23 offense relate to sexual abuse, in which case on the 24 government's reading, it doesn't matter whether a minor 25 or ward was involved; or does it relate to this other

Official
16 1 category of abusive sexual conduct, which as far as we 2 can  3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But just to be 4 clear, it's abusive sexual contact, right? 5             MR. ZAS:  Not in our list.  That's the 6 language from  7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  (e)? 8             MR. ZAS:   the Federal predicates.  The 9 separate crime in 2244 is abusive sexual contact. 10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I see. 11             MR. ZAS:  Our list is abusive sexual 12 conduct.  As far as we can tell, no one has ever 13 explained what in the world the difference is. 14             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, we might be  when 15 did they write?  We're looking at, call it "your 16 section," which is (a)(4); is that right?  Or what is 17 it?  It's  for the three things in it.  The one you're 18 interested in is  let's  I don't want a name for it. 19             MR. ZAS:  Yes.  It's  20             JUSTICE BREYER:  I call it "your section." 21             MR. ZAS:  It's the penalty provision. 22             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  I'm going to 23 call it "your section." 24             MR. ZAS:  You can, Your Honor. 25             JUSTICE BREYER:  Your section.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1             Then think of several other sections, which 2 are the one I hadn't thought about which Justice Alito 3 raised.  That's really suspicious the way that looks 4 there.  41, 42, 43.  Now, when you pull up 41, 42, 43, 5 law or written before the relevant parts of your section 6 were written. 7             MR. ZAS:  They were, Federal predicates 8 prior to  9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  If that's so  and 10 I don't know if this helps you or hurts you, but it 11 seems to me that there is a readymade right there for a 12 drafter explanation of why he uses these words.  Because 13 we first look to 41, and that's aggravated.  And then we 14 look to 42, and that's sexual abuse without aggravated. 15 And conduct is just the same as contact, but the drafter 16 is thinking maybe we should go a little bit bigger. 17 Now, the difficulty is in each of the sections I've 18 mentioned, there is a special related section for 19 children. 20             So the difference between the two for adults 21 is the nature of the force requiring a person to perform 22 a sexual act.  A threat of violence, et cetera.  That's 23 one.  Right? 24             And then the next section, abuse, it can be 25 some other kind of threat.  Then we get to the way it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
18 1 deals with children, and it deals with children under 2 the 12  under 12.  That's one.  And it deals 12 to 16. 3 That's the next.  And then we have a section called 4 contact, and that has to do with sex acts basically that 5 really weren't sex acts but for a certain kind of 6 conduct which is defined.  All right. 7             So I read this, I say, hey, that's what they 8 picked up.  They just  a drafter just picked it up and 9 changed a little bit, but that's what he had in mind. 10 Then the question is:  Your question.  And in your 11 favor, I think, is the fact that each of these earlier 12 sections does have a special section dealing with 13 children under the same number. 14             Now, don't tell me I'm right if I'm not 15 right, but that's what I suddenly saw when Justice Alito 16 asked his question.  Just tell me your reaction. 17             MR. ZAS:  Well  18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're not going to tell 19 him he's right. 20             (Laughter.) 21             MR. ZAS:  I wouldn't do that, Your Honor. 22             The courts of appeals that have addressed 23 this precise question, just  just so it's clear, none 24 of them  they've all rejected the idea that I  that 25 I think starts the premise here, which is that Congress

Official
19 1 meant to  meant for courts to interpret these terms by 2 reference to the Federal predicates.  In fact, that's 3 the government's position here as well. 4             So the parties are on common ground in 5 saying that these weren't meant to track the Federal 6 predicates.  And as I pointed out earlier, Congress not 7 only knew how to do it when they wanted to, they did it 8 in these two pieces of legislation in '96 and '98. 9             Now, it's true that these terms existed in 10 the Federal predicates before they were added to this 11 section.  But they also exist all around the country in 12 the 50 States.  So Congress wasn't  wasn't trying to 13 track them.  It could have just said, any State offense 14 that would be a violation of Federal law if  if in 15 Federal jurisdiction.  It  it  it didn't do that. 16             It was recognizing that States do all kinds 17 of things.  And it's using these terms to say, anything 18 relating to it.  It doesn't have to even be sexual 19 abuse; it just has to relate to sexual abuse.  But 20 because that could pick up misdemeanor sex offenses 21 around the country, committed only against an adult. 22             Public lewdness would be an example. 23 That  that crime, we sited one statue in the briefs. 24 That's  the statutory maximum is 30 days in jail.  But 25 if that were picked up, suddenly someone who is in

2 Federal offense of possessing child pornography, is

3 suddenly going to have their sentence go 

4             JUSTICE ALITO:  But your  your argument is

5 that it is just a coincidence that Congress came up with

6 this list of three terms that are redundant and that

7 just so happen to be almost exactly the same three terms

8 in the same order that appear in the Federal provisions.

9             MR. ZAS:  No, I  I  I don't mean to say

10 that.  It's  it's not a coincidence.  Congress would

11 naturally use terms that it is familiar with, that are

12 in the Federal  the Federal  Federal chapter, but

13 that's very different.

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  They didn't use the same

15 terms.

16             MR. ZAS:  That's  that's right.

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The third term is

18 different.

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  But they used  they

20 used 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think it was an

22 accident that the third term was different?

23             MR. ZAS:  No.  I think the court presumes

24 that when Congress uses a different term, it  it acts

25 deliberately  and I  I think 

Alderson Reporting Company

21 1             JUSTICE ALITO:  When they use "sexual abuse" 2 and "sexually abusive conduct," they were not  they  3 they had in mind the Federal provisions, but they didn't 4 want those terms in this provision to mean the same 5 thing as they mean in the Federal provision, even 6 though, according to you, there is no generally accepted 7 understanding of the difference between sexual abuse and 8 abusive sexual conduct. 9             MR. ZAS:  That's right.  That's right. 10 They  they didn't. 11             Sex  I'm sorry.  Chapter 110, the chapter 12 that contains the statute, has its own definitional 13 section.  There is no definition there of any of these 14 terms.  The only potentially pertinent term that's 15 defined is the term "minor," which is defined 16 differently in this chapter than it's defined or used  17             JUSTICE ALITO:  Sexual abuse is defined, and 18 abusive sexual contact is defined, are they not? 19             MR. ZAS:  They are  they are defined in 20 Chapter 109A.  But as Justice  as Justice Scalia 21 pointed out, they didn't use abusive sexual contact. 22 They used abusive sexual conduct.  So it  it could be 23 viewed as, that's going broader, but with a floor.  We 24 want to brightline it.  If you commit any kind of sexual 25 abuse, not  not only sexual abuse, but anything
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 relating to sexual abuse, you're going to face these

22

2 severe penalties, so long as it involves a minor or

3 ward.  That's the focus.  Congress was trying to protect

4 children, and to punish and deter those who would harm

5 them.

6             There is nothing in the history or the

7 understanding of these provisions at the time of

8 enactment to suggest that they were also focused on

9 sexual abuse  State sexualabuse crimes against

10 adults.  Now, that's a serious crime.  No one disputes

11 that.  But it wasn't the focus of this legislation.

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why would they be

13 focused on Federal sexual abuse involving adults but not

14 State sexual abuse involving adults?

15             MR. ZAS:  Because the 1996 Congress was

16 focused on a very specific problem that they identify.

17 And that's the link, the connection between child

18 pornography and other sex offenses against children.

19             So that was their focus.  And given that

20 focus and given that the other State law predicates in

21 this statute are also limited to  to crimes against

22 children, they naturally limited these offenses as well

23 to children.

24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but the  the Federal

25 predicate, the Section 109, I believe it is, does apply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to adults as well.  So why would they be focused on

23

2 adults with respect to Federal offenses but not with

3 respect to State offenses?

4             MR. ZAS:  Because, I think most importantly,

5 Congress controls the Federal  Federal crime.  It

6 creates them, it knows what they are, they're a finite

7 set, and it knows that those predicates are not going to

8 change without congressional action.

9             Once the national legislature has to

10 consider 50 penal codes around the country which can

11 change at any time and can cover things that may relate

12 to sexual abuse or abusive sexual conduct, Congress

13 reasonably may have decided that it didn't want to sweep

14 that broadly, so it, again, created this floor.

15 "Involving a minor or ward" was the key phrase.  And our

16 reading is the only one proposed that gives it some

17 operative work to do.

18             I'd like to reserve the balance of my time

19 for rebuttal.

23              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL

24                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25             MS. O'CONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it please the Court:

24

2             This case involves two competing canons of

3 statutory interpretation, and there are four basic

4 reasons why we think the government's interpretation is

5 correct.

6             First, Petitioner's interpretation creates

7 an unexplained redundancy where the Court would have to

8 conclude that Congress created a list of three things,

9 two of which are the same.

10             Second, our interpretation is consistent

11 with the only possible reading of Section 

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Let's do them

13 one by one.

14             On the first one, even under your

15 interpretation, two of the three are the same, aren't

16 they?

17             MS. O'CONNELL:  Under our interpretation,

18 what  what we've said is that the first category and

19 the third category are logically subsets of the more

20 general category of sexual abuse.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

22             MS. O'CONNELL:  But there's a couple of

23 explanations for why Congress may have done that.

24             The first is that, when they added these

25 State law predicates to the Section 2252(b)(1) for the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 first time in 1996, there already were Federal

25

2 predicates on the list that included aggravated sexual

3 abuse, sexual abuse, and sexual abuse of a minor or

4 ward.  So even though it may be true that Congress could

5 have covered everything it wanted to cover in the State

6 law crimes by just saying "sexual abuse," it would have

7 opened itself up to arguments if it had just said all of

8 those Federal crimes and then any State law relating to

9 sexual abuse, that those other types of sexual abuse

10 under State law were not covered.

11             Especially with respect to the third

12 category, sexual abuse or abusive sexual conduct

13 involving a minor or ward, Congress made clear when it

14 included that third category that it was picking up

15 State law offenses where a person is deemed incapable of

16 consenting to sexual contact or sexual conduct, because

17 of their status as either a minor or a ward.

18             So our interpretation can be explained.

19 There is redundancy, and we're not asking for just an 

20 a straight invocation of the canon against surplusage.

21 Both interpretations contain surplusage.  But it's a

22 reason why it doesn't make sense to apply the

23 seriesqualifier canon here, because it 

24             JUSTICE ALITO:  Why do you resist  why 

25 why do you resist the argument that what Congress was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1 doing was picking up basically the definitions of the 2 Federal offenses that are worded almost identically?  If 3 that's what they are doing, then it's understandable 4 what is meant by all three terms.  If that's not what 5 they were doing, it's a strange coincidence. 6             And not only is there redundancy, but 7 there's ambiguity about what is meant by sexual abuse as 8 opposed to abusive sexual conduct, and why they had to 9 put in aggravated sexual abuse in addition to sexual 10 abuse. 11             MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Alito, we  we 12 don't think that Congress was trying to pick up the 13 exact definitions of the three Federal statutes.  And we 14 think that's most clear, as Petitioner pointed out, by 15 the fact that there are other provision in this chapter 16 where Congress used different language when it wanted to 17 do so. 18             The most clear example is the recidivist 19 provision for the sexual abuse offenses. 20             JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes, they could have done it 21 more clearly, of course.  The  the statute is  is 22 poorly drafted.  You know, we give them a "D" for their 23 drafting of this statute. 24             But what is the difference between sexual 25 abuse and abusive sexual conduct?  Putting aside the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 definitions of those  of those terms or similar terms 2 in Chapter 109. 3             MS. O'CONNELL:  I don't think there is any 4 difference between those two terms. 5             And  and Petitioner agrees, which is 6 why  7             JUSTICE ALITO:  So why did they put  why 8 did they do that? 9             MS. O'CONNELL:  I think because the  10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Just catchy phrases that 11 came to their mind? 12             MS. O'CONNELL:  No.  I think the last 13 category, "sexual abusive conduct involving a minor or 14 ward," was meant to  to indicate and make clear that 15 Congress was picking up State offenses where a person is 16 deemed incapable of giving consent because they are a 17 minor or a ward.  They are deemed incapable by the law 18 even though, under a generic definition of "sexual 19 abuse" that may apply to everyone  20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ward  a ward can't  21 why  why would you say a  why would you add "ward" 22 if  if that was the reason for it?  Why wouldn't you 23 just say of "a minor"? 24             MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, Congress added "ward." 25 And 
Alderson Reporting Company

28 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I know.  Why?  That's what 2 I'm asking. 3             MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.  Well, we think the 4 most  5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  To achieve what  what you 6 say they were achieving, it would  it would have 7 sufficed to say "minor." 8             MS. O'CONNELL:  No, I don't think so. 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  No? 10             MS. O'CONNELL:  A minor  a ward is not 11 just a person who is a minor or a foster child, or a 12 person who's been placed under a guardianship because of 13 mental incompetence or something like that.  Those 14 people are all wards, but as we've explained in our 15 brief, a ward also very clearly includes a prisoner, and 16 Congress would have known that. 17             And the  the 18 Federal sexual abuse of a ward provision refers 19 basically to  20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that  that's not 21 somebody who could not  who could not give consent. 22             MS. O'CONNELL:  Under  23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're  you're saying the 24 reason for it was they wanted to pick up people who 25 could not consent to the thing.  But to do that, all
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 they had to say was "minor."

29

2             MS. O'CONNELL:  No  no.  I think that a 

3 a ward is also basically deemed incapable of giving

4 consent 

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Prisoners  prisoners are

6 deemed incapable of giving consent?

7             MS. O'CONNELL:  The law has the same sort of

8 operation, yes.  It  it deems the conduct abusive even

9 if it's consensual.  The Section 2243 does that, the

10 Federal sexual abuse of a ward statute.  And we've cited

11 in footnote 14 a lot of State laws that prohibit the

12 same thing.

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And "concrete" would mean

14 that, if it was a prison guard and a prisoner 

15             MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.

16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   even if the prisoner

17 said, "Yes."

18             MS. O'CONNELL:  Exactly.  That that would be

19 deemed abusive sexual conduct.  It would be 

20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But a ward  a ward could

21 also be a 40yearold person who is incompetent.

22             MS. O'CONNELL:  Correct.  A ward could

23 certainly be an adult.

24             And I think this is a  a key point that

25 Petitioner has never really answered is that Petitioner

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1 is trying to say that there is this clear pattern that 2 Congress had when it was creating the  these lists, 3 and that the Federal crimes can involve both adults and 4 minors, but it was always limiting the State law crimes 5 to crimes against children.  And it just isn't the case. 6 And even under his interpretation, because "wards" are 7 included, there is at least some adult sexualabuse 8 crimes against adults that are being swept up even if it 9 applies to all three categories. 10             And also in Section 2251(e), the  11 the enhancement for child pornography production 12 offenses, the only way that you could read that 13 provision is to include sexual abuse offenses against 14 adults. 15             And so it's not the case that there is this 16 very clear pattern where Congress was only including 17 child victim counterparts to all of the Federal offenses 18 that it was putting on the list. 19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. O'Connell  20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is Petitioner right when 21 Petitioner says that it was the Department of Justice's 22 original view that involving a minor or ward, it 23 modified all three categories?  That that was  the 24 first position that the government took and then the 25 government changed?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1             MS. O'CONNELL:  No.  I  I  I don't think 2 that that is an official position that the government 3 took.  We never took that position in a brief.  Any time 4 we were confronted with actually interpreting the 5 statute as a legal matter, we have contended that 6 involving a minor or ward applies only to the last 7 category. 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where did you get that idea 9 from, then? 10             Where did he get that idea?  What  what 11 had the Department said that  that suggested the 12 opposite? 13             MS. O'CONNELL:  There was the  this letter 14 submitted in 1998 that the Petitioner cites where, when 15 the  the author of the letter  the  the point of 16 the paragraph is to say, look, Congress, in the  the 17 sexual abuse provision or the recidivist provision 18 for  for receipt and distribution offenses in 19 2252(b)(1), you have all these State law crimes that you 20 didn't include on the  on the list of predicate 21 offenses for 2252(b)(2), the possession offenses, and we 22 think you should line them up. 23             In summarizing that argument, the drafter of 24 the letter referred to them as "child molestation 25 crimes" or "child abuse crimes."  It was an  it was an

3 But it was just a useful way of summarizing what was

4 there and what would have been most 

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Surely it shows 

6             MS. O'CONNELL:   for Congress.

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  that  that an

8 intelligent person could think that that's what this

9 involved.

10             MS. O'CONNELL:  I 

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume that the person

12 read this and  and thought that that's what it meant.

13             MS. O'CONNELL:  And  and, Justice Scalia,

14 I think that's why the canons of interpretation don't

15 get anybody a hundred percent of the way there.

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I agree.  And what I worry

17 about is the rule of lenity.  You have these dueling

18 canons, and you have a rule that when the government

19 sends somebody to jail for ten years, it has to turn

20 sharp corners.  It has to dot every I and cross every T.

21 It has to be clear.

22             And, you know, I  we've been discussing

23 this dueling canons and so forth.  My goodness, I have

24 no  I have no assurance what the right answer is.  But

25 I know that somebody could read this and think that it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 means what the petitioner says it means.  And if that's 2 the case, it seems to me the rule of lenity comes into 3 play.  That's  that's what concerns me most about this 4 case, not the dueling canons. 5             MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Scalia, I think if 6 you read the text of the statute once, you may think, I 7 don't know what this means.  It could go either way. 8 But if you just read the rest of the list of things that 9 Congress included and take a look at it, we think 10 there's four things that jump out that make clear that 11 involving a minor or ward only is modifying the last 12 category.  The first is the  the redundancy problem 13 that Petitioner's interpretation creates. 14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, could I ask about 15 your  your basic theory as to that, which, if I 16 understand it, says the reason why we shouldn't worry 17 about the redundancy you create is because Congress just 18 wanted to make absolutely clear that the sexual abuse 19 was also sexual abuse involving somebody who couldn't 20 consent.  That's basically your theory. 21             And there is a very easy way to do that, and 22 it would have completely made this  I mean, made this 23 a hundred percent clear.  Congress would just have said 24 aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual abuse 25 involving a minor or ward.  And just by using the exact
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 same language, it would have been clear, but the

34

2 distinction was between sexual abuse and sexual abuse

3 involving a minor or ward.

4             But Congress doesn't do that, right?

5 Congress changes the language of the third noun.  And

6 that's what creates the puzzlement.  And  and so it

7 seems to me that your theory doesn't really cohere with

8 the fact that this third term  although, nobody can

9 say exactly what it means that is different  the third

10 term is linguistically dissimilar from the second one.

11             MS. O'CONNELL:  It is, but  but under a

12 generic interpretation of sexual abuse, any generic

13 definition that a court has come up with, I think one

14 that is a typical one is sexual conduct that uses or

15 misuses or injures a victim so as to cause harm or

16 damage.  They all include sexual conduct.  And so

17 regardless of whether sexual conduct is  you know,

18 under the Federal law, sexual conduct could be both a

19 sexual act or a sexual contact, anything that's defined

20 within the Federal provision.  But the term "sexual

21 abuse" was already broad enough to cover abusive sexual

22 conduct.

23             I can't say that I know why Congress didn't

24 say "sexual abuse of a minor or ward" as opposed to

25 "abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward."  But

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
35 1 I think the key part of it to focus on is the fact that 2 they use the term "involving a minor or ward."  It's the 3 same category or category of people that they are trying 4 to pick up that's reflected in the prohibitions on 5 sexual  6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, why not just say 7  drop the "abusive"?  Just say "sexual conduct with a 8 minor or a ward"?  Because now you have to deal with the 9 adjective "abusive."  So how does that get you to 10 consent or no consent? 11             MS. O'CONNELL:  I think Congress could have 12 done this without saying abusive, but, you know, the 13 Federal sexualabuse statute of  of a minor or ward is 14 called sexual abuse of a minor or ward.  They also 15 include the word "abusive."  I think it's just  the 16 ambiguity really is that abuse could mean different 17 things depending on who the victim is.  Something could 18 be abusive because it's done to or in front of a child 19 but not an adult.  And so that may be  it's not a 20 reason why Congress wouldn't  needed to use the word 21 "abusive," but there  there is a reason  it is a 22 reason why there could be some daylight between the two 23 categories. 24             JUSTICE BREYER:  What were the  what were 25 the other three?  You said there were four reasons.  I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 started where I think Justice Scalia did.  Of course, I 2 might more often than he think that the canons don't 3 help us all that much.  And this  this is a poster 4 child, I think, for that proposition. 5             And so you said, no, there are four things 6 here that show that this isn't ambiguous.  You shouldn't 7 end up that way.  Now, one was a redundancy, which I'm 8 not sure what it was, and then you didn't get to the 9 other three, which I'd like to hear. 10             MS. O'CONNELL:  Okay. 11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I apologize for that.  I 12 jumped in on it. 13             MS. O'CONNELL:  No apology necessary. 14             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it wasn't. 15             MS. O'CONNELL:  The second reason why we 16 think the Petitioner's interpretation doesn't make sense 17 is because in the penalty provision for production 18 offenses Section 2251(e), Petitioner agrees that the 19 only way you can read that penalty provision is to 20 include State sexual abuse offenses against adults, 21 because Congress worded it slightly differently.  They 22 included all the same crimes, but the way that provision 23 is  reads, it says, "State laws relating to aggravated 24 sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact 25 involving a minor or a ward or sex trafficking of
Alderson Reporting Company

1 children."

Official

37

2             So it's no longer  involving a minor or

3 ward is no longer a modifier that appears at the end of

4 a list.  This is at page 13A of the appendix to the gray

5 brief.

6             And so there's only one possible

7 interpretation of the list of State sexualabuse

8 offenses in Section 2251(e), and there's two possible

9 interpretations of the  the same three crimes in the

10 next provision.  And so the Court would have a choice

11 between saying that those  the State sexual abuse

12 offenses have different scopes in the two provisions.

13             Third is that it ignores  Petitioner's

14 interpretation ignores the clear parallel between the 

15 the three main categories of sexual abuse offenses in

16 Chapter 109A, the Federal offenses.

17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  And the other?

18             MS. O'CONNELL:  That's the  and the three

19 categories that it created for State sexual offenses.

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  And the fourth.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is not a parallel

22 if  if you read the word, right?

23             MS. O'CONNELL:  It's not exactly parallel.

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Contact is not conduct.

25             MS. O'CONNELL:  I  I think that's  that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
38 1 is debatable.  I mean, there's  there's sexual conduct 2  3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's debatable that contact 4 and conduct are different words?  That's not debatable. 5             MS. O'CONNELL:  Not that they're different 6 words.  But I think even Petitioner points out that in 7 the abusive sexual contact provision, sexual contact 8 is  they start out by calling it sexual conduct in 9 circumstances where it didn't amount to a sexual act. 10 It's all  11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  You're not suggesting this 12 is just a scrivener's error, are you?  That it was meant 13 to be contact? 14             MS. O'CONNELL:  I think the  they both do 15 the same job.  So I don't  I don't know why it was 16 changed, but I don't think there is a reason why it's  17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Fourth, fourth. 18             MS. O'CONNELL:  The fourth is that 19 Petitioner's interpretation would frustrate the purpose 20 of the statute because under the categorical approach, 21 it would exclude as predicates any sexual abuse crimes 22 that were committed against children if the defendant 23 was convicted under a generally applicable sexualabuse 24 statute. 25             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So he'll say "or" is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 in this one and it's not in the other one for a reason. 2 He'll say they're superfluous reading both ways.  He'll 3 say that  I can't remember the third  but the fourth 4 he's going to say, yeah, it's underinclusive versus 5 overinclusive.  Yours is it would be somewhat 6 underinclusive for the reason you say, and you take 7 your reading, it will be overinclusive for the reason he 8 says. 9             So if we're at  this is the only place 10 that  if we are absolutely at equipoise, which I can't 11 say we are now, but I think it through  if we are 12 absolutely at equipoise, before turning to the rule of 13 lenity, I would like your comment on my temptation to 14 say at least here, the legislative history helps.  And 15 indeed  16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I knew you were going to 17 say that. 18             (Laughter.) 19             JUSTICE BREYER:  Indeed  20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I knew it. 21             JUSTICE BREYER:   it isn't just a letter 22 from the Justice Department.  It is that the report, the 23 way these are actually written is that a general idea is 24 given to a person whose job it is to draft.  And that 25 drafter tries to put in words the general intention
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that's been described, and the report is used to

40

2 describe what the general intention was.  I'm not saying

3 a hundred percent, but very often with technical

4 statutes, that's how it works.

5             So I read that report, and what do I

6 discover?  A repeat offender with a prior conviction

7 under datada, or under any State child abuse law, or

8 law relating to the production receipt or distribution

9 of child pornography.  And it is only two years later

10 after they pass that that the Justice Department writes

11 its letter noting that the provision they just passed

12 involved individuals with prior convictions for child

13 abuse.  And recommending an enhanced penalty as well if

14 they had a prior conviction for sexual abuse of a minor.

15             Okay.  So I read that and said, short, but

16 clear.  And that's what the drafter would have been

17 looking at when  the first one, anyway  working with

18 the staff of the committee when trying to translate

19 general intentions of senators and representatives into

20 actual language.  And I think it's not contrary to

21 popular belief to say that senators and representatives

22 do hire staff to do such things and do not sit there

23 with pen and pencil thinking, where does the "or" go?

24             Okay?  So what is  what is the Justice

25 Department's response to that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MS. O'CONNELL:  I think there are two

41

2 things.  The first is the response I gave before, which

3 is just that this may have been a useful shorthand way

4 to describe the conduct that Congress would have been

5 most concerned about, for the person writing the report

6 and for the Department of Justice trying to convince

7 Congress to add these State law crimes to the child

8 pornography possession recidivist enhancement.

9             And I think the other response is just that,

10 even if you think the letter is against us, you look at

11 what Congress actually did.  And they created a  a

12 provision that basically parallels the three Federal

13 offenses.  They included many Federal offenses that can

14 involve adult victims.  And then eight years later, when

15 they added State law predicates to Section 2251(e), they

16 made very clear they understood the modifier to apply

17 only to the last category.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. O'Connell, you  you

19 don't think Congress can leave it to its staff to decide

20 what a statute means, do you?

21             MS. O'CONNELL:  No.

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't legislative power

23 nondelegable?

24             MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.  We think the  the

25 most important thing here is to look at the text of the

Alderson Reporting Company

42

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  You asked a really quite

3 broad  I don't know what the 4,000 people over there

4 are doing, if  if they're not entrusted by their

5 principals to write words on paper that would reflect

6 the general idea.

7             You think they can't do that?

8             MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Breyer, I think

9 it  as we explained in the brief, it  it may have

10 just been a useful shorthand way to describe the most

11 serious conducts included in that provision.

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who is  who is the

13 author of this?

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know what

15 the hundred people 

16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who is the author?

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   are doing over

18 there if they're delegating everything to the staff.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This  this  this

20 letter that so much discussion has revolved around, who

21 was it in the Department of Justice that wrote?

22             MS. O'CONNELL:  It was the Acting Assistant

23 Attorney General Ann Harkins.

24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you talk about the

25 rule of lenity?  Does the rule of lenity apply with the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 same force when the question is the substantive

43

2 definition of a crime as distinct from the penalty

3 that's attached?

4             MS. O'CONNELL:  The Court 

5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me there's an

6 argument that it should apply equally, but have we

7 talked about that?

8             MS. O'CONNELL:  I think the Court has

9 typically applied the samestrength rule of lenity to

10 both substantive provisions and penalty provisions.

11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That  that makes a great

12 deal of sense.  It  other than that rule of lenity to

13 the extent it's based on notice, it seems to have

14 somewhat more force when it applies to the substantive

15 definition of the offense as opposed to the punishment.

16 But I  you could argue it either  either way.

17             But have we  have we talked about any

18 distinction?

19             MS. O'CONNELL:  There has not been a

20 distinction in the Court's cases.  There have been a few

21 times where criminal defendants have tried to say that

22 there should be a supercharged rule of lenity in a case

23 that's talking about mandatory minimums or maximums or

24 consecutive sentence.  And the Court has resisted that.

25             And I think this would be not a  not a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 good case for the Court to go down that path because

44

2 the  the guidelines range for this particular criminal

3 defendant was 78 to 97 months.  His minimum was 120.

4 It's not actually a huge difference.  And under  under

5 current law, the statutory maximum would have been the

6 same, regardless of  of whether this enhancement

7 applied.

8             Justice Breyer has helpfully walked me

9 through all of my points; so if the Court has no further

10 questions.

11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, can I go back to

12 the  to the language?  You know, it's confusing

13 language.  And I showed it to all my clerks and  and

14 basically said how would you read it.  And two came out

15 on one side, and two came out on the other side.  But 

16 but I'm sort of left with this feeling that it  we're

17 not in  in a situation where there are dueling canons.

18 We actually might be in a situation where one canon

19 trumps the other.

20             I mean, you have this lastantecedent rule,

21 and it's an important rule.  But it gives way when a

22 certain  when there is a certain quality to all the

23 antecedents when they're all parallel and when the last

24 modifier equally sensibly refers to them all, right?

25 And that that's a situation, so that seriesqualifier

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 rule is in some sense a rule about when the

45

2 lastantecedent rule doesn't apply.

3             So I guess I would ask you to comment on

4 that.

5             MS. O'CONNELL:  There  I have a couple of

6 different responses.

7             The first one is that the context is the

8 most important thing.  And it's not the case that the

9 Court hasn't applied the lastantecedent rule in cases

10 where the statute involves a list of parallel terms.

11             I think the FTC v. Mandel Brothers is the

12 best example of that.  There's a list of a purchaser,

13 consignee, factor, bailee, correspondent or agent, or

14 any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially

15 in fur products or fur.

16             And the Court said it didn't make sense to

17 only apply this to a purchaser who is also dealing in

18 the  in the fur products, and so we're going to apply

19 it only to the last antecedent.  The seriesqualifier

20 principle, you know, petitioner relies quite heavily on

21 the explanation in  in Justice Scalia's book that goes

22 through all of the canons.  And the book even says that

23 the series qualifier principle more so than others is

24 highly dependent on context and can be overcome if

25 something doesn't feel right about the way that it 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the statute reads when you apply it.

46

2             And we think the clearest indication here

3 that it doesn't make sense for the qualifier to apply to

4 all three of the categories is that it  it literally

5 renders categories B and C the same.

6             I'll  I'll point out just one other thing.

7             Justice Breyer, you mentioned during the

8 Petitioner's argument that you noticed that each of the

9 Federal predicates, 2241, 2242, 2243, have a provision

10 that applies to minors and wards.  Section 2242 does

11 not.

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  But it's followed by

13 what could be taken as.  They just gave it a different

14 number; isn't that right?  2243 does, in fact, deal with

15 minors?

16             MS. O'CONNELL:  2243 is the sexual abuse of

17 a minor or ward provision.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.

19             MS. O'CONNELL:  2241, aggravated sexual

20 abuse, has a special subsection dealing with very young

21 children.  Section 2242, the general sexual abuse crime,

22 does not include any specific for minors or wards.

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I  I

24 saw that.

25             MS. O'CONNELL:  All right.  Thank you.

47 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 2             Mr. Zas, you have four minutes. 3            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD S. ZAS 4                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 5             MR. ZAS:  Justice Alito, Justice Scalia, and 6 Justice Breyer I think all echoed the same theme, which 7 is, at the very least, this statute is not unambiguously 8 correct, which is the standard language this Court used 9 in Granderson for when the rule of lenity must apply. 10             So under that rule  11             JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't think I actually 12 said anything about the rule of lenity. 13             MR. ZAS:  No, no.  Your  Your Honor did 14 say  15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think he ever 16 mentioned the rule of lenity. 17             MR. ZAS:  But he did say  he did use the 18 word "ambiguity," and he did say that the statute was 19 poorly drafted.  And I think  I think we certainly 20 would agree that this is  this is not a model of the 21 drafter's art, by any means.  But  22             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you  you are making 23 an argument that an awful lot of this big book is  is 24 subject to the rule of lenity because a lot of it is 25 very poorly drafted.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1             MR. ZAS:  Well, this is  this is  this 2 is not just poorly drafted.  We  both sides have gone 3 through all the canons, all the tools, legislative 4 history.  And at the end of the day, as Justice Kagan 5 pointed out, you can read it reasonably both ways.  But 6 we think as a matter of text we actually have the better 7 reading. 8             My colleague from the Solicitor General's 9 office conceded when she was up here that there is no 10 difference between sexual abuse and abusive sexual 11 conduct.  So the parties agree on that, and yet we draw 12 radically different conclusions. 13             The government says the solution is to just 14 limit the modifier to the second term, but that doesn't 15 eliminate surplusage.  It causes the entire modifying 16 phrase, the entire category, abusive sexual conduct 17 involving a minor or ward, to effectively drop out of 18 the statute. 19             Our solution is to say, give the 20 nonredundant portion of the statute involving a minor or 21 ward some meaning.  Congress used those words for a 22 reason.  And the reason was the problem they were 23 focused on, which is the danger to children. 24             So the way to preserve effect for the  25 that modifying phrase is to apply it to all three terms,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 which makes perfect sense.  If two of them mean exactly 2 the same thing, why in the world would Congress limit 3 only one to minors and children?  They're synonyms.  It 4 makes sense  5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My problem is, why would 6 they include adults as a predicate for the minimum in 7 Federal crimes but not in straight State crimes. 8             MR. ZAS:  Because  9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know they have done it 10 in other situations. 11             MR. ZAS:  Yes. 12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why here?  If 13 they're worried about the abuse of children, why would 14 they not capture every conceivable person or every 15 conceivable abusive act towards kids? 16             MR. ZAS:  Well, in  in addition to the 17 fairness and administrability problems we've identified, 18 Congress reasonably could have determined that people 19 who commit abuse offenses against adults, as bad as that 20 is, don't pose the same level of danger to children. 21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, she's saying why  22 but they  they do include the sexual abuse adult when 23 you're talking about prior conviction of a Federal 24 crime. 25             MR. ZAS:  Yes.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  And the answer, I guess, 2 has to be that you  the drafters know what they're 3 getting into with the Federal crimes, and they have no 4 idea what they're getting into when they're dealing with 5 50 State crimes.  Is that your response? 6             MR. ZAS:  That's  7             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not trying to put words 8 in your mouth.  I want to know what  that's what I 9 read in the  10             MR. ZAS:  Your Honor, that's one answer. 11             JUSTICE ALITO:  Let's take a  an offense 12 as to which there isn't much ambiguity:  Rape.  All 13 right?  Under the  the ordinary meaning, why would 14 rape in a Federal enclave qualify; rape a few yards 15 away, perhaps, in State territory, not  not qualify? 16             MR. ZAS:  Because Congress was not focused 17 on symmetry in that way.  The  the Federal predicates 18 were added by the 1994 Congress.  They were  they 19 were  yes.  They were made Federal predicates.  The 20 later Congress, 1996 Congress, was the one that added 21 the State law predicates. 22             So it's not as if the same legislators are 23 making this decision at the same time:  Should we cover 24 Federal and  and  25             Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry.
