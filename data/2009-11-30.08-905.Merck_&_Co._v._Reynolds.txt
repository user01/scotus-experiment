1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:05 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Case 08-905, Merck and Company v. 5 Reynolds. 6 Mr. Shanmugam. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, 10 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 The statute of limitations for private 12 securities fraud claims incorporates the equitable 13 principle known as the discovery rule; that is, the 14 principle that the limitations period begins to run from 15 the discovery of the facts constituting the violation. 16 Under the discovery rule, a plaintiff who suspects the 17 possibility that the defendant has engaged in wrongdoing 18 is on inquiry notice and thereafter must exercise 19 reasonable diligence in investigating his potential 20 claim. 21 The court of appeals in this case erred at 22 the first step -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, that presumes 24 that then Congress is using unnecessary words when it 25 differentiates in a statute between discovery of facts

1 constituting a violation and a different statute, like 2 section 13 or 77m, however you want to call it, when 3 it says "due diligence." 4 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Congress did say that, 5 Justice Sotomayor, in section 77m, section 13 of 6 the 1933 Act, but we don't think -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are we supposed to 8 presume that they like using unnecessary words? 9 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we don't think that 10 Congress's inclusion of that express language referring 11 to constructive discovery in that provision was 12 significant, and that's because of the default 13 understanding -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're answering me 15 yes, it's unnecessary. 16 MR. SHANMUGAM: We don't think it makes any 17 difference in terms of the application of the rule. 18 And, indeed, there are cases applying section 13 of the 19 1933 Act that interpret it in exactly the same manner 20 that we're suggesting the Court should interpret section 21 1658(b) in, in this case. 22 And that's simply because the default 23 understanding has long been that when a statute of 24 limitations is triggered by a discovery rule, that 25 includes both express and -- both actual and
4 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 constructive discovery, and with the exception of three 2 sentences in Respondents' brief, the parties before this 3 Court are really in agreement on that proposition. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you want to go beyond 5 constructive discovery? 6 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, no, Justice Scalia. 7 We believe that the concept of constructive discovery 8 itself incorporates the specific principle of inquiry 9 notice, which is -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think there's a 11 line between constructive discovery -- constructive 12 discovery asks, when should you have known? And the 13 rule you are arguing for is something beyond that. 14 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we are asking the 15 Court to adopt the principle of inquiry notice, but we 16 don't believe that that is a particularly significant 17 additional step. And that is simply because that 18 principle has likewise long been understood as part of 19 the discovery rule with regard to fraud claims 20 specifically, and it was well understood to be part of 21 the application of the discovery rule with regard to 22 securities fraud claims specifically, at the time 23 Congress enacted section 1658(b). 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Under your rule, what 25 happens when you are put on inquiry notice? That's the
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 point at which you should be conducting additional 2 investigation, right? 3 MR. SHANMUGAM: That's right, and at least 4 where -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's where the 6 -- statute begins to run, at the point when you 7 should have conducted additional investigation? 8 MR. SHANMUGAM: At least where a plaintiff 9 fails to conduct an investigation -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 11 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- as is the case here -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 13 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- the limitations period -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would you -16 what would you -- what phrase would you use to describe 17 what happens when inquiry notice culminates in finding 18 out? You have to say, oh, there looks like there might 19 be scienter, I have to look at it. And after a year, 20 you find it; yes, there was scienter. What -- what 21 would you call what happens when they find out there was 22 scienter? 23 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think it's true that 24 at that point the plaintiff discovers the remaining 25 fact, and so to the extent that the Court embraces our
6 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 fallback approach, under which a plaintiff who actually 2 exercises reasonable diligence and conducts an 3 investigation gets the benefit of additional time, one 4 can essentially embrace and codify that understanding of 5 the words of the statute, which is to say a plaintiff at 6 the point of inquiry notice suspects the possibility 7 that the plaintiff has a claim. The plaintiff may not 8 be in possession of information bearing on each and 9 every element of the underlying violation, but if the 10 plaintiff at that point exercises reasonable diligence 11 and uncovers, discovers any remaining information -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how could -13 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- at that point the 14 plaintiff will have discovered the underlying facts. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how could that -16 let's descend from the abstract to the concrete that is 17 this case. The story that was being put out is, yes, 18 this drug may produce heart attacks, but there's no 19 indication that it does so -- that the other drug that 20 it's comparing with may have an anti-heart attack 21 element. And that's accepted. We could -- it could be 22 one explanation; it could be the other. 23 How would the most diligent plaintiff have 24 gone about finding out whether Merck really had no good 25 faith belief in this so-called naproxen hypothesis?
7 Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. SHANMUGAM: Right. Well, just to be 2 clear, as a preliminary matter, as I understand 3 Respondents' position, it is that the alleged 4 misstatement in this case is that Merck made 5 misstatements when it expressed its belief that the 6 naproxen hypothesis was the likely explanation for the 7 disparity in cardiovascular events that was reported in 8 the VIGOR study. 9 Now, as a first-order response, we believe 10 that there was considerable information in the public 11 domain suggesting the possibility that Petitioners had 12 engaged in securities fraud when they made those 13 statements. At that point, we believe that Respondents 14 were on inquiry notice, and that is a point that is more 15 than 2 years before the limitations period -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, excuse me. To -17 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- before the plaintiffs 18 filed. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: To say that, you must 20 believe that there is substantial evidence of fraud when 21 there is simply substantial evidence of inaccuracy, 22 without -23 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there was more than 24 that. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- without any evidence of
8 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 scienter. What evidence of scienter was there? 2 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, most notably, you had 3 the FDA specifically accusing Merck of deliberate 4 wrongdoing in connection with its public representations 5 concerning the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but deliberate 7 wrongdoing -- as I understood that, it was simply you 8 didn't give adequate weight to the -- to the other -- to 9 the other side of it. 10 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, but the FDA did more 11 than that in the warning letter. It accused Merck of 12 misrepresenting the cardiovascular safety profile of 13 Vioxx, and it accused Merck of minimizing the potential 14 of cardiovascular arrests. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: That means it's -- that 16 means it's wrong. You can misrepresent something 17 without having scienter to defraud. 18 MR. SHANMUGAM: But I do think that the fair 19 reading of the FDA warning letter is that the FDA was 20 accusing Merck of intentional misrepresentation. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it didn't stop it. 22 Didn't -- didn't Merck submit a curative label, 23 whatever, and the FDA said that was okay? And that -24 that submission continued to give the naproxen 25 hypothesis? Not the -- the reason that we are seeing

1 this heart attack thing showing up is that the other 2 drug has a -- has a clotting inhibitor. 3 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it is true that Merck 4 continued to maintain its belief in the naproxen 5 hypothesis. We don't believe that that is sufficient 6 somehow to toll the running of the limitations period. 7 Such an approach would render the limitations period in 8 section 1658(b) effectively triggered by a continuing 9 violation theory. 10 But I do want to get back to your question 11 about what more the plaintiffs in this case could have 12 done, because I do think that that is a very critical 13 question here. 14 We do believe that there was sufficient 15 information in the public domain to cause Respondents to 16 suspect the possibility that Petitioners had engaged in 17 wrongdoing. At that point, there are several things 18 that Respondents could have done. They could have 19 talked to experts to test the validity of Merck's 20 naproxen hypothesis. 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: But one of the things they 22 could not have done was file a lawsuit right then. Is 23 that correct? Because they would not have had adequate 24 facts to comply with the rules barring plaintiffs from 25 filing suits based on information and belief?
10 Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we don't believe that 2 the Respondents would have had sufficient information to 3 file a complaint then; and, indeed, we have taken the 4 position that they still don't have sufficient facts to 5 satisfy the PSLRA's pleading requirements. And I think 6 it's notable in this case that Respondents really can't 7 point to any facts that came into the public domain 8 between the date of the FDA warning letter and the date 9 in October of 2003 when the plaintiffs first filed 10 suit -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if we had that 12 -13 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- that somehow provided 14 them additional information. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we had that kind of 16 analysis, where the -- where the company has to reserve 17 all of its defenses, then we would never get to the 18 statute of limitations problem. I think we have to 19 assume that the -- that their theory of the case is 20 correct. We have to -- to assume it for statute of 21 limitations purposes. Of course, you deny it. 22 MR. SHANMUGAM: Right. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I think you 24 don't get -- get very far. And -- and it seems to me, 25 as Justice Stevens's and Justice Ginsburg's questions
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 indicate, that the companies can't have it both ways. 2 They can't endorse the Twombly case and then say just an 3 inquiry notice of a general -- of a general nature 4 suffices. You have to have specific evidence of 5 scienter. And there's nothing here to indicate that 6 the plaintiffs had that. 7 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it may very well -8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even on -- on -- but you 9 have you to say, on their theory of the case. 10 MR. SHANMUGAM: It may very well be that the 11 plaintiffs have to possess at least some information 12 bearing on scienter. And again, under our fallback 13 approach, where a plaintiff suspects that a defendant 14 has engaged in securities fraud but doesn't, at the 15 point of inquiry notice, possess information bearing on 16 every element of the claim, if the plaintiff then 17 investigates, the plaintiff will have the benefit of 18 additional time until the plaintiff comes into 19 possession of -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me -21 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- information relating to 22 scienter. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me what 24 that investigation would entail? Meaning, you started 25 by saying, go talk to experts, but I'm not sure what
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 talking to experts would have added to the market mix of 2 information. You either pick one expert who said the 3 theory was sound or one who didn't. 4 Outside of publicly available information, 5 what -- and finding it -- what other inquiry could they 6 have made that would have led them to discover 7 sufficient information to file a lawsuit? 8 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think, Justice Sotomayor, 9 that there are at least a couple of other things they 10 could have done. One thing that they could have done is 11 talked to former Merck employees and consultants. 12 Another thing that they could have done is 13 talk to the lawyers who had filed other Vioxx-related 14 lawsuits. There were quite a few as of the inquiry 15 notice date. There were even more by the time they 16 actually filed the securities fraud complaint. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming they had talked 18 to those lawyers, is there anything to suggest that 19 those lawyers had more information than the ones they 20 included in the publicly available lawsuit? 21 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there's no way to 22 know, of course, because the plaintiffs in this case 23 failed to conduct an investigation at all. One other 24 thing -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't answered my
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 question. Is there some information in some publicly 2 filed lawsuit up until the time of the filing of this 3 lawsuit that disclosed more information about scienter 4 than existed? 5 MR. SHANMUGAM: I would say that the very 6 fact that other lawsuits were filed that accused Merck 7 of making intentional misrepresentations with regard to 8 the very same statements that are at issue here actually 9 itself constitutes additional information that should 10 have put the plaintiffs on inquiry notice in the first 11 place. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How when -- when there 13 were -- doctors across the country were continuing to 14 write prescriptions for this, when the market apparently 15 accepted this -- it may be one thing, it may be another 16 -- but there were not signals from the market itself, 17 and the medical profession seemed to be going on and 18 writing -- lots of doctors were writing prescriptions 19 for this? 20 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, first of all, Justice 21 Ginsburg, the market did respond. We don't think that a 22 market response is dispositive for purposes of -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Very brief. 24 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- inquiry notice analysis. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a brief drop,
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 but it came right back up again. 2 MR. SHANMUGAM: A brief drop in response to 3 the FDA warning letter, a substantial drop, but the 4 stock price did rebound; and a longer term drop over the 5 course of 2001 when the various other events that are 6 discussed in the briefs were occurring. So I think that 7 there was a -8 JUSTICE ALITO: Your arguing that if the -9 if the plaintiffs' attorneys made diligent 10 investigation, they would have uncovered facts about the 11 safety of Vioxx that the FDA was unaware of? 12 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -13 JUSTICE ALITO: Because the FDA never took 14 any action during this period, other than changing the 15 label. 16 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the FDA did issue the 17 warning letter, and the label was changed to incorporate 18 language indicating the cardiovascular disparity from 19 the VIGOR study. That took place in 2002. And I think 20 that it is noteworthy for purposes of the merits of this 21 case that the FDA itself thought that that was 22 sufficient. 23 But in this case, Respondents seem to be 24 pointing to much later information as the point on which 25 they were on inquiry notice. They seem to suggest in
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 their brief that they were not on inquiry notice until 2 as late as 2004 when The Wall Street Journal published 3 an article disclosing certain internal e-mails. 4 Now, leaving aside the sort of fundamental 5 embarrassment to their position, I would submit, that 6 that suggests that they were on inquiry notice after the 7 complaint was actually filed. I -8 JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- I take it the 9 point of general principle, as opposed to this case, is 10 I take it you will concede the following: Let's imagine 11 on January 1 some investors look out and there are 12 not only storm clouds, thunder, whatever you want, lots 13 to put them on notice. So then the statute begins to 14 run. But it could be the case that once they start to 15 investigate, there is a key element, say scienter, the 16 only evidence for which would take them an extra six 17 months to find, because it's in the hands of a person 18 who is in jail in Burma. All right? 19 (Laughter.) 20 So, you are prepared to say in that 21 situation the statute does not begin to run on 22 January 1; it begins to run on July 1, if they really 23 look into it. But if they don't really look into it, 24 then it's January 1. That's I think the basic 25 difference, as I gather, between the sides, or one major
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 difference in this case. 2 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that's correct, 3 Justice Breyer. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if that's 5 correct, why? That is to say, it seems to me that, in 6 treating these differently, you have proposed a real 7 morass for courts to get into. 8 Did they really investigate on January 1? 9 Was it an inadequate investigation? Was it a thorough 10 investigation? Along with the difficulty of drawing a 11 distinction between why it should be that that 12 difference should exist, why not just apply the same 13 rule to the investors whether they really do investigate 14 or whether they don't and in both cases the statute 15 begins to run on July 1, not January 1? 16 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think there's no doubt, 17 Justice Breyer, that the easiest rule in some sense for 18 the Court to apply would be a rule that started the 19 clock running from the date of inquiry notice. But when 20 you're comparing our fallback position, a rule that is 21 triggered by an actual investigation by the plaintiff, 22 with Respondents' rule, which looks to what a 23 hypothetical plaintiff could have done, I really do 24 believe that our rule is going to be much easier to 25 administer because Respondents' rule by definition calls

1 for speculation. And in the context -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not say that because 3 of one -- one element of the claim is scienter, that 4 there's no inquiry notice based on -- there may have 5 been a misrepresentation, whether it was innocent or 6 deliberate, we have no way of knowing. Why not say 7 because scienter is an element of the claim, and you 8 can't get your foot in the door in the court unless you 9 can plead that with particularity, that it's only when 10 you have that indication that you have what you call 11 inquiry notice? 12 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, again, Justice 13 Ginsburg, the fundamental inquiry, so to speak, in 14 determining whether a plaintiff is on inquiry notice is 15 simply whether a reasonable investor based on the 16 information in the public domain would at least suspect 17 the possibility that the defendant has engaged in 18 securities fraud. And a plaintiff need not possess 19 information bearing on each and every element of the 20 underlying violation in order to be on inquiry notice. 21 Were the rule otherwise, the concept of inquiry notice 22 would collapse -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's inquiry -- it's 24 notice of what? And -- the law is that one element 25 that must be pleaded with particularity. If you don't
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 have that, you have no claim. 2 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -- well, that's 3 correct. But this Court has never tethered the running 4 of the limitations period to the ability to satisfy any 5 applicable heightened pleading requirements. Indeed, to 6 the contrary, in Rotella, this Court held quite the 7 opposite. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if not, then the 9 whole storm warning theory that you have conceded 10 doesn't work. 11 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I -- I'm by no means 12 conceding that the storm warning theory doesn't work. I 13 am simply suggesting that a plaintiff need not possess 14 information specifically relating to scienter in order 15 to be on inquiry notice. And that, we would -16 JUSTICE BREYER: Then he would have to file 17 a complaint possibly before he has enough evidence to 18 even bring a case. That is, suppose my guy in Burma is 19 going to be in jail for 3 years; he can't get to him 20 for 3 years. Now, he's going to have to file his 21 complaint before he could have the evidence that there 22 was scienter. Now, that doesn't make sense to me. 23 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there are certainly 24 going to be cases, Justice Breyer, in which a plaintiff 25 frankly can never get to the point where the plaintiff
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 can satisfy the PSLRA's pleading requirements. And I 2 think it's noteworthy that -3 JUSTICE STEVENS: In those cases, of course, 4 the statute would not run. Is that right? 5 MR. SHANMUGAM: No. We certainly don't 6 believe -7 JUSTICE STEVENS: If we go back to the text 8 of the statute, it says 2 years after discovery, and you 9 argue it should mean 2 years after he should have 10 discovered, though -- and that period being measured by 11 a date from inquiry notice, which is not mentioned in 12 the statute at all. 13 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that in 14 understanding the term "discovery," Justice Stevens -15 that term really can't be meaningfully understood 16 without reference to the common law against which the 17 statute was enacted. And this Court in interpreting 18 discovery rules -19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree that you 20 are reading as though it meant 2 years after he should 21 have discovered? 22 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that's right, and, 23 again, I think that getting to the point of "should have 24 discovered" is a fairly modest step. But this Court has 25 repeatedly made clear in interpreting the discovery rule
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that a plaintiff must exercise reasonable diligence in 2 order to invoke the rule's benefits, and that is simply 3 because the discovery rule is an equitable rule, and it 4 effectively incorporates the principle of laches, that 5 is the principle that a plaintiff who sleeps on his 6 rights is not entitled to the benefits of equity. 7 Indeed -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, in Lampf we 9 -- we had to choose between what statute of limitations 10 provision, Federal one, we thought applied. And we had 11 two choices: One was section 77m, which reads: "After 12 such discovery" -- "after the discovery of the untrue 13 statement or the omission or after such discovery should 14 have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence." 15 That was one choice. 16 The other choice was 78i(e), which simply 17 said: "unless brought within one year after the 18 discovery of the facts constituting the violation." No 19 statement of "or after it should have been made by the 20 exercise," okay? We chose the latter in Lampf. 21 Now, you are telling me that there was no 22 choice between the two, that -- that "after discovery" 23 always means after discovery was made or after it should 24 have been made? What were we doing in Lampf, spinning 25 our wheels?
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, no, I don't -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I read this -- this 3 statute -- and 1658 tracks, not 77m, which says "after 4 discovery should have been made"; it tracks 78i(e), 5 which says "after discovery." Now, to me that means 6 after discovery, period. 7 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Justice Scalia, the 8 Court did choose to essentially incorporate the language 9 from -- it was section 9(e) of the 1934 Act. There were 10 various provisions in the '33 Act and the '34 Act that 11 incorporated discovery rules. And that's one -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, just tell me what the 13 difference it was between 77m and 77i(e)? 14 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was the difference, 16 unless it was that 77m -- I'm sorry, 78i(e) -17 absolutely required knowledge? 18 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think one potential 19 difference is that section 13, section 77m, refers to 20 discovery of the untrue statement or the omission. But 21 I think more broadly with regard to both section 9(e) 22 and the other provisions of the 1934 Act to which the 23 Court looked, courts had actually construed those 24 provisions as reaching both actual and constructive 25 discovery at the time the Court decided Lampf. So I
22 Alderson Reporting Company

1 really don't think -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: So there was no difference 3 between the two -4 MR. SHANMUGAM: No, there was really -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and we were just wasting 6 our time? 7 MR. SHANMUGAM: There was no difference 8 between the two, and I think really for the reasons that 9 the government states in its brief as well as the 10 reasons that we state in our opening brief, the default 11 understanding has always been that a reference to 12 discovery includes at least constructive discovery. And 13 a rule that triggers the limitations period from actual 14 discovery would have significant vices because it would 15 give plaintiffs -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- could you 17 tell me what the difference is between actual knowledge 18 and constructive knowledge? Because as I read the amici 19 who have submitted briefs arguing that actual discovery 20 should be our standard, they appear to say that actual 21 discovery or actual knowledge includes anything that's 22 in the public domain; that parties are presumed -- and 23 we have plenty of cases that say that -- to know what's 24 out there. 25 So outside of that, how would constructive
23 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 knowledge or constructive discovery be any different? 2 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think -3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It would require the 4 shareholder to find the guy in Burma? Or to go and 5 attempt in every case to engage employees in 6 dishonorable conduct by talking about their business in 7 private, company business -- as I understood it, we were 8 asking employees to engage in potentially fiduciary 9 breaches? 10 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think it's an open 11 question, Justice Sotomayor, as to what actual discovery 12 would -- would actually mean, and I think that there 13 would be a pretty good argument that you don't actually 14 discover the underlying facts until the plaintiff 15 himself subjectively actually has them in his 16 possession. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's going 18 further than the amici are suggesting. The amici are 19 suggesting -- and assuming we accept their suggestion -20 that it should be everything that's in the public 21 domain, which seems reasonable to me. 22 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What, in addition, do 24 you think constructive knowledge would include that the 25 actual knowledge standard doesn't?
24 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think it does -2 constructive knowledge obviously also includes 3 information in the public domain, and we believe that 4 the plaintiffs in this case were on inquiry notice 5 precisely because -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Putting all of that -7 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- of that information. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what in addition to 9 that would it include, in your mind? 10 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, for purposes of the 11 inquiry notice analysis, I think that that's all you 12 look to. You look to either information in the 13 plaintiff's possession or information in the public 14 domain. And once there is sufficient information ­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- so you are 16 conceding amici's point that actual -- an actual 17 knowledge standard is the same as a constructive 18 knowledge standard? 19 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I would hope at a 20 minimum that if the Court were to embrace an actual 21 discovery standard, it would look to information in the 22 public domain, precisely because otherwise you really 23 would be rewarding an ostrich plaintiff because a 24 plaintiff who claimed not to read what was in the 25 newspapers could have the benefit of additional time.

1 But -2 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if actual knowledge 3 means things that the plaintiff doesn't actually know, 4 then I don't know what the difference is between actual 5 knowledge and constructive knowledge. It's a 6 meaningless distinction if that's how actual knowledge 7 is defined. 8 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, again, that's not how 9 I would ordinarily understand the phrase "actual 10 knowledge." But I think that it's important to remember 11 that if in essence the standard that this Court were to 12 adopt is a standard that does not start the clock 13 running until there is sufficient information in the 14 public domain for a plaintiff actually to plead a 15 complaint, that would radically extend the limitations 16 period for private securities fraud actions. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the problem -18 MR. SHANMUGAM: No circuit -19 JUSTICE ALITO: What is wrong with the -20 with the inquiry notice rule that the court of appeals 21 in this case set out on pages 29a to 30a of the joint 22 appendix? This is from a Seventh Circuit -- quoting 23 from a Seventh Circuit decision: "The facts 24 constituting inquiry notice must be sufficiently 25 probative of fraud, sufficiently advanced beyond the
26 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 stage of a mere suspicion, sufficiently confirmed or 2 substantiated, not only to incite the victim to 3 investigate but also to enable him to tie up any loose 4 ends and complete the investigation in time to file a 5 timely suit." 6 So that the statute would run upon inquiry 7 notice, provided that within the 2-year period, the 8 plaintiff could, if the plaintiff diligently 9 investigated, find sufficient facts to -- to file a 10 complaint that would satisfy -- satisfy the PLRA? 11 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think I'll answer that 12 question, and then I would like to reserve the balance 13 of my time. 14 I think the only problem with that rule is 15 that, at the tail end, it effectively mandates the same 16 hypothetical plaintiff inquiry that Respondents suggest. 17 It requires a court to attempt to assess whether a 18 plaintiff could have discovered the remaining 19 information within a 2-year period. And that has all 20 of the same vices, we would submit, as Respondents' rule 21 and the government's rule. 22 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 24 Mr. Frederick. 25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
27 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 2 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 3 Justice, and may it please the Court: 4 Our position is that Congress intended the 5 word "discovery" in section 1658 to have its normal and 6 well-established meaning. 7 By contrast, Merck asks the Court to add 8 concepts to section 1658 not found in its text by 9 interpreting the word "discovery" to mean suspicion and 10 for the 2-year limitations period to be triggered when 11 facts cause an investor to suspect the possibility of 12 fraud. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're adding -14 you're adding concepts to it, as well. Nobody arguing 15 before us intends discovery to mean actual discovery. 16 Your -- you say constructive knowledge is enough; don't 17 you? 18 MR. FREDERICK: Well, we say, at the first 19 part of our submission, that the Court can decide the 20 case on an actual discovery -- actual knowledge 21 standard. 22 We have gone on to brief constructive 23 discovery because, prior to 1934, in the numerous State 24 statutes that use the phrase "discovery of facts 25 constituting," many courts had adopted a constructive
28 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 knowledge standard. 2 We think we win under either standard. If 3 the Court decides this is an actual knowledge case -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can -- can you tell me 5 what you see as the difference between the two? I keep 6 going back to what the amici has argued, which is actual 7 knowledge that includes knowledge of what's in the 8 public domain, under the theory that every shareholder 9 is presumed to know what's in the public domain because 10 that's what they buy with and that's the market theory 11 of securities law. 12 So, what do you see as a difference between 13 the two? 14 MR. FREDERICK: In a fraud-on-the-market 15 case, like this one, where an efficient market is 16 pleaded, there's no practical difference. In an 17 individual case, where the securities fraud alleges that 18 an individual investor is harmed by the individual 19 actions of some broker or some other person, there could 20 very well be a difference in terms of what the 21 reasonable investor should have known on the basis of 22 information that would be available. 23 And the point of the constructive knowledge 24 standard was to have plaintiffs not rest on their -25 their ability to hide information, but to be diligent,
29 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 reasonably, in ascertaining that information, and the 2 constructive knowledge standard really came to address a 3 case different from the case that we have here, Justice 4 Sotomayor. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I -- it sounds 6 right, but give me a practical -- give me a practical 7 example -8 MR. FREDERICK: Sure. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- of what you are 10 talking about, where -- where an individual investor 11 would have something that's not in the public domain. 12 MR. FREDERICK: That would be information 13 that the -- the broker, for instance, would have made 14 available to the investor, that the investor simply 15 didn't look at, or that the investor could have asked 16 for, but -- but never followed up in obtaining. 17 And that kind of constructive knowledge 18 standard, this Court has held in numerous cases, dating 19 back to the 19th century, is an appropriate form of 20 attributing knowledge to a reasonable person. 21 And the cases that we've cited in our brief 22 -- Kirby, Wood -- those kinds of cases talk about what a 23 reasonable person in those kinds of circumstances would 24 be imputed to know. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- but actual
30 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 knowledge would include anything the investor had in 2 their possession because that's what actual knowledge 3 is; I have it in my possession -- or I have it in the 4 public domain. You start it from there. 5 MR. FREDERICK: Correct. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The -- the only 7 difference then would be information the individual 8 would have been able to get that wouldn't have been in 9 the public domain? 10 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, through 11 reasonable inquiry, that by following up with questions 12 to the broker or to other persons associated with that 13 entity. It's a different theory, concededly, Justice 14 Sotomayor, in a fraud-on-the-market case, which is what 15 this case is. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- so we are in 17 agreement that on a fraud-on-the-market case, it might 18 have a different -- they would be identical? 19 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, and -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are suggesting that, 21 in an individual fraud case, the inquiry has to be 22 constructive knowledge because there could be things 23 that -24 MR. FREDERICK: It could be actual or 25 constructive, depending on the facts and circumstances,
31 Alderson Reporting Company

1 but the important point to draw away from this is that 2 Congress also wrote in a 5-year period of repose in 3 this statute and followed up on the suggestion of the 4 Lampf dissenters, who believed that the period of repose 5 was too restrictive. 6 So, in 2002, when Congress amended the 7 statute, they cited the Lampf dissenters and extended 8 the period of repose, which created an absolute bar to 9 claims of fraud being brought against defendants. 10 The statute of limitations period -- by 11 using a discovery rule -- was intended to preclude 12 persons from resting on their rights and not taking 13 action when they had discovered the facts constituting 14 the violation. It was not intended -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But when does the ­- when 16 does the 5-year -- what is the trigger for the 17 5-year period? 18 MR. FREDERICK: From the violation. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is the 20 violation? 21 MR. FREDERICK: The violation would be a 22 material misstatement made with scienter. And, here, 23 what we assert in the class period, Justice Ginsburg, is 24 that the first statements that were made with scienter 25 were those statements after Vioxx was put on the market,
32 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 in which Merck touted the naproxen hypothesis as an 2 explanation for what it asserted to be a cardio-neutral 3 effect of Vioxx, which was only subsequently -- there 4 was empirical evidence to -- tending to disprove that 5 thesis. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you say that 7 you did -- you did begin this action even before that 8 point was reached because you -- you attribute this to 9 the disclosure of the internal e-mails in the Wall 10 Street Journal article? 11 So you -- you say, well, we sued even 12 earlier than -- than the point at which we had evidence 13 of scienter. 14 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. Under 15 our theory of the case, the period of constructive 16 knowledge of all of the elements of the violation would 17 have occurred in November of 2004 with the publication 18 of The Wall Street Journal article. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are admitting 20 that you filed an improper complaint, that you didn't 21 have a basis -- a good faith basis for the complaint you 22 filed? 23 MR. FREDERICK: No. I'm saying -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if you had a 25 good faith basis, what was -- what was in your
33 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 possession that gave you that good faith basis? 2 MR. FREDERICK: First, let me say that the 3 first complaint is now a legal nullity. It has been 4 superseded by -5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- whether 6 it's a legal nullity or not, answer my question which 7 is: You had to have a basis for your complaint. What 8 was in your possession or in the public possession that 9 gave you that basis? 10 MR. FREDERICK: Shortly before the filing of 11 the first complaint, there were public releases of a 12 study that was done by the Harvard Brigham and Women's 13 study, and that was a large epidemiological study that 14 was the first empirical basis that disproved an aspect 15 of the naproxen hypothesis. 16 Naproxen was not a drug studied at that 17 time. But what the study showed was that Vioxx and 18 Celebrex users had a higher rate of cardiovascular 19 incidents, and, in fact, Vioxx had higher than Celebrex. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't prove 21 scienter, though. 22 MR. FREDERICK: Well, to an investor who was 23 following this information, that very well may have led 24 to a strong inference of scienter because of the 25 vociferous denials that Merck subsequently made to a
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 study that was publicly reported as being funded by a 2 Merck grant. 3 Now, whether that would have met a 4 post-Tellabs pleading standard, we will not know because 5 that was not subject to that kind of scrutiny. We're 6 here on a subsequent, superseding complaint that pleads 7 those allegations, and we're here on a statute of 8 limitations argument in which Merck attempts to argue 9 that the suit was filed too late, rather than too early. 10 Obviously -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Judge Sloviter used 12 the so-called Harvard study, it seems, in her opinion. 13 She thought that that was the point at which you had 14 enough to suspect scienter. 15 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. But, of 16 course, at that time, Justice Ginsburg, the case wasn't 17 about the pleading standards for scienter of the first 18 complaint. 19 It had long since gone past that, and the 20 fourth and now the fifth amended complaint, which 21 Merck acceded to its filing in the district court after 22 certiorari was granted in this case is now the operative 23 complaint, and I would submit that the allegations well24 established the pleading standards for scienter. 25 Of course, that's not an issue before the
35 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Court, and the question of whether the first complaint 2 was premature is also not before the Court. But the 3 fact that there is constructive knowledge only on the 4 basis of new information that came to light is relevant 5 because Merck cannot point to a single fact that came 6 out between the FDA warning letter and the file -- and 7 2 years before the filing of the first complaint, so 8 that narrow window between September 2001 and 9 November 6, 2001. 10 And, in fact, when the FDA expanded the uses 11 of Vioxx in April 2002, it approved a label that 12 specifically addressed the uncertainty about the 13 naproxen hypothesis. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, your -- your 15 position is that the statute begins to run at the time 16 when a -- a plaintiff is -- has constructive knowledge, 17 at least, of information that would be sufficient to 18 file a complaint that would satisfy the PLRA? 19 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. That was 20 the general rule, prior to 1934, when Congress first 21 wrote those words into the Federal statute. 22 But, Justice Alito, we have also provided 23 information to the Court of a case in the 19th century 24 called Martin -- this is on page 25 of our brief -- in 25 which the standard was seen to be somewhat lower than
36 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the normal pleading standard, and that is what a 2 reasonable person would have believed that he had been 3 subject to fraud. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, my question -- why, 5 then, did Congress allow 2 years after that? At that 6 point, the plaintiff has everything that's necessary to 7 file a complaint. So why does the plaintiff need 2 8 years after that point? 9 MR. FREDERICK: In the legislative reports 10 that accompany the Act in 2002, what the Senate 11 described in its report was a concern that a 1-year 12 period would be too short for a plaintiff to file an 13 action, survive a motion to dismiss, and then gain 14 discovery about the possibility of other codefendants 15 who had participated in that fraud. 16 This was the era, Justice Alito, in which 17 Enron and WorldCom exposed to the world the complexity 18 of vast and difficult-to-ascertain frauds, and Congress 19 was seeking to extend that period so that investors 20 would have an opportunity responsibly to bring cases 21 that would ferret out that fraud and to get at all of 22 the people who might have participated in that fraud. 23 That was the explanation that the -- the 24 Senate gave for that, and that couples with the action 25 by Congress in the PSLRA, which was intended to ensure
37 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that these pleading standards would be well investigated 2 and well ferreted out prior to pleadings. The 2-year 3 period was intended to ensure that that kind of action 4 would -- would take place. 5 And when you couple that with the 5-year 6 statute of repose, the statute of limitations is simply 7 an -- an insurance that a plaintiff is not resting too 8 far on information within its possession when the 9 statute of repose is going to provide absolute 10 protection. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: So, is there a difference 12 -- I'm trying to get these terminological differences 13 clear in my mind, and I'm not quite certain of the 14 difference between you and the government. 15 If you go back to my -- my Burma example, I 16 think both you and the government agree that the statute 17 doesn't begin to run until you find this person in 18 Burma. But now, I'm not sure you disagree about -19 whether you agree or disagree about this. So I think -20 you find the person in Burma. That's 6 months after 21 you had all the other indications. Now, both of you say 22 the statute begins to run. You would say, when you 23 find that person in Burma, you have to get, through him, 24 enough information to be able to file your complaint now 25 in respect to scienter.
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 But the government would say, when you get 2 that person in Burma, he has to be able to give you 3 enough storm clouds, in respect to -- to scienter. 4 Is that what the -- is there that 5 difference? I think -6 MR. FREDERICK: I don't believe so. I 7 believe -8 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there no difference, 9 then, between the two of you, or what? 10 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the difference -- here 11 is the difference: We accept that the pleading standard 12 rule advocated by the government is the brightest line 13 rule and that this Court should adopt it. If it adopts 14 something less than that and adopts a reasonable 15 person's believing that fraud had occurred, that might 16 not quite meet the pleading standards, but would 17 nonetheless encapsulate the laws that existed prior to 18 1934, and we would prevail under that standard, too. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So do you think -20 you think the standard should be -- and I can find out 21 from the government, and I will, I guess -- that it 22 should be -- that you have to -- a reasonable person 23 having talked to the guy in Burma would walk away 24 thinking, Fraud. 25 That's the standard; you think they're both there --
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 but both of you agree you have to find the guy 2 in Burma, though it could turn out that other features 3 of the case, 6 months earlier, would put a reasonable 4 person on notice to begin looking for somebody in Burma? 5 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: So you both agree about 7 that? 8 MR. FREDERICK: We do agree on that. And 9 the difference is that if you talk to the person in 10 Burma, Justice Breyer, you may not get enough facts to 11 get a PSLRA-compliant pleading on file, but you might 12 have the belief that a fraud had occurred. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so you want to say, 14 you ought to get enough information from that or in all 15 the other things the same, so that you have -- are able 16 to file the complaint. They want to say you have to get 17 enough so a reasonable person would believe a fraud had 18 occurred. Is that right? 19 MR. FREDERICK: No. Our position is that 20 the pleading standard is correct, and that if you don't 21 adopt a pleading standard, something a little bit less 22 than a pleading standard -- their standard -- is that -23 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not saying -- I'm 24 not so worried about that. I know there's a lot less, 25 but -- or more, whatever -- but I am --
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. FREDERICK: The difference -- the space 2 between our the position and the government is really 3 quite small, and it rests on pre-1934 interpretations of 4 "discovery of the facts constituting" that did not seem 5 to tie specifically to pleading standards, but 6 nonetheless adopted a reasonable person standard based 7 on what a reasonable person would have believed that 8 fraud had occurred. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, before you 10 -- you've finished, there's something puzzling about 11 the Third Circuit decision, and it's that Judge Sloviter 12 says at the end, in summary, "We conclude that the 13 district court acted prematurely." She doesn't seem to 14 close off a statute of limitations defense. 15 It's -- and the same thing on page 48a, 16 footnote 17. She says, this -- her conclusion is, "At 17 this stage of the evidence" -- she doesn't say that the 18 district court was wrong in saying that the limitation 19 period -- in its judgment about the limitation period 20 having expired. She just said it was premature. 21 What -- what did she mean by that? 22 MR. FREDERICK: Well, this was brought as a 23 motion to dismiss, Justice Ginsburg. Most times, a 24 statute of limitations defense, which is an affirmative 25 defense that the defendants have the burden to show --
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 most often they are brought as motions for summary 2 judgment, in which there are undisputed facts that the 3 defendant attempts to argue. 4 Here, I think what the Third Circuit was 5 holding was that, this is not proper as a motion to 6 dismiss and deny it as a motion to dismiss. But there 7 - it is routine in the law that where there are motions 8 to dismiss, there subsequently are facts developed and 9 subsequent pleadings brought. I don't think that the 10 court was saying anything other than, this is the normal 11 course in which motions to dismiss which should not have 12 been granted would be allowed for further percolation by 13 the case -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it does seem to me 15 that even if we adopt your theory of the case, there is 16 some problem with the allegation that there was fraud, 17 because Vioxx did not -- because Merck did not disclose 18 that the hypothesis was only hypothetical, and the FDA 19 August letter made that clear. So it seems to me you 20 may have a problem as to that aspect of the case. 21 MR. FREDERICK: I don't think so -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, again, I'm not sure 23 we would parse that out up here. 24 MR. FREDERICK: Well, you can in these ways, 25 because the market had no reaction. The analyst who
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 looked at the FDA warning letter said that this was not 2 changing their information. The FDA has said -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, well, you mean we 4 have to look to see how the analysts react? 5 MR. FREDERICK: Well, that was part of the 6 factual inquiry that Merck itself submitted as part of 7 its motion to dismiss. Whether the Court treats that as 8 relevant for ascertaining at this time whether to 9 affirm the Third Circuit, I don't think the Court needs 10 to reach, but I would point out that our brief goes into 11 this in quite some detail, that the publicly available 12 information made clear there was absolutely no market 13 reaction that would have led any person reasonably to 14 suspect that Merck did not honestly believe the naproxen 15 hypothesis that it were positing at the time. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you think there 17 was, because you filed suit a month after that study in 18 2003. 19 MR. FREDERICK: To be sure, subsequently 20 information came to light that brought Merck's very 21 serious fraud to public attention. And on the basis of 22 that very serious fraud that had significant adverse 23 consequences to investors, we have brought suit. 24 But it would be the height of irony that for 25 Merck's success in concealing its fraud through the

Official
1 scientific uncertainty that was occurring with the 2 naproxen hypothesis, that it would have this suit thrown 3 out on statute of limitations grounds and never face the 4 day in court that the investors here expect and deserve. 5 If there are no further questions, thank 6 you. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 8 Mr. Stewart. 9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART, 10 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 11 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 12 MR. STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 13 and may it please the Court: 14 By its terms, section 1658(b)(1) provides 15 that the 2-year period of limitations will commence to 16 run upon discovery of the facts constituting the 17 violation. In isolation, the word "discovery" could 18 refer either to actual or constructive discovery. 19 Between the period of the time of this Court's decision 20 in Lampf and the enactment of the new limitations period 21 in 2002, all of the courts of appeals had concluded that 22 constructive discovery would suffice, and we believe 23 that Congress's enactment of the statute tracking that 24 language constitutes acquiescence in that view. 25 Nevertheless, it's noteworthy that the
44 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 statute refers to facts constituting the violation, and 2 it's absolutely essential to this Court's section 10(b) 3 jurisprudence that can there be no 10(b) violation 4 without scienter. Scienter is an essential element of 5 the offense, and the coverage of section 10(b) would be 6 dramatically expanded if it were read to cover innocent 7 mistakes. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Was there also a substantial 9 support in the lower court case law prior to the 10 enactment of this provision for the existence of inquiry 11 notice? And is that therefore also incorporated into 12 this? 13 MR. STEWART: There were certainly frequent 14 references to the concept of inquiry notice. There was 15 not uniformity among the courts of appeals as to 16 precisely what role inquiry notice would play in the 17 analysis. 18 The majority of the courts of appeals 19 believed as we believe that inquiry notice is a 20 subsidiary step along the way to determining when a 21 reasonable plaintiff would have actually discovered the 22 facts constituting the violation. And so you look first 23 to see when would a reasonable person have become 24 suspicious, and then you ask: Once the reasonable 25 person's suspicions were aroused, how long would it take
45 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to complete the investigation and have actual knowledge? 2 And that's consistent with our view. 3 There certainly were courts that adopted 4 Petitioners' view that the statute began to run at the 5 time of inquiry notice, at the time suspicions were 6 aroused. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: But, under your position, as 8 -- the concept of inquiry notice becomes essentially 9 very unimportant, if not completely meaningless. You 10 just ask at what point would a reasonably diligent 11 investor have obtained knowledge of the necessary facts. 12 And so, what difference does it make when a person was 13 put on inquiry notice? 14 MR. STEWART: Well, I think it is -- I 15 think you are right that that is the ultimate question 16 for the Court: When would a reasonably diligent person 17 have obtained actual knowledge? The concept of inquiry 18 notice can be a useful subsidiary step, because even 19 once it has been established -- for instance, there are 20 many cases of this Court in which the plaintiff's 21 failure to exercise reasonable diligence consisted of 22 the failure to look at documents that were available in 23 public records offices or corporate records that were 24 open for inspection. 25 And in that situation, once you identify the
46 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 point at which a reasonably diligent plaintiff would 2 have commenced to look, there won't be a very long gap 3 in time before the reasonably diligent plaintiff would 4 have found what he was looking for. And in that 5 situation, it's really integral to identify the point of 6 inquiry notice, the point at which the plaintiff would 7 have started looking. 8 Now, the fact that inquiry notice is not the 9 be-all and end-all shouldn't be surprising, because it's 10 a term that doesn't appear in the statute. And so the 11 fact that it ultimately plays a subsidiary role in 12 undertaking the ultimate -13 JUSTICE BREYER: So how -- how -- what's the 14 right phrasing? Because I -- I understood that inquiry 15 notice has somehow made an appearance, and it seems to 16 confuse me. So you say the statute begins to run when 17 a reasonable person would have found facts sufficient to 18 show a violation or sufficient to permit him to file a 19 complaint that alleges a violation? How -- does that 20 come in any way? 21 MR. STEWART: Yes, we -- under our -22 JUSTICE BREYER: How do I say that here? 23 MR. STEWART: Under our standard, the -- the 24 individual would have knowledge of facts constituting 25 the violation once he had facts sufficient that if -- if
47 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 alleged in a complaint, they would survive a motion to 2 dismiss for failure to state a claim. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 4 MR. STEWART: They would establish -5 JUSTICE BREYER: So you are basically in 6 agreement. And then the way that the -- the -- then the 7 way that this inquiry thing comes in is that 8 sometimes, perhaps quite often, a reasonable person, 9 given certain facts, would begin to inquire. 10 MR. STEWART: That's correct. And -11 JUSTICE BREYER: And if it happened to be a 12 case where inquiry played no role, then it wouldn't. 13 It's all a question of what a reasonable person would 14 do. 15 MR. STEWART: That's correct. There 16 certainly would be -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't 18 understand -- I don't understand that. I mean, if there 19 are facts that would cause a reasonable person to 20 inquire, you say that those only come to fruition for 21 purposes of the statute of limitations when they 22 discover it, when they have constructive discovery, 23 right? 24 MR. STEWART: Yes. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So inquiry notice
48 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 has nothing to do with anything. 2 MR. STEWART: Well, inquiry notice is -- in 3 many instances, identifying the point of inquiry notice 4 is often essential to identifying the point at which a 5 reasonable person would have discovered the facts that 6 would support a well-pleaded complaint. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 8 that. 9 MR. STEWART: For instance, suppose it was 10 common ground that there were records available in an 11 admittedly obscure public records office, and that a 12 plaintiff, once he started to conduct an investigation, 13 would find those records within a week. We still 14 wouldn't know the point at which a reasonably diligent 15 plaintiff should have found those records until we could 16 first determine when would a reasonably diligent 17 plaintiff have started looking, and that would be the 18 point of inquiry notice. And so, it might be that at a 19 certain point, the plaintiff had -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and maybe ­21 and maybe it turns out that you could find them within a 22 week and maybe it turns out you could find them within 3 23 months or when the fellow from Burma is released, but in 24 either case, it's when they discover it or should have 25 discovered it.

1 MR. STEWART: That's correct, but we -2 again, knowing only that the records would have taken a 3 week to be discovered once the plaintiff started 4 looking, wouldn't tell you when a reasonably diligent 5 plaintiff would have found those records, unless you 6 also knew the date on which the reasonably diligent 7 plaintiff would have begun his investigation. 8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, you are 9 talking about a hypothetical case here, right? 10 MR. STEWART: Yes. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Some -- we are talking 12 about this particular case. Does the inquiry notice 13 contribute anything to answering the question when this 14 plaintiff or the -- the class of plaintiffs should have 15 discovered this violation? 16 MR. STEWART: I think typically in a fraud17 -on-the-market case, inquiry notice will really tell us 18 nothing meaningful -19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 20 MR. STEWART: -- because the whole premise 21 of the case is the market as a whole was defrauded. 22 Certainly, a reasonably diligent investigation ­23 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, in this particular 24 case, we should ignore inquiry notice entirely? 25 MR. STEWART: I think we should ask: When
50 Alderson Reporting Company

1 would a reasonably diligent investor have discovered 2 sufficient facts to file a well-pleaded complaint? 3 Now, constructive discovery does still play 4 a role, because if there was information in the public 5 domain, but a particular investor simply didn't read 6 news reports, didn't follow even public information 7 about the -- the nature of what was going on with Vioxx, 8 that person wouldn't be shielded from the running of the 9 limitations period simply because he didn't have actual 10 knowledge. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: Why does the -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And, Mr. Stewart, the -13 you said -- the phrase that you used were "facts 14 constituting the alleged violation," and the other side 15 says, well, look at the Court's Tellabs opinion: That 16 described as discrete (1) facts constituting an alleged 17 violation -- which you say is the test -- and (2) facts 18 evidencing scienter. 19 MR. STEWART: And I think if you read 20 Tellabs as a construction of this statute, it would be 21 inconsistent with our view. But the Tellabs Court was 22 talking about something else. It was construing the 23 heightened pleading requirements of the PSLRA. 24 Now, the PSLRA pleading requirements do 25 distinguish, in adjacent subsections, between the
51 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 requirement that a plaintiff plead with particularity 2 the specific statements that are alleged to be false or 3 misleading and the reason that they are false and 4 misleading, on the one hand -- that's in subsection (1) 5 -- and then, in subsection (2), it requires also to be 6 pleaded with particularity the facts that establish 7 strong inference of scienter. 8 And the Court in Tellabs used the term 9 "facts constituting the violation" as a shorthand 10 reference to that subsection (1); namely, you have to 11 plead with particularity facts about the alleged 12 misstatement and why it's misleading. 13 The statute itself, the PSLRA, does not use 14 the term "facts constituting the violation" to describe 15 the first category. And the word "violation" as applied 16 to 10(b) naturally encompasses both what the defendant 17 did and what his state of mind was. 18 The other thing we would say -- two other 19 things we would say in that regard are, first, as the 20 introductory language of section 1658(b) 21 points out, this limitations period only applies to 22 suits in which the plaintiff alleges misconduct 23 involving fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance. 24 And so, the limitations period is limited 25 to violations that have scienter as an element. And,
52 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 therefore, it would be particularly peculiar to think of 2 a violation as not encompassing the fact of scienter. 3 The other thing we would say -- and Justice 4 Scalia was asking earlier about the differences between 5 78i(e) and 77m -- and there are really too salient 6 differences. The first is that 77m is explicit in 7 providing that constructive as well as actual discovery 8 will suffice. And we think that 1658(b)(1) is properly 9 read to encompass constructive discovery, even though 10 it doesn't say so in so many words. 11 But the other salient difference is that the 12 period in 77m doesn't commence to run by its terms upon 13 discovery of the violation or the facts constituting the 14 violation. The statute says discovery of the false or 15 misleading statement or omission. That's natural in 16 77m, because 77m deals with violations that don't 17 have scienter as an element. But if this Court had 18 incorporated that language, it would have given the 19 impression that knowledge of scienter was not 20 sufficient -- was not required. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 22 Mr. Shanmugam, you have 4 minutes. 23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 24 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 25 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you,
53 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Mr. Chief Justice. 2 A narrow issue before the Court in this 3 case is whether a plaintiff must possess information 4 specifically relating to scienter in order to be on 5 inquiry notice. And really under any standard for 6 inquiry notice, there was abundant information in the 7 public domain as of 2001 at least suggesting the 8 possibility that Petitioners in this case had engaged in 9 securities fraud. 10 Now, my brothers don't really dispute that 11 proposition. Instead, they really advance two other 12 options for interpreting section 1658(b), under which 13 the concept of inquiry notice, the well-established 14 concept of inquiry notice, really has no role. 15 My friend Mr. Frederick suggested, at least 16 in cases involving alleged fraud on the market, that the 17 standard really should be an actual discovery standard. 18 But no court of appeals has adopted that interpretation 19 of section 1658(b), and as a practical matter that would 20 dramatically lengthen the limitations period for private 21 securities fraud actions. 22 And it is no answer to say that Congress's 23 inclusion of a statute of repose makes everything okay. 24 We would respectfully submit that the inclusion of the 25 statute of repose suggests that Congress was simply
54 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 particularly concerned with the inclusion -- with the 2 fact that plaintiffs could bring stale claims, and that 3 Congress in no way intended to modify the traditional 4 operation of the discovery rule. 5 With regard to the suggestion that the Court 6 should simply adopt a constructive discovery rule that 7 pays no heed to inquiry notice, which is the standard 8 that the government seems to be advancing, I think, 9 first of all, Respondents' difficulty in coming up with 10 a date on which constructive discovery occurs in this 11 case simply illustrates the problem that would be 12 multiplied a hundredfold if that standard is applied 13 nationwide. 14 And where a statute of limitations is 15 concerned, one needs to have clear rules and rules that 16 courts can easily apply without inconsistency. I do 17 think that that rule would also lead to abuse. It would 18 lead to the abuse of the ostrich plaintiff who simply 19 lies in wait and waits to see how a company's stock 20 performs before bringing suit. 21 And make no mistake about it: That is what 22 precisely happened in this case. By counsel for 23 Respondents' own admission in the district court, the 24 filing of the lawsuit in 2003, before the withdrawal of 25 Vioxx from the market, was triggered by a disappointing
55 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 earnings report that led to a decline in the stock 2 price. And one can expect that that phenomenon will be 3 multiplied if such a hypothetical plaintiff inquiry is 4 adopted. 5 In this case, there was abundant information 6 in the public domain by virtue of the FDA warning letter 7 and other sources as of 2001. The plaintiffs in this 8 case conducted no investigation at that point. And this 9 Court's cases -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As long as the stock 11 price was holding, how was the plaintiff injured? 12 MR. SHANMUGAM: The plaintiff may not have 13 suffered an injury by that point, but it is clear that 14 section 1658(b) refers to the facts constituting a 15 violation of section 10(b), not all of the elements of a 16 private cause of action. So Congress itself 17 contemplated the possibility that the limitations period 18 could begin to run before the loss occurred. 19 And if I can just say one thing about this 20 Court's cases concerning the discovery rule, I 21 respectfully disagree with my friend Mr. Frederick. 22 This Court's cases make clear that a plaintiff must 23 exercise reasonable diligence in order to take advantage 24 of the discovery rule. Indeed, recently in Klehr in the 25 context of civil RICO, this Court held that a plaintiff
56 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 must exercise reasonable diligence even to invoke the 2 doctrine of fraudulent concealment. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it's true that 4 everything was locked up internally at Merck, all the 5 reasonable diligence in the world would not have 6 uncovered what eventually came out. 7 MR. SHANMUGAM: And under our approach, if a 8 plaintiff comes forward and shows that the plaintiff 9 exercised reasonable diligence but was unable to 10 discover any remaining information, the plaintiff will 11 have the benefit of additional time. 12 Thank you. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 14 The case is submitted. 15 (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the 16 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
