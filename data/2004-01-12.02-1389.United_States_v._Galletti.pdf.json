    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Of course."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",

    "speech": "Mr. Kent, if you're not right about that and you do have to have individual notice and demand to the partners, then there's a consequence other than liens and levies, isn't there, where you have whopping penalties and interest attached?  I thought if you don't give notice and demand within the 60-day period, then not only can't you impose liens, but that the interest and penalties stop running."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",

    "speech": "Why don't you go ahead with the issues that are presented?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "Okay.  Well, the point I was making was that the court ruled against us because they said that the partnership taxes had not been assessed directly against the partners.  But respondents now correctly concede that there is no requirement of Federal law that a derivative or secondary State law liability to pay a tax has to be assessed before it can be collected, and that concession is plainly correct in light of this Court's decision in 1933 in the Leighton case where the Court held that a derivative or secondary liability that arises under State law to pay a tax may be recovered -- and I quote -- without assessment of that liability.  And there are numerous cases that have applied that principle in -- in related secondary and derivative liability contexts. And as -- as I've already indicated, those principles plainly apply here because under the Uniform Partnership Act, which applies in California, the liability of the partner is derivative for the -- and secondary rather than principal, as I've discussed with Justice Scalia.  Not only is it clear from the legal structure of the UPA, but the official comments to the -- of -- to that act state that the liability of the partnership for partnership debts is principal and that the liability of partners is -- is in the nature of a guarantor.  It's secondary.  It arises only when the partnership doesn't pay its own debts. Federal law also makes clear that this is a liability that attaches directly to the partnership.  This is a Federal employment tax.  It applies to employers because, under California law, the -- the partnership is a separate and distinct legal entity.  It is the employer. It pays the wages.  Its payment of wages is what causes the taxes to be imposed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you -- you agree that it's the law of California that imposes the derivative liability on the partners?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "That's the way the cases describe it.  From my -- and that's the way this Court described it in -- in Commissioner v. Stern."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What more do you want?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "Pardon me?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I say what more do you want."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "Well, I don't want more.  I'm just being finicky I guess, because to me we -- the Court in Commissioner v. Stern said that these -- historically these are substantive liabilities that Congress accepts from State law.  And therefore, the Court applies the substantive body of State rules in -- in implementing that liability. You could also think of this -- and I'm not asking the Court to reconsider Commissioner v. Stern.  But you can -- even in light of Commissioner v. Stern, you can think of this as Federal law borrowing State law for this remedial purpose, and Congress has sanctioned that by not altering the principles that have long existed on this. The -- but the -- the point that this Court made in Leighton is that these principles that they apply come from State law and you don't a -- actually respondents now admit there's no mechanism in Federal law to assist this -- assess this sort of secondary derivative State law liability, and that's correct.  That's what the Court addressed in the Leighton case.  And the court of appeals in this case just misapplied those well-accepted principles. Once the assessment of the partnership taxes was made, under section 6502 the United States has 10 years from the date of the assessment to bring any proceeding in court to collect the taxes.  And in the Updike case in 1930, the Court held that that 10 years applies not only to actions against the directly liable party but also to a person whose liability is derivative or secondary and arises from State law.  And the Court explained that the broad purpose and broad text of 6502 applies equally in both cases because in the Court's words, in a real sense the action against the derivatively liable party is a proceeding in court to collect the tax.  As the Court said in Updike, the aim in the one case, as in the other, is the same.  It's to collect the tax liability. Now, in this Court respondents do not dispute that accepted understanding of 6502.  Instead, they raise here a new and, indeed, a radical claim that no court has adopted and that they did not raise prior to their merits brief in this Court.  What they argue now for the first time is that the Federal statute of limitations should not govern this derivative liability claim because since it stems from substantive State law, the State statute of limitations should govern it.  Now, since they didn't raise that claim at any time before their merits brief in this Court -- and it is a statute of limitations which is an affirmative defense -- they're -- they've waived the claim as too rate to -- too late to raise it. But nonetheless, I think it is important to note that their claim is plainly inconsistent with this Court's decisions.  For example, in the Summerlin case, this Court held that whenever the United States acquires a claim acting in its governmental capacity, that claim of the United States is not subject to a State statute of limitations because of the sovereign rights -- sovereign immunity of the United States.  And they applied that holding in Summerlin to a situation where what the United States obtained was a right to enforce a private note and private mortgage that the --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "May I interrupt for this question? You know, there are some State statutes of limitations that -- or some States have limitations provisions that are either affirmative defenses or some are, in effect, conditions precedent to bringing an action.  If California had the latter form of action, how would you decide this case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "I think that in -- in Commissioner v. Bresson where the Ninth Circuit addressed that very point, they -- they were -- they wrote a very useful opinion that seems to me to be perfectly correct, that the -- that if it is the passage of time after the United States acquires its right that causes the claim to expire, that that is what is barred by the Summerlin rationale because the sovereign rights of the United States can't be extinguished.  And so whether you think of it as extinguishing the claim or limiting the -- the period of recovery, in either event what's instrumental is that the -- the United States had the right at the time it obtained the claim and that the State law could not thereafter cut that right off."

    "speech": "Why not?  Why -- why -- suppose that you have a -- a bank that guarantees a debt, and the debt is Smith's debt.  And the guarantee is to pay, including tax debts.  That's what it says.  It was a condition of the borrowing or some other thing.  Now, why wouldn't State law govern the period of time in respect to which any creditor, including the Government, has to assert a -- a claim under that note, let's say, or under that particular written guarantee since the liability there is a creation of State law and the State would have the right to define its contours?  And after all, that guarantor is not the taxpayer.  The -- the guarantor's liability arises solely out of the fact that he happens to have entered into a note with a guarantor who promised to pay."

There's another example --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "There's a --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "-- where the similar thing happened. 3505, which is the lender's liability.  There was no lender's liability for employment taxes that the Court discussed in the Jersey Shore case.  That liability didn't have a -- a common law precedent, and so Congress created the liability because they saw a specific problem where lenders were allowing or in -- in effect, helping employers evade employment taxes by loaning them money from which they paid wages but didn't paid taxes.  And so Congress created this separate statutory scheme. But respondents are correct in their concession that there is no mechanism under Federal law for assessing the derivative State law liability of a partner for the debts of the partnership.  And so as the Court held in -- in Leighton, we can proceed without assessment against them to enforce that liability. Now, I do want to also mention the -- the citations that respondents make to section 6303.  That section appears in the portion of the code that addresses administrative collection through liens and levies, and it states that the Secretary is to give notice of the assessment to any person liable for the tax.  The cases that have interpreted and applied that statute, which stem from 1954, have -- have concluded correctly that that statute applies only to administrative collection through liens and levies and has no application to judicial collection actions. And there's a -- a sound historical explanation for that, and that is that prior to 1954, there were two independent routes for collecting taxes.  The Secretary was authorized by the code to bring a judicial collection suit, but there was a separate officer known as the collector of revenue for each district.  And the collector of revenue was, by the code, authorized to do the administrative collection through liens and levies.  And the predecessor of 6303 had said that the collector is to give notice of the assessment and make demands for payment.  And it was well established that that applied to his actions in administrative collection and had no application of the Secretary's independent authority to bring a judicial collection suit. In 1954 in revising the code, Congress eliminated references to the collector in the code, placed the Secretary in charge both of the -- of judicial and administrative enforcement and changed the predecessor language of 6303 from saying the collector is to give notice to saying the Secretary is to give notice.  But in doing so, Congress did not mean to change -- and the courts that have reviewed this have correctly concluded did not change -- the fact that this notice of assessment requirement applies only to the administrative collection area, has no application to judicial collection suits like this one."

    "speech": "Okay, let's assume that.  If we gave notice and demand to the partnership, what we would be authorized to do is clearly under 6321 and -- make a lien and levy against any assets of the partnership.  And then as I said, although -- the -- the cases are also perfectly consistent that the notice to the partnership is valid as constructive notice to the partners. And so, for example, if we have a partnership employment tax liability from Smith Construction and the two partners are Bob Jones and Bill Wilson, notice of the assessment to the partnership is valid as notice to its two partners.  And so our lien arises, if they don't pay the tax, but if a third party creditor is out there, First National Bank, the First -- our notice to the partnership may not be notice to the First National Bank.  And so in a lien contest we might not have the prior lien vis-a-vis this other party, but vis-a-vis the two partners, the cases say that our notice is valid for 6303 purposes to them because, well, of course, a partnership only acts through its partners and notice to one of them or to the partnership is valid, constructive notice to all the others. There is no case inconsistent with that conclusion, but again, it's plainly not presented in this case and we would not ask the Court to address it. There's no need for it to.  This is just a judicial collection case. The only issue that is really before the Court is whether we have to give notice -- I'm sorry -- whether we have to assess the individual partners to collect the State law derivative liability.  And for the reasons I've described, that the decision below is incorrect on that and -- and should be reversed. And I would like to reserve the balance of my time."

A partner's liability for the debts of a partnership may arise under State law, and this Court has noted in the case of United States v. Kraft that State law defines the rights as between the parties, but the manner by which it may be collected, the tax itself or the claim, is governed by Federal law.  And that is really the heart of what our argument is. There is no specific Internal Revenue Code provision that makes a partner liable for a partnership debt.  What the Government in this case does is it relies specifically upon historical cases that stem from old section 280, which is adopted as section 6901 of the Internal Revenue Code, whereby assessments may be made against transferees, donees, and fiduciaries, and the cases interpreting those statutes basically find that there is a derivative liability with a coterminous statute of limitations."

I've never heard of a guarantor who wouldn't become liable at the time the thing is final and that the -- he just becomes -- I mean, how does it work?

It has to do with the way this Court is asked to define this particular claim in this particular case.  Is it a tax claim or is it a claim which is derived from the partnership liability?  In other words, is it a tax debt or is it a debt because they're liable for a debt of the partnership so that it loses its nature as a tax claim? If that's the case, this is a bankruptcy case. Tax claims in bankruptcy have priority over other claims under section 507(a) of title 11 of the United States Code.  Those claims too are not dischargeable if they're a tax claim under section 523 of title 11.  So if the Court determines this is nothing more than a guarantee pursuant to State law and not a tax claim, then this debt will be discharged in this bankruptcy case."

They are subject to the tax under section 7701(a)(14) of the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore they are taxpayers.  Once they are taxpayers, that invokes the provisions of section 6501 requiring assessment or suit within 3 years.  We don't claim that assessment is the only method.  We claim assessment or suit, which is consistent with the history of the cases, and that's a 3-year limitation period as to these --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

But by the same reasoning that you follow, if they are taxpayers because they are partners, why isn't notice to the partnership notice to the partners or assessment against the partnership assessment against the partners?

I think that the argument that there is constructive notice merely because one is a partner creates notice to -- notice to the partnership is notice to the partners.  There is no controlling case on this idea, and that would be too a question I think of State law, whether notice to a partnership is notice to the partners.  And we've clearly cited to California law that says you must commence a separate suit against the partner in order to obtain a judgment against it.  There is no California law that says that by filing a suit against the partner, that's sufficient for due process purposes of creating notice to the partners such that --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "HABERBUSH",
    "speech": "All of the cases referred to for the coterminous statute of limitations, which is what would be suggested would be applied here if in fact they are liable for this tax debt and therefore the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code apply, are all cases where specific enabling provisions created the liability of those persons.  Under section 6324, certain persons are made personally liable.  Under section 6901, certain persons may be assessed with taxes as transferees.  And those specific statutes have provisions in them that say that the assessment and collection and enforcement of the tax -- this is 6901 and its predecessor, section 280, where the collection assessment and enforcement of the tax is subject to the same provisions and the same limitations as the tax itself.  So it's not surprising that you have cases like Leighton and Updike where the statute of limitations set forth in what is now 6502 applies to them because they're subject to the same limitation periods. There is nothing in the Internal Revenue Code that sets forth a limitation period as to partners.  If one adopts the guarantor analogy, then this is conceivable a case where any number of years could pass where the partners would become liable. Your -- I would point out the Court's record in the joint appendix.  At pages 100 and 102, we have the proofs of claim that were filed in these bankruptcy cases, and these proofs of claim on their face show that the Government in this case is not simply filing a claim as though it were a lawsuit against these partners.  These proofs of claim were filed as secured claims in both of the two cases that are before the Court.  Secured by what? Motor vehicles and real estate.  So the Internal Revenue Service is taking the position clearly, unequivocally that it can enforce this debt by the summary collection process which has been called awesome and -- and super powers that are not available otherwise."

Partners are, quote, in the nature of guarantors, end quote, rather than principal debtors on the debts of the partnership.  So let's suppose they're like guarantors.  I would have thought that State law was something along the lines of a guarantor must be sued in order to collect a -- a guaranteed debt within a period of time after it becomes determined that such a debt exists.  Now, I would think that that's how the normal State law runs. So unless there's something Federal to the contrary -- and by the way, if there is, they have 10 more years.  But unless there is something Federal to the contrary, there's no problem with bringing this case. So the only question in this case is are they in the nature of guarantors.  And I'd be interested -- well, A, I'm interested in your comment on what I just said, and I'm also interested in the comment of why they're not guarantors."

Guarantors under California law are liable for the debt and perhaps the interest, but not for the penalties.  The Court will note that these proofs of claim are approximately three to four times as much as the amount of tax that was originally assessed against the partnership in the initial instance.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that these partners had knowledge or notice of these taxes at any time before these proofs of claim were filed. Now, under California law, if you have a guarantor, the guarantor knows of the liability that that guarantor is offering surety for.  That guarantor knows that that liability exists.

Turning back to the -- the idea of the -- the assessment in this case, the -- there are striking examples throughout the brief of the Government, although the Government contends that it is not able legally to assess partners, there are no less than 12 cases cited in the briefs, 10 of which were cited by the Government, in which summary collection process was instituted against partners, and in -- in any of those cases there was an assessment. In fact, the one case that's cited by the Government, the -- the United States v. Wright -- that's the case which came out of the Seventh Circuit that the Government contends is in direct conflict with the Ninth Circuit case in this instance is one where the United States District Court in its findings found that the partners were assessed.

However, it is entirely consistent with the idea that in that case there were coterminous statute of limitations.  For the reason that assessments were made within the statutory period of time -- that was still within the coterminous periods -- then the collection.  The question was whether the 6502 allowed the collection against the partners who were jointly liable with the partnership in that instance.  The statutory period of time allowed to the partnership, because it had been tolled during a bankruptcy, the court found coterminous statute of limitations, relying on the Updike case as its example. We -- we believe that the collection of taxes would be enhanced by adopting the position that we have taken in this case.  We believe that requiring the filing of lawsuits in every instance where partners are liable for the debts of a partnership which has failed to pay its taxes and which may or may not be out of business, is simply a policy which would have litigation that is not required. If the partnership is liable for the tax and this Court were to find that the notice provisions of 6302 and the provisions of 6501 allowing suit or assessment within 3 years applies, that that would enhance the collection of taxes.  We believe that -- excuse me -- we believe that by doing that, the tax will be paid at the earliest possible time.  Interest and penalties, such as have accrued in this case, would not accrue because the partners would be encouraged at every point and at every spot to cause their partnership to pay or to pay the tax themselves. The Government is not in the business of banking tax claims, if you will, allowing them to accrue penalties and interest and thereafter, for who knows how many years, potentially as many as 3 plus 10, and if suit is filed within the 10 years under 6502, the -- the term for enforcing a judgment.  So it could be 20-25 years that a partner could be out there liable for the tax during which penalties and interest continue to accrue, and then finally one day maybe that partner or that partner's estate or the partner's beneficiaries of the partner's estate might become liable for this tax. We believe that by filing the tax -- by filing an assessment at the earliest possible opportunity against the partners, this would encourage tax collection."

  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "Thank you. At page 3 of respondents' brief on the merits, they say -- and I quote -- if respondents are secondarily liable for the partnership taxes, then the Ninth Circuit's ruling that the IRS must assess respondents to collect the partnership taxes is incorrect.  It is clear to us that there is -- this is a secondary derivative liability that partners have under State law.  I didn't hear respondents give any explanation of why that isn't so. Given those two facts, then this Court's holding in Leighton seems clearly applicable, which is that we don't have to assess a derivative State law liability to bring suit to recover upon that liability. Now, respondents say, well, somehow that holding is influenced by the fact that transferee liability is provided in 6901 of the code.  It's interesting that in -- in the Leighton case what the Court held was that the 6901 transferee liability is a supplementary remedy that did not displace and, indeed, left in place the right of the United States to bring its suit upon the derivative State law liability without assessment. So the -- the principle that we draw from the Leighton case is not dependent on any of the specific statutes that address specific types of -- of assignments of transferees.  In fact, it's utterly independent of that, which was the very issue the Court decided in Leighton. Given that and -- and given that there's a derivative sub-secondary liability, we can recover against State law.  Then the only other question is, well, what statute of limitations applies to that, which the Court held in Updike that it's 6502 which applies both to the direct liability and the derivative liability."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "See, that's what I'm really wondering about.  I mean -- but -- but I mean, A, they may have not have raised it below.  B, it's not within the scope of the question.  C, it may not make any difference because the State and Federal may give you enough time anyway.  But if you do have to get to it, I'm -- I'm a little worried about it because I don't -- I don't really see why it should be Federal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "The reason it should be Federal is because all of these actions are designed, as the Court stressed in Updike, to collect the tax.  We have different remedies.  Congress could Federalize all of this. Congress could write a statute that said, you know, you can bring suits for derivative liabilities and that those suits will -- specifically subject to 6502.  And what the Court noted in Stern was that Congress hasn't done that because the Court has consistently applied State law to permit such tax collection to occur. And -- and so that's why Updike has got to be right because this is a strong Federal interest in collecting taxes, not to be too big about it, but I mean, this Court has noted that the collection of taxes is the lifeblood of Government.  This is as sovereign a claim as we have, and -- and because of that, we need to have a uniform statute of limitations, which Congress has provided under 6502. If -- if we were left to the haphazards of State law, we would certainly want Congress to -- to address that and correct it, but they don't need to correct it because since 1930 in the Updike case, the Court has explained that 6502 is broad enough to cover both types of -- of judicial collection proceedings.  In the Court's words, the action against derivatively liable party is in every real sense a proceeding in court to collect the tax, and that's the -- that's the statutory language. And -- and I -- there has been no contention that that's not a correct interpretation of 6502.  I do not know what references respondents may have in mind to arguments they raised under State statutes of limitations before.  We're not familiar with those.  The statute that's referred to in their merits brief is a specific State statute.  We're not aware that that statute was ever cited before by the parties in this case, but even if it was, it seems to us that the reasoning of the Summerlin case and -- and of Updike, which is -- there's already a Federal statute -- should control that question and --"

    "speaker": "JONES",
