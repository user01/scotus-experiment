3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 14990, Shapiro v. McManus.

5             Mr. Kimberly.

6           ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. KIMBERLY

7               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8             MR. KIMBERLY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10             Section 2284(a) states in plain terms that a

11 district court of three judges shall be convened when an

12 action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the

13 apportionment of congressional districts.

14 Section 2284(b) lays out the procedure for calling a

15 threejudge court when the circumstances identified in

16 2284 are satisfied.

17             It  it reads, quote, "Upon the filing of a

18 request for three judges, the judge to whom the request

19 is presented shall, unless he determines that three

20 judges are not required, immediately notify the chief

21 judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other

22 judges."

23             Now, although that language did not appear

24 in the statute until the 1976 amendments, it was no more

25 than a congressional recognition and codification of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 what was then by settled  what was by then settled

4

2 practice, that a complaint covered by 2284(a) would

3 have, initially, to be referred to a single judge, that

4 the litigants then would have to file a request for a

5 threejudge district court, and in turn that the single

6 judge would have to determine whether three judges were,

7 in fact, required.

8             Now, at the time that Congress enacted that

9 longstanding practice in the 1976 amendments to the

10 Act, this Court's precedents had made clear that one

11 basis upon which three judges are, quote, "not required"

12 is when the claim is constitutionally insubstantial.

13             Congress is presumed to have been aware

14 of  of this Court's precedents so holding, and in the

15 absence of a contrary indication  and here there is

16 none  to have intended that interpretation of the

17 words "not required" to be incorporated into the

18 statute.

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it's perfectly clear

20 that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment?  Let's say

21 the State legislature goes back to its pre Reynolds v.

22 Sims method of constituting the State legislature.  Does

23 that have to be referred to a threejudge court?

24             MR. KIMBERLY:  If it is  if the claim is

25 obviously foreclosed by this Court's precedents, then

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 no, it doesn't.  The  the upshot of this Court's

5

2 insubstantiality doctrine is that when a claim is so

3 obviously foreclosed it doesn't present a bona fide

4 controversy within the meaning of Article III and,

5 therefore, isn't the kind of case that has to be

6 referred to a threejudge court.

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what 

8             JUSTICE ALITO:  How do you square that 

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Go ahead.

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.

11             How do you square that with the statutory

12 language?

13             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, we think that's

14 embodied in the words "not required."  In  in the two

15 and three years before Congress inserted the key

16 language in Section 2284(b), this Court had said in

17 Goosby that three  that a threejudge district court

18 is, quote, "not required" when the claim is

19 insubstantial.

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe Goosby was wrong.

21 You don't think Goosby was wrong?

22             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I  Goosby represents

23 what had been, by then, nearly 50 years of practice

24 beginning with this Court's decision in Poresky.

25             For what it's worth, I will say I  I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 if Goosby is wrong, we still end up winning because  2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I know that.  Yes. 3             (Laughter.) 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well  I'm sorry. 5 Well  I'm sorry, why don't you  6             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I  I  I would just 7 say, I think the path of least resistance here in 8 reversing the Fourth Circuit is not to overturn that 9 precedent.  But we certainly would be happy if the Court 10 were inclined to do that. 11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you do if 12 your argument in  in a case that might go before a 13 threejudge court is that the Court's precedents should 14 be overruled?  It's clearly foreclosed by the Court's 15 precedents, but maybe there's a very good argument that 16 the  those precedents are  haven't withstood the 17 test of time or whatever. 18             What happens then? 19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This Court's precedents? 20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, yes. 21             MR. KIMBERLY:  This Court's precedents. 22             I think  23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand the Chief 24 Justice. 25             MR. KIMBERLY:  So I think in that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
7 1 circumstance, at least according to the Goosby rule, is 2 that the case would proper  properly be dismissed 3 for  for lack of jurisdiction as not stating  4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  By the  by the  by the 5 singlejudge court? 6             MR. KIMBERLY:  By the singlejudge court. 7             And  and if  if, then, this Court  8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have  I have some 9 problems with that.  Suppose the  the case has been on 10 the books from this Court for 15, 20 years, has all 11 sorts of academic commentary; certain circuits have 12 questioned whether the reasoning is still valid. 13             A singlejudge court can dismiss in that 14 case? 15             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I  I think according 16 to the substantiality rule, yes.  Again, if the Court 17 were inclined to  18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I'm surprised  you 19 think they do need to take that position? 20             MR. KIMBERLY:  No.  And again, I don't think 21 we do.  And if the Court were inclined to narrow the 22 rules that it didn't apply in that circumstance, again I 23 think we'd still win. 24             I don't think this case necessarily presents 25 that question.  And, you know, I think all  all the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1 Court has to recognize for the purposes of this case is 2 that the insubstantiality rule is not one and the same 3 as the 12(b)(6) standard. 4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I take it Goosby is 5 not parallel to Rule 11.  Rule 11 is a class of cases 6 which are more frivolous even than what Goosby would 7 have  8             MR. KIMBERLY:  No.  I think Goosby is even 9 more frivolous than Rule 11.  What the Goosby  10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Oh, really? 11             MR. KIMBERLY:   standard provides is that 12 the claim must be obviously frivolous.  And what the 13 Court said in Goosby is  obviously is doing work in  14 in that formulation.  It can't just be that a judge 15 ultimately concludes that the claim is frivolous.  It's 16 got to be that there couldn't possibly be any debate 17 about whether it is, in fact, foreclosed by this Court. 18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Am I right that Goosby 19 thought of that as part of the jurisdictional question? 20             MR. KIMBERLY:  That's correct. 21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  In other words, it's an 22 application of Bell v. Hood  23             MR. KIMBERLY:  That's correct. 24             JUSTICE KAGAN:   which suggests that if 25 something is so obviously frivolous, then the Court has
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 no jurisdiction on it at all?

9

2             MR. KIMBERLY:  That is not a bona fide case

3 and controversy within the meaning of Article III.

4 That's exactly right.

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's a very

6 difficult line you're drawing, and  and I understand

7 Bell v. Hood.  But you're saying he can't do it.  He

8 can't determine that the threejudge court is not

9 required just because the plaintiffs are wrong, but he

10 can make that determination if they are really wrong.

11             And  and your brief in the analysis and

12 all this, it  it is always  it's  it's like a

13 thesaurus.  It's just a collection of adjectives that

14 all mean "frivolous," "insubstantial," you know.  And

15 I'm not sure it gives a great deal of guidance to  to

16 a court.

17             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I  I think I'd say

18 two things about that.

19             The first  I mean, that  that catalog of

20 adjectives appears in Goosby.  This is a rule that has

21 been on the books since Poresky in the 1920s.  It  it

22 isn't, in our view, a rule that has been causing a whole

23 lot of trouble since 1976 amendments.  But again, if 

24 if the Court is dissatisfied with the ruling, we're

25 inclined to hold that it is not a basis for finding

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 three judges not required.  We still  I think it still 2 would require a reversal of the Fourth Circuit's rule 3 and of the district court's judgment in this case. 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you call it  5 I guess my concern  you call it a rule, but it's 6 really not much of a rule.  It's just kind of a  I 7 don't know, a sense that something is  is really bad, 8 as I guess I said earlier, as opposed to just bad.  And 9 I think that's an awfully fuzzy line to  to draw, but 10 fuzzy in  in when you're talking about jurisdiction 11 where you like to have very precise and clear rules. 12             MR. KIMBERLY:  I  I agree entirely, and 13 I  and I guess what I  what I would say on top of 14 that is that if  if the Court is concerned to avoid 15 fuzzy and difficult rules, that certainly is a reason 16 not to adopt Respondents' position. 17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could the Respondents 18 argue that, in the light of Iqbal and Twombly, Goosby 19 should be reconsidered, and the Federal court should 20 have some  district court, single judge should have 21 some more authority?  Or does that work the other way, 22 do you think? 23             MR. KIMBERLY:  I  I think it works the 24 other way.  I would be surprised to see Respondents make 25 that argument, because again we're dealing here with a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 statute, with statutory language that says when a

11

2 complaint is filed challenging the constitutionality of

3 congressional districts, that a threejudge court shall

4 be convened.

5             And then in (b), using the word "required,"

6 it  essentially Respondents' view is that the words

7 "shall appearing" in 2284(a), actually means "may," and

8 that the rule "required appearing" in 2284(b) actually

9 means "permitted," and that a single district judge, in

10 their view, can elect whether or not to convene a

11 threejudge court if he or she would, in his or her

12 discretion, prefer to keep the case for him or herself.

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does it depend  does

14 your argument depend on categorization of what is

15 frivolous in the Goosby language as being

16 jurisdictional?

17             MR. KIMBERLY:  I think if the Court were to

18 continue that line of cases here and to hold that that

19 is a basis for declining the convening of a threejudge

20 court, yes.  It depends on it being a jurisdictional

21 question.

22             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what happens under the

23 current statute that calls for a threejudge court on

24 request of a party?

25             Suppose nobody requests the threejudge

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1 court.  Would  could the single judge proceed with the 2 case? 3             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, our  our view, in 4 light of this Court's precedence, is no, that it isn't 5 waivable and it's  it's a jurisdictional statute 6 that  that the  the judge would be without  that a 7 single judge would be without power to consider the 8 merits in the case covered by the statute. 9             But I should say that that also isn't 10 necessarily a question that's presented here because, 11 even if it's just a claimsprocessing rule, it's still a 12 mandatory claimsprocessing rule.  And nothing in what 13 the Respondents had said indicates that when a request 14 is filed, the district judge would be empowered 15 nevertheless to disregard the request and  and 16 nevertheless keep the case for himself. 17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you  you don't 18 think  and let's assume that  that Goosby is 19 jurisdictional. 20             Does that mean that we must let the single 21 judge determine it? 22             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I  23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is it that the single 24 judge must determine the jurisdictional question?  Why 25 can't that be left to the threejudge court just as
Alderson Reporting Company

1 everything else is?

Official

13

2             MR. KIMBERLY:  To be clear, I don't think a

3 single judge does have to decide the jurisdictional

4 question.  I think  again, the key point is that the

5 merits have to go to a threejudge district court.  I

6 don't think the Court has to say anything more about the

7 statute than that in this case because, on the face of

8 it, what the district court here did was enter judgment

9 under Rule 12(b)(6).

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Perhaps the jurisdiction

11 has to go to that court as well.

12             MR. KIMBERLY:  I  I think that's right,

13 yes.  Perhaps, yes.

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does  does the waiver

15 argument, the argument that this can be waived by the

16 consent of all parties, does that rest on decisions of

17 this Court?

18             MR. KIMBERLY:  Not so far as I'm aware.  I

19 mean, nothing in this Court's precedents indicate that

20 the statute is jurisdictional.  And in fact  excuse

21 me, that it's waivable.  And in fact, the Court's

22 decision in Idlewild, and before that in Stratton, say

23 precisely the opposite.  They say that it's a

24 jurisdictional statute and, moreover, when the  the

25 conditions for convening a threejudge court are met,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 that a single judge loses jurisdiction over the merits 2 of the case, either to grant or to deny relief. 3 Idlewild says that very  4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In my  what  5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Has the waiver rule been 6 adopted by some of the circuits? 7             MR. KIMBERLY:  Not  in fact, no.  It  8 it's been rejected by every court that's considered it, 9 the Second and D.C. circuits. 10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why do you  11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there was a  there 12 was a change in '76, and that's when they put in "upon 13 the filing of a request."  And that language suggests 14 that it isn't a jurisdictional question, because if a 15 party has to request it, it normally follows if a party 16 doesn't request it, it's waived. 17             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I  I  I wouldn't 18 disagree that that is one possible way to read the 19 statute.  I  I think it's inconsistent with what this 20 Court's precedents said beforehand.  And our view again 21 is that really that language is best understood as 22 Congress's codification of what was by then wellsettled 23 practice, that when any complaint is filed in a district 24 court, it necessarily first goes to a singledistrict 25 judge.  That singledistrict judge then has to make a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 determination whether three judges are required, and

15

2 that's typically done in response to a request.

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  In reality, on the ground,

4 what percentage of cases is there a request for a

5 threejudge court?

6             MR. KIMBERLY:  Oh, all of them.  And 

7 and 

8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Litigants want this?

9             MR. KIMBERLY:  Ah 

10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are there any litigants that

11 say to themselves, I'd rather have a onejudge court,

12 thanks?

13             MR. KIMBERLY:  Not so far as I'm aware.  I

14 think in  in most cases  now, I  I think under the

15 Respondents' reading of the statute is a oneway ratchet

16 permitting only dismissals, but I  I gather not

17 grants, although it's not clear where, in the statute,

18 the Respondents 

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It  wasn't it a

20 practice in the old days that if you didn't want the

21 threejudge court, you simply didn't ask for injunctive

22 relief?  You filed a complaint for declaratory relief

23 and then you didn't  you could get your one judge?

24             MR. KIMBERLY:  That may be so.  To be clear,

25 though  so first of all, that would just mean that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 the  the preconditions for invoking the statutory  2 the jurisdictional nature of the statute weren't 3 satisfied, and that certainly is something that 4 litigants could choose. 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know why it's 6 contrary to a jurisdictional status that it has to be 7 requested.  I mean, can't a request be one of the 8 conditions to confer jurisdiction just as a plaintiff is 9 one of the conditions to satisfy Article III and thereby 10 confer jurisdiction? 11             MR. KIMBERLY:  That's exactly right.  And 12 our example is, for instance, filing a notice of appeal 13 in the court of appeals.  The Court doesn't have 14 jurisdiction without a request for the  15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let me get back to 16 the question Justice Kagan asked.  It was certainly the 17 case when the law was enacted that the threejudge court 18 was viewed as an antiplaintiff provision. 19             The idea was that single judges were too 20 quickly issuing injunctions, you know, blocking the 21 State enactments, and they thought that would be less 22 likely if you had three judges.  I'm not sure if that's 23 still true today, but it certainly was when the law was 24 passed. 25             MR. KIMBERLY:  It was true in 1910 when the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1 first version of this statute was enacted.  It was not 2 true by 1976 when the  when the amendments at issue 3 here were enacted. 4             That much is made clear by the legislative 5 history of the Voting Rights Act, which is one of those 6 other statutes that provides  statutes that provides 7 for threejudgecourt review beyond 2284. 8             The legislative history in that  in that, 9 with respect to that statute, was clear, that indeed, 10 threejudge district courts were more likely to grant 11 relief to plaintiffs than were single judges, which is 12 in part what explained why Congress, in that Act, 13 provided for threejudgecourt review. 14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And plaintiffs liked it 15 because you could skip over the court of appeals and go 16 right to this Court, and on appeal rather than 17 certiorari. 18             MR. KIMBERLY:  That's right.  And so I think 19 in that respect, Respondents reading the statute is also 20 quite inconsistent with the wellunderstood purposes of 21 the statute.  Among them, key among them, to ensure that 22 merits judgments and cases covered by the Act, which 23 after the 1976 amendments are quite narrow and cover 24 only particularly politically sensitive and important 25 cases, receive as quick a final decision before this
Alderson Reporting Company

1 Court as possible.

Official

18

2             On Respondent's reading of the statute, a

3 single judge can keep the merits for him or herself and

4 interpose the court of appeals in the process.

5             What's more, their reading of the statute

6 also creates really difficult jurisdictional problems on

7 appellate review.

8             If  if a singlejudge district court can

9 grant a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6) and it goes

10 before the court of appeals and the court of appeals

11 reverses, the upshot is that, well, three judges were in

12 fact required after all.

13             The case then has to get referred to a

14 threejudge district court.  But it's not clear, then,

15 whether the threejudge district court would be bound by

16 law of the case on the 12(b)(6) question by the decision

17 of the court of appeals.

18             If  if it is bound, that's 

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure it is.  Come on.

20             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Really think that's

22 questionable?

23             MR. KIMBERLY:  I actually don't think it's

24 questionable.  I think it's quite inconsistent with what

25 the statute says in (b)(3), though, and it's an

19 1 indication why Respondent's reading of the statute can't 2 be the right one, because what it means is the 12(b)(6) 3 question then goes to the court of appeals precisely in 4 the circumstances when Congress has meant  Congress 5 meant only the singlejudge district courts decide that. 6             JUSTICE ALITO:  How do you think the  the 7 Goosby Rule applies to political gerrymandering claims 8 in general?  This Court has never seen one that it 9 thought was justiciable. 10             Do you think there are any that  but 11 assuming that the possibility that there might be one is 12 enough to take the case to the threejudge court?  And 13 if that's so, are there any that would not go to a 14 threejudge court? 15             MR. KIMBERLY:  I  I think there are some 16 that wouldn't go.  A political gerrymandering claim that 17 was predicated exclusively on a purported rights 18 proportional representation in Congress would be wholly 19 foreclosed by Bandemer itself. 20             But the fact  21             JUSTICE ALITO:  But so long as it favors 22 who  the party that controlled the legislature when 23 the plan was drawn up, which is almost always the case, 24 couldn't a political gerrymandering claim be made that 25 that's why it was done?

20 1             MR. KIMBERLY:  I  I think that's right, 2 and I think that's why we see most of these claims 3 rightly being sent to threejudge district courts, just 4 as Congress intended. 5             JUSTICE BREYER:  We might get to this 6 question, but at some point somebody is going to have to 7 say whether you do have a substantial claim. 8             MR. KIMBERLY:  That's right.  And our view, 9 against the backdrop of this Court's precedence, is 10 that's a sufficiently easy question that  11             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it? 12             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I think so  13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because? 14             MR. KIMBERLY:  There is no  no decision of 15 this Court  binding decision of this Court holding 16 that our claim is wholly foreclosed. 17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Vieth? 18             MR. KIMBERLY:  No.  I think Vieth  19             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because? 20             (Laughter.) 21             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, Vieth  Vieth has  I 22 think the threshold question is what is the controlling 23 opinion in Vieth.  There's a plurality opinion.  The 24 courts  the lower courts have all generally agreed 25 that it's Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Vieth that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 controls.  And it's Justice Kennedy's concurrence in

21

2 Vieth that provides the basis for the complaint in this

3 case.

4             It would be quite strange to say that a

5 claim that is embodied in the controlling opinion of

6 this Court from less than a decade ago is wholly

7 foreclosed by this Court's precedence.  That's why we

8 think it's a sufficiently easy question for this Court

9 to remand with instruction simply to convene a

10 threejudge court, but if the Court were not inclined to

11 go that far, we're perfectly comfortable briefing that

12 question before the single judge.

13             If there are no further questions, I'll

14 reserve 

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I didn't understand.  If

16 you're not going to go that far, you want to brief what

17 question before the district?

18             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I think  I think the

19 single judge below Judge Breyer would have to address

20 the question whether three judges are required under

21 proper standards.  In this case he said three judges are

22 not required because I dismiss under Rule (12)(6).  I 

23 I don't think it necessarily follows 

24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you'd want to brief it

25 under Goosby or something?

22 1             MR. KIMBERLY:  Yeah, that's right, under the 2 proper insubstantiality standard. 3             Now, as I say, I think that issue has been 4 briefed before this Court, and it's a sufficiently easy 5 question to answer  6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Oh, I see. 7             MR. KIMBERLY:   that it's something this 8 Court can reach.  But if it's not so inclined, then  9 then we'll do so before the single judge. 10             Thank you. 11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 12             Mr. Sullivan. 13            ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. SULLIVAN 14               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 15             MR. SULLIVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 16 please the Court: 17             In 1976, Congress considerably narrowed the 18 circumstances that would call for the procedural device 19 of a threejudge court.  And as part of that pairing 20 down of the threejudge statute, Congress, for the first 21 time, authorized a singledistrict judge to, quote, 22 "determine that three judges are not required." 23             For three reasons, this Court should affirm 24 that that authorization permits the single district 25 judge to dismiss a complaint that, on its face, fails to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 satisfy Rule 8 and Rule 12(b)(6) as required in all

23

2 civil actions.

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I go back to

4 something you just said?  Because I thought that the

5 word "required" was in the statute.  It wasn't

6 introduced in '76; it was there before.

7             MR. SULLIVAN:  Well 

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Required to be heard by a

9 threejudge court.

10             MR. SULLIVAN:  But it wasn't for an

11 authorization for a single judge.  In the prior statute,

12 upon the filing of the request for injunctive relief,

13 the threejudge court was required to be convened, and

14 so the express language of the statute did not have a

15 provision for the single judge to make that call.

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On what basis are  it

17 sounds to me that you're giving a meaning to not

18 required that was different to the meaning we gave to it

19 pre1976.  Am I correct?

20             MR. SULLIVAN:  I  I don't think that's

21 necessarily the case.  I think not required meant that

22 it didn't have a set meaning as plaintiffs 

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  he took out the

24 adjectives, descriptors from our case law:

25 "Insubstantial," "wholly insubstantial," "frivolous,"

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 "obviously or essentially frivolous."  I mean 

24

2             MR. SULLIVAN:  But that 

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   that's very different

4 than a 12(b)(3) motion.

5             MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor,

6 that  those words appear, but in the prior case law

7 before 1976, this Court had, in two important cases,

8 permitted a district judge to adjudicate the entire case

9 notwithstanding the presence of a substantial claim

10 raised by the plaintiff.  And those cases are Bailey and

11 the Hagans v Lavine case cited by Petitioners.

12             There, Hagans v. Lavine, there was no

13 question there was a substantial equal protection claim.

14 The district judge perceived that there's this

15 preemption claim, and I think I can get rid of the case

16 by ruling on the preemption claim, which is exactly what

17 the district judge did.

18             And this Court affirmed that that was the

19 correct procedure; that there was no reason to trouble

20 the threejudge court if there was a statutory claim

21 that could be resolved and rendered unnecessary to

22 address the equal protection clause.

23             So the idea that there was this set

24 understanding that any time there's a substantial claim

25 it's off limits to a single district judge is simply not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 borne out by this Court's pre1976 precedent.  So

25

2 there's more at work in that precedent.

3             Indeed, for those who will consult

4 legislative history, the Senate Report 94204 has a

5 heading under uncertainties in the prior law, and the

6 first item is A, whether or not a threejudge court

7 should be convened was the first of the several

8 uncertainties that the Senate noted in its report.

9             So the idea that Petitioners want to say

10 that by saying "not required" in the statute, Congress

11 intended to adopt a certain subset of this Court's prior

12 jurisprudence is not borne out by 

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, they  they want to

14 raise about as important a question as you can imagine.

15 They want to say, reading Vieth, that the State

16 legislators are forbidden to draw district boundaries

17 the way that has been done here.  I take it that's their

18 basic claim.  And if they are right, that would affect

19 congressional districts and legislative districts

20 throughout the nation.

21             So what reason could Congress have had for

22 saying, although we want threejudge courts to decide

23 these kind of cases generally, where the singlemost

24 important issue that could possibly be raised  I

25 exaggerate only slightly  is raised, that kind of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 issue is for a single judge?

26

2             MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, Congress, if it had

3 looked back at this Court's case law, would have seen

4 that this Court regularly denied threejudge courts even

5 where there was an important issue such as when the

6 preemption was the issue.  Preemption cases 

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you want to give me a

8 list of those cases with  I'm going to continue it.

9             MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  Swift  Swift and

10 Company 

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Answer Justice Breyer.

12             MR. SULLIVAN:  So the  the Court's

13 concern, it was always a narrow interpretation of the

14 statute for very important reasons.  And that is to

15 minimize the dislocation of the lower Federal courts'

16 functioning and structure, which always happens when you

17 have to bring in two extra judges.  And secondly, to

18 control this Court's mandatory appellate docket.

19             So those are always at work when the Court

20 was reading the statute.  And Congress knew this.  And

21 on page 5, the Senate report acknowledges this narrow

22 reading without disavowing it or instructing this Court

23 to do otherwise.

24             So the statute always was read not in the

25 most embracing terms, as it said in Swift & Company v.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 Wickham at page 126, not in the most embracing terms, 2 but in restrictive  in a restrictive way because of 3 the important concerns of judicial administration that 4 were at stake, but also to best serve the historical 5 purpose, which is to protect States from the improvident 6 injunction by a single judge. 7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, haven't they 8 strayed from that  or Congress has, because Congress 9 said you also get a threejudge court if you're 10 attacking a Federal statute, right?  It started out with 11 the concern about enjoining State statutes.  But if you 12 were trying to enjoin a Federal statute, you could also 13 get a threejudge court, right?  And there was no 14 Stateprotective interest involved in that. 15             MR. SULLIVAN:  That was probably to protect 16 an analogous Federal interest in having its  its laws 17 not improvidently enjoined.  That statute is no longer 18 there, as you know.  But that obviously wouldn't have 19 had the same State sovereignty concerns, but the  20 there was impetus for that adoption from the Federal 21 Government because they saw the benefits that the States 22 reached from having the procedure adopted. 23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I make sure I understand 24 what you're saying, because what you're saying now is 25 different from what I had thought that your briefs were
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 saying?  I had thought in your briefs that you were

28

2 relying on changes in the law that  that Congress made

3 in  I think it's 1976; is that right?

4             MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But now you're suggesting

6 that you're not relying on that, that you're saying that

7 before that, we  we viewed as acceptable a  a

8 onejudge court dismissing a case.  Is that now what

9 you're saying, historic practice favors you as opposed

10 to the  the 1976 amendments favor you?

11             MR. SULLIVAN:  I think the important thing

12 is the amendments that we pointed out in our brief

13 are  were significant changes in  in the structure

14 and meaning of the statute.  But I was responding to

15 Petitioners' argument that this Court can simply look at

16 the words "not required" and know immediately what they

17 mean from reading the prior case law.  And I don't think

18 that will be an effective process for this Court if it

19 gives full 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a winner for you 

21 it's a winner for you if those prior cases say what you

22 say they say.

23             MR. SULLIVAN:  I hope so, Your Honor.  And I

24 hope you'll remember that.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it should have been

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 in your brief.  I mean, you should have made that point 2 in your brief. 3             MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, you know, I'm trying to 4 provide value now in addition to what we had in the 5 brief. 6             (Laughter.) 7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  For my edification, what 8 are the cases  I know Bailey is one.  What are the 9 other ones you're relying on? 10             MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, in Swift v. Wickham is 11 the best exposition of what this narrow construction or 12 restrictive construction is about.  The words clearly 13 said in the prior statute, "On grounds of 14 unconstitutionality." 15             And this Court read that phrase not to 16 include a very important clause of the Constitution, the 17 supremacy clause, because it was important to keep it 18 narrow and not to open the floodgates to every 19 preemption challenge that would come down, even though 20 those challenges are very important and often much more 21 devastating to the State than a constitutional claim 22 could be.  That's an example. 23             In Gonzalez, this Court read the phrase in 24 28 U.S. 1253, which is the direct appeal provision  25 "orders granting or denying an injunction," this Court
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 read to not include any denial of an injunction that

30

2 would have been a sound basis for not convening a

3 threejudge court in the first place.

4             And the Court phrased it that broadly to

5 include whatever basis there might be to not convene a

6 threejudge court.  That means you don't get the direct

7 appeal, which is a very important part of this whole

8 statutory scheme.

9             It became more important with the rise of

10 the reapportionment cases, which, by the way, the reason

11 you don't see any old reapportionment cases in the case

12 law is they would have been foreclosed by this Court's

13 precedent until Baker v. Carr.

14             But with the rise of those, the part of the

15 structure  not the threejudge so much, but it was the

16 direct appeal that became more important to the States

17 to protect them, as  as was spoken to by the assistant

18 U.S. attorney general Robert Dickson who testified.  And

19 we quote his testimony at page 30, talking about, but

20 for that direct appeal and the ability to get an

21 immediate stay from this Court, entire elections would

22 have had to be conducted under plans that were adopted

23 by district courts, contrary to what the legislature had

24 provided, and it was very important to have access to

25 this Court to get that stay and not to have the entire

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 election disrupted by that order.

31

2             The idea that Petitioner insists on that the

3 insubstantiality rule is not a meritsbased test is just

4 obviously can't be true, because you have got to know

5 what the merits are before you know it's insubstantial.

6 I know this Court's precedent has treated it as a

7 jurisdictional matter.  But I would submit that it  it

8 really doesn't meet the set of tests that Justice

9 Ginsburg laid out for the Court in Arbaugh of what's

10 jurisdictional and what is not.

11             And the idea that there's a clear division

12 between insubstantially and failure to state a claim is

13 not borne out.  And in one of the cases cited by the

14 Petitioner in their brief at page 23, Kalson v.

15 Paterson, the 2008 Second Circuit case illustrates that,

16 because there a singledistrict judge is deemed able to

17 decide it because it's insubstantial, even though the

18 court acknowledges that the theory is not foreclosed by

19 precedent.

20             It just comes around to saying, yes, it is

21 insubstantial.  And it rules, it affirms the grant of a

22 motion on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), which in the

23 Second Circuit, as in most other circuits, is analyzed

24 exactly like a Rule 12(b)(6) failure to state a claim

25 motion.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1             The claim there was that the State should 2 have used voting age population, which, interesting 3 enough, is the issue that this Court has noted probable 4 jurisdiction on in Evenwell.  And there a threejudge 5 court in Evenwell dismissed under 12(b)(6). 6             So you have a court in the Second Circuit 7 saying that's insubstantial.  Whether or not they were 8 right or they analyzed it right under Goosby, they 9 reached that conclusion.  And they  they did it on an 10 analysis that it's hard for me to distinguish from a 11 12(b)(6) analysis.  And then the threejudge court in 12 Evenwell, which this Court will be visiting, did the 13 whole matter under a 12(b)(6) analysis, which is maybe a 14 little more detailed than the Second Circuit in 15 insubstantially analysis, but really hard to tell the 16 difference.  How did you reach that conclusion? 17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Sullivan, I  I  I 18 guess I'm  I'm not so inclined to think that.  We 19 always have had this very narrow category of cases which 20 we say we're dismissing on jurisdictional grounds that 21 sound kind of meritsy.  But  but we've cabined that. 22 You know, we've basically said that's only when it's 23 completely ridiculous.  And so there's no case at all. 24 It's just a laughing stock of a case, given our 25 precedents.  And that's a very different kind of inquiry
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 than the typical 12(b)(6) inquiry.

33

2             MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, it's easy when it's the

3 little green men and the extraterrestrials, but that's

4 not the cases that have arisen and been addressed by

5 this Court.  Goosby v. Osser, the court of appeals in

6 that case ruled that it was insubstantial, the claim

7 there that prisoners had to have access to absentee

8 ballots, because this Court had a prior case, McDonald,

9 which had said the prison system there and the election

10 system was  it was fine not to allow the prisoners to

11 have absentee ballots.

12             And when it came to this Court, Justice

13 Brennan for the Court said, you've misread our

14 president; McDonald doesn't foreclose this case.  So it

15 involved extraterrestrials and no little green men.  But

16 a panel 

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what you mean

18 by "extraterrestrials."  What are these 

19             MR. SULLIVAN:  Some of the case law refers

20 to 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Aliens?  No?

22             MR. SULLIVAN:  Aliens  aliens.  Some of

23 the case law seems to  to categorize only the  the

24 only cases that would come under Bell v. Hood, some

25 judges will say are the ones so outlandish that involves

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 something that on its face you could say that could

34

2 never be true.

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  And that  that's

4 what you mean by "extraterrestrial"?

5             MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Outlandish.  Okay.

7             MR. SULLIVAN:  Outlandish.

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Bailey is  I mean, Bailey

10 was the mirrorimage case.  I mean, it was a case where

11 some AfricanAmerican plaintiffs were saying they have a

12 constitutional right to travel without discrimination in

13 interstate commerce, as I read it.  And they convened a

14 threejudge court because they wanted to set aside

15 Mississippi law to the contrary, in 1961.  And the court

16 said, but it's absolutely clear that a statute that

17 requires segregation is unconstitutional.  So this

18 shouldn't have even been heard by a threejudge court

19 because there has to be some kind of an issue.  And the

20 words it uses are it doesn't require a threejudge court

21 when the claim that a statute is unconstitutional is

22 wholly insubstantial.

23             MR. SULLIVAN:  But there's 

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  He's speaking nonexistent.

25 And they said it's nonexistent because it's clear what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the Federal law was.  I mean, that was the nature.

35

2             So  so I don't see how that helps you.

3             MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, I don't know if it

4 helps, but I think it doesn't help Petitioners the idea

5 that that's a significant expansion, if not a complete

6 departure from Bell v. Hood, which addressed when a

7 complaint could be dismissed for lack of subject matter

8 jurisdiction because it's insubstantial.  There the

9 claim is granted, relief is granted in 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true, but I mean,

11 they put down a standard as to whether or not a

12 threejudge court is necessary.  And they say a

13 threejudge court is not necessary when the reason for

14 giving the threejudge court  you know, if it's  if

15 it's insubstantial.  In that case you have to have a

16 threejudge court, I guess, when there's some

17 constitutional issue.  They said there is no

18 constitutional issue, not because it was frivolous or

19 from Mars, but for the opposite reason:  The law was

20 clear.

21             MR. SULLIVAN:  The law was clear, and 

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

23             MR. SULLIVAN:   the singledistrict judge

24 should have been allowed to address that in argument 

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So here his 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 I guess you're going to think certainly, he's not

36

2 clearly right, and the question is, is he clearly wrong.

3             MR. SULLIVAN:  But I would submit that,

4 under this  the Court's prevailing rule, the Court 

5 the Court adopts the Federal rules, and all  all

6 district judges are bound for them.

7             If a district judge is entitled to grant

8 relief, as under the Bailey case, it seems reasonable to

9 allow that judge to determine that a complaint on its

10 face is legally sufficient, as the court would in any

11 other case.

12             These  these rules are binding, unless you

13 can find in the statute a reason that compels the

14 district judge not to comply with the civil  the rules

15 of civil procedure, then the district judge is in his or

16 her rights?

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you say "required in the

18 statute" means "states a claim"?

19             MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, I think that it

20 could  it incorporates that understanding as much as

21 it would incorporate the insubstantiality, because both

22 are presumptions that courts rely on.  A case is not

23 going to proceed, pass a motion to dismiss, certainly

24 not under Iqbal and Twombly, unless it satisfies Rule 8.

25 That's just a basic understanding of every district

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
37 1 court in the land.  And it seems strange that, if  if 2 the cases are that important and they're going to 3 require two extra judges and a direct appeal to this 4 Court, that a legally insufficient complaint that 5 otherwise could not get past the threshold of the 6 courthouse is going to get an automatic direct appeal to 7 this Court. 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So let  let's assume you 9 have a district judge who says it fails to state a 10 claim.  And  what does the plaintiff do?  Where does 11 the appeal go? 12             MR. SULLIVAN:  To the court of appeals, as 13 in every other case. 14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it goes all the way up, 15 and if  if he loses in the court of appeals, he tries 16 to come up here, right?  And we finally decide it did 17 state a claim.  Then what happens?  It goes back down 18 and you begin all over again with a threejudge court, 19 right? 20             MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Your Honor. 21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wow.  Wow, that's  I 22 mean, that's my comment. 23             (Laughter.) 24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's extraterrestrial, as 25 he said.

2             MR. SULLIVAN:  But  but I  I understand

3 your reaction, but I think that comes  when you have a

4 departure from the norm, as the threejudge statute

5 creates, you're going to have some situations that may

6 be a little bit stickier than otherwise that you have

7 had in a normal functioning of the content.  But that's

8 happened.

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, the other

10 alternative is it's a threejudge district court, and

11 then we have to take it on the merits.  I mean, that's a

12 serious problem because there are a lot of cases that

13 come up in threejudge district courts that would be the

14 kind of case  I speak for myself, anyway  that we

15 might deny cert in, to let the issue percolate.  And now

16 with the threejudge district court, no, we have to

17 decide it on the merits.

18             MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, you had seven more

19 direct appeals from Maryland, as we cite in our  in

20 our brief, that  the cases we've had in recent years

21 that were dismissed by a single judge, they would have

22 all come here.  And we're one State times 50  400 more

23 direct appeals, perhaps?  I don't know how frequently

24 these cases are filed in other States.

25             But that was a concern that  that was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 always lurking in all the cases prior that this Court 2 decided before 1976 and was acknowledged in the report 3 that there is this concern to control this Court's 4 mandatory docket, which Congress cares deeply about, 5 because they took away the direct appeal of 6 constitutional claims that would come up from the 7 courts. 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  We care even more than 9 Congress.  Trust me. 10             MR. SULLIVAN:  I hope you care deeply and  11 and deeply enough to  to affirm this reasonable 12 interpretation.  And I think it will serve the interest 13 of  of this Court and also all the other litigants as 14 well. 15             And if  unless there are further 16 questions, we submit. 17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 18             Mr. Kimberly, you have 11 minutes left. 19         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. KIMBERLY 20               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 21             MR. KIMBERLY:  Just a few quick points. 22             First, a comment about Swift v. Wickham. 23 This is a case that we addressed on page 5 in footnote 1 24 in our reply brief. 25             The holding in that case was simply that a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1 preemption claim is not a constitutional claim within 2 the meaning of the statute.  There's nothing 3 inconsistent about that holding with our position before 4 this Court. 5             Second, with respect to the  6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Explain why that's so.  Why 7 is  why is that so clear that  that it's frivolous, 8 you know? 9             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I  I don't  that's 10 not the holding in the case.  I'm sorry.  I just  11 the  the  in order to have a threejudge court, you 12 have to bring a constitutional claim, and the Court's 13 holding in that case was that a preemption claim, 14 although it involves a question under the supremacy 15 clause, is ultimately really a statutory claim.  And so 16 it just isn't of the sort that Congress meant to  to 17 go before a threejudge court, as a matter of 18 interpretation of the statute. 19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it doesn't matter 20 whether that's frivolous or not? 21             MR. KIMBERLY:  That's right.  Yes.  It  22 it's a completely different holding.  It has nothing 23 whatever to do with the question whether a substantial 24 claim has to go before the threejudge court. 25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does it happen often that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 a single judge will say there are three issues here; one 2 would definitely involve a threejudge court, but the 3 previous are ones that I can reach, and so I will reach 4 those first. 5             Does that happen very often? 6             MR. KIMBERLY:  Not so far we're aware of. 7 We  we are aware that it has happened.  It doesn't 8 seem to be a frequent occurrence. 9             The Third Circuit in Page indicated that 10 when that happens, because the statute applies to the 11 action, that the entire action must go. 12             Now, if I could say something briefly about 13 purpose.  My friend on the other side of the podium 14 suggested that the sole purpose here for the statute was 15 to protect States from improvident grants of 16 injunctions.  If that were the case, you would expect, 17 in Section 2253, to see  which is the  the provision 18 that provides for appellate review over judgments of 19 threejudge district courts  you'd expect to see 20 mandatory and direct review before this Court only from 21 final judgments of courts granting injunctions.  But in 22 fact, what 2253 says in express terms is that there's a 23 right of immediate appeal before this Court from both 24 grants and denials of relief in cases heard by the two 25 district courts.

2 otherwise, we  we would have to say that you get 

3 you get no appeal in one category of case.  I  I 

4 I  you know, I'm  I'm not sure it  it would comply

5 with due process to  to have a judgment from which

6 there is no appeal.

7             MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, I think 

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's what you're

9 saying, that  that Congress would have provided for no

10 appeal whatever if you  if you  if  if  if the

11 State wins.  No appeal for the plaintiffs.

12             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I  I  I think

13 Respondents' position is if relief can be denied, it may

14 be granted.  That  an order of that sort may be

15 entered by a single district judge and you'd get 1291

16 review before a court of appeals.

17             Our  our  our point is only that, if the

18 statutory purpose were only to protect States from

19 grants of injunctions, you would see  and that single

20 judges in turn could decide everything else, you would

21 not see in 1253, which provides for immediate appeal to

22 this Court from judgments of threedistrict court 

23 threejudge district courts, the right of appeal from a

24 denial of relief.

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  I  as far  as far as I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1 understand it, his strongest argument on the other side 2 would roughly go  he didn't put it this way  like 3 this: 4             On your side is the fact, well, why wouldn't 5 a threejudge court decide a very important question of 6 law in this area? 7             On the other side of it is that, well, you 8 just have left, in threejudge courts primarily, almost 9 exclusively, reapportionment issues, which are specially 10 political. 11             And to put these all, you know, they are 12 very  because of the opinions you point out in Vieth, 13 there's a huge variation of all kinds of different legal 14 claims that might be made.  And if there is a set of 15 cases where this Court should be careful as to when and 16 how and which it enters in which order, i.e., 17 discretion, if we accept your view, that set of cases 18 where we should be particularly careful as to how we 19 proceed will be the set of cases where we have no choice 20 and we have to take immediately whatever variations on 21 the theme of disproportionate gerrymandering, da da da, 22 whatever order they happen to arise and whenever they 23 happen to arise, because we have no choice. 24             MR. KIMBERLY:  So I have two responses to 25 that.  The first is it's reflected in the congressional
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 record and the testimony before Congress that, indeed, 2 Congress was quite concerned with the political 3 sensitivity of these cases. 4             The way that Congress decided to deal with 5 that political sensitivity was to ensure that, in the 6 first instance, these cases are decided by a panel of 7 three judges, as  as Judge Henry Friendly, in his 8 testimony before the 92nd Congress, indicated there. 9             The concern was to ensure that adherents of 10 more than one political party were deciding these cases 11 because, not only to ensure greater deliberation and 12 accuracy and decision making, but also because it might 13 be unseemly to allow a single judge to decide such a 14 politicallysensitive case where it might appear  15 whether or not it actually is true  where it might 16 appear to the public that his or her own political 17 ideologies and predilections  18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So now you have  19 now you have cases quite often, particularly in the most 20 sensitive ones, decided by a vote of two to one.  So I 21 don't know how that  how that particular answer is 22 very responsive to the concern that Justice Breyer has 23 pointed out, which  which is one I share. 24             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, so that leads to me to 25 the second half of my response, and that is that in the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 majority of these cases that make it before this Court 2 on mandatory review, the Court generally enters a 3 summary affirmance and doesn't note probable 4 jurisdiction and take full briefing. 5             When the Court affirms on the basis  6 affirms on the  without taking full argument and 7 briefing, there's a limited presidential effect to those 8 decisions.  It is not binding the same way that a full 9 decision  that they're binding in the same way as a 10 decision following full briefing  11             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, to go back to your  12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just to follow up: 13 In  in recent years, is it true that in 14 reapportionment cases, the majority of the way we've 15 handled direct appeals has been summarily? 16             MR. KIMBERLY:  With all due respect, I think 17 you'd probably be in a better position to answer that. 18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I'm just 19 talking statistically. 20             MR. KIMBERLY:  I mean, certainly the Court 21 has been taking a large number of these cases recently. 22 It's been two or three each term.  I  23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you say 24 "taking" them, I mean, they're being presented to us. 25 We have no choice, but taking

46

2             MR. KIMBERLY:  Right.  And I'm sorry.  What

3 I mean is noting probable jurisdiction and taking full

4 briefing and arguments in two or three such cases each

5 term.

6             But that, at least as I understand how the

7 Court operates, is  is a question of  of discretion,

8 whether it notes probable jurisdiction and takes that

9 additional step.

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  On the issue of political

11 sensitivity, if it goes to a single judge, you will have

12 a decision by a judge who has presumably been selected

13 by the spin of the wheel, or by  at random, and then

14 you'll have an appeal to a court of appeals panel that

15 is presumably chosen at random.  Whereas if it goes to a

16 threejudge court, there will be a decision, and it may

17 involve some very sensitive findings of fact by a panel

18 that is handpicked by the chief judge, who is in a

19 position to appoint himself or herself to the

20 threejudge court and select a third district judge who

21 the chief judge believes is likely to agree with or

22 defer to the chief judge.

23             So I don't see how that  how that creates

24 an insulation against the appearance of political

25 favoritism.

47 1             MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I  it may be so that 2 in those cases, if  if a litigant or a member of the 3 public dug down behind how the panel is appointed, that 4 there might be a basis for raising a concern.  But it's 5 certainly reflected in the congressional record that it 6 was Congress's judgment that the best protection against 7 that concern  and  and indeed, this goes back to the 8 original version of the Act back in 1910, that 9 Congress's concern was that the public could rest more 10 easy when decisions of such political importance and 11 sensitivity are decided by three judges rather than one. 12             If there are no further questions. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 14 The case is submitted. 15             (Whereupon, at 10:50 a.m., the case in the 16 aboveentitled matter was submitted.) 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
