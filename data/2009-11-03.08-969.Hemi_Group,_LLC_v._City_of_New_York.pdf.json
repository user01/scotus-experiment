  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Possessory and use taxes are extremely difficult to collect, even under the best of circumstances. Indeed, here the city alleges in its second amended complaint that it only collected 40 cents on the dollar, and its response claims a collection rate of 55 cents on the dollar. Yet it wants to collect 300 cents on the dollar from my clients, who never owed these taxes in the first place. The Respondent City of New York alleged two RICO claims and pendent State law violations that the city said resulted in a lost sovereign opportunity to collect cigarette possessory taxes from its city residents. The alleged lost opportunity to tax was based on claims that my clients and 50 other defendants in four consolidated cases did not send names of customers to the State of New York and had statements on their website saying sales were tax-free and no tobacco taxes applied. The Federal district court dismissed all claims. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated one of the city's RICO claims against the Petitioners, the Hemi Group and its sole owner, Kai Gachupin, and affirmed dismissal of the city's other RICO and its common law fraud claims. Yet reinstating the one RICO claim was improper because the city does not have standing to sue, based on the injuries that it has alleged. It does not have standing because the city's claim that it lost the sovereign opportunity to tax is not an injury to -- to business, and it's not an injury to property."

Moreover, it was the taxpayer who was being prosecuted, the person who actually had taken the liquor into Canada, not some third party that said, let me sell you the liquor."

    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, it's not an identified sum of money. They don't know -- they can't tell who owed the taxes, in what amount, whether any of those people were eligible for the exemption under the law. It was inchoate. It was not known. It was not known who owed it or --"
  },

They allege two injuries, sources of their injury. One was that statements made on an Internet website somehow caused people who purchased cigarettes in New York City not to pay. The district court described that source of injury as farfetched. Those were Judge Batts' words. The second source of injury they claim is that by not reporting to the State of New York, the city then did not receive information about which city residents purchased cigarettes, and the city could then not go to those residents who had not self-assessed, and --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Alito, the allegations here are not that there were no taxes due. There wasn't someone waving a tea bag and saying, \"Don't pay your taxes.\" What the website's allegations are is that the sales are tax-free, and the sales were tax-free. As the city points out, they -- it was beyond the power of the city to impose any sales tax on these transactions which occurred on the Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "Well, it has to do with the intervening, Justice Alito, with -- with intervening causes of the city's failure to collect these taxes. The -- RICO requires someone who has been injured in their business or property by reason of the alleged proximate act, and the fact is the city here was injured in its -- was injured, if at all, by reason of its citizens' failure to self-assess and pay their taxes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "It was injured because it couldn't find its citizens because it didn't know who they were. And that was the whole idea of the Jenkins Act, was to help States find the people who were evading the payment of the use tax on the cigarettes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The Jenkins Act was -- was focused on allowing States to help find those, and the city is therefore outside the zone of interest."

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, suppose -- suppose you had a case in which an individual that lives in New York goes to a person with a supply of cigarettes outside the State and says: I want to buy a lot of cigarettes and I don't want to pay taxes; can you help me? And they agree on an arrangement to ship, to ship the cigarettes. Is there proximate cause? Is it there if the city sues for injury in that hypothetical case? Would you say there's no proximate cause?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "I would say that there is no proximate cause for a lawsuit under RICO against the seller who the person went to and said: My goal here is not to pay taxes; can you help me figure out a way to get them into the city in a way that I don't have to?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",

  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, I would say that there would be an intervening, Justice Kennedy, there would be the intervening cause of the person's decision. It's -- it's beyond the first step."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Even though those are the only two people that have made the arrangement, and that was the whole purpose and intent of the arrangement? And you still say there's no proximate cause?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "Your Honor, the intent to injure, even if specific, as the Court held in Associated General Contractors, is not itself sufficient to change -- to give someone standing under RICO."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Does your answer to Justice Kennedy depend upon a notion that the causation standard as -- in RICO is different than general proximate cause standards in tort law?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, because I believe that the proximate cause standard that the Court has adopted rests at its core in proximate cause analysis in tort law. When the Court first started applying proximate cause requirements in the antitrust law and in RICO, it was looking at, as I understand it, the -- the common law analysis of proximate cause, and -- and it really discussed the elements of that quite clearly in the Associated General Contractors case where it talks about five or six factors that the Court has to look at, those factors being the nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury, is it -- whether it was the type that the antitrust laws were intended to forestall, or here the RICO laws. We would submit that it is not. It's an injury to a sovereign interest. The directness of the injury. Here the injury is indirect. It either comes -- flows through the citizens who didn't pay their taxes or through the State that didn't get the reports of customers in the city."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Can you go back to the question I had asked you and was not finished getting your position on. Jenkins requires report to the State. You say the city was not within the zone of interest. But from the point of view of the sellers, the out-of-state sellers of cigarettes, my goodness, would they really want not only to have the burden of sending a list of names to the State, but to every county and municipality? Isn't it the -- just as it is in New York, there is a working relationship. The State gets all the names, and then it sends the names to the cities. You -- you -- I -- you're suggesting that it would be okay if the Jenkins Act had made it even more burdensome to the cigarette sellers by saying not only do you have to disclose to the State but also to any municipality that independently taxes cigarettes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, Congress could have given the States power to share those lists, but it did not under the Jenkins Act. And it's not clear that -- that -- even the agreement --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Is it -- we're told that New York City and New York State have a tax information- sharing agreement pursuant to which the State does share this information with the city."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "The -- the agreement, and it's quoted on page 6 of the response -- and I want to get this right -- says, Justice Ginsburg in paragraph 1 of the quote, in footnote 6: \"Provided, that the disclosure of that information is permissible under existing laws and agreements.\" And this is proprietary information. These are customer lists."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, what do you do with -- what do you do with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical? I mean, she can pursue her own question, but I'm interested in the answer. Her question is, suppose the statute were amended so that the information had to be given to the city as well as to the State; would the case then be different, hypothetical case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "Yes, it would be different, because in that instance the city would be the -- would -- would as -- would -- would be the direct victim, would be within the zone of interest of the statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Are there any sanctions for failing to comply with the Jenkins Act, just on its own, without having to go through RICO?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, it's a misdemeanor violation and it has to be prosecuted by the U.S. Government. Those -- that's the extent of the Jenkins Act. And -- and the -- and what the city has done here, as Judge Winter noted in his dissent, is take the misdemeanor Federal criminal law and bootstrap it into RICO, seeking 300 cents on the dollar through mail and wire fraud. These sales occurred on the Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico. And it's my client's position, and it's no secret, he says on his websites that he doesn't -- that the Jenkins Act, the scope of the Jenkins Act does not include his sales. There -- there's a dispute with the city on that, but it's not even clear that the State had a right to get these names, much less the city. Yet the city is claiming because it didn't get the names -- and if it had the names it claims a recovery rate between 40 cents and 55 cents on the dollar -- it should be able to collect 300 cents on the dollar from a business that didn't owe them in the first place. Because the civil RICO has a separate standing requirement separate from mail and wire fraud, as Justice O'Connor discussed in Holmes that it's not just the predicate act's standing requirement, but -- but the person injured in his business or property by reason of -- because Congress took this \"business or property\" language right out of the antitrust laws unchanged, the court in Hawaii interpreted that language. The court drew a bright line. It was a pragmatic line, a workable line, an important line, that that business or property did not include injury to a sovereign interest. The opportunity to collect taxes is a sovereign interest. The taxes themselves, once collected or assessed, could be property, but not the opportunity. The injury flows either through the States or consumers and, therefore, is not proximate. These websites were not State-specific, much less city-specific."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "But you don't -- you don't think that proximate cause is satisfied only with respect to the person who is supposed to be paying the taxes? If there's some way in which someone else contributes or makes it feasible or makes it more likely that the person is not going to pay his taxes, that's not automatically outside the scope of proximate cause, is it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BARNHOUSE",
    "speech": "It wouldn't automatically be outside the scope of proximate cause, but if -- if it was action that made it more or less feasible. But it would be unreasonable under this Court's decision in U.S. v. Boyle, where you -- where the Court held that you cannot rely even on an agent for purposes of not filing taxes -- it would be unreasonable for anyone to rely on language on a vendor's Internet -- commercial language on a vendor's Internet website to -- to -- to decide that for some reason they didn't have an obligation to pay. And these websites had language that said -- the city attached the -- the pages from the websites themselves to the -- they were part of the record, the RICO record. I had those just a second ago and I can't seem to find them. But the -- the website pages for my client specifically had languages noted in the briefs that said these are not city-specific or State-specific, that -- that you need to contact -- you should contact your State officials for purposes of determining what your individual obligations are regarding possession and tax."

Those can come in all sorts of different formats, some of it just stacks of paper perhaps. And it would be the State's responsibility then to go through those, select which ones were residents of the city of New York, and then decide whether under existing laws it was even permitted to share this proprietary information with the city, before giving those to the city. It would then be the city's responsibility to take the list given to it by the State and decide who hasn't paid. Then there's the exemption issue that comes on top of that. And then go out and try to collect these amounts, which they allege to have done in at least two instances. Finally, the policy -- I'm sorry. The policy that this Court adopted in Hawaii makes a -- makes very much sense, as recognized by courts who have looked at issues such as additional fire protection, payment of -- of public benefits, other instances where governments have come forward and under RICO tried to bring a claim to recover actual out-of-pocket expenses, overtime that was paid to police that had to monitor protests against abortion clinics, public benefits paid to people who were not legally in the country and working in agriculture. Governments have brought those and the circuit courts of appeals in both of those instances said those are injury to sovereign interests, citing Hawaii, and not the kind of injury to business or property that Congress intended when it adopted RICO. If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal."

Oklahoma, where in an original jurisdiction case Wyoming sued the State of Oklahoma on the ground that the State's regulation which attempted to require Oklahoma coal-fired generation plants to use 10 percent of Oklahoma coal, and prior to the legislation all of Wyoming coal was used in the generation plant. Wyoming sued in this Court and the defense was that Wyoming didn't have an interest because it lost the opportunity to collect taxes.

Was it substantial enough to allow them to sue, challenging the Oklahoma statute. In Pasquantino, though, the issue was foreclosed. In that particular case the issue of definition of property was the exact same issue that you have in the RICO case. Indeed, mail and wire fraud is a predicate for RICO. In that case there was, as Justice Ginsburg noted, a criminal prosecution based on the importation of alcohol into Canada from Maryland. The charge was wire fraud. And first, there were two issues: One, the revenue rule, which is not relevant here. But the first issue was whether or not the opportunity to collect taxes which Canada lost, whether that was an injury to property. And there was a long discussion by this Court equating the lost opportunity with embezzlement from the Canadian treasury and pointing out in the definition of Black's and the Webster's definition that property includes not only that which you actually have, but that  which you were denied the opportunity. In this particular case, the reason we don't have the taxes is because of the act of fraud as we allege of the defendant. It's a little tough --"

The sole economic injury in that act is lost taxes to the State and the city. It's the only economic injury. It's hard to say that Congress didn't contemplate this when, in addition to the general definition, they put this in. In addition, the Jenkins Act was passed in 1949 precisely for this problem, so it was on congressional minds."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "No. What we're saying is the Jenkins Act is some evidence of the state of mind of the defendant when he commits this fraud. What we are saying is he is aware that he has an obligation to file reports with the State indicating both the identity of the seller and the identity of the purchaser. Our predicate act is not Jenkins. Our predicate act is wire and mail fraud. Even if Jenkins did not exist, we would still have a wire and mail fraud cause of action based on the representations of the seller, which is that all the sales are tax-free. What Jenkins does through the cooperation agreement is it gives us the mechanism to collect these taxes when they're complied with. If the defendant by active intervention does not file and instead advertises no sales tax required, he is preventing us from --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But do you know -- do we know that? Do we know whether the Petitioner has in fact filed the Jenkins Act report with New York State?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "No. We have -- we have alleged that he has not -- not filed one report with New York State. Indeed, he has actively represented in the website that he has no obligation to file the report, and that any information that he obtains from the purchaser is confidential."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "All right. So I think that their response to the mail and fraud is, you're right, it is all mail -- it is all mail fraud. All these tax violations, in fact every one, you mail in your tax return normally."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "Correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "So all of these would be mail fraud. But mail fraud is not a treble damages statute. And therefore the question is who will prosecute, State or Federal? So normally it's State if it's a State tax. But it's one thing to say Congress didn't care about that and quite another thing to say that Congress didn't care if the States were going to use this in order to collect three times what the taxes are owed. And so they're looking for a way to cut off this tax liability for ordinary, simpleminded tax -- failure to pay your State taxes. And that's why they've hit on this idea of the antitrust. I don't know if that's a satisfactory idea. I don't see the solution. I think I see the problem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "But in the antitrust case in the State of Hawaii, the reason there that the State was not allowed to sue was not because of the injury. It was not -- it was the directness of the injury. This Court pointed out the fact that there was the possibility of duplicative recoveries, and the State of Hawaii was acting on behalf of the consumers. Here, we have a direct injury. The city was the only one injured as a --"

    "speaker": "ALITO",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "So how can you call it -- I mean, part of the problem with calling it property is there -- there is such a low chance of recovery of the amount owed here. Even if the Jenkins Act filing had been made, you still have to -- have to assume that this -- number one, you have to assume that the State would turn the list over to the city, which the State isn't required to do."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "But we do have a cooperation agreement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",

  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",

    "speech": "When you look at the website and you have flashing lights that say \"No taxes required,\" indeed we allege in the complaint that the entire business model is predicated on the fact that they don't have to pay State and city taxes. The wide difference allows for the profit for the seller and a savings for the buyer. That is what we allege and, given the opportunity, we can prove that."

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Could you satisfy Justice Breyer's concern -- and maybe the answer is not -- by saying that if there were a corporation that went around to California taxpayers and said, we have a way to avoid taxes, that then there would be a RICO violation, and that would be closer to your case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "It would be -- it would be easier to prove, but I can't dispute Justice Breyer's fact pattern, that if you had an underpayment through a fraudulent return that it may be a predicate for RICO, and indeed --"

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well -- well, you're certainly consistent and persistent on that point."

    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "Yes. That would be a better factor --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "But it -- it would seem to me -- it would seem to me that I gave you a way to differentiate this case. And isn't that consistent with RICO because we have a very specific enterprise here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "Well, I do want to reiterate the fact that, apart from the general language in this case, we do have this Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act, which I alluded to earlier. That -- that Act precisely deals with the problem of underpayment of taxes for cigarettes. It was passed in 1978 and then amended in 2006 to include localities. It has very severe penalties under RICO criminally. It allows for fines and forfeitures. But more important, you can use RICO civilly, and the only economic injury in that entire legislation is the lost opportunity to collect taxes. So it's difficult to say that Congress was not aware of this problem, aware of its potential scope. And while I understand this Court's frustration, it seems to me, as this Court has said in many cases, including the last one, Boyle, it resides with Congress to change it. If they feel there is a misuse of this legislation and suits are exploding out of context in terms of what they contemplated, then they should change it. Yet --"

    "speech": "It is, but if you look at -- Chief Judge, if you look at how you've applied proximate cause in the past in Anza, in Holmes, what you said is that there are other factors that are not associated with the unlawful act, and therefore you didn't want courts or juries to have to parse -- parse out legitimate business problems and illegitimate business problems because they become too complex. You don't have that here. Here, you have direct injury to the city, and it's an easy calculation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

The only benefit that these Internet sellers have is the cost saving as a consequence of the tax saving."

    "speaker": "KOERNER",

The difference here is the entire business plan is based on not paying tax. Now, RICO has been in business since 1970. Your decisions have expanded its use. As I indicated, there has been no attempt to restrict it in any way, and, indeed, despite --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, but that's because in every one of those cases, or at least in many of them, we kind of wring our hands and say, well, we don't have any choice, this is what Congress did, and we're faithful to that intent. But I guess, as I tried to point out earlier, this is a different question. This is the usual judicial application of concepts of proximate cause, and I would have thought concern about how broad RICO was written and how broadly it has been interpreted would cause us to look very carefully to the proximate cause question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "But in the proximate cause equation, as you yourself have defined it, meaning the Court, you've talked about unlawful issues and lawful issues. And as I indicated, where there's a combination you don't want a Court to weigh what's lawful and unlawful. But here our injury -- injury is solely the result of an unlawful use. There are no intervening factors."
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "Because in this case, they don't have any other reason --"
  },

    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "The law of proximate cause in the case you described, you would have to consider all of the issues, some related to the transaction that you're suing on, some not. If the mail order catalog could show there were other reasons for their sales, not attributable to the unlawful RICO definition, then it's the type of injury you don't want to make an inquiry to. But if you have --"

They will be -- the New York buyer is doing it because it's cheaper because he is not going to pay taxes on it. But it seems to me the seller couldn't care less whether the buyer pays taxes on it or not. So long as he pays the money for the cigarettes, the seller has gotten what the seller wanted."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "Except that the buyer -- the seller is advertising it as tax-free. He's not --"
  },

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "As I said, it's a harder case because there may be other reasons why that mail order house is -- is successful, just like you said in Anza, just like you said in Holmes. But in this case there's only -- it's the whole model. There's only one reason why they're successful."
  },

    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "Well, maybe that isn't completely true. Maybe it's a matter of convenience, at least theoretically. You buy stuff over the Internet, you buy these advertised cigarettes, the price seems all right, and you don't -- whether you pay the tax or not is your decision."
  },

    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Usually you're not liable for misrepresentation unless it causes -- it's relied on. You really think that the -- that a large percentage of the people who were getting this stuff really, really were gulled into believing that New York State was somehow being done out of taxes?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "No, I am sure the purchaser knows: I'm not going to pay taxes, even though I should pay taxes. But you're -- you're telling me that the only reason the purchaser doesn't pay taxes is because of this misrepresentation that you don't have to purchase -- you don't have to pay taxes. I've known a lot of New Yorkers, and not many of them are that gullible."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "What I'm telling you, that it's probably easier to go to the corner store and obtain a package of cigarettes than order it over the Internet. What I'm saying, you have to look at the context of the facts. The facts were affirmative misstatements by the seller."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "But what if the seller didn't make those misstatements but just says -- the whole operation is set up exactly as this one is, but they don't have that statement in there; they just say: Get advice from your lawyer about whether you need to pay taxes or not. And what if that was the -- that was exactly the -- and then they all got the advice, and the lawyer says: They'll never catch you if you don't pay it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "I think it's a question of proof, and if we're able to show that these individuals thought it was tax-free, then we should be able to pursue -- let me just say, forget the Jenkins Act. You have the Cigarette Trafficking Act. That is within RICO. That sole economic injury is loss of revenue to the State and the city. So if we allege the Cigarette Trafficking Act -- it was not applicable at the time of this case; it was amended to apply to localities slightly after, but if we predicated the case on that, would you still say there's a proximate cause issue when you have Congress's express intent to allow that to be a predicate to the RICO count?"

    "speech": "Just to get back at maybe the same point Justice Kennedy was raising, which is you're focusing on -- you keep saying: The whole purpose of this, look at their website. But the issue is proximate cause, and if you've got to go through the individual consumer, it's either proximate cause or not. And if the -- if the indirect nature of what they're doing because the direct cause is the consumer's failure to pay, it doesn't seem to me that their intent is pertinent."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "But we're seeking -- the injury is the opportunity to collect, which we've been denied, which is the Cigarette Traffic Act contemplates. Indeed, if you look at the legislative history of that Act, the sole purpose was to make it a very, very serious felony, and with civil undertones, in order to discourage the act as a disincentive, so that this trafficking, which is a major problem, started to be reduced."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, I'm -- I'm not sure. Let's talk about the contraband cigarette trafficking. I'm not sure that these people would be in violation of it. It makes it unlawful for any person knowingly to ship or transport, also receive, possess, sell, distribute, or purchase, cigarettes which bear no evidence of payment of applicable State or local cigarette taxes."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KOERNER",
    "speech": "Well, first of all, in time, the Internet has raised many issues. It's unclear how Congress feels about this. We have legitimate enterprise. But cigarettes have been a particular focus, and I think, in effect, you cannot use the general argument as to the Internet, when you have congressional legislation which, one, under the Jenkins Act, was specifically passed in 1949 because of transactions like this, where States were -- were being deprived of the revenues through the interstate shipments. And you have the traffic -- the Cigarette Trafficking Act which is, again, an expression by Congress that they want these individuals to be put out of business. That's exactly what RICO is about."

Justice Stevens, the city brought exactly that case, where one of the 50 defendants here was a defendant that didn't say sales are tax-free, and that case was similarly dismissed by the district court, and that dismissal was affirmed by the Second Circuit. Justice Breyer, in Illinois v. Fawaz, the States was going after $14,500 in back sales and gasoline taxes. After having prosecuted the individual, they were seeking civil RICO damages, in that Seventh Circuit case, when the Seventh Circuit became the first circuit to say, we -- we hesitantly believe that the case could go forward beyond a motion to dismiss."

I mean, at least for civil torts, you can -- there are a lot of cases where the landlord leaves out the bulb in the -- in the stairway and one of the residents gets mugged and he sues the landlord and wins, even though there is an intervening criminal act. Now, maybe what you want to argue is that that -- that has never been applied, to my knowledge, to either criminal liability or -- or penal provisions, and that maybe the -- an intervening criminal act does cut off causality, for purposes of penal statute, such as -- such as RICO.
