3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

4 argument next in Case 14419, Luis v. United States.

5             Mr. Srebnick.

6             ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD SREBNICK

7                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8             MR. SREBNICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9 and may it please the Court:

10             The Sixth Amendment has always recognized

11 the individual's right to spend his own money to obtain

12 the advice and assistance of counsel.  At the time of

13 the adoption of the Bill of Rights, that was the core

14 right, a time when the right to appointed counsel had

15 not yet been established by this Court.

16             We submit that the right to representation

17 by private counsel must allow a defendant to use assets

18 which she rightfully owns, assets over which there is no

19 dispute that she has good title, so that she may be

20 represented by the lawyer that she prefers.

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you do about

22 Monsanto?

23             MR. SREBNICK:  In Monsanto and in Caplin &

24 Drysdale, those were cases involving tainted funds, drug

25 money.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
4 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  So what is 2 the logic that says it doesn't violate the Sixth 3 Amendment if it's tainted funds, but it does if it's 4 untainted funds? 5             MR. SREBNICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, the  the 6 logic is that no one has a rightful claim to drug money. 7 No one can claim a valid property right in drug 8 proceeds.  Ms. Luis is wanting to use assets that are 9 not drug money.  They are her lawful assets.  They are 10 not connected to any crime at all. 11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Srebnick, I mean, 12 compare two situations. 13             One is the one that Monsanto talked about 14 where, yeah, a bank robber goes in and he has a pile of 15 money now.  And Monsanto says, you know, even though he 16 wants to use that money to pay for an attorney, too bad. 17             Now a bank robber goes in, he has a pile of 18 money, he puts it into a separate bank account, he uses 19 that bank account to pay his rent, to pay other 20 expenses, and he uses the money that would have gone for 21 the rent and other expenses to pay a lawyer. 22             Why should the two cases be treated any 23 differently for Sixth Amendment purposes? 24             MR. SREBNICK:  Because no amount of 25 socalled dissipation, as the government would suggest,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1 negates petitioner's lawful interest in the property she 2 owns apart from any alleged criminal activity. 3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but is  4 doesn't it make sense the  the sort of substitution 5 rule?  I mean, if you've got $10 million in drug 6 activity  money and you had $5 million, and you spent 7 $10 million, you can't say, you know, oh, I spent the 8 drug money, you can't touch the $5 million.  It seems to 9 me that's what the statute is doing when it says 10 whatever it's a reasonable substitute or assets 11 substituted for. 12             MR. SREBNICK:  And so, Mr. Chief Justice, of 13 course, if there is a conviction, if the defendant is 14 found guilty, after the conviction when punishment is 15 determined, there may well be the opportunity for the 16 government to seek punishment that includes the 17 financial penalties associated with the crime.  But 18 before that time, pretrial, when the defendant is the 19 exclusive owner of the untainted assets, there is no 20 principle of law that deprives her of the right. 21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but I  I thought 22 the Chief Justice's question was slightly different.  I 23 don't know if you were privileged to hear the exciting 24 argument yesterday on tainted assets. 25             (Laughter.)

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, you know, there

3 are degree  there are degrees of taint.  Can you 

4 can you follow  can you follow the assets?  So just to

5 say "tainted" or "untainted," it's a  it's a more

6 difficult question than that.

7             MR. SREBNICK:  Well, in this case, it's a

8 simple answer, because here we have a stipulation, Joint

9 Appendix 161, that the assets that are the subject of

10 the dispute here today are assets that are undisputedly

11 untainted, not traceable to the crime.  They include,

12 for example, family jewelry, not traced to any criminal

13 activity.  They include real estate that was acquired

14 before the allegations of the conspiracy.

15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me go back to

16 Justice  Justice Kagan's question and ask it in  in

17 a different way.

18             So you  we have two brothers and  twin

19 brothers, and they rob a bank.  They get $10,000.  They

20 split it up, $5,000 each.  And on that very same day, it

21 happens to be their birthday, and their rich uncle comes

22 and gives each of them $5,000 as a birthday present.  So

23 they go out to party, and one of them  and they both

24 spend $5,000 partying.  One of them spends the money

25 from the bank robbery.  The other one spends the money

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that was given to them by their rich uncle.  And your

7

2 position is that the one who spent the money from the

3 socalled "tainted assets," the money from the bank

4 robbery, is entitled to use the remaining $5,000 to hire

5 an attorney, but the other one is out of luck?

6             MR. SREBNICK:  Yes, because the 

7             JUSTICE ALITO:  What sense does that make?

8             MR. SREBNICK:  Because the property interest

9 a defendant has in an inheritance or in a gift, those

10 property rights are not negated simply because the

11 defendant has allegedly committed a crime, simply

12 because there's probable cause.

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the law  you want

14 this Court to say spend the bank robbery money first.

15             (Laughter.)

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's  that's your

17 position?

18             MR. SREBNICK:  Well, the  the government

19 is concerned about what we would  have described as

20 the socalled wily criminal.  The defendant who spends

21 the money, the tainted assets, faces perhaps even more

22 punishment at the end of the day or at the end of the

23 conviction, either through money laundering charges or

24 otherwise.

25             So the Court, keeping in mind that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 forfeiture has as its primary component punishment,

8

2 there are ways of disincentivizing these kinds of

3 financial transactions that, Justice Kennedy, you're

4 referring to.  But it doesn't affect the defendant's

5 property interest in assets that are wholly apart from

6 any criminal activity.

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do  I  I

8 don't know how these things actually work.  I mean, the

9 defendant obviously has daily expenses, and  and that

10 the government's freeze order apparently goes beyond the

11 money she has.  What, does she get an allowance or  or

12 something?

13             MR. SREBNICK:  As of now she gets nothing,

14 Mr. Chief Justice.

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So  so if her 

16 putting aside lawyers, if her daughter's tuition bill

17 comes due, she can't pay that?

18             MR. SREBNICK:  Under the current restraining

19 order, she can do nothing.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But she can surely

21 pay the rent or the mortgage?

22             MR. SREBNICK:  Under the current restraining

23 order, she can do nothing.  The statute, as it's being

24 construed by the district court, allows no exception.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it your position the

9

2 government could prevent payment for the tuition but not

3 for the counsel?

4             MR. SREBNICK:  Our position is that there's

5 a constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment to

6 retain counsel.

7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the answer is you

8 can  the government can stop the tuition payment but

9 not the payment to counsel?

10             MR. SREBNICK:  I would think so, in those

11 kinds of instances.  There may be other cases, I

12 concede, if it's lifeordeath matters, lifeordeath

13 expenditures, a different defendant might come before

14 the Court and say there's a strong compelling need for

15 that money for other reasons.  But if it's ordinary,

16 routine expenses, our claim today doesn't reach that.

17 Our claim reaches Sixth Amendment issues.

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you really don't have

19 a statutory argument.  You're making a Sixth Amendment

20 argument because if it were a statutory argument, it

21 would be you can  you can restrain  you can't

22 restrain untainted assets.

23             MR. SREBNICK:  Justice Sotomayor, the

24 statute, 18 U.S.C. 1345, which is different than the

25 drug forfeiture statute, 18 U.S.C. 1345, it's at the

10

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I guess I'm  I

3 understand what you're going to say because I read your

4 brief.

5             MR. SREBNICK:  Okay.

6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the logic of your

7 argument would suggest that you can't freeze untainted

8 assets for anything, because you're saying the

9 government has no property right to it.  It's untainted.

10 It's your money; it's not their money until they secure

11 a judgment.  And so the logic of your position would be,

12 I think, they can't restrain untainted assets, period,

13 constitutionally or statutorily.

14             MR. SREBNICK:  Well, we do not go that far

15 in our 

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know you don't because

17 it's very nice that you limit it.  But once we announce

18 a rule, we have to carry it to its logical conclusion.

19 And if the rule is it's untainted assets and it belongs

20 to me, how do we then limit it?

21             MR. SREBNICK:  Well, I suppose that if

22 there's no Sixth Amendment right at stake, if there's no

23 constitutional right to use the asset today, I don't

24 know of any prohibition, provided that there's due

25 process, that would prevent the Court from restraining

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 assets proposed to be used for other purposes.

11

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you said that this 

3 this is her property.  If it's tainted, you say she

4 doesn't own it, it's not her money.  But if it's

5 untainted, it is her money.  So I think

6 Justice Sotomayor has asked a fair question.

7             Isn't the logic of your position that the

8 untainted assets can be used without restraint for

9 whatever she wants to use it for?

10             MR. SREBNICK:  Justice Ginsburg, from a

11 constitutional perspective, I don't think that that's

12 necessarily correct because the courts can give

13 injunctive power to restrain assets, even assets

14 currently belonging to the defendant.  Our objection is

15 when such an injunction interferes with the

16 constitutionally protected right to retain counsel of

17 choice.

18             And so while the statute could

19 constitutionally allow, provided that there is adequate

20 hearings, et cetera, the restraint of even a defendant's

21 owned assets, lawfully owned assets, that principle

22 can't extend to assets  the subset of assets she needs

23 to use counsel of choice.

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if  what if the

25 woman is a devout Muslim and she  she makes a  an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1 annual trip to Mecca every year?  Wouldn't she have a 2 constitutional right to use the money for that? 3             MR. SREBNICK:  So certainly she would have a 4 constitutional right.  And whether she could then obtain 5 the assets free from the injunction immediately would 6 raise a separate First Amendment question. 7             The Sixth Amendment, because the deprivation 8 will be permanent, meaning, we need those assets now 9 before the trial, and the immediacy of the need for 10 those assets  11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, she has an immediate 12 need to go to Mecca.  I mean, if she doesn't get it now, 13 she's not going to be able to fulfill what she regards 14 as a religious obligation.  I don't know how you can 15 limit your  your principle to the Sixth Amendment. 16             MR. SREBNICK:  The Sixth Amendment is 17 important in the context of the adversarial proceeding 18 that will determine the ultimate ownership of those 19 assets at the end of the day.  And so unlike the First 20 Amendment, unlike any other amendment, the Sixth 21 Amendment is a guarantee that the defendant will be 22 represented at the proceeding where that property and 23 her liberty are at stake.  And with regard to the 24 travels to Mecca, those travels, while significant under 25 the First Amendment, don't bear on the ultimate outcome
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of the criminal case.

13

2             And so because the need for assets that we

3 are requesting limited to that amount needed to retain

4 counsel of choice, limited to the amount needed to mount

5 a legal defense to the very charge that threatens her

6 property rights and her liberty upon conviction, there

7 needs to be an accommodation so that she can use enough

8 assets, controlled by the Court, of course 

9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Srebnick, this goes

10 back, I think, to the Chief Justice's first question.

11 It seems that the distinction that you're making is one

12 that the Court explicitly rejected in Monsanto.  In

13 other words, the Court said the Sixth Amendment here is

14 the exact same thing as the First Amendment.  It even

15 used that example that Justice Scalia gave, or that

16 general example.

17             And  and so it goes back to the

18 Chief Justice's question in  in the sense of there's a

19 very powerful intuition behind your argument, but it's a

20 powerful intuition that was explicitly rejected by us.

21 And  and this case doesn't seem to present any

22 different circumstances than that one.

23             MR. SREBNICK:  Justice Kagan, I  I think

24 the circumstances are quite different because of the

25 tainted property that was at issue in Monsanto.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             First, we know it was drug money in

14

2 Monsanto.  It had been established by clear and

3 convincing evidence.  In our case, it's totally

4 untainted assets.

5             Second, the Court recognized that a

6 defendant doesn't have a lawful property interest in

7 drug money.  No different than a bank robber does not

8 have a lawful interest in the bank loot.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yeah, but your  your

10 earlier argument was you have a constitutional right to

11 establish that it isn't drug money.  That was your whole

12 answer to Justice Scalia.

13             MR. SREBNICK:  In this case there's no

14 dispute that the money is untainted.  And I'm not 

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm talking about the rule

16 that you're proposing.

17             MR. SREBNICK:  The rule I proposed,

18 consistent with the Court's observation in Kaley, there

19 are two elements to establish forfeitability; one, that

20 there's a crime committed, and second, traceability from

21 the majority opinion in Kaley.

22             Here we have undisputedly untainted assets,

23 not traceable to a crime.  In Monsanto, the assets were

24 drug money.  And a defendant doesn't have the right to

25 use drug money to represent  to be represented by the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 counsel of his choice.

15

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess you're  I

3 think this may be Justice Sotomayor's point.

4             Your argument, you're distinguishing tainted

5 and untainted assets, and I understand that.  I just

6 don't understand that if you can freeze the assets

7 despite the Sixth Amendment when they're tainted, I

8 don't understand why it's not the same rule when they're

9 untainted.

10             You may have  may have statutory

11 arguments, you  but if you have arguments, it has

12 nothing to do with the constitutional right to counsel.

13             MR. SREBNICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think it

14 has everything to do with the Sixth Amendment because,

15 at its inception, the Sixth Amendment only encompassed

16 the right to spend one  one's own money to be

17 represented by counsel.  There was no right to the

18 appointment of counsel.

19             So taking away the defendant's lawfully held

20 assets, whether it be their pension funds, whether it be

21 an inheritance, whether it be their lawfully earned

22 labors, to take that away at the inception of this

23 nation would have meant the defendant would have been

24 left with no counsel at all since the notion of an

25 appointed lawyer is really a notion of more recent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 vintage, in the 20th century.

16

2             So indeed, to take away the property rights,

3 pretrial, of a defendant, at the time when he or she is

4 under indictment, needs those assets to retain counsel,

5 any private counsel  so we're not talking in this case

6 about a particular 

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what if  what if

8 the prosecution brings a case for crime X and wins that

9 case, and it imposes a fine that takes away all of the

10 defendant's assets, and then the prosecution brings

11 another case for crime Y, would you be arguing that the

12 fine had to make an exception for the defense of

13 crime Y?

14             MR. SREBNICK:  No, Justice Scalia.

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the difference?

16             MR. SREBNICK:  There's a judgment.  Upon

17 judgment, a defendant can lose his right to property

18 upon execution of that judgment.  So the government

19 could execute on that criminal judgment and take as much

20 of the defendant's assets needed to satisfy the fine.

21             Our objection is to the government doing it

22 before conviction, before there's been any judgment.

23 Locking down somebody's assets at the very moment when

24 he or she needs those assets to exercise the right to

25 counsel.  As it was envisioned 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The Sixth Amendment only  2 only protects your money up until the point where 3 there's a judgment? 4             MR. SREBNICK:  Yes. 5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in  in this case, 6 there was a finding of probable cause. 7             MR. SREBNICK:  Yes. 8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you want us to make a 9 distinction between probable cause and a judgment? 10             MR. SREBNICK:  Yes.  Every case, every 11 indictment brings with it a finding of probable cause. 12 It's  the two rights have to coexist.  The right to be 13 represented by counsel of choice under the Sixth 14 Amendment has to coexist with the indictment, because 15 under Patterson v. Illinois, the right under the Sixth 16 Amendment is triggered by the indictment.  It's 17 triggered by the finding of probable cause. 18             To then say that probable cause destroys the 19 right to the Sixth Amendment is to then say that they 20 don't coexist.  But, of course, they do, because the 21 Sixth Amendment was established in 1791, and it's part 22 of our fabric. 23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I might just be repeating 24 myself, but  but I thought that, again, that 25 distinction was the one specifically rejected in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Monsanto.  I mean, Monsanto could have said Caplin &

18

2 Drysdale is different because it's postconviction.  But

3 Monsanto refused to say that.  Monsanto said the same

4 rule that applies postconviction ought to apply upon a

5 finding of probable cause.

6             MR. SREBNICK:  Yes, Justice Kagan, but

7 probable cause to believe the assets are tainted.

8 Probable cause to believe that the drug money is not the

9 defendant's to spend.  Not probable  there's no

10 probable cause here as to these assets that Ms. Luis

11 proposes to use to retain counsel of choice.

12             JUSTICE ALITO:  The problem with this

13 argument is that as a matter of economics and  and

14 common sense, money is fungible.  To say if the  if

15 the socalled tainted money has been spent, and what's

16 left is the untainted money, it doesn't make a

17 difference which  you know, which pot has been spent

18 and which pot hasn't been spent.

19             MR. SREBNICK:  Respectfully, Justice Alito,

20 it makes a major difference.  Our property laws, while

21 money in some instances is fungible when they're

22 commingled, if there is segregated property, when

23 creditors try to levy against property that's not part

24 of a secured interest, the law treats it very

25 differently.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, yes, but then

19

2 there's  that's all sorts of complicated rules in

3 those areas.

4             I mean, let's  suppose you have 

5 and none of that necessarily applies here.  Suppose you

6 have the situation where what's at stake is money that's

7 going to be used for restitution, all right?  So at the

8 beginning of the case, the question is whether the

9 defendant can spend that money to hire the attorney of

10 the defendant's choice, which is certainly a very

11 powerful interest, or whether that money, at the end of

12 the case if there is a conviction, is going to go to the

13 victims.

14             So how do you  how do you try to

15 accommodate those two interests?

16             MR. SREBNICK:  Well, to provide a

17 restitution exception would just swallow the entire

18 Sixth Amendment out of the Constitution for the

19 following reason.  In most cases, a victim has sustained

20 an injury.  It might be property damage.  It might be

21 personal injury.  And if, for example, to use a

22 hypothetical, if someone were to steal the Mona Lisa, or

23 allegedly steal the Mona Lisa but the Mona Lisa isn't

24 found, there's no principle this Court has ever 

25             JUSTICE ALITO:  So your answer is that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 defendant's right to hire counsel of choice takes

20

2 precedence over the rights of the victims, and you would

3 say that no matter how strong the proof is?

4             MR. SREBNICK:  Yes.

5             JUSTICE ALITO:  Until there's  until there

6 is a verdict?

7             MR. SREBNICK:  As long as the assets that

8 the defendant proposes to use are her lawful assets,

9 untainted, not connected to the crime, not traceable to

10 any criminal activity, yes, because 

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That seems to me not a

12 very  I don't know  not a very persuasive line.

13 You're relying on property law.  What you're saying is

14 the government can take away all your money if it's

15 tainted, if there is probable cause to believe that it's

16 tainted, right?  It can take away all of your money if

17 there is a judgment.  But it can't take away all of your

18 money if there's simply probable cause to believe that

19 you're going to owe this money.

20             MR. SREBNICK:  Right.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your crime.  That seems to

22 me a very  I don't know, not  not  an evanescent

23 line.  I  I don't know why the Sixth Amendment case

24 is  the property case is  is stronger in one

25 situation than the other, but I'm not sure that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Sixth Amendment case is any stronger.

21

2             MR. SREBNICK:  What  what the statute is

3 purporting to do is give the government a prejudgment

4 attachment on the defendant's assets based on a

5 projected judgment.

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right.  It's

7 property law.

8             MR. SREBNICK:  And the Sixth Amendment 

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're complaining about

10 property law, not the Sixth Amendment.

11             MR. SREBNICK:  Well, I'm complaining that

12 the Sixth Amendment, because at its root contemplated

13 the use of property to retain counsel, the two in some

14 degree are interrelated, of course, because without

15 money 220 years ago or so, you couldn't hire a lawyer,

16 and none would be appointed for you.

17             So while the Court has accommodated the

18 indigent by providing them with appointed counsel, that

19 is not a license for the government to render people who

20 are not indigent, indigent.  It's not a license to

21 impoverish them by virtue of the accusation alone.  That

22 would simply write out the Sixth Amendment from the

23 Constitution.

24             In every single case where there is a victim

25 who claims injury, every single one, the government has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 by definition probable cause because the indictment is 2 based on probable cause.  And it's not subject to 3 challenge under the Kaley opinion.  And so if we are 4 going to say that merely being accused in this country 5 because a grand jury has found probable cause is now 6 sufficient to lock down all of your assets, assets you 7 have owned for decades, perhaps, because at some future 8 time maybe a jury will convict and maybe a judge will 9 enter a judgment, and then maybe the court will then 10 have to enforce that judgment, really is to write out 11 the Sixth Amendment. 12             And there are ways  if the point of a 13 criminal case is to inflict punishment on a defendant, 14 there are ways other than financial means to do so.  Of 15 course, incarceration is the number one form of 16 punishment. 17             And while the needs of the victims are 18 certainly important, what we're asking here is to 19 accommodate both.  We're not asking that all the funds 20 be released, only so much as are necessary so that the 21 accused can be represented by private counsel. 22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know this is not part 23 of the question asked, but I know that it  it's 24 suggested in the fringes of the briefs.  How does the 25 district court ensure that she doesn't use every penny
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1 for defense costs when the district court thinks that 2 that's not reasonable, for example? 3             MR. SREBNICK:  I don't think there's an 4 issue, particularly in this case with that issue, 5 because the court which now has control over the assets 6 would manage the disbursement of funds for counsel, and 7 the bar rules would apply.  Just as with a CJAappointed 8 lawyer, Criminal Justice Act appointed lawyer, goes to 9 the court, and says, here are my hours.  Here's what I 10 need for investigation.  Here's what I need for support 11 services for discovery.  That would be managed by the 12 district courts. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you're not  14 you're not looking for CJA rates, are you? 15             MR. SREBNICK:  No, we're not, Justice. 16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I didn't think so. 17             (Laughter.) 18             MR. SREBNICK:  And  and so given the 19 ability of our district courts to manage those issues, 20 the only standard we would ask for, that they be 21 reasonable and bona fide, and the bar rules govern that. 22             I should add that while we are having a  23 an academic discussion here, it didn't seem to be such a 24 controversial proposition to the government when in 25 Caplin & Drysdale in their brief, they wrote the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 following:  "The Constitution requires that a court

24

2 afford a defendant a fair opportunity to secure counsel

3 of choice using whatever assets he has at his lawful

4 disposal."

5             That's the brief of Caplin & Drysdale by the

6 Solicitor General at page 42.

7             And so when the Solicitor General's office

8 argued this case in Caplin & Drysdale 25 years ago, they

9 came to the Court and said there was a difference

10 between tainted and untainted assets.  And some 26 years

11 later, those are being conflated as if there is no

12 difference between the two.

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we have a new

14 statute.  853 made a difference between  and still

15 does  between tainted and untainted.

16             MR. SREBNICK:  That is very true,

17 Justice Sotomayor.  And to the 

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This section came later,

19 and it says substitute property.

20             MR. SREBNICK:  That is true.  So there is

21 a  a statute, the statute that's at issue in this

22 case, different from 853.  853 in most circuits does not

23 authorize the pretrial restraint of untainted assets.

24 So all the concerns about victims, all the concerns that

25 emanate from the questions that have been asked today,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1 Congress struck that balance and did not allow for the 2 restraint of substitute assets, at least in most 3 circuits as it has been interpreted.  The Solicitor 4 General has a different view of the statute as it 5 expressed in the Fourth Circuit. 6             But in all events, though the victims are 7 certainly to be accommodated, so, too, the rights of the 8 criminal defendant who needs to be represented by the 9 counsel of choice. 10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But Congress seemed to 11 have singled out these banking frauds and healthcare 12 frauds for special treatment, so they're not governed by 13 the general forfeiture statute, which makes the 14 distinction between tainted and untainted.  They seem to 15 want to come down very hard on these two crimes.  So why 16 would we interpret  was it 1345?  as doing nothing, 17 as being controlled essentially by 853? 18             MR. SREBNICK:  So 1345, although it doesn't 19 use the word "forfeiture," it doesn't say what happens 20 to these assets.  It simply locks them down, so to 21 speak, until something happens.  It doesn't even talk 22 about a criminal case, but it is in the context of 23 Title 18.  And the one court  court  Fang case talks 24 about, there needs to be some sort of criminal procedure 25 that follows the lockdown.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             And Justice Ginsburg, while Congress may

26

2 have given in this instance the ability of the

3 government to restrain assets of equivalent value,

4 notwithstanding our statutory interpretation argument,

5 it still needs to accommodate the rights of the criminal

6 accused.

7             If I may reserve the balance of my time for

8 rebuttal.

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

11            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

12                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13             MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

14 and may it please the Court:

15             I think that the appropriate starting point

16 for this case is the last sentence of Monsanto, not

17 because Monsanto specifically addressed substitute

18 property, but because it adopted a principle that I

19 believe resolves this case.  And the last sentence of

20 Monsanto says, "If the government may, posttrial, forbid

21 the use of forfeited assets to pay an attorney, then

22 surely no constitutional violation occurs when after

23 probable cause is adequately established, the government

24 obtains an order barring a defendant from frustrating

25 that end by dissipating his assets prior to trial."

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that was said 2 in the context of the government's submission that 3 there's a difference between tainted and untainted, 4 right?  Your  your argument in Monsanto focused on the 5 tainted aspects of the proceeds. 6             MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, it did.  And that's why I 7 say that the principle that the court articulated in 8 that sentence is what decides this case. 9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is that the principle? 10 The principle  they're talking about money that 11 doesn't belong to the defendant. 12             MR. DREEBEN:  Well  13             JUSTICE BREYER:  It belongs to Smith or 14 Jones of the bank.  Now, let's try that principle in a 15 case where it's the defendant's money.  The principle is 16 that the government, without proving that he's guilty of 17 any crime beyond a reasonable doubt, can take all his 18 money.  Oh, because he might be fined. 19             I've never heard of such a principle, 20 frankly.  I've just never heard of it.  Now, if there is 21 some case that says  22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sixth Amendment or not. 23             JUSTICE BREYER:  So  now I can imagine  24             MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, let me try to 25 explain 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE BREYER:  I can go from there and

28

2 find interests on both sides, da, da, da.

3             MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, I think that

4 it's important to start with, actually, the principle

5 that Monsanto adopted, not because it resolved the

6 factual circumstances here, but because it's talking

7 about the point in time after the government wins a

8 judgment.  And the principle is that if the government

9 will have a right to forfeit that property at the end 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

11             MR. DREEBEN:   if it can show probable

12 cause 

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  I  I understood that.  I

14 just wanted to try it with the facts here.

15             I mean, the first principle is if, in fact,

16 the defendant has somebody else's money that he's taken

17 unlawfully, and he has to give it up at the end of the

18 trial, we can make him give it up at the beginning to

19 make sure it's there.

20             Now let's try it with the facts here.  If a

21 defendant has some money, which maybe he will have to

22 pay in a fine, what we'll do is we'll take all his money

23 away before he's been convicted beyond a reasonable

24 doubt.  Okay.  That's the difference in the

25 propositions.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1             And I'm saying it's pretty hard for me to 2 think in a country which says that before he's 3 convicted, you have to release him on bail except in 4 unusual circumstances, that nonetheless, you can take 5 all his money away so he can't hire a lawyer. 6             I know that's a little simpleminded, but 7 nonetheless, that seems fairly basic.  I don't know 8 where it comes from. 9             MR. DREEBEN:  So Justice Breyer, I think 10 that the  the embedded premise there is that people 11 will not suffer restraints on their liberty or property 12 before they have been convicted beyond a reasonable 13 doubt. 14             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's correct.  That is 15 the principle, and now we make a number of exceptions. 16 And one exception is if you think he's going to  I 17 mean, I can think of exceptions where we do keep people 18 in jail.  That is, of course, right.  And  and here, 19 what they're saying, I think, in essence is, let's try 20 and think of an exception for this one.  Pretty hard. 21 And anyway, if there is one, what he wants to use the 22 money for is to make sure he has a lawyer.  It's called 23 the Sixth Amendment. 24             All right.  Now, there we are.  That's where 25 I  at this moment in my mind, that's where the case
Alderson Reporting Company

1 is.

Official

30

2             MR. DREEBEN:  All right.  So can I try to

3 break that down a little bit?  Because I do think that

4 the principle in Monsanto is critical.  The principle in

5 Monsanto is that if the government will be able to

6 forfeit the property at the end of the day, it has an

7 interest in ensuring that it is available and not

8 dissipated.  It's the monetary equivalent of flight.

9 It's asset flight.

10             And this statute, Section 1345, was

11 specifically designed, as Justice Ginsburg observed, for

12 crimes in the banking and in the healthcare context in

13 which money flows into accounts, money is fungible, very

14 difficult to 

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  I think  I think that's

16 a  what you say is, look, this is equivalent to the

17 case where we keep the guy in jail because he might run

18 away.  That's your point.  That's not a bad point.  So I

19 have on that on one side, and I have on the other side

20 that he'd like to have a lawyer which is a Sixth

21 Amendment right.

22             So I have a suggestion that I want you to

23 focus on.  The suggestion is  let's read this statute

24 in light of what you've said, that there is an interest

25 on your side and there is a constitutional amendment on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 the other side.  Why can't we read this statute to say 2 they accommodate those interests in this way? 3             If they're going to run away from  with 4 the property, then the court has the authority to enjoin 5 the alienation or disposition of property, say tainted, 6 then you can ask for a restraining order to prohibit the 7 prohibition, not just of the tainted property but also 8 of property of equivalent value. 9             If I read that without knowing the 10 background, I would say a lot of cases come up where you 11 get TROs, where they're not precise because you don't 12 know exactly what property you're talking about.  So 13 what do you think about reading this statute to avoid 14 the constitutional question to say the TRO means TRO? 15             And a TRO means where there's some property 16 out there and it may be tainted, mixed up with the 17 untainted, you can get a TRO on the whole thing.  You 18 have to have a speedy hearing.  He has to be 19 represented.  And your purpose of that is to separate 20 the two kinds of assets.  That seems to me to work for 21 the purpose, and it also avoids the constitutional 22 question. 23             MR. DREEBEN:  So two things on that.  I hope 24 I get a chance to say both of them. 25             First, I don't think that it is a serious
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1 constitutional question in light of Monsanto, so I don't 2 really think that there's a serious avoidance concern 3 here.  Monsanto basically said that if the government 4 has shown adequately that it will be able to forfeit the 5 money at the conclusion of the case, the Sixth Amendment 6 doesn't override the government's interests. 7             After all, Justice Breyer, this is basically 8 a zerosum game.  Either there will be money available 9 at the end of the case for the victims or the money will 10 have been spent on lawyers.  And Congress made a 11 judgment that the government can't come in in every case 12 and simply restrain assets upon a showing of nothing. 13 But it does have a statute in a very specific area that 14 allows it to  15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you really  16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what is it that 17 confines your  your rationale to a specific area?  It 18 seems to me that if the government prevails in this 19 case, every State in the union, every locality could say 20 that in the event of assault and battery, malicious  21 malicious mischief, drunk  an accident caused by drunk 22 driving, any crime involving a bodily injury, that the 23 government is entitled to restrain disposition of assets 24 that might be used for medical care, for pain and 25 suffering.  And this would, in effect, prevent the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 private bar from  from practicing law unless it did so 2 on a contingent basis. 3             MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Kennedy, it's correct 4 that our principle is not limited to the types of crimes 5 that are in this case.  It is limited to the government 6 making an adequate showing that at the conclusion of the 7 case, it will have the right to the money. 8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but you're talking 9 about probable cause.  But  but there's  10             MR. DREEBEN:  Understood. 11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The government can often 12 show probable cause, and that's usually the basis for 13 the indictment. 14             MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.  And, I  15 again, I think that Monsanto resolved this question by 16 saying that if the government can take title to the 17 property at the conclusion of the case, it has an 18 interest in ensuring that it is available, and the Sixth 19 Amendment doesn't override it. 20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Dreeben  21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It takes the  it  22 it establishes that right in the same way as the issue 23 here, without counsel on the part of the defendant, 24 because you  I assume Kaley applies to untainted 25 assets as well as untainted.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.

34

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So add to the

3 context of what Justice Breyer was concerned about.  You

4 not only can do that, you can do that without giving the

5 defendant any type of hearing, right?

6             MR. DREEBEN:  No, I think the defendant is

7 often entitled to a hearing.  The question is what

8 issues the defendant may raise at the hearing.  Here,

9 for example, there was clearly an issue of whether the

10 defendant was, in fact, dissipating assets.  And that

11 would have been something that the defendant 

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought  I

13 thought under Kaley, the defendant didn't have to be

14 provided a  a hearing with respect to the pretrial 

15             MR. DREEBEN:  With 

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   seizure of

17 assets.

18             MR. DREEBEN:  With respect to whether

19 there's probable cause to believe that the defendant

20 committed an offense.  That's what Kaley said is

21 controlled.

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Kaley was a question of

23 tracing, because it was 

24             MR. DREEBEN:  It  it was,

25 Justice Sotomayor.  And that 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
35 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you don't have any 2 tracing problem here.  As soon as he commits a crime 3 that you say was worth $45 million, you can freeze 4 $45 million worth of assets, correct? 5             MR. DREEBEN:  Although there were far fewer 6 here because most of them had been dissipated.  And I 7 think that the reason why  8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I respect that, and  9 but  but you agreed that these particular funds were 10 untainted.  I'm told by your adversary  11             MR. DREEBEN:  We  we stipulated  it's 12 technical, but we  we stipulated that there may be 13 some unquantified amount of untainted assets in the 14 assets being restrained.  We did not know, and did not 15 attempt to figure out, and that would be an issue for a 16 later day if the Court said that that mattered. 17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Dreeben, I think, you 18 know, in essence your argument goes like this:  You have 19 Monsanto, you combine Monsanto with a  a simple 20 factual acknowledgment that money is fungible, and it 21 gets you to a judgment in this case.  You win, the 22 petitioner loses.  And  and, you know, that's a fair, 23 strong argument, if  if one is comfortable with 24 Monsanto. 25             I mean, there is  so I think I would just
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 ask you, I mean, suppose the Court is just uncomfortable 2 with the path we started down the road on in Monsanto? 3 And you might be right that it just doesn't make sense 4 to draw a line here, but it leaves you with a situation 5 in which more and more and more we're depriving people 6 of the ability to hire counsel of choice in complicated 7 cases.  And so what should we do with that intuition 8 that Monsanto sent us down the wrong path? 9             MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I  I would hope that 10 the Court sees that even if there are some uncomfortable 11 aspects of Monsanto, it actually rests on a sound legal 12 judgment.  And I  I realize I have said this, but I 13 will keep coming back to this because I think it is the 14 touchstone for Monsanto. 15             Caplin & Drysdale was a postjudgment case. 16 And it said once these funds are forfeitable, the 17 defendant, if he pays his lawyer with them, is paying 18 the lawyer with somebody else's money, namely, the 19 government. 20             Then the question is, can the government do 21 anything to prevent dissipation of the assets before it 22 obtains the judgment?  And the Court said not 23 automatically, not as a general rule it can always come 24 in and say this is what we want, this is what we get. 25 But with an appropriate hearing, the balance of interest
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 does permit the government to preserve the equities.

37

2             Now, this has an effect on counsel of

3 choice.  It has no effect on the ability of the

4 defendant to be represented by counsel.

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, how  I

6 don't know how these things work.  Let's say you get an

7 order freezing the assets, and it's $10 million, and 

8 and the defendant comes into the court, whatever, and

9 says, look, my lawyer is going to cost $100,000, one

10 percent of the assets that are at issue here.  Then you

11 would argue, no, even though it's only a tiny fraction

12 of what we're seizing, the Sixth Amendment doesn't even

13 entitle him to one percent of the assets that might 

14 might end up being forfeitable?

15             MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  I don't think there's an

16 exception in the Sixth Amendment.

17             Now, this is a statute in which the

18 government proceeded through seeking a civil injunction

19 and restraining order, and the district court does have

20 discretion.  It's not a flat rule that forbids the

21 district court from releasing funds for counsel.

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How does it work?

23 Like the  you know, the daughter's tuition bill comes

24 due, you know, and it's whoever  you know, who knows

25 how much these days, $60,000.  And the defendant cannot

Alderson Reporting Company

1 pay that?

Official

38

2             MR. DREEBEN:  Not as a matter of right.  But

3 this is a civil statute in which the judge can exercise

4 equitable discretion.  And if the defendant comes in and

5 says 

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why was it 

7 why would it be  if he can exercise equitable

8 discretion for the daughter's tuition, why  why not

9 when the Sixth Amendment is at stake?  And, you know,

10 counsel of choice, it turns on that, it would seem to me

11 that if there's going to be a case in which equitable

12 discretion will be exercised, it ought to be in that

13 situation.

14             MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I don't think

15 automatically so.  Here the judge said one consideration

16 is, will the defendant have representation in the 1345

17 proceeding itself?  The defendant did.  Mr. Srebnick

18 represented the defendant in that proceeding.  So the

19 court said, I don't need to worry about that.

20             Then the court turned to the question of

21 whether the defendant needed counsel in the criminal

22 case and said, the defendant will be afforded counsel in

23 the criminal case, by appointment if necessary.

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you get back  you had

25 two responses to my reading of the statute.  I heard the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 first, and I didn't hear the second.

39

2             MR. DREEBEN:  So this 

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  By the way, let me  let

4 me remind you 

5             MR. DREEBEN:  I remember exactly what 

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  But I want to say it,

7 because maybe you can focus on this.  We're in before

8 the judge on a TRO.  Our object of the TRO is to

9 separate the assets that are not this man's from the

10 assets that are this man's.  So we do that separation.

11             Now we say $10,000 is not his, it's the

12 bank's.  $15,000 or $10,000 over here is totally his;

13 he's never been convicted of the crime.

14             What's the government's interest?  And why

15 can't he take this other, once we've had the TRO 

16             MR. DREEBEN:  So Justice Breyer 

17             JUSTICE BREYER:   to separate it?

18             MR. DREEBEN:   I think I need to stop you

19 here because it's not a TRO.  The statute does not 

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  I know.  It says

21 restraining order 

22             MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.

23             JUSTICE BREYER:   and my suggestion is we

24 read those words "restraining order" as "temporary

25 restraining order," which (3)(b), it seems to me,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 clearly permits, but we can get into that argument.

40

2 I'll worry about that later.

3             MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that the 

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to know what your

5 second response was to that.

6             MR. DREEBEN:  My second response is that

7 this a statute that contains two basic provisions.  I

8 think petitioner describes it accurately.

9             Section (a) describes the things the

10 government can seek under the statute; Subsection (B)

11 describes the procedure that's used.

12             Subsection (A) first allows the government

13 to get an injunction against fraud in (A)(1).  In (A)(2)

14 it allows it to restrain assets as the ultimate object

15 of the suit, not as a temporary interim measure.

16             Temporary interim measures are described in

17 Subsection (B) where it specifically allows the Court to

18 impose various restraints until the Court has concluded

19 the proceeding.  So it addresses temporary relief in

20 (B).

21             Subsection (A)(2) describes the things that

22 the government can seek as the ultimate object of the

23 case.  Injunction against the person who has the funds,

24 or a restraining order against any person to restrain

25 the funds that are derived from illegal activity, or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 funds of equivalent value.

41

2             And just to make one final point on that,

3 the reason that makes sense in a banking context and in

4 a healthcare context is dollars are fungible, as

5 Justice Alito said earlier.  They will flow into an

6 account; they will flow out into other accounts.  It's

7 difficult to trace them.

8             So Congress obviated the need to do that by

9 saying you can restrain the defendant, but we're not

10 going to rely only on restraining the defendant.  You

11 can also restrain the banks where the funds are.  And

12 you can restrain them not only in the amounts that

13 represent the tainted funds, but represent the monetary

14 equivalent of them.

15             So in a sense 

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't  go ahead and

17 finish.

18             MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think, in a sense,

19 this statute negates the premise that there is a clean

20 line between tainted funds and untainted funds.  The

21 money is fungible once it's received by the defendant.

22             There is Medicare fraud if the government

23 establishes probable cause, and its financial interest

24 is ensuring that it can have a judgment to make whole

25 the Medicare trust fund or other victims at the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 conclusion of the case.

42

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm  I'm troubled by this

3 statute.  I  I can't understand the difference between

4 (a) and (B).  I don't think  the issue was not raised

5 in the cert petition, and I don't know whether it can be

6 brought in with the Doctrine of Constitutional

7 Avoidance, because it really has nothing to do with the

8 Sixth Amendment.  This would apply regardless of whether

9 there's any Sixth Amendment issue in the case.

10             But, having said that  Mr. Srebnick can

11 address those in rebuttal if he wishes to, but having

12 said that, if (B) does not refer to a temporary form of

13 relief, then  which I understand to be your

14 argument  then I don't understand what (a)

15 contributes.

16             MR. DREEBEN:  So (a)(2) has two different

17 sections, and it describes what the government can seek

18 as the ultimate relief in the case.

19             This started out as an antifraud injunction

20 statute.  Somebody is going around with the boiler room

21 operation or a Ponzi scheme; it takes a while to get the

22 evidence to indict.  The government can come in and seek

23 an injunction to prevent further fraud.

24             Then Congress added (a)(2) on the theory

25 that there's something else the government needs to do,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 ensure that money is available at the conclusion of

43

2 whatever parallel criminal case or civil fraud case the

3 government brings.

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  So what they can do is

5 this?  If we read this literally under (B), that

6 Mr. Smith is indicted for a banking law violation, he

7 has $100,000 of other people's money.  The government

8 can say that the order  the restraining order of the

9 Court prohibits his wife, any other client, the milk

10 man, anyone in the world, from taking, not the $100,000

11 that belongs to the bank, but any other $100,000 that he

12 got for any other purpose, I guess including his

13 retirement fund, including no matter what.

14             I mean, that is  goes  it seems to me

15 that's what it says  any other person from taking

16 property of equivalent value, and he hasn't been

17 convicted of anything.

18             MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, but it's  it's

19 referring, again, to a person who has  there is

20 probable cause to believe has obtained money as a result

21 of a criminal violation, and then it provides a

22 mechanism for restraining it.  It's not aimed at

23 restraining people who have nothing to do with the case,

24 unless they're holding the defendant's money.

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, this is  this is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 innocent money, the defendant's, not the money he

44

2 obtained as a result of the violation.  The money he

3 didn't obtain, that's what this case is about.

4             MR. DREEBEN:  The innocent money versus

5 tainted money all depends on a theory that they are

6 economically pure.  Now, the  the only argument that

7 Mr. Srebnick made to distinguish them, and I realize

8 there may be members of the Court who think this is not

9 a very good argument, and maybe the question is whether

10 Monsanto is at root problematic, but at least insofar as

11 that argument goes, it's based on a reading of the

12 relationbacked doctrine that's contrary to this Court's

13 cases.

14             Monsanto itself made this very clear.  It

15 said that the government can restrain money that will

16 become the government's property at the conclusion of

17 the case.

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Dreeben, you're

19 taking Monsanto out of context, because 853, by its

20 nature, was limited to tainted funds.  This is the first

21 statute if  that I know of that permits the government

22 to come in and take untainted funds.  The incidence of

23 the tainted funds concept was, you can't spend another

24 person's money.  You stole this money somehow, and you

25 can't spend that money because it belongs to someone

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 else.  It really doesn't belong to you.  But it's not 2 until a judgment  and this is what your adversary is 3 trying to say  that the money that's untainted, the 4 money that  or the property that he bought before this 5 crime, this untainted property becomes yours.  It's not 6 until that moment, the judgment, that the property is 7 forfeitable. 8             MR. DREEBEN:  That's true. 9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You can't forfeit it 10 beforehand.  So now the issue is  11             MR. DREEBEN:  That's true for all  that's 12 true or all money, tainted and untainted. 13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but  but still 14 the question becomes, is there a substantive difference, 15 and I think Justice Breyer is expressing  the problem 16 with this, as Justice Kagan said, this intuitive sense, 17 which is where do we draw this line? 18             MR. DREEBEN:  So  19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does the right to 20 counsel have any meaning anymore? 21             MR. DREEBEN:  I think it does. 22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Frankly, I expect within 23 three to five years, if we rule in your favor, 853 will 24 be changed to have this same language. 25             MR. DREEBEN:  So 853, Justice Sotomayor,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 does permit forfeiture of substitute property.

46

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes, but not pretrial.

3             MR. DREEBEN:  Not  not pretrial.  This

4 statute is different because it has a different function

5 and a different purpose.  But the basic concept of

6 forfeiture is punishing the defendant by taking money

7 through forfeiture that's equivalent to the tainted

8 property if the tainted property is gone.  That's the

9 policy behind it.  Now 

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's true of every

11 judgment.

12             MR. DREEBEN:  It is true 

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Every judgment gives you

14 a right to substitute property of some sort.

15             MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, but  but the point is

16 that the tainted property and the substitute property

17 are similarly situated at the end of the forfeiture

18 case.  The government has a property right in each of

19 them, but the  I don't think the property right is

20 really the essence of what's going on here.

21             The fact that Section 853 permits pretrial

22 restraint of tainted property, but it doesn't reference

23 the subsection that deals with substitute property, is a

24 feature of that statute, but I think that has nothing to

25 do with the underlying point, which is that if the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 government is going to be able to collect on its

47

2 forfeiture judgment, sometimes it will need to restrain

3 property.  Monsanto recognizes that, and I don't think

4 that saying that the defendant has a interest in paying

5 for counsel trumps the government's interest in being

6 made whole at the conclusion of the case.

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Dreeben 

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  When did the  when did

9 the  when was the first statute that allowed the

10 government to restrain the expenditure of tainted funds?

11 Does that go back a long time or 

12             MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the  the whole history

13 of in personam forfeiture was dormant until 1970, and

14 then Congress passed a statute that permitted this kind

15 of activity.  It improved the statute in 1984 to remedy

16 defects in the pretrial restraint of assets.

17             So it was relatively recently developed,

18 targeting basically drug conspiracies and organized

19 criminal activity.

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And  and the first time

21 that Congress ever applied it to nontainted property

22 was what year?

23             MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the substitute assets

24 provision was added to the  the basic forfeiture

25 statute, and it was there at least by 1984.  I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that it may have been earlier as well.

48

2             This provision is different, as Justice

3 Sotomayor pointed out, from the basic forfeiture statute

4 in permitting pretrial restraint of any assets, but I

5 think that it reflects the same basic underlying idea.

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that 

7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And  but just  just to

8 be clear, so that I understood your earlier answer, the

9 consequence, the necessary consequence of your position

10 is that any State in the union can provide for

11 forfeiture or a freeze  a freeze of assets pending

12 trial in any assault and battery case, spousal abuse

13 case, criminal negligence, date rape cases in order to

14 make the victim whole, to pay for medical costs, to pay

15 for pain and suffering, and can freeze those assets even

16 if the consequences of that is that in most of those

17 cases most people cannot afford counsel.

18             MR. DREEBEN:  So if  if at the conclusion

19 of the case 

20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's the consequence of

21 your argument?

22             MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that if there is

23 a  yes, if there is a monetary assessment that will

24 become provable at the conclusion of the case and the

25 government can show a need to preserve the assets so

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that they're available.

49

2             I mean, think about the cases that you're

3 talking about, Justice Kennedy.  They are cases in which

4 victims have been harmed.  Serious medical costs may be

5 at issue.  If the funds are spent on an attorney, they

6 will not be available for compensation.

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, and they're

8 all cases in which the defendant has not been found

9 guilty.  And  and in all those cases, I mean, all you

10 have to do, all the governments have to do, all the

11 State governments have to do, is provide for a fine and

12 argue, then, well, unless we  if we don't freeze the

13 assets, there won't be money left to pay a fine.  So

14 this could apply  I guess this is the point.  This

15 could apply to every crime on the books.

16             MR. DREEBEN:  So I  I do think the Court

17 could draw distinctions among the types of fines and the

18 purposes of the fines that are at issue.  So it's not 

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  Have you seen  have you

20 seen the judgments in the fraud on the market cases?  I

21 mean, it isn't too tough in cases involving fraud on the

22 market to find judgments of tens or hundreds of millions

23 of dollars, I mean, judgments in fines after

24 convictions, and that's what, I think, the question is.

25             The principle of constitutional law that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1 you're advocating would, in fact, permit the freezing of 2 what might be paid afterwards in a fine which could be a 3 huge amount before the person is convicted.  Am I right? 4             MR. DREEBEN:  So  well, I  I do think 5 that I was trying to say to the Chief Justice that there 6 could be distinctions that are drawn among various 7 monetary exactions.  I think the strongest case is when 8 victim compensation is at issue.  All the money in 9 the  the context of a Medicare fraud case like this, 10 although it's not required by statute, it will be 11 returned to the Medicare trust fund.  This is a fraud 12 against the people.  $45 million is obtained, we allege, 13 by fraud.  Most of  14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It goes to the 15 Medicaid trust fund? 16             MR. DREEBEN:  Medicare trust fund, 17 provided to the Medicare trust fund. 18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The  will go to 19 the victims? 20             MR. DREEBEN:  Yes. 21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does that go to the 22 victims in case? 23             MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the Medicare trust fund, 24 which represents basically the fiscal interests of the 25 people of the United States is the victim.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry?

51

2             MR. DREEBEN:  The Medicare trust fund, from

3 which the funds came that we say are obtained by fraud,

4 is the victim.  So the funds will be returned to the

5 victim.  That's the purpose of trying to freeze the

6 funds in a health care case, so that they can be

7 returned.

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Dreeben, you're

9 saying that your  your view, your interpretation, your

10 reading of the statute is the only tenable one, but if

11 one took the view that Justice Breyer's interpretation,

12 that restraining order means a temporary restraining

13 order, or it was another interpretation put forth in the

14 Americans for Forfeiture Reform brief, because if  if

15 a judge were to take the position that all of  all

16 three are plausible readings of the statute, but we'll

17 pick the one that allows the defendant to have counsel.

18             MR. DREEBEN:  So Justice Ginsburg, we don't

19 think that any of the alternative readings are

20 plausible.  For the reasons that I explained to Justice

21 Breyer, this statute doesn't limit the restraining order

22 to temporary relief, nor would it make any logical sense

23 to do that because the purpose of this statute was to

24 preserve funds so that they would be available at the

25 conclusion of the case.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1             I also think that the amicus argument is not 2 a tenable one because it simply reads "or equivalent 3 value" out of the statute and without any reference to 4 the context of the statute, which is to try to make the 5 government be able to be made whole at the conclusion of 6 a case if, in fact, it obtains a judgment given the very 7 difficult process of segregating out money in banking 8 and financialtype crimes. 9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Dreeben, if I could go 10 back to Justice Alito's questions about your 11 interpretation of the statute, I think what Justice 12 Alito was suggesting was that (a)(2)(A) would be 13 completely subsumed by (a)(2)(B) on your interpretation, 14 and I don't think that you got around to answering that 15 question. 16             MR. DREEBEN:  So I  I think that that  17 that is true.  I think this Court understands, from 18 arguments last week, that superfluity is no stranger to 19 congressional statutes.  They do have a different focus, 20 though, and I think it was quite reasonable for Congress 21 to make clear what that focus is.  2(A) is aimed at the 22 person who's doing the dissipating themselves, the 23 person who obtained the property by fraud, and (B) 24 expands that out. 25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but in  in just saying
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that, you're essentially saying, yes, (B) expands it

53

2 out, meaning it covers everything that (A) covers and

3 some more.

4             MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, but the  it's not that

5 this is a statute that anyone's reading gives off

6 provisions of fact because the (b) section, 1345(b)

7 permits restraining orders or prohibitions during the

8 course of the case as are needed to protect the

9 United States against the substantial injury.  So that

10 provision would subsume the  the reading that my

11 friend gives.

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think that there's

13 any 

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead.

15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think that there's

16 any way to read this statute such that it applies to

17 people who wish to retain counsel as opposed to make

18 other expenditures?

19             MR. DREEBEN:  No, I don't think there's any

20 reading of the statute that exempts counsel.

21             It does give discretion to the district

22 court to entertain arguments.  Those arguments were made

23 here and rejected.

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

5             I think all of us who heard the argument of

6 Monsanto and Caplin & Drysdale when it was delivered in

7 1989 understood the line was drawn between tainted and

8 untainted assets.  And that was a line  while the

9 defense bar had its druthers, was a line that was

11 move that line and essentially make the line disappear

12 altogether.

14             JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't want to use up your

15 rebuttal time, but I do want to ask you two quick

16 questions about the statute.

17             First is:  Did you raise anything about this

18 in your cert petition?  And the second is:  Is there a

19 way to limit this to the Sixth Amendment context?

20             MR. SREBNICK:  The answer to the first

21 question is no.  In our cert petition, since we were

22 constrained in the Eleventh Circuit by the

23 interpretation that had been given back in 1999, we

24 focused on the constitutional issue in order to suggest

25 to the Court that the doctrine of constitutional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
55 1 avoidance should be triggered because there's a Sixth 2 Amendment problem. 3             The Eleventh Circuit has concluded that the 4 statute is ambiguous. 5             JUSTICE ALITO:  You didn't say anything 6 about constitutional avoidance in your cert position, 7 did you? 8             MR. SREBNICK:  That is correct.  We argued 9 that the Constitution would be violated, and because 10 this Court, in its discretion and indeed in the Rumsfeld 11 vs. FAIR case, looks at a statute even if the 12 interpretation is offered at the merit stage by an 13 amicus, the Court has considered those competing 14 interpretations in order to avoid the constitutional 15 issue. 16             Justice Scalia, in response to your question 17 about property, it sure sounded to anyone who heard the 18 argument and read the opinions in Monsanto and Caplin & 19 Drysdale that it was much about property.  The 20 government, by invoking the taint theory, which does 21 date back to the founding of our nation, taints a 22 particular subject, and that is the tainted asset. 23 That's why it's called the taint theory.  It's 24 counterintuitive to suggest that untainted assets should 25 be treated as tainted assets.

1             And because, as I used the word earlier,

56

2 there must be a coexistence between the taint theory and

3 the right to counsel of choice, Monsanto drew the line,

4 Caplin & Drysdale drew the line and said if the

5 government can establish that the asset is tainted, it

6 can be frozen.

7             Nothing about Monsanto, nothing about Caplin

8 & Drysdale, suggested that assets over which the

9 government has no present property interest, no

10 relationbacked theory, no taint theory to speak of, can

11 then take Aunt Sally's money or a client's pension funds

12 needed to  for representation to use those assets to

13 retain counsel.  Nothing in this Court's precedent in

14 those cases suggests that.

15             And naturally, as a member of the defense

16 bar, we would welcome a revisiting of Monsanto and

17 Caplin & Drysdale because the parade of horribles is

18 here today.  The government says quite candidly there is

19 no line.  If the fine is $1 million, the defendant has

20 to pony up, ante up $1 million up front in order to

21 exercise his right to counsel.  The right to counsel of

22 choice will have a price tag.  And it is whatever the

23 government says the maximum fine is.  Whatever the

24 maximum restitution is, that will be the price that the

25 defendant must pay in advance.  It's an advance fee that

57 1 the defendant must pay according to the government in
 2 order to be able to exercise his Sixth Amendment rights.
 3 We ask the Court to reject such an interpretation.
 4
             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 5             The case is submitted. 6             (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the
 7 aboveentitled matter was submitted.) 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
