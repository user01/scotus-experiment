    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: William Freeman's plea agreement, his presentence report, and the sentencing record all show that his term of imprisonment was based on a crack cocaine guideline that was retroactively lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission. This case asked the Court to decide whether the fact that a sentencing court accepted a plea agreement under Criminal Rule 11(c)(1)(C) precludes eligibility for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2). We submit that Mr. Freeman is not barred from eligibility for a (c)(2) sentence reduction for several reasons. First, under the ordinary definition of \"based upon\" and in the context of this particular statute, since the subsequently lowered guideline was used to determine Mr. Freeman's term of imprisonment, that term of imprisonment was based on the subsequently lowered guideline. Second, the categorical ban on eligibility adopted by the Sixth Circuit and advanced by the Government frustrates the purpose underlying section (c)(2) and finds no support in the plain language of the statute, of the rule, and under the terms of Mr. Freeman's plea agreement. Third, a record-based analysis that reviews the plea agreement, the presentence report, and the sentencing record to determine the basis of the sentence is -- is best suited to correctly implement section (c)(2), and it's -- that record-based analysis supports the conclusion that Mr. Freeman's sentence was indeed based on a retroactively lowered guideline.

First of all, maybe the defendant is elderly. Maybe the defendant has serious medical conditions. Maybe the defendant has -- was guidelines, even in that situation, provide the starting point for analysis?

If those -- if there was nothing in that plea agreement to tie the sentence to the -- the sentence -- the agreed sentence to the guidelines, that certainly would be problematic. But that doesn't resolve the issue one way or the other, because the judge would have to consider the presentence report to see if there's a connection or correlation between the agreed sentence and the complicated. You have to look at everything and you're not giving us a lot of guidance as to what you do when you -- when you see these things.

So it's not just whether the guidelines played a role; it's whether this particular sentencing range was what was driving the sentence.  imprisonment. At the bottom of page 25, the agreement says that a fine will be at the lowest end of the applicable guideline range. And then if you go over to pages 27 and 28 in paragraph 11, that's where the guideline calculation occurs. And notice it is an incomplete calculation.

That's completely different from the way it deals with a fine. It specifically says there's an agreement that the sentence of 106 months of incarceration is the appropriate amount.

The judge can do that at the time when the sentence is imposed. We roll the clock back on the crack -- on the crack cocaine guidelines. Under the authority that So it seems to lead logically to the conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old pre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that that is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the whole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous."

If the judge were to -- to misapply the guidelines before he engages in the analysis that you're talking about, Justice Alito, that would be grounds for an appeal. In retrospect, if the judge is asked whether the sentence was based on the guidelines, he -- he may say that particular sentence wasn't, because I ended up disregarding the guidelines under 3553(a). I did the analysis. I was exercising my sentencing discretion the first time around under 3553(a), and the guidelines ended up not being the basis of the sentence.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GANNON",
    "speech": "I -- I do think that -- that this gets puzzling as -- as you get further down, but I think that this is the simplest case. It is a narrow category of cases. We are dealing with a subset of one particular type of plea agreement. It is distinct from every other aspect of Federal sentencing. It's unlike what happens when somebody goes to trial; in those circumstances the judge clearly has the discretion to apply the sentencing guidelines at the time of sentencing. It is different from regular type B plea agreements where the parties have come up with an agreement and the judge notwithstanding the agreement is still free to determine the sentence that he or she wants to determine. that going back to what had bothered Justice Alito and Justice Scalia on now that the guidelines are not mandatory, is any sentence even under C really based on the agreement? Because even a C agreement has to be approved by the judge. The legal consequence is not the agreement. That doesn't sentence the defendant. It is the judge's decision as to what the sentence should be which he denotes in accepting the agreement that binds. And I think -- I may be making Justice Breyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement and it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge feels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a sentence in the guidelines and impose one in the guidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not the guideline sentence?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GANNON",
    "speech": "Well, because I think that the relevant question for purposes of both 3582(c)(2) and the policy statements that the court said in Dillon controls the -- the process of implementing 3582(c)(2), accept the plea agreement, the relevant phrase in 1B1.10(b)1 which is -- which is on page 8A of the government's appendix is that the judge is supposed to go back and look at what --to only make substitutions for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced. And so when you have a type C plea agreement that has a specific sentence even under the terms of this agreement, the only thing that the judge considered when he decided the sentence was going to be 106 months with respect to the term of imprisonment was the binding plea agreement. That is what rule 11(c)(1)(C) required."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GANNON",
    "speech": "And had he not done that the proceeding would have occurred differently and it may not even have right occurred then, and -- and I think because under Rule 11 if he was rejecting the plea agreement and -- and the 106 months that the parties had agreed to, he would have to give the defendant the right to withdraw the plea at that point. So the government would have been released from its obligations; the parties -- the defendant could have gone to trial. He could have -- he could have continued to plead guilty. The parties could have come up with a type plea -- B plea agreement. The parties may have asked for time to renegotiate a different type C agreement. We do not know what would have happened in those circumstances. And as you pointed out before, Justice Sotomayor, this is not about asking the judge to step into the shoes of the parties and renegotiate what the agreement would have been had the judge decided to reject it the first time around. Instead 3582(c)(2) contemplates a limited process by which the judge will sentencing, the judge did not actually have to apply the drug quantity table."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "I am not following that argument for this reason. It seems to me if you ask what did the judge apply at the time he imposed the original sentence, well, it has got to be the guidelines, because first the agreement provides for it; then he says I am going to wait for the probation report so I can see what the calculation is, whether I agree with it; and then he gives him a sentence that is precisely within the guidelines. So if you asked me to describe what that sentence was -- of what was it, 46 to 106 days -- I say that was a guideline sentence. It was right there within the brackets that -- the guidelines. So why wasn't it a guideline sentence?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GANNON",
    "speech": "Because for purposes of the term of imprisonment the judge was not actually applying the guidelines at that point. He did so for purposes of the fine. He ended up actually waiving the relevant the guideline range and he concluded that that was the applicable guideline range which he needed to do for purposes of calculating the fine and other things, but it wasn't actually the basis for the sentence. The basis for the sentence was the plea agreement that he accepted, and there it was the parties' agreement. And there are all sorts of things that went into the parties' agreement that the judge does not have the wherewithal to reconsider in retrospect."

  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

  {
    "speaker": "GANNON",
    "speech": "Yes. And that specifically contemplated in Rule 11(c) and in the guidelines, that the judge may postpone acceptance of the plea agreement until after the presentence report is prepared. And the judge did do that here. So he was aware of what the PSR recommended, but once, and had he decided that he did then have then argued for a higher sentence within the range. Could have argued that the criminal history failed to represent the seriousness of the defendant's criminal past. Could have argued for an upward departure even, but the Defendant got the benefit of the 106 month agreement of not having the Government raise any of those other arguments at that time. And now he is asking for essentially another bite of the apple and we think that because the basis for the sentence was indeed the negotiation and the agreement between the parties, that the court of appeals decision was correct. If there are no further questions."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "HEFT",
    "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. Just a couple of points. First of all, the record here leaves no doubt that the judge based his sentence on the guidelines as set out therein.\" On page 48 of the joint appendix the judge says, having considered the advisory guidelines, he went on to impose that sentence. So it is quite clear that the judge and even in his statements of reasons on page 95 of the joint appendix, again reaffirmed that this sentence was based on the guidelines. Now, the other point that I'd like to make is that the Government acknowledges that it has carved out a very small exception to its argument that C pleas regarding specific sentences and sentencing ranges are not eligible for (c)(2) relief. But it seems to me that reading, taking the Government position into account, if this plea agreement had not stated 106 months, then Mr. Freeman's under the terms of this plea agreement in the Government's view and under the Government's argument of what exception exists under the C pleas for purposes of 3582, Mr. Freeman would be eligible for the relief that was granted. And we would simply urge the Court in this case to adopt a rule that does not exclude specific sentences and C pleas for eligibility in 3582. Thank you."
