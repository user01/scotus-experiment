1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument first this morning in Case 08-1322, Astrue v. 5 Ratliff. 6 Mr. Yang. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 EAJA provides that in an appropriate case a 12 court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other 13 expenses incurred by that party. Every court of appeals 14 to have addressed the question, including the court 15 below, recognized that the plain meaning of EAJA's text 16 directs payment of EAJA fees and other expenses to the 17 prevailing party, and not her attorneys. 18 Moreover, EAJA's relationship to the fees 19 approved under section 406(b) of the Social Security Act 20 and this Court's decisions in Jeff D. and Venegas in the 21 section 1988 fee context make clear that Congress 22 designed EAJA, like other fee-shifting statutes, 23 to work within traditional attorney-client fee 24 relationships, under which the attorney looks to the 25 client for payment.

1 Congress has also provided that, subject to 2 exceptions not relevant here, all funds payable to the 3 -- by the United States to an individual who owes a 4 valid delinquent debt, Federal debt, shall be reduced by 5 administrative offset. 6 There is no dispute in this case 7 that the prevailing party in this case, Ms. Kills Ree, 8 owed a valid delinquent debt to the United States, 9 received notice of that debt, had the opportunity to 10 repay that debt or enter into a repayment agreement that 11 would have avoided offset, failed to do so. Congress 12 directed in the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 13 that agencies and the Department of Treasury here shall 14 offset such payments for delinquent debts. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it true that the 16 Commissioner of Social Security in the past paid EAJA 17 awards directly to attorneys and that this is still 18 done in cases in which the client has assigned the 19 payment to an attorney? 20 MR. YANG: That is true in part. Prior to 21 2005, the Treasury Department did not yet implement, 22 fully implement, the Debt Collection Improvement Act 23 with respect to certain payments. Here, these are 24 miscellaneous payments. Treasury undertook the very 25 large undertaking of computerizing the system to provide

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 for offsets by tackling things like tax refunds, Federal 2 benefits, most contractor payments, large payment 3 systems that the government deals with on a day-to-day 4 basis, and only in 2005 was able to implement 5 miscellaneous offsets. 6 Since 2005, the government has been 7 offsetting EAJA payments. Now, in some circumstances 8 where a debt is owed -- where an EAJA payment is made 9 and a court, for instance, orders the government to pay 10 the attorney, the government's policy is to check 11 whether or not there is a delinquent debt a prevailing 12 party owes, and if not, then the government may accept 13 the assignment or comply with the -14 JUSTICE ALITO: What gives the Federal 15 Government the right to override State law on that 16 issue? Suppose the situation was that another creditor 17 would have priority over the attorney if the money had 18 been paid directly to the claimant. 19 What gives the government the right, in 20 effect, to override that by paying the money directly to 21 the attorney, unless the government believes that this 22 is payable to the attorney under -- under EAJA? 23 MR. YANG: I don't believe so. There's two 24 circumstances where -- that we might be talking about. 25 The first circumstance might be where a court has
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 ordered the government to pay the attorney. That 2 happens in a number of cases. 3 When the government does not have a debt 4 which is receivable from the prevailing party, it 5 complies with the district court's order. It simply 6 does not have a dog in that fight. When we have an 7 assignment that the government recognizes, that's true 8 in any kind of context where you might have an 9 assignment. The government recognizes the assignment. 10 If there are third-party creditors who are able to come 11 in, they may come in and contest that. They likely 12 wouldn't have notice of it. But it's no different than 13 any other assignment that the government might accept, 14 from a party, of the debt, and that is not an infrequent 15 event. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: What authority does a court 17 have to direct that the money be paid to the attorney? 18 MR. YANG: Well, it certainly doesn't lie in 19 EAJA. Courts have recognized that they retain equitable 20 authority to recognize a constructive trust or an 21 equitable lien to enforce an agreement between the 22 attorney and client that the client will pay over to an 23 attorney funds received pursuant to an award such as 24 EAJA. And in that context, although courts haven't been 25 particularly clear in their reasoning -- they have cited
6 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to equity -- the courts have provided that when, for 2 instance, an attorney represents a client pro bono or 3 represents a prisoner pro bono, that the court will see 4 to it that the payment actually received doesn't 5 ultimately land in the hands of the client and enforces 6 the understanding, either expressed or implicit, between 7 the attorney and client that the funds that the client 8 receives will go to the attorney. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen in the 10 case -- in case it is a prisoner who is this 11 prevailing party? Would the -- would the attorney fee 12 be paid to the prisoner? And if not, to whom would it 13 be paid? 14 MR. YANG: The attorney fee under EAJA is 15 payable to the prevailing party, which would be the 16 prisoner. Now, attorneys would likely come in, the 17 attorneys for the prisoner, and ask the court to 18 exercise its equitable authority to recognize a 19 constructive trust over the fees that are actually paid 20 to the party and prevent the party from keeping that 21 money. But a prisoner is ultimately no different than 22 any other prevailing party under EAJA. It is the 23 prevailing party to whom Congress has directed the court 24 shall award fees and other expenses. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how can the
7 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 court's broad equitable authority trump what you say is 2 what the statute says? 3 MR. YANG: They are not trumping it, Your 4 Honor. The -- there's two things going on when a court 5 recognizes an equitable trust. First, it has to 6 necessarily recognize the right of the prevailing party 7 to the payment. The prevailing party obtains the payment, 8 and only once the prevailing party actually has title to 9 the thing does equitable trust or a constructive trust 10 attach. So it's recognizing in the EAJA context that 11 the prevailing party is the one who is entitled to the 12 fee, but then -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you actually have 14 to transfer it or -15 MR. YANG: Well -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, the statute 17 says pay the prevailing party. 18 MR. YANG: Correct. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're saying 20 the court can say: No, pay the lawyer. 21 MR. YANG: Well -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In certain -23 MR. YANG: In order to recognize the 24 agreement between the party and the attorney. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is the agreement
8 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 between the party and the attorney? The Equal Access to 2 Justice Act provides that fees will be paid to the 3 prevailing party. Where does the prevailing party have 4 a contract with the attorney to turn the fees over? 5 MR. YANG: I'm sorry. I didn't -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said that pursuant -7 maybe I misunderstood you, but I thought you said that 8 there is a contract between the prevailing party and the 9 attorney. And where is -- how does that contract come 10 about if it's simply a case that the lawyer is 11 representing pro bono a plaintiff? 12 MR. YANG: Well, as this Court recognized in 13 Venegas in the section 1988 context, it's commonplace 14 either for there to be an expressed or an implied 15 agreement to pay over any statutory award that the 16 prevailing party may receive to the attorney. And I 17 think, in the absence of any indication otherwise, courts 18 are well positioned to simply say, you know, if they 19 haven't agreed otherwise, the normal practice would be 20 for a prevailing party, if they were to receive 21 something under a statutory fee-shifting provision like 22 section 1988 or like EAJA, to agree to pay it to the 23 attorney. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't -- doesn't the 25 government setoff depend upon who owns the money under
9 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 State law? I mean, it's -- it's commonplace for the 2 Federal law to look to State law on issues of ownership. 3 And, in fact, if there is this doctrine of equitable 4 ownership on the part of the attorney, what right does 5 the government have to do the setoff? 6 MR. YANG: Well, that might be true if we 7 were relying on a common law offset. But in this 8 context, Congress has directed that all Federal 9 payments, unless there is an exception -- and there is 10 no exception in this case -- are to be offset before 11 payment, any payment, to the debtor. So in this case, 12 Congress has effectively established a priority scheme 13 whereby when a debtor owes a delinquent valid debt to 14 the United States and the United States owes an 15 offsetting obligation to that individual, Congress has 16 provided that no Federal funds shall be paid to the 17 individual and instead that the debt -- the government's 18 debt shall be offset against the debt that the -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the client 20 is bankrupt? What happens then? 21 MR. YANG: The same rule would apply. No 22 Federal payment would -- well -- I believe that the same 23 rule would apply. I've not carefully studied the 24 bankruptcy provisions, and I hate to venture into a very 25 complicated area to give you something definitive. But
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 my belief is that, based on the very clear text of 2 section 3716 of Title 31, which was amended by the Debt 3 Collection Improvement Act, that no payment shall be -4 even in bankruptcy, the payment goes to the -- has 5 to go to the debtor first, and then it goes to the estate 6 -- that no payment shall be made from the Treasury and 7 instead an administrative offset shall be undertaken to 8 collect the government's debt. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a way for the 10 lawyer -- a lawyer sees that his client has a good case 11 against the government, and thinks he can get an EAGA 12 fee, so he says to the client: I'd like to represent 13 you and I can get paid for this. But the client says: 14 There are a lot of debts I owe the government. 15 Now, is there any way they can work it out 16 so he can get the representation? 17 MR. YANG: Well, sure. There's -18 JUSTICE BREYER: What? 19 MR. YANG: As we indicated in our brief, 20 there's several things that can be done. First, the 21 attorney can determine whether there is in fact a debt 22 which is eligible for offset, and that can be done by 23 asking the Treasury with a valid Privacy Act waiver from 24 the client. If that is the case, the client retains the 25 right, which Congress expressly codified in section
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 3716, the right to enter into a repayment agreement. If 2 that is done, there will be no offset, and the repayment 3 agreement is largely governed by the Federal claims 4 collections standards, which are codified at 31 C.F.R. 900 5 to 904, and those -- those provisions provide in section 6 901.8, for instance, that installments shall -- should 7 bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and 8 the debtor's ability to pay. And in some instances, the 9 government agency is able to compromise that debt if the 10 debtor is unable to repay it within a reasonable amount of 11 time. The agency should consider the age, health, 12 present and potential income, as well as assets of the 13 debtor, in order to determine the -14 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, the lawyer 15 and the agency and the client sit down, and the lawyer 16 says: Here, I can get some money for this client and 17 that will help everybody, but I want to be paid. So I 18 want you, Agency, to agree that on the repayment 19 schedule if I get an EAGA fee, then I get to keep it and 20 I don't have to give it to my client, who will have to 21 give it to the government. And then they can sign a 22 piece of paper and then that's done and the lawyer gets 23 to keep the money. 24 MR. YANG: That -- that's correct. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: And has that ever happened?
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. YANG: I don't know that that's happened 2 in this offset context. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: But it could now. Now 4 people would know about, and they could do it. 5 MR. YANG: It could well happen, and in 6 fact -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what's -- what's the 8 authority for the government to enter into the agreement? 9 MR. YANG: The authority -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if the statute 11 says there has to be an offset, that's it. 12 MR. YANG: Well, the statute also provides, 13 under section 3711, for the Department of Justice and the 14 Department of Treasury to establish guidelines for 15 agencies. They have done so in Parts 901 to -- or 900 16 to 904 of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do the guidelines 18 reflect Justice Breyer's hypothetical? 19 MR. YANG: Well, the statute actually 20 reflects Justice Breyer's hypothetical, because at 21 section 3716 -- this is at page 9a of the government's 22 brief's appendix -- the head of the agency, prior to 23 implementing an administrative offset must advise -24 this is on a4 -- the debtor of the opportunity to make a 25 written agreement with the head of the agency to repay
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the amount of the claim. That reflects the practice in 2 the Federal claims collections standards of agreeing to 3 repayment of such claims. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what 5 would motivate the government to agree to give to a 6 lawyer a piece of a recovery that it, the government, 7 thinks it's entitled to? I mean, it's one thing to work 8 a repayment plan. That starts on the proposition that 9 the individual can only each week or month or whatever 10 give a certain amount of money over. But what -11 MR. YANG: Well, I think the hypothetical was 12 premised at the beginning of the lawsuit rather than at 13 the end. If -- if the case were at the end and the 14 government were ordered to pay EAJA fees, the offset 15 would be automatic. We would not agree at that point to 16 split the -- the offset with -- with the attorney. But 17 in the beginning of the lawsuit, when the attorney is 18 undertaking representation of the client, the attorney 19 is able to do precisely what Congress intended, which 20 was to have debtors come to the United States and 21 take -- to avail themselves of the opportunity to repay 22 their debts to avoid an offset. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's a 24 fanciful answer, because EAJA requires that the 25 government's position, to get fees, is substantially
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 unjustified. And so the government lawyer is going to 2 sit down and say, well, you know, if I take a position 3 that is substantially unjustified, I will at that point 4 pay the fees to you, not to the client. 5 MR. YANG: Well, not at all. The 6 government's interest in an installment plan is not 7 motivated by EAJA. The government's interest is -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the 9 attorney's interest -- I thought in the hypothetical we 10 were talking about, the attorney's interest is. He 11 thinks the government is going to take a substantially 12 unjustified position, and he wants to make sure in that 13 case that he gets paid. 14 MR. YANG: This is a separate question, 15 which is whether there is really any deterrent or how 16 large the deterrent effect would be having the specter 17 of a fee offset. And as we explained in our brief, this 18 Court in Underwood explained that, because EAJA awards 19 are not given to every prevailing party and are only 20 given to parties where the government's position is not 21 substantially justified, it is -- one cannot reliably 22 determine in advance whether the government's position 23 is going to be so unreasonable that you're going to get 24 an award of fees. 25 And that -- that suggests that any deterrent
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 effect of having the possibility of an offsetting -- an 2 offset for the client's debt is small. And that -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's going 4 to look awful bad to a court that comes in and he's -5 and the court is asked to award EAJA fees, and there is 6 an agreement already in effect. The government says, 7 well, if we're -- you know, if we're liable for EAJA 8 fees, this is how we are going to handle it. 9 MR. YANG: I may have misspoken -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be the 11 first piece of -- that would be the first piece of 12 evidence that I would want to put in saying I should get 13 EAJA fees. The government thought they might even take 14 a position that qualified. 15 MR. YANG: Let me back up. I may have 16 misspoken. What I intended to convey is that at the 17 beginning of the case when an attorney is deciding 18 whether to represent a client, the case has not been 19 litigated, we don't know whether the government's 20 position is going to be found to be substantially 21 unjustified or not, the attorney -- if the attorney 22 checks and wants to determine whether the client has 23 a -- a debt owed to the government that would be subject 24 to offset, the attorney can go to the government and say: 25 Let's enter into a repayment plan so that my debtor gets
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 on the government's good graces and no longer is subject to 2 have a tax -- a tax return, for instance, offset or any 3 other payment that the government may owe to that 4 debtor in the future, including EAJA. But it's not 5 because of the EAJA payment that you would enter into 6 the agreement. The government -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but say he goes 8 in to the government and says, look, I'm about to sue 9 you, and I'd like to sit down and negotiate a nice 10 agreement about the repayment. 11 MR. YANG: Well, I guess the attorney may 12 say, I'm about to sue you, but the government certainly 13 is not motivated because of the lawsuit. The 14 government -- whether an attorney is going to sue the 15 government or not, the question is -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Government lawyers 17 are always sympathetic to people who come in and say: 18 I'm going to sue you. 19 (Laughter.) 20 MR. YANG: Well, I guess that certainly gets 21 our attention. But the reason that the government would 22 enter into a repayment agreement is because that is an 23 opportunity for the government to collect a debt that is 24 delinquent, valid, and outstanding. 25 And what Congress intended to do in the Debt

1 Collection Improvement Act was not to have additional 2 Federal funds be paid to debtors who have been given 3 multiple warnings of the debt and are essentially, you 4 know -5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem with your 6 argument is this pot of money is actually not going 7 to -- it's going to the debtor, according to your 8 argument, because in theory the debtor is the prevailing 9 party and is entitled to get the award. But the money 10 is not being paid to the debtor. It's for the benefit 11 of the lawyer who has done the work that Congress wanted 12 done. 13 MR. YANG: Well, actually, either -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know what the -15 I don't know what the motivation would be for a lawyer 16 to undertake to represent the meritorious claim when 17 they have to not only do the work in the case, but now 18 have to do the work for the government in getting their 19 client to negotiate an agreement with the government on 20 something that's completely unrelated to the claim. 21 MR. YANG: I guess a -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's -- it's sort of -23 MR. YANG: There's a few answers -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- illogical. 25 MR. YANG: There's a few answers to that.

1 EAJA applies not only in the Social Security context; it 2 applies in all civil actions in which -- not sounding in 3 tort, in which there's not another specific fee 4 provision, brought -- brought by or against the United 5 States. 6 Congress intended -- and this is in the 7 statutory findings which precede EAJA in section -- I 8 believe it's 202 of the Act; it is -- to diminish the 9 financial deterrent on individuals, businesses, and 10 organizations caused by the expense of providing -- of 11 litigating a case. This is -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That sounds like 13 you're -- you have -- the client has an agreement to pay 14 the lawyer or the client has paid the lawyer. It would 15 make sense if the client has paid the lawyer and then 16 there is reimbursement under EAJA that what -- what 17 you're describing would make sense in that situation. 18 But in most of these situations, the client doesn't have 19 the wherewithal to pay the attorney upfront, of course. 20 MR. YANG: That may be true in the Social 21 Security context, but there are many instances in 22 which -- this is the -- this is the normal way that, 23 you know, clients and -- and -- and their -- their 24 attorneys work out fee arrangements. Sometimes clients 25 will pay their attorney in advance; sometimes they will
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 pay as the litigation goes forward. And by the time you 2 have the EAJA award the client will have paid all or 3 part -- sometimes none -- but all or part of the -- of 4 the fee award. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURGH: Is it -6 MR. YANG: Congress directed -- the language 7 is very clear: Courts shall award to the prevailing party 8 fees and expenses -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And does that mean -10 MR. YANG: -- incurred by the party. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The award goes to the 12 prevailing party. So, therefore, the attorney's fee is 13 income to the client -14 MR. YANG: I -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is taxable income 16 to the client? 17 MR. YANG: This is -- the answer to that is 18 complicated and, generally, yes. The IRS is of the view 19 that attorney fee awards to prevailing parties, whether 20 it's EAJA or otherwise, are deemed to be taxable income 21 to the client. 22 Now, the clients, of course, will have an 23 offsetting deduction for expenses incurred by -- in -24 in the course of producing or collecting income, and 25 that was recognized by this Court's opinion in Banks.

1 That deduction is, of course, subject to certain limits. 2 It has to be in excess of 2 percent of the adjusted 3 gross income and subject to the alternative minimum tax, 4 which wouldn't apply to Social Security claims. 5 But the general answer is yes, it is income 6 when the prevailing party receives a fee. There is an 7 offsetting deduction. However, there's a -- some 8 uncertainty with whether some fee awards when the 9 underlying benefit obtained is not taxable, whether 10 that -- the IRS will treat such payments to -- the fee 11 awards, as -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Like pain and suffering, 13 but that's not -14 MR. YANG: Yes, so, but also certain 15 Federal benefits, including Social Security benefits, 16 have a very complicated tax relationship. Social 17 Security benefits are taxable in part. It depends on 18 the size and the amount of other income. 19 So, the answer is actually quite complicated 20 whether fees are taxable under EAJA in the Social 21 Security context. But the general rule is, yes, fee 22 awards to a prevailing party are income and subject 23 to -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then, in turn, income 25 to the attorney when -- if the client --

1 MR. YANG: Correct. Just as, you know, when 2 I'm -- you know, I am paid my salary and taxed on it, 3 and then when I pay for services, the person to whom I 4 pay also has income, and they are taxed as well. This is 5 not an unusual situation. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me the 7 underlying assumption -- and some of the question would 8 have been put to you by the court -- is that the 9 government has somehow benefited because the money is 10 created to offset the debt. It really isn't. It 11 would -- this would be true if an attorney were suing 12 a third party and creating a fund, and the government 13 said, ah, there's the money. In this case, it's just 14 being paid from one account to the other. The 15 government would be better off if there were no suit 16 at all. 17 MR. YANG: That's correct. If the 18 government never had an EAJA award, it at least would 19 be less of a debt that it could collect. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's just paying itself 21 from one account to the other. 22 MR. YANG: That's correct. The government 23 is -- ultimately zeroes out here. The person that gets 24 the benefit is the prevailing party, because the 25 prevailing party has eliminated a debt to the United
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 States by having that offset by the EAJA award. So the 2 prevailing party obtains the benefit, which is precisely 3 what Congress intended here. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The government 5 zeroes out, but in the course of it, it has taken a 6 legal position in court against a small business that 7 was substantially unjustified. 8 MR. YANG: And it has paid its EAJA award by 9 offsetting that award against the debt that the business 10 owed to the United States. The government is -- at the 11 end of the day, the balance sheets of the government 12 have not changed. And with -- from the perspective of -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I think the 14 idea -- well -15 MR. YANG: From the perspective of the 16 prevailing party as well. The prevailing party has an 17 obligation to the attorney. Those are the attorney's 18 fees incurred which have not yet been paid. The 19 prevailing party also has an obligation to the 20 government in the -- in the amount of a debt. It has 21 income that comes in through the -- through the fee 22 award, and whether that goes to offset the debt to the 23 government or offset the -- for use to pay the attorney, 24 the prevailing party ultimately gets the benefit of that 25 fee award. And the government has paid the EAJA award
23 Alderson Reporting Company

1 as required by statute. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you happen to know how 3 much the -- the Treasury typically collects in a year 4 under these EAJA offsets? Does it put a dent in the 5 Federal deficit? 6 MR. YANG: We don't, and the reason we don't 7 is because each agency that -- which is the subject of 8 an EAJA order submits to Treasury a payment request 9 based on that order, and they check "miscellaneous 10 payment." That agency doesn't know whether that payment 11 is offset. Treasury receives that -- that request of 12 payment and sees that it's a miscellaneous payment, 13 checks it against a debt, and may offset. But Treasury 14 doesn't know that the miscellaneous payment was an EAJA 15 award. 16 So we don't have any statistics that we can 17 point to, to say how often this -- this occurs. I can 18 say that the financial management service executes one 19 -- over one billion payments per year, and that offsets 20 of those payments account for $4.8 billion. So about 21 two-tenths of 1 percent of payments from the Federal 22 Government result in offsets. 23 I'd like to reserve the balance of my 24 time. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

1 Mr. Leach. 2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. LEACH 3 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 4 MR. LEACH: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 5 please the Court: 6 I'd like to discuss with you this 7 morning four reasons why Catherine Ratliff, and not the 8 government, is entitled to receive the fee for the legal 9 services she performed, that Congress invited her to 10 perform, to show that the government's position was 11 legally erroneous and was not even substantially 12 justified. 13 And my first point arises from your 14 question, Justice Scalia. You asked whether State law 15 determines who has the priorities here in terms of 16 offset, if I understood. And the answer is that 17 actually Federal law determines that, specifically the 18 Debt Collection Improvement Act and regulations. The 19 Act requires mutuality of a debt between the debtor and 20 the government before the government can offset. And the 21 regulations, which I'll quote in just an instant, 22 require that before offset can occur, the government must 23 look to who has the beneficial interest in the payment. 24 In other words, who is entitled to benefit from it. 25 Specifically, 31 C.F.R. 285.5(b), which is
25 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 quoted at page 45 of the red brief, defines, quote, 2 "offset," close quote, as withholding funds to satisfy 3 a debt owed by a payee. And "payee" -- and this is 4 critical -- is defined as the same -- in the same 5 regulation, also quoted at page 45 of our reply brief, 6 as "the person entitled" -- as the person entitled to 7 the benefit of all or part of a payment. In other 8 words, not the legal title holder if there is a 9 difference, but the person with the beneficial interest. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The prevailing party 11 gets the benefit in the sense that she is relieved of 12 the debt she owed to the government. That's a real 13 benefit. 14 MR. LEACH: Well, Your Honor, I think that's 15 a benefit -- true, that's a benefit, I agree; but that's 16 not a benefit, I don't think, in the sense of who -17 because the question is who has the beneficial interest 18 in the fee payment? And when we look to that question, 19 because that's what's at issue here, is the fee payment. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't this argument 21 circular? The -- the issue is who is -- to whom is this 22 payment to be made. And if it's to be made to the -23 the claimant, then it's not for the beneficial interest 24 of the -- of the attorney. 25 MR. LEACH: Two responses, if I could,
26 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Justice Alito: First, the word "payment" gets thrown 2 around a lot in the briefs. It can mean two separate 3 things. It can mean who receives the payment first; in 4 other words, who is the check mailed to; or it can mean 5 who the check is ultimately entitled to -- who is 6 entitled to benefit from it. 7 And the government's -- my second point is 8 the government's reply brief at page 10 to 12 concedes 9 that, but for the government's alleged right to offset, 10 the attorney does indeed have the beneficial interest in 11 the attorney's fee. And the government gives three 12 reasons, and only three reasons, why its alleged right 13 to offset trumps the attorney's beneficial interest. 14 The first reason the government gives is the 15 government says that the -- the constructive trust, which 16 the government acknowledges exists in the -- in -- in 17 favor of the attorney with respect to the fee payment, 18 does not arise until the instant the fee reaches the 19 client. And that's true, but that's not the point. 20 The point is the attorney had the 21 beneficial interest in the fee, which had to precede the 22 moment the fee reached the client, if it's payable to 23 the client in the sense of "sent to." The beneficial 24 interest had to precede that in order for a constructive 25 trust to arise.

1 The government's second argument -2 JUSTICE BREYER: On the first one, imagine 3 that the -- a trust owes some money to the government. 4 Now, suppose a lawyer representing the trust recovers. 5 Now, they recover on a separate debt, okay? Separate 6 debt? One. That money goes to the trust. Right? 7 MR. LEACH: If -- I'm not -8 JUSTICE BREYER: The trust first owes -- the 9 trust owes $1,000 to the government. The trust then 10 independently recovers $500 from the government on a 11 different matter. 12 MR. LEACH: Yes. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: The government couldn't 14 offset that? 15 MR. LEACH: Of course it could. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Of course it could. 17 MR. LEACH: Yes. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: But the trust is not a 19 person entitled to the benefit of the payment. 20 MR. LEACH: Well -21 JUSTICE BREYER: The beneficiaries of the 22 trust are entitled to the benefit of the payment. 23 MR. LEACH: If I understood your 24 hypothetical, if the trust is entitled to $500, then the 25 trust I think would be entitled to the benefit of the
28 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 payment. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not entitled to the 3 benefit of the $500. The trust holds money for the 4 benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust. So -5 MR. LEACH: I -6 JUSTICE BREYER: -- it can't -- you agree 7 that that couldn't be? 8 MR. LEACH: Well -9 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and once you agree 10 that that couldn't be, I think you are in trouble on 11 your first argument. I'm not sure. 12 MR. LEACH: Okay. I don't think so, because 13 if we are talking about payments to persons, you know, 14 if a person -- if a person owes a debt of $10,000, 15 receives $500 on the debt, the person receives the 16 benefit of that $500. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -18 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, similarly, the -- the 19 guy -- the client here receives the benefit of the money 20 that he has just gotten from the government, including 21 the attorney's fees. It happens that he can't keep 22 those attorney's fees, just as the trust can't keep the 23 $500. He has to give the attorney's fees to the lawyer, 24 just as the trust eventually has to give the $500 to the 25 beneficiary. So I'm simply saying -- drawing a
29 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 parallel, which -- go on to the next issue. 2 MR. LEACH: All right, Your Honor. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me -- can 4 trusts -- can trusts recover EAJA fees? 5 MR. LEACH: I don't know, Your Honor. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I don't either. 7 I'm looking at the definition. It doesn't say "trust." 8 It says a lot of other things, like corporation, 9 association, unit of government. I just don't -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm having trouble with 11 this aspect, and it may -- may be that it varies from 12 State to State. But as a general matter, under State 13 law, let's say that the employee makes a contingency fee 14 arrangement with a lawyer to sue the employer and wins 15 $50,000. It's a one-third contingent fee. The -- the 16 employee already owes the employer $40,000. It would 17 seem to me under the general principle of offset that 18 the employer has to only pay $10,000, and the attorney 19 is not going to get his full fee. 20 MR. LEACH: That's -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's just -- that's 22 just the law of offsets. 23 MR. LEACH: That's true. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because again, it's the 25 same party. If they created money by suing some third
30 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 person, then that's different. 2 MR. LEACH: I think that's true. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and so I -- it 4 seems to me that what you're -- what you're asking for 5 is just contrary to the standard law of offsets. 6 MR. LEACH: Well, Your Honor, with what I -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's even worse 8 because the Federal statute says that there shall be 9 this offset first as a matter of priority. 10 MR. LEACH: Actually, Your Honor, the 11 Federal statute provides for offset in accordance with 12 regulations to be issued by the Treasury Department. 13 And those Treasury Department regulations were what I 14 quoted right at the beginning of my argument. We have 15 to look at who is entitled to the benefit of the 16 payment, not the benefit in a generalized sense of the 17 lawsuit. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in the generalized 19 sense of -- of common law of offsets, as I've described 20 to it, sure, the attorney has a beneficial interest, but 21 he's not going to be able to collect it vis-à-vis the 22 employer who is entitled to an offset. 23 MR. LEACH: Yes. And the difference, Your 24 Honor, is that in your hypothetical we're talking about 25 one sum of money that's recovered in the name of the
31 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 claimant. In this situation, we're talking about a 2 statutory fee award, which is created only based on the 3 work of the attorney and which is labeled an attorney's 4 fee and separate from the benefit -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how is it different? 6 Look. This, what I was talking about, has nothing to do 7 With EAJA. 8 MR. LEACH: Yes. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: It has to do with when the 10 government's allowed to offset some money. 11 MR. LEACH: Yes. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's allowed to offset 13 some money when the money is money that it would otherwise 14 give to a payee. All right? 15 MR. LEACH: Yes. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: And then you've defined 17 "payee" as a person who has some beneficial interest in 18 that money. 19 MR. LEACH: Yes. Yes. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: And I think that the client 21 here has no more and no less beneficial interest whether 22 he's a person or whether he's a trust. That was my 23 point. 24 MR. LEACH: I understand, Your Honor. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
32 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. LEACH: And my point about the statute 2 is simply that the statute is subject to the regulation 3 which looks to who's entitled to benefit. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, let's take the 5 regulation: "A person who is entitled to the benefit of 6 all or part of the payment." Ultimately, isn't it the 7 plaintiff who has recovered that is entitled to the 8 benefit, because this money is given to him in order 9 that he can meet a financial obligation that he owes to 10 the lawyer? 11 I mean, if this didn't exist, he'd owe the 12 lawyer and have to pony it up out of his own pocket, no? 13 MR. LEACH: Not so, Your Honor, in Social 14 Security cases, which this is, and in Veterans cases, 15 which together account for more than 90 percent of all 16 EAJA awards. In Social Security cases, 42 U.S.C. 17 406(b)(2), set out in our appendix, makes it a Federal 18 crime for any lawyer to charge, receive, demand, or 19 collect a fee payment directly from a client, other than 20 under past -- the 46 U.S.C. 406 past-due benefits, 25 21 percent, or EAJA. 22 And this is a critical difference. In the 23 non-EAJA, in the non-Social Security, non-Veterans 24 contexts, you know, about 10 percent of cases, you've got 25 -- conceivably, you've got, often, clients paying lawyers
33 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 on a traditional pay-as-you-go basis. But in a Social 2 Security case or a Veterans case -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: And in those cases, you 4 agree the offset can be made? 5 MR. LEACH: Absolutely. Absolutely. 6 The difference here in all these Social 7 Security and Veterans cases is that the attorney is 8 barred by law from receiving money on a 9 pay-as-you-go basis. So the attorney has never been 10 paid. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In exchange for getting 12 25 percent of the recovery? 13 MR. LEACH: No. Actually, Your Honor, in 14 exchange for showing in Federal court, if I understand 15 your question. I hope I do. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: My understanding is that 17 the ordinary payment to the lawyer for Social Security 18 benefits gained for the client is 25 percent of the 19 recovery to the client paid directly to the lawyer. 20 MR. LEACH: That's true. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that, just as a 22 background in this case, did Ms. Ratliff get that 23 25 percent? 24 MR. LEACH: No, Your Honor. There was no 25 25 percent fee here.
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was because it 2 was too small to be bothered with? What was the reason? 3 MR. LEACH: She did not apply for a 4 25 percent fee. It would have been quite small, had she 5 received it. It would have been much smaller than the 6 EAJA fee. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And she could keep only 8 one from the -9 MR. LEACH: Yes. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: She could keep only the 11 larger of the two. 12 MR. LEACH: Had she received the EAJA fee, 13 she could have kept it. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the difficulties 15 with your position is that Congress did exempt a number 16 of Federal payments from the offset, but it didn't 17 exempt Equal Access to Justice fees. 18 MR. LEACH: Yes. And the -- there are two 19 points there, Your Honor. I mean, EAJA fees -- I'm not 20 claiming all EAJA fees are exempt. As I just said -21 spoke with you, Justice Scalia, if the -- in a non-Social 22 Security, non-Veterans case where the client has paid 23 the attorney and then an EAJA fee comes down, that's 24 clearly subject to offset. You have to look to that 25 regulation and who is entitled to the benefit of the fee
35 Alderson Reporting Company

1 payment. 2 And the reason that the Debt Collection 3 Improvement Act doesn't address this in 1996 is that in 4 1996, the government had never taken the position that 5 attorney fees were subject to offset in Social Security 6 or Veterans cases. And in fact, in 1996, there were 7 three court of appeals decisions on the question of 8 whether a creditor could offset a statutory fee award: 9 Plant -- these are all of our briefs -- Plant, Fourth 10 Circuit, 1979; Duncan -- I'm sorry, Plant is Fifth 11 Circuit, 1979; Duncan, Fourth Circuit, 1989; Curtis, 12 Eighth Circuit, 1993. 13 All those cases said that the creditor may 14 not offset a statutory fee award against the creditor's 15 debt because the fee is for the attorney. That's why 16 Congress couldn't have conceivably thought to address it 17 in 1996. 18 And some of the questions take me toward the 19 point that you asked about before, Justice Roberts -20 Chief Justice Roberts. And you suggested, or you said, 21 that EAJA says: Pay to the prevailing party. If I heard 22 you correctly. In fact, Your Honor, the language of the 23 statute is, quote, "award to the prevailing party... 24 fees and other expenses...incurred by that party." 25 And the two parts that we haven't really
36 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 addressed yet are that what is awarded is attorney's 2 fees. And this "incurred by" language -- with respect to 3 that attorney's fee language, "attorney's fees" has a 4 traditional meaning. It's a meaning this Court has 5 recognized in all those cases bullet-pointed at pages 19 6 to 21 of our briefs. It's a fee earned by and paid to 7 an attorney. And in Gisbrecht v. Barnhart in 2002, this 8 Court specifically described the real parties in 9 interest in attorney's fees litigation as the attorneys, 10 recognizing the reality that attorney fees go to 11 attorneys. 12 In addition, the language "incurred by that 13 party" -- what does it mean here? Well, outside of EAJA, 14 it could mean -- it does mean, I think -- money the 15 client takes out and pays to the attorney. We know in 16 Social Security cases and Veterans cases it can't mean 17 that, because that's illegal. That's a Federal crime if 18 the attorney does it. 19 So what does it mean? Well, the government 20 concedes at page 8 of its reply brief that that language 21 "incurred by" a prevailing party is supported by the 22 client's implied or express obligation to pay the 23 attorney the fee received. So this is where the 24 government's argument is circular, I think, 25 Justice Alito, in the sense that that "incurred by"
37 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 language only is satisfied and an EAJA award only may be 2 made where the client has the express or implied 3 obligation to pay the attorney. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say that in 5 Social Security the attorney is forbidden to accept 6 pay-as-you-go? Is -7 MR. LEACH: Yes, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that doesn't mean that 9 there is not either an express or an implied contract 10 between the attorney and the Social Security recipient. 11 MR. LEACH: I agree. That's what I was 12 trying to say. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but if there is that 14 implied contract, then it is an obligation of the 15 recipient. 16 MR. LEACH: Yes, that's what I was trying to 17 say, Your Honor. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't see how that 19 leads you where you want to go. Then the payment given 20 to the recipient does indeed benefit the recipient by -21 by paying off an obligation that the Social Security 22 recipient has. 23 MR. LEACH: Yes, but that obligation exists 24 only to the extent of the EAJA fee. It's not a separate 25 obligation. The attorney can't turn around and go
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 against the client. I mean, 406(b)(2) prohibits the 2 attorney going against the client for any fee other than 3 the 406(b) fee, which is separate, if there is a 406(b) 4 fee, or the EAJA fee. And when -5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it -6 MR. LEACH: We have been talking 7 -- I'm sorry. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so I'm clarifying, 9 is it your position -- and this is something I want to 10 ask the government as well -- that once the EAJA fee is 11 awarded, the attorney couldn't sue the client later even 12 in an offset situation for repayment, because by statute 13 you view them as blocked from -14 MR. LEACH: Yes. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- from seeking anything 16 other than the EAJA fee or the 406 fee? 17 MR. LEACH: Yes, that's what 406(b)(2) says, 18 Your Honor. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that once the offset 20 happens, the attorney, under -- even if the client had 21 other money, the attorney would be blocked from going 22 after it? 23 MR. LEACH: Yes, Your Honor. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because by the terms of 25 the statute they can only seek the EAJA fee?
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. LEACH: They can only seek what? 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Either the EAJA fee or 3 the 406 fee. 4 MR. LEACH: Yes, and we have been talking as 5 if EAJA fees and 406(b) fees are sort of contemporaneous 6 in every case. In fact, the data cited at page 14 of the 7 red brief is that 46 percent of Federal court Social 8 Security cases result in a remand. Only 5 percent result 9 in an award of benefits. So there are going to be far more 10 EAJA fees in Federal court than there ever are 406(b) fees. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you calculate the fee 12 under either the Social Security Act or EAJA, depending 13 on the case? Do you ever calculate it under both so that 14 you get some under each? 15 MR. LEACH: Yes, Your Honor. And that's -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- you calculate 17 it under both so you get some under each? 18 MR. LEACH: No, section 3 says how this 19 works, of the -- of EAJA 1985. It says if there are two 20 fees, the attorney keeps the larger fee -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. 22 MR. LEACH: -- and sends the smaller 23 to the client and vice versa. 24 And that's the situation, for example, 25 where you could have an offset of an EAJA fee in a
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Social Security case. Let's say there is a 406(b) fee 2 that's $6,000. Let's say there is an EAJA fee that is 3 $4,000. Under section 3, that -- the attorney doesn't 4 keep that $4,000. That $4,000 winds up in the client's 5 pocket. The government can offset that. That's -6 that's what integrates all this discussion we've been 7 having about EAJA fees not being exempt. We have to 8 look to the beneficial interest. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In what percent of the 10 Social Security cases where the claimant prevails is 11 there an EAJA fee? 12 MR. LEACH: Forty-six percent. No, that's not 13 right. It's about 42 percent. And I get that from 14 combining two numbers. There are 5,481 EAJA awards per 15 year. That's red brief page 4. And there are about 16 13,000 Social Security civil cases per year. That's 17 green brief page 22. Fifty-four -- 13,000 divided by 18 5,481 is 42 percent. 19 And this bring me to the point the 20 government was making in suggesting that an attorney at 21 the beginning of a case could never know whether or 22 not there -- there is going to be an EAJA fee, because, 23 you know, you can't know at the beginning, they argue, 24 what position the government will take, whether or not 25 the government's position is substantially justified or
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 not. 2 Well -- and the government cites 3 Pierce/Underwood from 1988 from this Court, in which 4 this Court said exactly that -- Pierce v. Underwood. 5 Pierce v. Underwood is outside the Social 6 Security context, outside the Veterans context, so 7 Pierce v. Underwood is in this less than 10 percent 8 category of cases under EAJA which are not Social 9 Security or Veterans. 10 In a Social Security case or a Veterans 11 case, the attorney has the record before proceeding into 12 court, before deciding whether to proceed into court. 13 And the attorney can look at that record, read it, and 14 have a pretty good idea of whether or not the government 15 position might be substantially justified or not. 16 I don't ask you to take my word for any of 17 this. Let me tell you what the data shows. 18 The data, Justice Ginsburg -- this is where 19 the 42 percent of Federal Social Security cases result 20 in an EAJA award. If it's 42 percent, that's quite a 21 high number of cases in which the government's position 22 is found substantially -- not substantially justified as 23 well as legally erroneous. 24 In Veterans cases, it's even worse. The 25 Court of Veterans Appeal Web site -- this the number of
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 cases -- all together -- number of dispositions per year 2 and the number of EAJA awards. And for 2008 and 2009, if 3 you add up the numbers, out of all the Veterans 4 disability cases filed, 70 percent, 7-0, result in an 5 EAJA award. So there's quite a large number of cases 6 in which -- in -- in a Veterans context or Social 7 Security context where the government's position is 8 found not to be -9 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand your 10 earlier point. 11 MR. LEACH: I'm sorry. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Imagine that if Joe Smith 13 is in a lot of financial trouble. 14 MR. LEACH: Yes. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: His house is being 16 foreclosed on -17 MR.

The concept of a repayment 19 agreement being any use to a lawyer who is thinking 20 about taking one of these cases is fanciful for two 21 reasons: Number one, SSI benefits by statute are 22 limited to, quote, "aged, blind, and disabled people who 23 have little or no money." 24 So, I don't know where the disabled or blind 25 or aged person is going to get the money to enter into
46 Alderson Reporting Company

1 any repayment agreement. 2 But the second reason it's fanciful is that 3 the attorney only has 60 days from final agency action 4 to file the case in Federal court. And, so, there is 5 60 days to, you know, meet with the client and try to 6 get an answer out of the government. I've never tried 7 to do this -- I don't know anyone who has -- but I don't 8 think you're going to get much of an answer at 60 days 9 asking the government to do this so the attorney can 10 then recover a fee. 11 Finally, there's -- there's a critical 12 point here that I need to get to, which is that I think 13 Congress has told us exactly what this language means. 14 Here's why. 15 In 1985, Congress enacts EAJA and uses this 16 section 3 language which talks about who gets the fee, 17 large or smaller fee. Okay. In 1992, Congress extends 18 EAJA to Veterans claims. And when it does that, in 38 19 U.S.C. 5904, Congress uses the same language, down to 20 the exact commas in the same place, that it has done in 21 1985. 22 During this entire period -- and here's why 23 that's important -- during that entire period from 1985 24 to 1992, and indeed continuing many years after that, 25 but for purposes here, 1992, the administration is every
47 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 time paying the attorney's fee to the attorney under 2 EAJA. And so when Congress in 1992 uses the same 3 language for Veterans EAJA claims that it used for 4 Social Security EAJA claims 7 years earlier, 5 Congress, as a matter of law, is incorporating the 6 settled administrative construction -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the -- I 8 thought the government said they only did that when -9 when the court directed that it be paid to the attorney. 10 MR. LEACH: Mr. Yang was talking about from 11 2006 on. From 1990 -- from 1985 to 2006, every EAJA fee 12 went to the attorney. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because there was no 14 offset in the picture because the government wasn't 15 offsetting. 16 MR. LEACH: Two responses, Your Honor: The 17 offset came into the picture in 1996, but the government 18 says it wasn't practical to 2005. Even if you grant them 19 that point, the agency had to make -- totally apart from 20 offset, the agency had to decide who these fees should 21 be paid to under section 3 -- I mean under EAJA. 22 The government had to say, who does this 23 statute say fees should be paid to? Now, had the 24 government said, well, fees go to the client, says, you 25 know, award to the prevailing party, fees and other
48 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 expenses, we are going to pay attorney's fees to 2 clients, which had never happened. But had the 3 government said that -- that's not what they said. 4 They look at the statute. They look at the 5 fact that the attorney earned the fees, and they say we 6 are going to pay these fees to the attorney. So that's 7 what's going on at the time Congress in 1992 copies its 8 1985 language -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress has provided 10 in some statutes, the Social Security Act itself, 406, 11 that you quoted, for the fee to be paid directly to the 12 attorney. Here it used different language; it said pay 13 the prevailing party. 14 MR. LEACH: Just two points, 15 Justice Ginsburg: Number one, we get back to this 16 question about does payment mean who receives the check 17 or who is entitled to benefit from it? Number two, EAJA 18 doesn't say pay to the party. EAJA doesn't use the 19 phrase "payment"; 406 says payment to the attorney. EAJA 20 doesn't say that, "payment," at all. The only place you 21 find "pay" in EAJA is where it says the government 22 cannot be required to pay a filing fee. 23 There is this, shall award to a prevailing 24 party fees and other expenses, and (d)(2)(A) defines 25 "fees" to include quote, "attorney fees," close quote.

1 I'm finishing my sentence, Your Honor. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. 3 MR. LEACH: Thank you. And -- and so 4 "payment" isn't even in EAJA. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 6 MR. LEACH: Thank you very much, Your Honor. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Yang, you have 8 4 minutes remaining. 9 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG 10 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 11 MR. YANG: I believe I heard counsel concede 12 that EAJA fees outside of the Social Security context 13 are payable to the prevailing party and therefore 14 subject to offset. That's true. EAJA does not draw a 15 distinction between Social Security fees and other types 16 of fees. Section 2412 uses the same language, court 17 shall award to the prevailing party fees and other 18 expenses. I believe that disposes of this case. 19 Second, counsel relies on a definition of 20 "representative payee" in the offset regulations. That's 21 addressed at reply -- our reply, page 2, footnote 1. A 22 representative payee -- as the Federal Register provisions 23 that relate to this make clear, it refers to things like 24 attorneys, it refers to things like parents, where the 25 beneficial interest is not that of the attorney or the
50 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 parent but the client and the child. 2 It would be entirely unworkable if any time 3 that a payee owes some debt that a third party might 4 claim an interest to, that the government would have to 5 find out the payee's finances and obligations in order 6 to execute an offset. It's simply not the way the 7 offset program was designed, and it's not reflected in 8 the regulation. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, is your 10 adversary correct that under 406(b) -11 MR. YANG: (2). 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- (b)(2), that if these 13 attorneys -- if any attorney attempts to collect from 14 a Social Security or Veterans client any fees outside 15 of those granted -16 MR. YANG: No. Section 206(b) of the EAJA, 17 which is reproduced on 4a of our appendix, states that 18 section 206(b)(2), the provision you were talking about, 19 shall not apply with respect to any such award, meaning 20 any award under EAJA, so long as where the attorney 21 receives fees, the smaller fee is returned. So -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you -- do 23 you dispute your friend's statement that 42 percent of 24 the time in Social Security cases the government's 25 position is unjustified, and 70 percent of the time in
51 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Veterans cases? 2 MR. YANG: Well, I think that reflects the 3 stakes often, Your Honor. Oftentimes the government 4 does not contest, for instance, a $2,000 EAJA award 5 and because it's the government, it has to -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So whenever it 7 really makes a difference -8 MR. YANG: No -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- 70 percent of the time 10 the government's position is substantially unjustified? 11 MR. YANG: In cases -- in the VA context, the 12 number is not quite that large, but there's a substantial 13 number of cases at the court of appeals -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What number would 15 you accept? 16 MR. YANG: It was, I believe, in the order of 17 either 50 or maybe slightly more than 50 percent. It 18 might be 60. But the number is substantial that you get 19 a reversal, and in almost all of those cases, EAJA -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's really 21 startling, isn't it? In litigating with veterans, the 22 government more often than not takes a position that is 23 substantially unjustified? 24 MR. YANG: It is an unfortunate number, Your 25 Honor. And it is -- it's accurate.

1 With respect to the question of in the 2 Social Security context, EAJA awards occur not only -3 excuse me, 406(b) awards under the Social Security 4 Administration do not apply in only the 5 percent of the 5 cases that get judgment entered. 406(b) provides that 6 any time a judgment that leads to an award of benefits 7 is made, then 406(b) fees are awarded. 8 So even if in cases that were remanded to 9 the Social Security Administration, as in this case, you 10 could get 406(b) fees. It's just a question of the 11 timing. You have to do so after a remand determines the 12 amount of the fee. So in all cases in which a claimant 13 ends up recovering back benefits -- prevailing and 14 recovering back benefits as a result of a successful court 15 case, that attorney is entitled to payment under 406(b) 16 pursuant to the fee agreement with the client. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would that be in 18 this case? What was the -- the amount? 19 MR. YANG: That is not in the record, but 20 what is in the record -- actually, no, this is not in 21 the record, either. But the court's -- I can tell you that 22 the district court's opinion at the underlying case, 23 pursuant to the government's concession, awarded -24 determined that 2 additional months of benefits would 25 be paid.
