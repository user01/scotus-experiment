3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

4 argument this morning in Case No. 14614, Hughes,

5 Chairman of the Maryland Public Service Commission, v.

6 Talen Energy Marketing and the consolidated case.

7             Mr. Strauss.

8             ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT H. STRAUSS

9          ON BEHALF OF THE NO. 14614 PETITIONERS

10             MR. STRAUSS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11 please the Court:

12             Maryland determined that new generation was

13 needed for local reliability, so it directed its retail

14 utilities to sign 20year contracts with a competitively

15 selected project developer.

16             Maryland's action did not intrude on Federal

17 authority, primarily for two reasons.

18             The first reason is that Maryland's new

19 resource did not distort the wholesale capacity auction.

20 FERC revised its auction bidding rules to require the

21 Maryland resource to bid on the basis of its cost,

22 backing out any State contract revenue.  The developer

23 bid in accordance with the rules and cleared the

24 auction.

25             FERC says that means that the resource is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 economic, needed, competitive, and does not suppress

5

2 prices, any State revenue notwithstanding.

3             The second reason is 

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if it doesn't

5 suppress prices, why did Maryland do it?

6             MR. STRAUSS:  Maryland did it, Your Honor,

7 because they saw a need for generation going forward.

8 As is clear in the generation order, Maryland perceived

9 a problem.  It had large coal units that it believed

10 were going to retire in the coming years, and it needed

11 to have resources in place to be able to meet that need.

12 So it undertook to have those resources built pursuant

13 to the contract mechanism before you.

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if that hadn't

15 happened, prices would have been higher.  So it was to

16 suppress prices.

17             MR. STRAUSS:  No, it was not to suppress

18 prices, and, frankly, Your Honor, could not have

19 suppressed prices.

20             FERC revised the rules in 2011 to be clear

21 that the resource had to bid on the basis of its costs

22 without regard to the State revenue.  So there was no

23 way for it to suppress prices.  If the costs had been

24 too high for the resource, it would never have cleared.

25 It wouldn't have been in the market at all.  It was only

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 in the market because it was able to clear on the basis 2 of its cost, which showed it was efficient. 3             And FERC made that finding.  FERC found it 4 needed, competitive, and not suppressive of prices 5 notwithstanding the subsidy. 6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why was this done 7 through stepping on FERC's turf at all?  I mean, could 8 it have been done by requiring longterm contracts with 9 the new generator? 10             MR. STRAUSS:  It was done through longterm 11 contracts, Your Honor, but the question of getting 12 involved with FERC's turf is as follows: 13             FERC has  has set up the capacity auction 14 in PJM, and when under that auction, PJM procures three 15 years in advance for a oneyear period all the capacity 16 the region needs, and then it allocates the cost of that 17 capacity among all the utilities.  But it tells the 18 utilities that you have a way to hedge against those 19 costs.  If you have longterm resources, resources that 20 you bought or procured through contract, you can bid 21 them in, and if they clear, they will offset the cost. 22             Maryland's concern was this:  It wanted and 23 needed the resource, but it was concerned that the 24 resource clear so that it hedge against the cost and 25 customers not pay twice for the same resource.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
7 1             So in order to do that, it entered into the 2 contract for differences.  And the way it did that was 3 it did a competitive procurement and found a developer 4 who was willing to undertake the risk of nonclearance. 5             And that was the issue.  The contract for 6 differences assigns and allocates that risk to the 7 developer, not the State, and that enabled the resource 8 to go forward in a way that would not result in any 9 possibility of a double charge. 10             The contract developer  the developer 11 receives the contract price.  The utilities paid the 12 contract price and no more than that, received the 13 market price.  That is exactly the way this would have 14 worked if we had simply done it as a bilateral, with one 15 key difference.  The difference is that the risk of 16 nonclearance is with the developer, not the  17             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there's another key 18 difference.  If you had done it directly with  if CPV 19 had contracted directly with the distribution utilities, 20 that would have been subject to regulation by FERC, 21 would it not? 22             MR. STRAUSS:  Yes.  This contract was as 23 well. 24             JUSTICE ALITO:  Only after you lost in the 25 Fourth Circuit did you concede that, isn't that correct,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 on the very day of the Fourth Circuit's decision?

8

2             MR. STRAUSS:  No, Your Honor.

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  No.

4             MR. STRAUSS:  In the district  let me

5 explain why.  In the district court, during the district

6 court litigation, CPV obtained marketbased rate

7 authority from the FERC and filed a motion with the

8 court telling the court that the case should be

9 dismissed because the contract was being entered into

10 pursuant to that authority.  And that made it a FERC

11 contract that could be reviewed at FERC.  So any party

12 could have filed the complaint.

13             JUSTICE ALITO:  But your initial position

14 was that it did not have to be reviewed by FERC; wasn't

15 that  isn't that right?

16             MR. STRAUSS:  That's  that's correct.  The

17 position below was that it was either of two things,

18 Your Honor.  Either it was a nonjurisdictional

19 financing arrangement or it was a FERCjurisdictional

20 contract.  But either way it was not preempted, and that

21 was the question.  It was either subject to FERC's

22 jurisdiction or outside it.  But the question of whether

23 it was preempted would not have been  the answer would

24 have been the same regardless.  The district court

25 decided that it would deal with that motion in its

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
9 1 order, and decided in its opinion that while it probably 2 was a FERCjurisdictional contract, the judge went ahead 3 and found what Maryland had done unconstitutional. 4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not sure why it is that 5 when you say it was subject to FERC's jurisdiction, that 6 doesn't end the case right there against you, because if 7 it's subject to FERC's jurisdiction, that means it's a 8 wholesale sale.  And that's for FERC to do is to set the 9 rates and other terms of wholesale sales, and that's not 10 for the States to do.  So that means you're preempted. 11             MR. STRAUSS:  No, that's  no, no.  No, it 12 does not.  You're exactly right, Your Honor.  Wholesale 13 sale is for FERC to review. 14             But the way the statute works, sellers under 15 the statute are permitted to set rates as an initial 16 matter by contract or tariff.  FERC superintends that 17 process, as this Court decided in the NRG case a number 18 of years ago.  In this case, the developer, the seller 19 set the rate through a contract entered into with the 20 State utility.  That contract would be subjected to FERC 21 review.  That's just another day on  22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are you saying that Maryland 23 didn't set the rates just because they use an auction? 24 Is that what you're saying? 25             MR. STRAUSS:  Maryland did not set the rate
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 because Maryland did not select the price.  The price 2 was selected by the seller. 3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's true of FERC itself. 4 FERC doesn't set rates anymore, either.  It allows an 5 auction to set rates, but we would never say that that 6 doesn't mean that they are FERC rates, that they are 7 FERCapproved rates.  And so here, the fact that 8 Maryland decided not to set rates directly but to allow 9 an auction to do it, I mean, that's just a mechanism 10 that Maryland chose.  They are still Maryland's rates. 11             MR. STRAUSS:  The  the auction  the 12 auction that FERC designed, the wholesale auction, 13 permits, if not incentivizes, exactly what was done 14 here.  FERC has made that very clear.  The purpose of 15 the auction is to  in part, to provide information to 16 the market about what kinds of longterm contracting 17 is  are needed, what is needed. 18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you used the auction 19 dynamic, the auction mechanism to go outside of the  20 of that dynamic. 21             MR. STRAUSS:  What we did was perfect  22 yes, Your Honor, but that's perfectly permissible. 23 Remember, the  24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That  that's  I  25             MR. STRAUSS:  Let me explain.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm  I'm sure that

11

2 that's one of the issues in the case.

3             MR. STRAUSS:  Yes, Your Honor.  The auction

4 dynamic allows for parties, and indeed encourages

5 parties, to enter into longterm contracts for capacity

6 resources and bid them into the auction.  But they can't

7 clear the auction.  They don't become auction resources

8 unless they are able to do so.  And in this case, FERC

9 had in front of it exactly what Maryland and a related

10 program in New Jersey were about at the time they

11 revised the rules.

12             What FERC sought to do was to reconcile the

13 issue of the State programs and how they would interact

14 with the auction, and FERC did that.  It set a different

15 bidding process, and Maryland followed that bidding

16 process.  The CPV resource bid in accordance with it and

17 cleared on that basis.

18             JUSTICE ALITO:  But the  as originally set

19 up, CPV had no incentive to  to bid anything other

20 than zero; isn't that right?  All it was interested in

21 was clearing the market.

22             MR. STRAUSS:  That is  that is correct.

23             JUSTICE ALITO:  And that affects the dynamic

24 of the  of the PJM auction, does it not?

25             MR. STRAUSS:  Yes.  Yes, Justice Alito, it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 does.  And that's why in 2011, FERC, when it became

12

2 aware that this had happened, changed the rules.

3 Remember, originally, when FERC approved the auction in

4 2006, it said that State resources that were being built

5 for reliability, which is exactly what this resource is,

6 could bid in at zero, a zero price, and clear

7 automatically in order to ensure that States could meet

8 their responsibilities to ensure of a liability.

9             In 2011, when FERC became aware of the

10 Maryland and New Jersey programs, it revised the rules.

11 But it didn't prohibit those resources; it didn't

12 preclude them.  It changed the rules so that they could

13 continue to bid, but they had to bid on a cost basis.

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But  but I have to say

15 that they also looked at a longterm contract  FERC

16 did, and PJM  in the PJM Interconnection order, and it

17 determined that a sevenyear lockin period for a new

18 generator was unfair, unjust and unreasonable.  It's

19 something it can do.

20             Why didn't that end what you're doing?

21 You're arguing that you're not affecting price.  FERC

22 disagrees, because you have no incentive to bid anything

23 other than zero.  I don't understand why this case is

24 not ended by FERC's determination that lockedin

25 contracts are unjust and unreasonable.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1             MR. STRAUSS:  FERC determined that under the 2 auction it would not allow a guarantee of more than 3 three years.  But FERC did not at that time say that 4 longterm contracts outside the auction were prohibited. 5 Longterm contracts are a staple of this industry, as 6 this Court knows, and FERC was not trying to prohibit 7 them.  What FERC was doing there was, the threeyear 8 lockin, which I think is what you're alluding to, 9 Justice Sotomayor  10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is it different than 11 your contract? 12             MR. STRAUSS:  It's different in that this is 13 a 20year agreement. 14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know the years are 15 different, but I'm talking about the mechanics. 16             MR. STRAUSS:  The mechanics of it are that 17 it operates outside the auction, but bids into the 18 auction.  The  the new entry price adjustment to which 19 you refer functions within the auction and for a very 20 specific purpose.  It's designed to address the 21 situation in which you have a relatively small 22 geographic zone and a relatively large plant that's 23 built.  The concern is that when you build that resource 24 and put it in the market, it creates a glut, and prices 25 will crater.  And the concern was because of that, no
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 one will ever build such a resource.  So the auction

14

2 allows you to lock those prices in for three years, but

3 that's simply in that particular circumstance.

4             What FERC said when asked to make it longer

5 was that's not the purpose of the auction.  The auction

6 is not intended to ensure revenue certainty.  It's

7 intended to provide information, information that the

8 market can use in making contracting decisions.  And

9 that is exactly what happened here.

10             Maryland looked at the  at the auction

11 results, came up with a program to have a resource built

12 outside the auction, which would then bid into the

13 auction, but it had to do it in accordance with FERC

14 rules.  FERC is the gatekeeper of the auction.  Maryland

15 couldn't insert itself into the auction in a way that

16 FERC didn't allow, even if it wanted to.

17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Strauss 

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't  I  I

19 didn't  I have to admit for myself, in this kind of

20 brief, it would have been much, much easier if people

21 had used simplified examples with real numbers.  I have

22 a hard time thinking in terms of simply abstract words.

23 But as far as I understand it, my law clerk says that

24 this costbased system of FERC is that the minimumoffer

25 price has to be set, that is, they have to set a price

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 at 90 percent of the cost of new entry for a combustion 2 turbine generator or a combined cycle generator.  That's 3 as they calculated  PJM, or if it's neither of those 4 two kinds of generators, it's at 70 percent; is that 5 correct? 6             MR. STRAUSS:  I believe that is, Your Honor. 7             JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's correct, then if 8 I have a generator up somewhere in the hills of  of 9 surrounding their hills in Maryland, and it's more 10 expensive to get coal up into those hills or oil or 11 natural gas, and so I have a generator that I can  12 that's 500 megawatts, and it allows me, based on cost, 13 to charge, if I were to charge the full cost, and that 14 depends on the banks and loans and so forth, it allows 15 me to charge $220 a megawattday.  Okay? 16             MR. STRAUSS:  Okay. 17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Does that?  I can go to 18 FERC, and I can say 70 percent of that is what I am 19 going to put into the pool, 'cause I know that Maryland 20 will give me the rest.  And this is not one of those two 21 kinds.  And 70 percent of 220 is around  I don't know, 22 my math isn't too good  180. 23             So they get awarded the contract 'cause it's 24 180, but there's some other firms that are more 25 expensive over here, and those other firms don't get
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 into it at all because we used up all the generating

16

2 capacity that we needed for the next five years with

3 your firm and a few others.  And that changes rather

4 dramatically who supplies the contract, and it also

5 changes the price at which retailers across PJM will pay

6 for the electricity they are getting from the pool.

7             Now, is that right?  That's either right or

8 wrong.

9             MR. STRAUSS:  Well, Your Honor 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  If it's right, it seems

11 like the end of the matter.  If it's wrong, then you

12 explain to me why.

13             MR. STRAUSS:  Here's what's going on, Your

14 Honor.  If the cost of the generator is below the

15 default price, that 90 or 70 percent price that you

16 described, the generator is  that is its offer floor,

17 and the generator is permitted 

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, I'm assuming that the

19 cost is higher than the 70 percent.

20             MR. STRAUSS:  That  that might  that

21 might be a problem, but I have two answers to that, Your

22 Honor.

23             First of all, that was not this case.  In

24 this case, the  the resource bid on the basis of its

25 cost, and its cost base number was below the default

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 price.  So there was no issue of a  of what you've

17

2 described as a resource with a cost above the default

3 price that gets to bid the default.

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  So you're asking only for

5 the case where it's below.  You're not interested in the

6 case where it's above.  And this whole case has been

7 argued only in the case where it's below.

8             MR. STRAUSS:  Well, that is actually what

9 happens, Your Honor.

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not saying what

11 happens.  I'm saying we have to decide a legal issue.

12 Is my legal issue to include my example or is it not?

13             MR. STRAUSS:  I think it does not include

14 your example, Your Honor.  That is a different kind of

15 distortion.  The Solicitor General mentions it in its

16 brief.  And if FERC  FERC, in 2011, when they revised

17 the minimumoffer rule, did not find reason to adjust

18 the offer level higher, which might have limited that 

19 that problem.  If FERC now believes that that distortion

20 exists 

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want to use up all

22 your time.

23             MR. STRAUSS:  I'd like to reserve the

24 balance for rebuttal.  Thank you.

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

2           ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFTON S. ELGARTEN

3          ON BEHALF OF THE NO. 14623 PETITIONER

4             MR. ELGARTEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5 please the Court:

6             Let me respond first to Justice Kagan's

7 comment.  The way the Federal Power Act works is States

8 have the power and the authority, recognized by FERC, on

9 the purchasing end of any contract to direct their local

10 utilities to enter into any contract they want.

11             When they direct a purchaser to do so, that

12 gives rise to a contract that is certainly within FERC's

13 jurisdiction to review.  They review the rates charged

14 on the other side of the contract, the seller side of

15 the contract, and they review the ultimate contract

16 itself.  But the notion that you are setting the rate by

17 engaging in a contract with a seller is completely

18 inconsistent with what has always been  and I can only

19 say always been the rule  and that's how the Federal

20 Power Act is written as set forth in our reply brief.

21             The Federal Power Act supplies jurisdiction

22 on the seller side of those rates.

23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  If I understand what you

24 just said, you're not relying on Mr. Strauss's argument.

25 Mr. Strauss said that this wasn't a  setting a

1 wholesale rate because Maryland did it by auction.

19

2             But you're saying that's irrelevant; that

3 Maryland could have just picked a price, and  and that

4 that would have been fine so long as at some point FERC

5 had the power to review and veto it.  Is that what

6 you're saying?

7             MR. ELGARTEN:  No.  It's  it's a fair

8 point, but no, Maryland could not have picked a price.

9 It could not impose that price on the seller.

10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well 

11             MR. ELGARTEN:  The  the longstanding rule

12 of FERC has been if it's competitively set by the

13 seller, leaving the seller free to respond to the  to

14 the bid of the purchaser, then it is subject to FERC,

15 and that review process is there.  And it is not

16 inconsistent with Mr. Strauss's position.

17             In the specific circumstance of an auction,

18 what we had here 

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I 

20             MR. ELGARTEN:  Yes.

21             JUSTICE KAGAN:   I don't understand that.

22 I mean, just take a hypothetical case where  where

23 Maryland said to all its utilities, this is the price

24 and this is the only price that you will pay for

25 electricity.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. ELGARTEN:  Crosses the line.

20

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are you  are you saying

3 that 

4             MR. ELGARTEN:  I belive that would 

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:   Maryland could do that?

6             MR. ELGARTEN:  I believe  there's a case

7 from  from the Commission, says that would cross the

8 line.  I am imposing a price that all my utilities would

9 sell.  That crosses the line.

10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Then you are saying

11 that everything's dependent on the difference between

12 picking a price and letting an auction pick a price.

13 But I guess I  I'll repeat the question that I made

14 to  to Mr. Strauss.

15             I mean, we know that one of the ways that

16 you pick a price is by letting an auction determine that

17 price.  That's exactly what FERC does.

18             MR. ELGARTEN:  We  we had a competitive

19 bid to bid  build a power plant.  That's what was set

20 up here.  We were talking  in answering your first

21 question, I was answering the conceptual question of

22 what it is FERC regulates.  FERC regulates the seller

23 side of  of every transaction.

24             In the auction context, things get a little

25 more complicated, as you just discussed in the  in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 EPSA case.  This case, however, was a procurement to

21

2 build a power plant.

3             CPV bid to build this power plant.  It

4 looked at the costs it would take to build a power plant

5 in this locale, how much turbines cost, how much it

6 would cost to run the plant and to bid into the market

7 and make it available to the market.  Of course, it then

8 divided the price over the 20 years.  You have 240

9 monthly payments.  That's exactly what we bid.

10             We understood that for Maryland to pay for

11 us to build a power plant and to keep all the profits

12 from our sales in  in the markets, both the energy

13 sales and capacity sales, both were involved  that

14 would be unfair.  They didn't want the ratepayers to

15 both finance our power plant construction, which is what

16 Maryland was after, and keep all the revenues.

17             So the contract reads  and this is on

18 page 17 of the reply brief  the contract reads:  "We

19 turn over all the revenues for 20 years, and we build

20 the power plant."  They pay us to build the power plant.

21 We turn over the revenues.  It is correct enough that

22 the net of that is the difference between the revenues

23 and the price.  But the purchase here was to build the

24 power plant.

25             Now, how did it impact the auction?  How

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 does it impact the auction?  The auction was always set 2 up by FERC on the understanding that States have the 3 inherent power, and I mean the reserve power under the 4 Federal Power Act itself to direct these kinds of 5 longterm contracts, to direct capacity purchases 6 outside because they control the purchasing decisions of 7 their local utilities every single day.  They review 8 them and they control them.  And they understood that 9 States would be using longterm contracts to support new 10 generation. 11             So FERC didn't, just as an act of grace, 12 allow constant sales of capacity outside the auction. 13 They constructed the auction against the existing 14 authority of the States to do exactly what was done 15 here. 16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would it be correct or 17 incorrect to say that under Maryland law, you entered  18 you entered the auction, and as a result, you altered 19 the consequences of that auction in a way that was 20 inconsistent with FERC's policy.  Is that a fair or an 21 unfair statement? 22             MR. ELGARTEN:  No, it is not fair, because 23 FERC's policy, it was expressed.  They said when States 24 do exactly what was done here, before they even set up 25 the auction  and then in  in fact they said, if
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1 States do what we do here, we have a mechanism in our 2 auction not to correct it, to adjust the auction so the 3 auction still functions.  And that was the point 4 Mr. Strauss was making. 5             The minimumoffer price rule, which has two 6 formats, is acceptable to FERC because FERC says if you 7 comply with that rule, it does not artificially suppress 8 prices.  That was FERC's judgment, whether it was a 9 70 percent or 80 percent situation of how you bid. 10             FERC has determined that is competitive, 11 economic  these are quotes  does not  does not 12 artificially suppress prices because FERC wants those 13 bids in.  You're a competitive resource. 14             In our case, however, we didn't even use 15 that default price.  We used a pure costbased price. 16 So the concern the government expresses that there's a 17 possibility of an exception which they say they haven't 18 corrected  I think FERC did it on purpose and said it 19 doesn't suppress prices  the possibility of that 20 exception is eliminated.  We were  we, in our case, 21 because we bid a pure costbased bid. 22             And when you bid a pure costbased bid, does 23 it affect the market?  Of course.  The addition of 24 supply affects the market.  FERC doesn't think that's a 25 bad thing.  FERC thinks that's a wonderful thing.

1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  That's another

24

2 problem I have here.  I  don't spend more than a

3 minute on this, but I don't understand the procedural

4 posture of this case.  That is, it seemed to me it

5 started out by saying that there was a  a Supremacy

6 Clause private right of action or something, which I

7 think there isn't, in my opinion.

8             MR. ELGARTEN:  Uhhuh.

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  And then  and then it

10 seemed to go we don't have FERC's opinion.  We only have

11 it through the SG.  I thought there was a doctrine

12 called primary jurisdiction where if the agency

13 really  their views is really relevant on that, you

14 got their views directly, what happened to all that?

15             MR. ELGARTEN:  We want to be in front of 

16 of the Commission.  We believe the Commission should

17 decide these issues.  We think the Commission would

18 decide these issues favorably to us because they have

19 done so in connection with this very case.  When the

9             JUSTICE ALITO:  You're arguing as if they're

10 not even here.

11             MR. ELGARTEN:  If you  if you read the

12 FERC's decisions that we've cited, the 135 and 137

13 FERC  that's how it's numbered in the briefs  if you

14 read that and you read the quotes that are included in

15 the Joint Appendix, you will see that FERC has

16 determined that these bids are competitive if they are

17 submitted in this way.  Why 

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you're saying that

19 FERC  FERC doesn't understand its own order?

20             MR. ELGARTEN:  I'm saying FERC's  as

21 happened in the Morgan Stanley case, there is a little

22 bit of changing of  of tunes that's at issue here.  If

23 this issue was presented to the Commission  which is

24 exactly who should decide these issues of energy policy,

25 not this Court, whether something artificially

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1 suppresses.  These kinds of issues of energy policy and 2 how the auctions should work should be decided by FERC. 3             Under this Court's case, Northwest Central, 4 it says if the issue between the State's authority and 5 the Federal authority can be reconciled  and they were 6 reconciled with these specific contracts in front of us. 7 FERC modified the rules to allow exactly this bid and 8 determined that it did not artificially suppress prices. 9             Does it affect prices?  Of course.  New 10 supply affects prices. 11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  How would 12 this  13             MR. ELGARTEN:  Does it artificially do that? 14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How would this work 15 normally?  Meaning forget that a lawsuit was started. 16 You enter into this contract.  Do you have to submit the 17 contract to FERC? 18             MR. ELGARTEN:  No.  Because we have what's 19 called marketbased rate authority.  It's been discussed 20 in your cases.  So we notify them. 21             Anyone can protest to FERC, yes.  Anyone  22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can somebody protest 23 here? 24             MR. ELGARTEN:  They didn't.  They  well, 25 they  we thought they did.  They raised an objection.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 They said this is adversely affecting the auction.  FERC 2 resolved their objection. 3             FERC had in front of it the very complaints 4 we have here.  The complaints about  excuse me  the 5 RFPs and the solicitations from New Jersey and Maryland, 6 and they presented this to FERC. 7             FERC said, ah, we take care of this in our 8 auction  we've always known how  with the 9 minimumoffer price rule.  They said the minimumoffer 10 price rule, when it is applied, will result in not 11 artificially suppressing prices. 12             That is how this was presented to FERC. 13 With these specific contracts, they are in  they are 14 in Volume III of the Fourth  Fourth Circuit appendix. 15 These specific contracts. 16             Now, if they want to protest it again and 17 say these have rates, or the rates that affect the 18 jurisdiction, they are free to protest it yet again. 19 And I am  I believe FERC would come up with the same 20 conclusion again and say this is perfectly appropriate 21 to bid into the auction in this way. 22             Now, if somebody wants to petition, let's 23 close this what they are calling the "loophole," the one 24 that Justice Breyer suggested, because it doesn't 25 require a bid at exactly a costbased price.  They can
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1 go to FERC and close that loophole.  It wouldn't have 2 affected our case at all because we bid a costbased, 3 but they can go to FERC on every one. 4             All of the conflict preemption issues should 5 be addressed to FERC.  They are not really for this 6 Court, which is obviously having some trouble 7 conceptualizing how this all works, to resolve.  Those 8 conflict preemption on the Northwest Central issues go 9 to FERC. 10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You wouldn't  11             MR. ELGARTEN:  They should not  12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   get to conflict 13 preemption if field preemption applies. 14             MR. ELGARTEN:  That's absolutely correct. 15 And so on the issue of field preemption, have we 16 exercised an authority that belongs to FERC?  No.  By 17 setting  by directing a contract or competitively 18 soliciting, we are not setting the rate.  If we did, the 19 hypothetical from Justice Alito, we  if we said 20 everybody in the State must pay that rate, FERC has 21 dealt with that issue.  That crosses the line. 22 Competitive solicitations do not. 23             When  the purpose  24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is your explanation 25 for why FERC is on the other side now, when you're

29

2             MR. ELGARTEN:  FERC  FERC, as the

3 Commission through its rulings and orders based on

4 evidence and appeal, as reflected in the New Jersey

5 appeal, the NJBPU, appeal of that order, they were on

6 our side.  When they were asked to join this case, the

7 Third Circuit said get in; they had two weeks.  I think

8 they took an illadvised position, but it's certainly

9 not a position that was done on the record subject to an

10 order.

11             And that's what's decisive here.  If the

14             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

15              ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16             MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

17 please the Court:

18             Maryland's effort to dictate what CPV

19 receives in connection with its wholesale sales to the

20 wholesale market operator is plainly preempted.

21             Maryland's targeting of the Federal market

22 was direct in this case.  CPV gets nothing unless it

23 bids and clears the PJM auction.  Once it does, it must

24 sell all of its output, all of its energy and capacity

25 to PJM.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1             If those things happen, then CPV receives, 2 thanks to the State of Maryland and its State action, 3 payment streams in conjunction  in connection with 4 those sales to PJM that are different from and far more 5 stable than the prevailing price on the PJM auction. 6 And  7             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  The  the way that 8 they've described it to me  I'll try this once more. 9 Because truer words were never spoke, than I am not 10 quite on top of how this thing works. 11             But the  the  the way he described is, 12 what are they bidding into the PJM is their real cost. 13 And when they are bidding their real cost, Maryland 14 isn't going to pay them a dime.  If they are an 15 inframarginal unit, which I assume they would be, the 16 cost for PJM is going to be higher, not lower.  And 17 there will be extra money.  So what they are going to do 18 is they are going to be paying Maryland. 19             Now, what they said is, we're going to be 20 paying you. 21             Oh, he's shaking his head.  So I haven't got 22 that right, either. 23             (Laughter.) 24             JUSTICE BREYER:  No?  No, I have got it 25 right?  I don't know.  I'm guessing at getting it right.

2             Anyway, I  well, you see my problem 

3             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I 

4             JUSTICE BREYER:   which is understanding

5 this.

6             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I guess I can see your

7 problem, which is, I think, first, there's a factual

8 premise there 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

10             MR. CLEMENT:   which is  I think it's

11 pretty much conceded that, at least in the first couple

12 of years of this, the expectation is that CPV is going

13 to be receiving an additional payment, a forced payment,

14 from the LSC, the loading serving entity, to PJM.  So

15 that's just a factual premise for you.

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  But are they bidding their

17 true cost into PJM?

18             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, they sure didn't start

19 that way.

20             And let me start here.  I mean, they had, as

21 I think Justice Alito alluded to, a completely different

22 incentive in bidding their costs into PJM than would a

23 private generator with new capacity.

24             A private generator with new capacity is

25 going to build its actual  bid in its actual costs

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 because they don't want to clear at the expense of

32

2 having an unprofitable generator.

3             It's a completely different dynamic for

4 somebody like CPV, because the bidding clear requirement

5 for them is just an obstacle to get to the pot of gold

6 at the end of the rainbow, which is all these guaranteed

7 payments for 20 years.  So they have every incentive to

8 understate their cost.

9             That incentive was realized here.  They

10 talked about bidding in their costs.  When they first

11 bid in their costs, they bid in their costs at less than

12 $14 a megawattday.  Okay?

13             Now, when PJM took a look at that, they

14 ended up upping the figure sevenfold to about $96.  So

15 that's a great measure of their incentive to distort

16 their costs for FERC.

17             Now, what they will say is, ah, but

18 Mr. Clement, the $96 bid cleared, and that's all that

19 matters.

20             Well, with all due respect, that's wrong.

21 FERC says it's wrong.  A bid like this can still have a

22 price effect  suppressive effect.  And you can see

23 that in a couple of ways.

24             I want to say one thing, though, is FERC is

25 here on our side in part because they are on its record

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 as saying this MOPR  the minimumoffer price rule.

33

2 The MOPR is not some sort of cureall that is designed

3 to ward off any pricesuppressive bid.  It is a default

4 rule.  It is a coarse screen to deal with the most

5 egregious costreducing bids.  It also depends on an

6 estimate of cost.  And here's why it doesn't really work

7 for a bid like this.

8             One of the most important costs is your cost

9 of capital.  Well, what was CPV's cost of capital

10 without this program?  They told you.  They told

11 Maryland, without the 20year guarantee, we can't get

12 any financing for this project.  We can't do it.

13             At the bench trial, they told the district

14 court, our ability to bid this project depends entirely

15 on the 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's another way of

17 saying that the bid that  that  that FERC says that

18 they have to make is not their actual costs 

19             MR. CLEMENT:  What 

20             JUSTICE BREYER:   because if in fact it's

21 based on a cost of capital that is lower than what the

22 cost of capital really is, that is a misstatement of

23 their cost or a  an  a lowerthanactual cost, just

24 as much as if the steel were in fact less expensive than

25 what they actually have to pay.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1             MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely.  And of course, 2 another component of cost is going to be future fuel 3 costs.  And anybody who's been to the pump lately knows 4 that we can all have a lot of variance as to what we 5 think are going to be future fuel costs, but if I could 6 return to the capital cost and just finish this point, 7 it's even worse that it's misstated, because ultimately, 8 because they are getting a 20year guarantee and no one 9 else is, everybody else is calculating their cost of a 10 new generation financing based on the threeyear price 11 signal that the  that the  that the capacity market 12 is settling, it destroys the ability to do an 13 applestoapples comparison.  And then the one thing we 14 know for certain here is that this project ended up 15 displacing a project that actually could be built based 16 on the threeyear forward price and without a 20year 17 contract. 18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you'd have  19 you'd have no objection if Maryland just decided to 20 subsidize the construction of the plant, would you? 21             MR. CLEMENT:  We would, Your Honor.  I think 22 it might be a harder case, but particularly if the 23 subsidy was conditioned on a bidandclear requirement, 24 I would be here making a preemption argument.  You might 25 not think it's as good of a preemption argument, and I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
35 1 think that the only difference is because the statutory 2 text of the Federal Power Act, it seems to me to make 3 our position clearly correct, is the provision that says 4 that FERC has the authority to dictate what a seller 5 receives in connection with a wholesale sale. 6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How do you define the 7 field that's preempted? 8             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think the field that 9 is preempted is the ability of a government actor to set 10 wholesale rates for wholesale sales.  And so if you have 11 State action that sets rates for wholesale sales  and 12 "rates" in this context is defined by the statute as 13 including what a seller receives for wholesale sales  14 we think that's preempted. 15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are they  are they 16 setting rates by having ended the auction? 17             MR. CLEMENT:  We certainly think so, and 18 more importantly, I think, for purposes of this case, so 19 did the district court.  I mean, it's kind of odd for me 20 to hear my friends on the other side, as I heard them in 21 the colloquy with Justice Kagan, they essentially 22 conceded they lose if Maryland sets the rates, and that 23 would be an odd concession in any case, but particularly 24 where at footnote 48 at the district court's opinion, 25 the district court finds  as a matter of fact, I'll
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 concede it's a mixed question of fact and law and all, 2 but still there it is.  The district court  3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In a sense, I guess all of 4 the bidders in the conventional auction in effect set 5 their rates by their bid. 6             MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  And I think what 7 Justice Kagan alluded to is if Maryland  8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So why is this  why is 9 this different? 10             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, it's  it's not, 11 because I  I think the point is, if Maryland is not 12 setting the rates here, than FERC's not setting any 13 wholesale rates, and that's not right.  And so just 14 because you use an auction mechanism to set the rate, 15 that doesn't mean that it's not the State setting the 16 rate.  And if you look at footnote 48, it's  it goes 17 beyond that because, based on particular findings, based 18 on the testimony of the chairman of the Maryland PSC, 19 the district court said that actually because there was 20 back and forth between Maryland and CPV, this was 21 Maryland setting the rate. 22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is Maryland 23 setting the rates when it subsidizes the construction of 24 a power plant? 25             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, if  Mr. Chief Justice,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 suppose they decided to  I mean, potentially they

37

2 could.  Not all subsidies are created equal.  If they

3 had a subsidy that was measured, a dollarfordollar

4 subsidy based on sales to PJM, I would think that would

5 actually be setting the rate.  Again, you might disagree

6 with me, but I would say that in that case, you would

7 have a very similar situation.  I think this case is

8 that much clearer because these payments from the LSC is

9 directly conditioned on selling to PJM.

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Clement, can you

11 tell me how I write this opinion?  And I'll ask you why.

12             MR. CLEMENT:  Okay.

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As I look at the

14 relevant statutory provisions, what it says is that FERC

15 has the power to ensure that rates that are set are

16 fair, are just and reasonable.  So it doesn't say it

17 gets to set the rates.  It says it can do rules and

18 regulation that control how the rates are set so that

19 I'm not sure how this is field preemption.  At best, I

20 think it might be conflict preemption.  And so if I

21 think it's conflict preemption, that something about

22 Maryland's plan conflicts with the system that FERC has

23 set in place, how do I articulate the rule in this case?

24 What is it that conflicts with FERC's rules and

25 regulations with respect to setting  participating in

1 the market  in the auction?

38

2             MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because as I understand

4 it, and I don't think you  you've told me any

5 differently, that the people who are auctioning in the

6 market can and do enter into contracts with States on a

7 regular basis.

8             MR. CLEMENT:  Oh, not with contracts with

9 the States.  That's not what my friends on the other

10 side were saying.  They enter into voluntary bilateral

11 contracts off of the market.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.

13             MR. CLEMENT:  And that is not what's

14 happened here.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Voluntary

16 contracts outside the market.

17             MR. CLEMENT:  Right.

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why is this involuntary?

19 Because of the State 

20             MR. CLEMENT:  Because the State told the

21 loadserving entities that they had to make these

22 payments to CPV.

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So is that

24 what conflicts?  I'm  I'm trying to articulate the

25 preemption rule in some simplified way.  I'm a little

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 bit like Justice Breyer on this.  I'm not quite sure how 2 everything is working, but I don't think it can be field 3 preemption, because you have to explain what field we're 4 talking about and what rule we're setting in the future. 5 I think it's conflict preemption. 6             MR. CLEMENT:  I think it's both, Your Honor. 7 I think part of the reason this is difficult is because 8 it's like an overdetermined equation.  There is both 9 field preemption here, but there's also conflict 10 preemption, and there are multiple evidences of conflict 11 preemption, because nobody's tried to do anything like 12 this before  13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So give me a simple  14 sir, when I write this opinion  15             MR. CLEMENT:  Sure  right. 16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   give me  give me 17 the first paragraph.  This conflicts with what? 18             MR. CLEMENT:  This conflicts with FERC's 19 determination that the PJM rates for the PJM auctions 20 are just and reasonable.  As you said, the starting 21 premise here is the statute gives FERC the authority to 22 determine whether wholesale rates are just and 23 reasonable.  FERC has done that effectively ex ante with 24 respect to the PJM markets by its regulations of PJM. 25 FERC has said that the auction clearing rate for sales
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to PJM is just and reasonable.

40

2             Now, the authority of FERC extends not just

3 to what the nominal rate is in the auction but to what

4 the supplier receives in connection with that sale.  So

5 if a State, through State action, says, it's all very

6 well CPV that you've sold that to PJM and PJM has given

7 you a hundred, this is your lucky day, we're going to

8 give you another 50, that is clearly preempted because a

9 State is having the supplier receive something in

10 connection with a wholesale sale to PJM that is

11 different from the rate that FERC has determined is

12 reasonable.

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Let me try that with the

14 example.  Five thousand new megawatts of capacity is

15 needed.  Existing suppliers can't supply more than four.

16 So FERC is trying to get an extra thousand.  The people

17 whom it will choose to give it and will allow to bid are

18 those who are the new people who have the lowest cost.

19 All of those people in a rising market will have higher

20 costs than the existing people.

21             So if in fact FERC looks to the existing

22 people and says, which can bid?  And says, you have to

23 use your real costs.  And if they really implement that,

24 what you just said is going to have no effect on the

25 market, because they will be in the market whether they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 are given a subsidy or whether they are not given a

41

2 subsidy.

3             And indeed, it won't affect the price

4 because the price is affected only by the marginal

5 units, who, by definition, have higher costs than

6 anything that FERC will look to to see what these

7 people's costs are.  Therefore, it is without impact,

8 and they add to that.

9             We would like to make this argument to FERC

10 where they have to focus on it and not just say in

11 general to the SG, this is how we think, because by the

12 time we're finished, we'll be able to modify present

13 rules so that they will see that they are not hurt at

14 all in the actual world by our costs.

15             I did get something like that out of what

16 they said.  Maybe I'm wrong in what they think.  Maybe

17 they'll just agree because they think I'm agreeing with

18 them at the moment, but I would like to know some

19 response to that.

20             MR. CLEMENT:  Here's your response, Justice

21 Breyer, and it comes in two parts, because there's at

22 least two parts to that question.

23             First, I take issue with the premise because

24 it may be that some new generation will come in, in your

25 hypothetical, but it won't necessarily be this one.  And

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 in fact here we know, as a matter of fact, that it

42

2 wouldn't be this one, except for the 20year guarantee,

3 and so they displaced somebody.

4             But please don't just shrug your

5 shoulders 

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, I am agreeing with

7 you.  I am.

8             (Laughter.)

9             MR. CLEMENT:  That is a huge 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not shrugging my

11 shoulders.

12             MR. CLEMENT:  That is a huge difference,

13 because this  the message this all sends to my clients

14 is don't take FERC's direction that you should be

15 competing based on market forces and efficiency.  We

16 should stop competing efficiently on the PJM and try to

17 put the best bid together based on the threeyear

18 advanced auction.  We should start competing for

19 subsidies, and we should start competing for guarantees.

20             The second part of your question, what about

21 FERC primary jurisdiction.  This is all a bit rich

22 coming from my friends on the other side because, as

23 Justice Alito alluded to, when this all started, their

24 position was this has nothing to do with FERC at all.

25 This is a financial arrangement that FERC can't even

Alderson Reporting Company

1 look at.

Official

43

2             Then my friend talks about how, well, they

3 eventually got marketbased rate authority from FERC in

4 a submission.  Well, I  I'd ask you to take a look at

5 what they said on Joint Appendix page 142 of that

6 submission.  What they said about the contract is they

7 said, quote, "CPV Maryland also notes that it included

8 the CFD in this application solely for informational

9 purposes and is not requesting that the Commission

10 address or discuss Commission jurisdiction over the CFD

11 in its decision on CPV's Maryland's request for

12 marketbased rate."

13             Don't look what's behind that curtain,

14 Mr. FERC.  We don't want you to do anything with that.

15 We're just here to try to get marketbased rate

16 authority.

17             For them now to come in, not having raised

18 any objection to the Supremacy Clause cause of action 

19 and by the way, there was a Commerce Clause cause of

20 action there as well, which is maybe why the parties

21 overlooked it, and I do think that's not jurisdictional,

22 so I think we're past that.

23             So for them to come in now and say, oh, this

24 has to go to FERC, I'm sorry; it's a bit rich.  And I

25 understood why they were making the MOPR argument at the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 early stages of this litigation before FERC filed the 2 brief.  But I am a little mystified why, at this late 3 stage of the game, after FERC has filed three briefs 4 saying that the MOPR is not sufficient to eliminate 5 pricesuppressive bids, that they're still saying we win 6 because FERC's on our side. 7             I mean, that is a bit mystifying.  And I 8 think FERC is absolutely right on this for the reasons 9 that we've already talked about.  I mean, you can't 10 really even apply the MOPR in an applestoapples way if 11 you have this kind of 20year guarantee, because the 12 cost of capitals are completely out of whack.  And of 13 course, they do have the problem that their own 14 testimony is they wouldn't be on the market at all if 15 they didn't have this 20year guarantee. 16             So in the first capacity auction that we had 17 to deal with, the price was suppressed.  In every energy 18 auction since then, the price was suppressed.  And 19 that's why I think FERC  you know, they never tried to 20 design the MOPR as this perfect thing. 21             You talked about the 90 percent and the 70 22 percent?  Way back in one of those proceedings, my 23 client said, FERC, why isn't it a hundred percent?  If 24 you think about the economics of this, it should be a 25 hundred percent.  And FERC's response was, eh, close
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 counts, this isn't perfect, we don't pretend it's

45

2 perfect so we think 90 perfect is a rough compromise.

3 Fair enough.  Probably not arbitrary and capricious, but

4 it doesn't mean that this is something that the MOPR is

5 some perfect solution.

6             I also don't think there's anything terribly

7 anomalous about the procedural posture of this case.  I

8 think it's exact procedural posture you had in front of

9 you in the Schneidewind case.  That was a district court

10 action, declaratory judgment for preemption.

11             What I think makes this a preemption case,

12 and what completely distinguishes voluntary bilateral

13 contracts, is State action.  It's the State action

14 forcing the LSCs to make these payments, and essentially

15 conditioning CPV's participation on the PJM market on

16 the bidandclear requirement.  That's State action

17 that's preempted.

18             In the typical voluntary bilateral contract,

19 you don't have State action.  The parties make their

20 agreement.  They eventually submit it to FERC, or if

21 it's a marketbased rate, somebody can object.  And the

22 only time you really get State action at that point is

23 at the very end of the process when the State's doing

24 retail rate regulation, and that's the point where

25 Mississippi Power & Light and Nantahala come in and say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 if at that late stage when there's finally State action 2 that the State has to take FERC's wholesale rate 3 determinations as a given; they can't second guess them 4 at late stage.  But here you got the State action right 5 up front, and the State action is preempted. 6             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, it  it does 7 seem to me important what the kind of State action is. 8 And this goes back to the question that the Chief 9 Justice raised with you. 10             If the State had just said we need another 11 power plant and had delivered a load of money to CPV and 12 said go build a power plant, you're not saying that that 13 would be preempted, are you?  If it's not at all, it  14 it  you know, that's going to have an effect on the 15 kind of bids that CPV is going to make.  But the State 16 is not itself changing the outcomes of the auction 17 process.  You wouldn't say that's preempted, would you? 18             MR. CLEMENT:  It would depend.  I mean, the 19 way you just described it, I would say  especially 20 because I think it's a helpful answer  of course not, 21 not preempted. 22             (Laughter.) 23             MR. CLEMENT:  But if they conditioned all of 24 that money on a bidandclear requirement, I would be 25 saying that that was preempted.  I think it's a harder

47 1 case, but I'd hate to lose that case here because there 2 are cases like that that are being litigated in the 3 lower court. 4             Thank you, Your Honor. 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 6             Ms. O'Connell. 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL 8           FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 9                SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 10             MS. O'CONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 11 it please the Court: 12             In the government's view, the Maryland 13 Generation Order is preempted because by requiring the 14 Stateselected generator to bid into and clear the PJM 15 capacity auction in order to receive the guaranteed 16 payments provided in the contract, the Maryland program 17 directly intrudes on the Federal auction, and it also 18 interferes with the free market mechanism that FERC has 19 approved for setting capacity prices in that auction. 20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have a 21 position on the question that Mr. Clement avoided, about 22 what if the State  what if the State subsidized the 23 power plant?  Is that good or bad? 24             MS. O'CONNELL:  I  I agree with 25 Mr. Clement's answer.  If the State just 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What  what was

48

2 Mr. Clement's answer?

3             (Laughter.)

4             MS. O'CONNELL:  If the State  if the State

5 just paid to build a power plant, that's not directly

6 targeting what's happening in the PJM auction.  Sure,

7 it's adding supply to the market.  But as long as the

8 State is staying within its sphere under the Federal

9 Power Act, that's fine.

10             But I also agree with the second part of his

11 answer, which is that if there was some kind of a

12 bidandclear requirement in the auction attached to it;

13 for example, if the State paid to build the power plant

14 and turned it over to CPV, but then they said, okay, we

15 want to get some money back for this power plant that we

16 built, so you're going to bid the capacity of this plant

17 into the auction.  And unless you clear, we're taking

18 the plant away from you, or something like that.  That

19 changes the incentives of the participants in FERC's

20 auction.

21             And that's what  what is the key 

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that's the conflict?

23             MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.  Yes.

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's  that's

25 because  you're articulating it as  and correct me

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 if I'm wrong  that the conflict is in affecting the 2 bid price in any way.  Requiring it, affecting it, or  3             MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.  It's  4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   determining it. 5             MS. O'CONNELL:  It's in creating a conflict, 6 changing the incentives of the people in the market in a 7 way that conflicts with the market mechanism that FERC 8 has set up.  We think that shows both field and conflict 9 preemption. 10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. O'Connell, you  you 11 have both arguments field and conflict.  If  if you 12 were to win this case, would you rather win it on field 13 or conflict? 14             (Laughter.) 15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And why? 16             MS. O'CONNELL:  I mean, I think that field 17 preemption is probably a better way to decide the case, 18 and it would  it would be a broader ruling.  In such 19 a  in such a ruling, I think the  the Court would 20 say that when the State does something that alters the 21 incentives of the people that are participating in 22 FERC's market, that is intruding on the Federal field. 23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But for  that  that 24 answers the earlier question:  No, they can't give money 25 to build a generator because that changes the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1 incentives.  The generator's cost by definition change 2 if it's receiving subsidies for free. 3             MS. O'CONNELL:  If  if the State is just 4 acting completely outside of the auction with no 5 requirement to bid into and clear in the auction, then 6 that is not something that changes the incentives of the 7 folks that are participating in the auction, which is 8 what happened here. 9             The  the cost  10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why do you even need 11 the sort of changeinincentives language?  Why isn't 12 the field preemption argument more that this  this  13 this scheme essentially takes the rate that the auction 14 produces and changes that rate for CPV and for all the 15 utilities in Maryland? 16             MS. O'CONNELL:  I think  Justice Kagan, 17 the  the reason why we don't agree with that broader 18 interpretation is because we  FERC does not think that 19 just receiving extra money in  in connection with 20 capacity that's being sold into the auction is 21 necessarily preempted, and let me explain why. 22             There's something that happens in this 23 industry, a widespread practice called contracts for 24 differences.  The contracts in this case are sometimes 25 referred to as contracts for differences, but because of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1 the bidandclear requirement they don't operate in the 2 same way. 3             Parties can enter into a hedge agreement. 4 For  5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but that's  but 6 that's  when Mr. Clement said that there's a real 7 difference here between voluntary agreements  you 8 know, if there's a contract for differences, fine, but 9 that this is Maryland coming in and effectively forcing 10 the LSCs to enter into such a contract, and by doing so, 11 changing the wholesale rate. 12             MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, I think the  the 13 problem that  that FERC sees with this is the effect 14 that it has on the auction.  If this was just a 15 bilateral contract occurring outside of the auction 16 where Maryland was accepting the results of a 17 competitive procurement and then submitting that 18 bilateral contract to FERC for review, that's where FERC 19 would review that contract. 20             The field that we're talking about here is 21 the auction.  And what FERC is concerned about here is 22 the effects on the auction of a State program like the 23 one here that ties a subsidy or  or extra payments 24 under the contract to a requirement that the  the 25 person receiving it bid into and clear the capacity in

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  See, when we 

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How far does your 

4 how far do you think your authority reaches with

5 respect to indirect effects on the auction?

6             I guess that was the point of my question on

7 the subsidies.  I mean, a lot of things are going to

8 have an effect on the auction.

9             Is it only because of the legal mandate in

10 this case?

11             MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.  It's  it's because

12 the  the  the program in this case, by requiring the

13 capacity to be bid into the auction and clear, it

14 directly targets the auction.  It has a direct effect on

15 the auction.

16             We  we recognize that, in the context of

17 the Federal Power Act, the State has its sphere too.

18 The State regulates retail rates.  The State has control

19 over generation.  And it can do things within that

20 sphere that have indirect effects on  on FERC's field.

21             But in this case the problem is that,

22 because of the biddingandclearing requirement, it's

23 directly altering the incentives of the people in that

24 market.

25             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why doesn't the  the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MOPR correct the problem?

53

2             MS. O'CONNELL:  The MOPR corrects it to some

3 extent because the MOPR is choosing what  what FERC

4 thinks is a fair price for a new generator to bid in at.

5 The MOPR isn't a complete solution because, as we've

6 described in our brief, if somebody bids in at the

7 minimumoffer price rule but its costs are actually

8 higher, it is necessarily going to knock somebody out of

9 the auction that would have cleared otherwise, and the

10 price of the auction will go down.

11             But  and I  I think, as Mr. Clement

12 correctly pointed out, the MOPR is not a  a perfect

13 solution to this.  In  in this particular case, I

14 think the incentives of what  what were  was

15 happening under the State program is demonstrated by the

16 fact that CPV tried to bid in so low even when it tried

17 to costjustify their bids.  And the market monitor in

18 PJM, when trying to actually reconstruct CPV's costs,

19 came to different numbers on what those costs would be.

20             So it's not a perfect way to try to screen

21 out offers that are not actually based on cost or that

22 should not be coming in.

23             And  and, additionally, just the fact that

24 FERC had to expand the MOPR to cover this program I

25 think shows that there's been an intrusion onto FERC's

FERC has tried to correct what's happening in 2 these programs through extending the minimumprice offer 3 rule to these bids, but I think that  that just shows 4 that's what's happening here is that the State programs 5 are changing the incentives of the  the people in the 6 field. 7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but I don't see how 8 that could be true.  If FERC could, in fact, get rid of 9 the problem, then it leaves you with no conflict. 10             MS. O'CONNELL:  I don't think that's right. 11 I think the conflict is still with the  the market 12 mechanism that FERC has set up in order to determine 13 wholesale capacity rates in the auction.  When you have 14 a program that has this bidandclear requirement, it 15 alters those incentives.  Even if there's not an actual 16 pricesuppressive effect, the  the  the possibility 17 for a conflict or the imminent possibility of a conflict 18 still calls for field preemption. 19             The  the Court of appeals cited 20 Schneidewind and Northern Natural Gas on page 21a of 21 the  of the Petition Appendix showing that  that's 22 still field preemption. 23             It's  what  what FERC is concerned about 24 is the effects of the  of the State program on the 25 participants in its auction.  In this particular  the

55 1 way that these contracts are constructed, CPV is going 2 to get the contract price regardless of whether the 3 clearing price is lower or higher. 4             JUSTICE BREYER:  I can see it.  But what are 5 the words of the field preemption thing that puts 6 outside the preemption the thing that's worrying the 7 Chief Justice? 8             See, I  I  I mean, you  you want to 9 say the field is so defined  10             MS. O'CONNELL:  Well  11             JUSTICE BREYER:   as, and  and now, 12 look, billions of actions of States affect the cost of 13 the generator and thereby affect the bid price into the 14 PJM auction. 15             Now, 99.99999 percent we want the State to 16 do.  They're perfectly free to do.  But you want this 17 1 percent no.  And  and  and I want the words that 18 are going to define that field. 19             That's what Justice Sotomayor was asking for 20 before.  It's something to do with the rule here in 21 Maryland that forces them not just to have these 22 artificial costs but to put it on the  the auction. 23             MS. O'CONNELL:  Right. 24             JUSTICE BREYER:  What are the words? 25             MS. O'CONNELL:  I think directly targeting

1 the auction to take some words from ONEOK would be a

56

2 fine way to do it.

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  I see targeting.

4             MS. O'CONNELL:  The  the  the field that

5 we're talking about is the PJM auction.  And any  a

6 State program that directly targets the auction and the

7 incentives of the participants in that auction by the

8 bidandclear requirement is  would be preempted under

9 a fieldpreemption theory.  We think also under a

10 conflictpreemption theory.

11             I  I could distinguish just a  just a

12 little bit the contracts for differences that are not

13 tied to a bidandclear requirement in the auction.

14             States  or the parties in this context

15 will sometimes enter into a hedge agreement where they

16 agree on a price.  Like a hundred dollars, if the

17 auction clearing price is below that, say it's 80, then

18 the person that the generator has contracted with, like

19 Merrill Lynch or something, owes the generator $20

20 regardless of what  what else happens.  That

21 transaction will always take place.

22             The generator then has to make a separate

23 decision of whether it wants to bid into the auction.

24 If it's  if the auction price is 80 and its costs are

25 90, it's not going to.  If its costs are 70, it will bid

57

2             That sort of a contract for differences is

3 not preempted here.  It's just when there's a

4 biddingandclearing requirement that the subsidy is

5 tied to.

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

7             Mr. Strauss, you have three minutes

8 remaining.

9           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT H. STRAUSS

10          ON BEHALF OF THE NO. 14614 PETITIONERS

11             MR. STRAUSS:  Thank you, Your Honor.

12             We did not  Maryland did not require CPV

13 to bid into the auction.  CPV agreed to do so in

14 response to a competitive procurement.

15             FERC has no issue with competitive

16 procurements, and that can be found in the Joint

17 Appendix.  At page 909, there is a regulation in which

18 FERC essentially says so.

19             That's all that happened here.

20             The question of whether we targeted the

21 auction:  We did not regulate the auction.  We could not

22 regulate the auction.  We could not regulate CPV,

23 either.  They're a wholesale generator.  They make their

24 own choices, and they made their own agreement here to

25 enter into this contract.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             We couldn't regulate the outcome of the

58

2 auction because FERC regulates the outcome of the

3 auction.  They control every aspect of it.

4             And in this case, what FERC found was a rule

5 change was needed to address this very contract.  The

6 change was made.  The resource bid in accordance with

7 the rule change and cleared.

8             FERC said its rule change would reconcile

9 the tensions between State policy and auction integrity.

10 FERC said that this resource was economic, needed,

11 competitive, and did not suppress prices.

12             There was no undue price suppression or no

13 artificial price suppression from this resource.  FERC

14 said that and  and said it more than once.  Even with

15 the State subsidy.

16             And the reason is very clear:  Because the

17 bid was a costbased bid without regard to the contract

18 revenue.

19             And keep in mind, there's been a lot of talk

20 about a subsidy here.  Maryland concluded that, over the

21 life of this contract, this was going to be a better

22 deal for ratepayers than for the generator.  And that is

23 in the generation order.

24             The only other point I would make,

25 Your Honor, is that the rule that should be articulated

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
59 1 here is one that allows each of the parties to fulfill 2 their responsibilities under the statute.  Sellers get 3 to set rates as an initial matter.  FERC gets to review 4 those rates, and States get to direct the procurement 5 decisions of their retail utilities. 6             Been a lot of talk here about what the 7 retail utilities were forced to do.  The subject is 8 State regulation.  State courts have affirmed what 9 Maryland did here with respect to its retail utilities. 10 There should be no question about that.  States can take 11 actions where necessary to develop new power plants. 12             And as we move forward into an era of a new 13 generation portfolio in this country, the last thing the 14 Court should be considering is trying to limit State 15 options.  It's very important to keep them open, 16 especially in a case here, where FERC has reviewed this 17 precise contract. 18             If you look on page 6 of our reply brief, 19 there is a quote from the FERC rehearing order in 20 November of 2011 in which FERC describes an acceptable 21 arrangement and describes this arrangement:  one in 22 which local utilities contract with a generator and the 23 generator bids the unit into the market. 24             That is exactly what happened under this 25 contract.  FERC speaks approvingly of it.
