 2 (11:11 a.m.)
 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument in
 4 next No. 01-408, The Holmes Group v. Vornado Air
 5 Circulation Systems, Inc. 
 6 Mr. Dabney. 
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. DABNEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 10 please the Court:
 11 This case concerns how far the Federal Circuit
 12 can properly go in taking jurisdiction to the exclusion of
 13 the regional circuits.
 14 In its recent construction of its appellate
 15 jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit has effectively taken
 16 the position that the defendant's answer containing a
 17 patent counterclaim acts like a super removal petition. 
 18 The Federal Circuit says that if the defendant in a non-
 19 patent suit files an answer that includes a patent
 20 counterclaim, that pleading automatically removes the
 21 plaintiff's non-patent suits from regional circuit
 22 jurisdiction and transfers it to Federal Circuit
 23 jurisdiction. 
 24 According to the respondent, that same pleading
 25 automatically has the effect of changing the substantive

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 law governing non-patent claims in the plaintiff's non-
 2 patent suit from regional circuit to Federal Circuit law,
 3 and the decision below demonstrates that these principles
 4 apply even when a judgment is entered which doesn't
 5 address patent law at all. 
 6 The petitioner respectfully submits that the
 7 decision below is antithetical to what the Congress had in
 8 mind when it established the Federal Circuit.
 9 QUESTION: Well, Congress did want patent law to
 10 be uniform, didn't it? 
 11 MR. DABNEY: Congress --
 12 QUESTION: I mean, that's why it placed the
 13 jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the Federal
 14 Circuit. 
 15 MR. DABNEY: One -- Mr. -- Your Honor, one of
 16 the Congress' objectives in establishing the Federal
 17 Circuit certainly was --
 18 QUESTION: And to the extent that you then allow
 19 the other courts of appeals to deal with patent claims,
 20 you're defeating that uniformity goal. 
 21 MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, the Congress in
 22 enacting 1295, according to this Court in Christianson,
 23 establishes not that every case in which a Federal patent
 24 claim is raised automatically goes to the Federal Circuit. 
 25 This Court in Christianson held -- this Court in

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Christianson addressed the question, how do we know if a
 2 case belongs in the Federal Circuit? That was the
 3 specific question raised in Christianson. 
 4 Citing the legislative history of 1295, this
 5 Court answered that question. Cases fall within the
 6 exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit, this Court
 7 held, in the same sense that cases are said to arise under
 8 Federal -- under Federal law for purposes of Federal
 9 question jurisdiction. 
 10 QUESTION: Mr. Dabney, has the Federal Circuit
 11 held that whenever there's a patent claim in a -- in a --
 12 a patent issue in a counterclaim, it has jurisdiction? Or
 13 must it be a compulsory counterclaim?
 14 MR. DABNEY: The Federal Circuit has held in the
 15 DSC Communications case that permissive or compulsory, it
 16 doesn't matter. 
 17 QUESTION: It doesn't matter. 
 18 QUESTION: But in this case --
 19 QUESTION: In this case, it was compulsory. 
 20 Right? 
 21 MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, it is far from clear
 22 that the counterclaim in this case was in fact compulsory. 
 23 The -- and the -- and the Court can see that most clearly
 24 by looking at the answer that was actually filed in this
 25 case, which appears on pages 94 to 98 of the lodging. The

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 one thing that's conspicuously absent from the answer
 2 filed in this case was any counterclaim for trade dress
 3 infringement. Well, if this was --
 4 QUESTION: But did -- did the court of appeals
 5 say in this case that the -- the counterclaim was
 6 compulsory?
 7 MR. DABNEY: The court of appeals did not say
 8 that. There's absolutely nothing in the decision --
 9 QUESTION: We're not talking about the trade
 10 dress claim. It was the patent infringement counterclaim
 11 that was in question. 
 12 MR. DABNEY: The respondent has taken the
 13 position that the patent counterclaim that it filed in
 14 this particular case was compulsory within the meaning of
 15 rule 13. No court has passed on that question that --
 16 QUESTION: Did it not arise out of the same
 17 transaction and occurrence which under the rules is
 18 interpreted broadly? 
 19 MR. DABNEY: The subject matter of that
 20 counterclaim was, at the time it was filed, the subject of
 21 another pending proceeding. And it is far from clear that
 22 this respondent was under any legal duty whatsoever to
 23 assert that patent counterclaim at any believable risk to
 24 itself. 
 25 QUESTION: Suppose that respondent who started

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 his own show in the -- in the CIT -- when the defendant in
 2 that case turns up as plaintiff in Kansas District Court
 3 -- was it? The -- the district court here? 
 4 MR. DABNEY: At the time that the present action
 5 was commenced, the plaintiff in this action was one of
 6 three named people whom the respondent was trying to get
 7 an investigation started against. 
 8 QUESTION: No. I just wanted to know where the
 9 forum was. The forum that the plaintiff is suing in is in
 10 the Tenth Circuit. 
 11 MR. DABNEY: Correct. 
 12 QUESTION: And it's in Kansas. 
 13 MR. DABNEY: That's correct. 
 14 QUESTION: Okay. 
 15 Suppose the plaintiff in the suit in New York
 16 then brings that same claim in the district court in
 17 Kansas and says, court, please consolidate these two, and
 18 then you don't have a counterclaim. You have two claims
 19 consolidated for adjudication. Suppose that were the
 20 case. 
 21 MR. DABNEY: Yes. 
 22 QUESTION: Then, I take it, the judgment is
 23 rendered. There's a patent claim, not a counterclaim, but
 24 a claim, and then the jurisdiction is in the Federal
 25 Circuit. Is that right? 

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DABNEY: That is a hypothetical situation,
 2 different from this case. I would suggest that the
 3 district court has an arsenal of remedies to decide
 4 whether that should or should not be the outcome in that
 5 case. 
 6 QUESTION: I'm asking you a question that puts
 7 together two claims, not counterclaims, two claims. The
 8 district court has made the judgment that these arise out
 9 of the same transaction and occurrence and therefore
 10 consolidates them because it makes sense in terms of
 11 judicial economy. Okay. They are processed as
 12 consolidated cases. There's a judgment. Where does the
 13 appeal go? 
 14 MR. DABNEY: I -- I would say in practice that
 15 would depend in large measure on the sequence in which the
 16 matters are tried, whether they are tried at the same
 17 time, whether they are tried separately.
 18 QUESTION: Yes, they are tried at the same time.
 19 MR. DABNEY: Tried at the same time? I believe
 20 that under the question that this Court has not accepted
 21 expressly under question 2, it would be open to both sides
 22 in that situation to request that the district court enter
 23 judgments which would preserve regional circuit
 24 jurisdiction over the plaintiff's non-patent suit in the
 25 first case. 

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: They're both plaintiffs. 
 2 MR. DABNEY: I understand. And no one in this
 3 case -- there's no question in this case as to what the
 4 appropriate disposition would be of any claim for patent
 5 infringement or any judgment adjudicating any such claim. 
 6 If the question had come up --
 7 QUESTION: Are you suggesting in -- in response
 8 to my question that they would -- these two cases that
 9 have been consolidated would then be split apart for
 10 purposes of appeal and one claim would go to a regional
 11 circuit and the other to the Federal Circuit?
 12 MR. DABNEY: It would be open to the parties to
 13 that litigation in -- where they're both plaintiffs and
 14 they both have filed claims, to request the entry of
 15 judgments if they felt it was in their interest to do so,
 16 based on the outcome of the trial. 
 17 QUESTION: Well, you're assuming they could have
 18 separate judgments under 54(b). Is that what your point
 19 is here? 
 20 MR. DABNEY: Yes, Your Honor. 
 21 QUESTION: Yes. 
 22 But if there were a single judgment which did
 23 include the patent claim, then I think you'd say the
 24 appeal would go to the Federal Circuit.
 25 MR. DABNEY: Not -- not necessarily. 

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Come on. Give us a little bit. 
 2 Surely, surely in that case. 
 3 QUESTION: Well, why not? I mean, what are you
 4 giving up in your case by agreeing to that? I don't
 5 understand that. 
 6 MR. DABNEY: I think it's important to
 7 understand that when a -- when a person comes to court and
 8 asked for a court to vary the rights and obligations of
 9 parties, seeks judicial relief, what that person comes to
 10 court with is a bundle of rights. That's his suit. That
 11 is what he's asking the court to vindicate. This Court
 12 has never said that that bundle of rights, the plaintiff's
 13 right to choose who's going to decide that claim, and what
 14 law is going to govern that claim, can be changed at all
 15 automatically by something the defendant pleads or by how
 16 the --
 17 QUESTION: May I -- may I interrupt and ask a
 18 kind of a basic question here? 
 19 MR. DABNEY: Certainly. 
 20 QUESTION: It seems to me that you could prevail
 21 on either of two theories, that -- that the counterclaim
 22 should be ignored for purposes of selecting the appellate
 23 court to go to, or you could say that in this particular
 24 case, you got a 54(b) judgment that had -- was totally
 25 unrelated to patent claims and therefore, in this case,

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 regardless of whether we agree with Aerojet or the rest,
 2 you should prevail. 
 3 But you seem to be arguing that even if the
 4 counterclaim had been decided and adjudicated on a patent
 5 issue, that you -- it would be the same case. 
 6 MR. DABNEY: That is correct, Your Honor. 
 7 QUESTION: You're not relying on the fact that
 8 -- that there was a severance of the non-patent claims
 9 under -- with a 54(b) finding, that it was a separate
 10 claim.
 11 MR. DABNEY: That would provide a narrower basis
 12 for reversal. 
 13 QUESTION: But you're not asking us to rule on
 14 that basis. 
 15 MR. DABNEY: Well, we did in the petition, but
 16 the Court declined to accept question 2 in the petition. 
 17 What Your Honor asked me was specifically question 2 in
 18 the petition for certiorari. 
 19 QUESTION: I see. 
 20 MR. DABNEY: And the Court did not accept that
 21 question before the Court. Hence, we're up on the broader
 22 question of whether or not the plaintiff's well-pleaded
 23 complaint continues to govern the basis of arising under
 24 jurisdiction in the Federal court.
 25 In Christianson, to decide this case, the Court

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 need look hardly beyond 486 U.S., page 814. Right then
 2 and there the Court was faced with the question, how do we
 3 know if a case properly belongs in the Federal Circuit? 
 4 And the Court held, we know that because Congress has told
 5 us the answer. What Congress said is, cases fall within
 6 the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit in the
 7 same way that they are said to arise under Federal law for
 8 purposes of general Federal question jurisdiction under
 9 1331. The cases are legion which say that what a
 10 defendant pleads in its answer, whether it's an
 11 affirmative defense or a counterclaim, is irrelevant to
 12 whether a case falls within the original arising under
 13 jurisdiction of the Federal court. 
 14 QUESTION: In the -- in the context where
 15 there's a great concern about Federal-State relations,
 16 cases lodged in the State court being lifted out of that
 17 State court and put into a Federal court, this context is
 18 totally different. It is an entirely Federal context, and
 19 it's a question of which appellate forum it goes to. And
 20 it seems to me that you can't just say that what arising
 21 under means in the original jurisdiction context it
 22 necessarily means when we're talking about an exclusive
 23 appellate forum for a case that's colored Federal totally. 
 24 There's no State element in it. 
 25 MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, I would say two things

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 in response to that. 
 2 In the first place, that was exactly the
 3 argument which the respondent in Christianson made. In
 4 footnote 2 of Christianson, the Court expressly recited
 5 maybe our arising under jurisprudence is irrelevant in
 6 this case since, after all, we're only deciding whether
 7 the Seventh Circuit or the Federal Circuit should decide
 8 this antitrust case in which the district court
 9 invalidated a number of patents.
 10 And citing the legislative history that the
 11 Congress chose, for better or for worse, to make the
 12 referent of Federal Circuit jurisdiction the same as the
 13 referent of district court jurisdiction under 1331 and
 14 1338, under the page and in the passage that I just read,
 15 this Court I believe specifically considered and decided
 16 that notwithstanding that the outcome in this type of case
 17 is simply which of two Federal courts of appeals will hear
 18 a case. Nevertheless, for better or for worse, Congress
 19 has decided that the referent of Federal Circuit
 20 jurisdiction is the same. 
 21 QUESTION: Christianson was the first time the
 22 Court encountered this issue, and Christianson affirmed
 23 the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit said, we don't
 24 have the appellate authority in this case.
 25 A couple of years later, the Federal Circuit

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 looked at the issue again in Aerojet and it wrote an
 2 opinion saying these are different. In one case we were
 3 dealing with a defense, an issue, a question, and in
 4 another case, we've got a claim. And for purposes of
 5 which court of appeals it goes to, maybe the court is --
 6 in Aerojet is saying we have to qualify Christianson's
 7 reasoning if not -- not its result.
 8 MR. DABNEY: Justice Ginsburg, in Aerojet, the
 9 Federal Circuit stated, among other things, that the
 10 traditional prerogative of the plaintiff to choose his law
 11 and to choose his court applies only to the trial court
 12 level. The Aerojet case said that the plaintiff in that
 13 case had fully exhausted his right to choose his court and
 14 to choose his law because he had access to a district
 15 court forum.
 16 This Court -- this case demonstrates how that
 17 rationale of Aerojet is mischievous and dangerous and
 18 incorrect. Since Aerojet in 1989, there has been a sea
 19 change in the Federal Circuit's approach to what law it
 20 chooses to apply in cases such as this, and it is the
 21 Federal Circuit's choice of law approach, adopted in the
 22 late 1990's, which has given birth to this entire action.
 23 QUESTION: When you say choice of law, you're
 24 not talking strictly about patent law, I take it.
 25 MR. DABNEY: Absolutely not. This -- it's

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 undisputed that what --
 2 QUESTION: You're talking about Federal law
 3 interpreted differently by different circuits. 
 4 MR. DABNEY: Precisely.
 5 QUESTION: It's not like am I going to choose
 6 the law of France or the law of Oklahoma versus the law of
 7 New York.
 8 MR. DABNEY: That's absolutely the case. And
 9 the Federal Circuit, being a co-equal court of appeals, is
 10 fully entitled, I suppose, to fashion its own liability
 11 rules and apply them even to claims over which it has only
 12 nonexclusive or pendent jurisdiction. But by doing that,
 13 it has given rise to great incentives, which the
 14 respondent has attempted to avail itself of in this case,
 15 to get a case into the Federal Circuit and take advantage
 16 of the different law of the Federal Circuit on a non-
 17 patent claim. 
 18 So, I would suggest to Your Honor that this
 19 Court has never wavered from the idea that a person who
 20 comes to court seeking relief -- there's a lot of
 21 uncertainty in litigation. I'm called upon to advise
 22 clients all the time whether they should or should not
 23 bring suit, where they should bring suit, how they should
 24 bring suit. The one thing this Court has said, whatever
 25 else is uncertain in litigation, the one thing you know

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is, number one, if you bring a suit, you have -- you are
 2 absolute master to decide what law you're going to rely on
 3 in your complaint. That's your claim. If I specify the
 4 law of California in my complaint, that's my choice. If
 5 the plaintiff specifies the law of the Tenth Circuit or a
 6 judgment of the Tenth Circuit, that is the plaintiff's
 7 choice. 
 8 QUESTION: That's a little odd, don't you think? 
 9 We are talking about one law, a Federal law. It is not
 10 quite the same as talking about the law of California, the
 11 law of Nevada. And wasn't one of the purposes of having
 12 the Federal Circuit so that you would reduce the number of
 13 disparities in -- in Federal law? 
 14 MR. DABNEY: Well, early in its history the
 15 Federal Circuit seemed to be more mindful of that type of
 16 conflict than it is today. 
 17 It's very important that Your Honor understand. 
 18 In the Midwest case, which fomented this whole thing, the
 19 1999 Midwest case, that was a case that involved not just
 20 Federal law claims, that was a case that involved claims
 21 under Iowa State law. And the Federal Circuit in that
 22 case was considering whether or not a plaintiff could
 23 properly claim trade dress protection for the shape a boat
 24 trailer winch post. And the district court had granted
 25 summary judgment dismissing the plaintiff's claims not

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 just under the Lanham Act, but under Iowa State law.
 2 QUESTION: Well, you -- you don't mean that the
 3 Federal Circuit has asserted that where you have a State
 4 claim, that it's going to apply Federal law to that State
 5 claim.
 6 MR. DABNEY: That is exactly what it did in the
 7 Midwest case. The Federal Circuit --
 8 QUESTION: Mr. Dabney, we're all quite close to
 9 you. I think perhaps we can hear you even if you don't
 10 speak so quite so loudly. 
 11 (Laughter.) 
 12 QUESTION: You -- you are saying that the
 13 Federal Circuit said we have the right not only to
 14 determine what is an answer to a Federal issue, but we
 15 have a right to tell Iowa what the law of the State of
 16 Iowa is? That would be astonishing. 
 17 MR. DABNEY: I invite Your Honor to look at
 18 pages 1564 and 65 of volume 175 of Federal 3rd, and Your
 19 Honor will read there that the Federal Circuit reversed a
 20 summary judgment under Iowa State law on the ground that
 21 in its view the Federal patent law doesn't limit any claim
 22 that can be asserted under Iowa State law. And therefore,
 23 the district court erred in not holding that Iowa State
 24 law could protect the shape of a trailer winch post.
 25 QUESTION: Mr. Dabney, would you heed my

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 admonition? Please do. 
 2 MR. DABNEY: Thank you, Your Honor. I
 3 apologize, Mr. Chief Justice. 
 4 So, therefore --
 5 QUESTION: On -- on one point that you made
 6 about the Federal Circuit saying, well, if it's a Federal
 7 question, what is the Federal law? We decide that as our
 8 sister circuits do. It's just asserting that it's a court
 9 of equal dignity, that it's not under the enthrall of the
 10 Tenth Circuit or any other circuit.
 11 MR. DABNEY: I am not questioning that that is
 12 what the Federal Circuit is currently doing, and that it
 13 -- it -- I'm not questioning it has the power to do that. 
 14 QUESTION: May I ask this -- just a question
 15 about the history of what we've got before us? Am I
 16 correct in believing that until the Federal Circuit
 17 changed its view and started to apply its own law to non-
 18 patent issues as opposed to applying other circuits' law
 19 when the case arose in another circuit, the bar generally
 20 was totally happy with the rule that the counterclaim
 21 would -- counterclaim alleging a patent claim would be
 22 sufficient to give appellate jurisdiction to the Federal
 23 Circuit? 
 24 MR. DABNEY: I cannot say that that is a fair
 25 characterization of what the bar generally holds. I

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 believe that the bar is very cautious in what it says
 2 about any court in which it may appear in front of. 
 3 QUESTION: Is it --
 4 QUESTION: So, it is true that this -- this has 
 5 become a much more important problem since they changed
 6 the -- their rule on what they do with the ancillary
 7 claims. 
 8 MR. DABNEY: It has much greater practical
 9 significance now. But the fact of the matter is that the
 10 arising under basis --
 11 QUESTION: The jurisdiction rule is the same in
 12 either event. 
 13 MR. DABNEY: Is -- is the same. We have a
 14 bright line test. How do we know whether a case belongs
 15 in the Federal Circuit or in any Federal court? You look
 16 at what's presented on the place -- on the face of the
 17 plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint. You don't inquire
 18 into the plaintiff's motives or -- or spin-out theories as
 19 to why the plaintiff is doing what it's doing.
 20 QUESTION: Well, may I ask a question? 
 21 MR. DABNEY: Certainly. 
 22 QUESTION: Not -- not your case certainly, but
 23 we had a case called Cardinal Chemical Company v. Morton
 24 International in 1993, which seemed to say that a patent
 25 law counterclaim could serve as an independent basis for a

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 district court's original jurisdiction.
 2 MR. DABNEY: That's not how I read Cardinal
 3 Chemical, Justice O'Connor. 
 4 QUESTION: Okay. 
 5 MR. DABNEY: Cardinal Chemical was a straight-
 6 up patent infringement case. The defendant in that case
 7 asserted two -- at least two things in -- in response to
 8 the claim of patent infringement. The defendant in
 9 Cardinal Chemical said, your patent is invalid, and
 10 therefore I'm not liable. And then, as many defendants do
 11 nowadays, the defendant in Cardinal Chemical says, I also
 12 want a counterclaim for declaratory judgment that your
 13 patent is invalid. One of the reasons why I want that is
 14 so that if you, the plaintiff, decide to pull the plug on
 15 your suit, I can stay in court on my counterclaim. And
 16 that was what came up and that was the issue. 
 17 However, it's very clear that since at least
 18 1990 the source of a district court's power to hear a
 19 counterclaim like that is in 1367, supplemental
 20 jurisdiction. The district court unquestionably --
 21 QUESTION: Not 1338? 
 22 MR. DABNEY: Not -- absolutely not. 1367. 
 23 So --
 24 QUESTION: What is -- what is -- taking a case,
 25 Mr. Dabney -- and this has come up I think again and again

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 -- where you have a counterclaim that would qualify for
 2 Federal jurisdiction whether under 1331, 1338, whatever,
 3 that for whatever reason, the main claim drops out, maybe
 4 because it failed -- fails to state a claim. The
 5 counterclaim, whether it's an antitrust claim, patent
 6 claim, copyright claim, stays in Federal court and it's
 7 not supplemental to anything. It has its own
 8 jurisdictional base. It's a Federal claim. And if it
 9 weren't a Federal claim, it couldn't stay there because it
 10 would have nothing to pend to. 
 11 MR. DABNEY: I don't believe that's a correct
 12 statement of 1367. I believe that a Federal court can
 13 retain --
 14 QUESTION: Are there not many, many cases in the
 15 district court, blessed by the courts of appeals, where
 16 exactly what I've described happens? The main claim drops
 17 for whatever reason. There's a counterclaim that would
 18 qualify independently for Federal jurisdiction. The court
 19 will adjudicate that. But if it has a counterclaim that
 20 would not independently qualify, it is not likely to hang
 21 onto that case. Right?
 22 MR. DABNEY: That is what happens --
 23 QUESTION: Because -- because the only Federal
 24 peg is gone. And pendent jurisdiction is exercised when
 25 there's a tail that's attached to a dog, but when the dog

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is gone, the tail doesn't stay. 
 2 MR. DABNEY: Yes. But in that situation,
 3 Justice Ginsburg, you're not talking about nullifying a
 4 plaintiff's choice of law and forum through the -- the
 5 assertion of a well-pleaded complaint. If a plaintiff
 6 asserts a defective complaint and shouldn't --
 7 QUESTION: The question I asked you is you said
 8 that what had been going on for years before there was
 9 1367 codified, all of a sudden that independent Federal
 10 claim, be it an antitrust claim, a patent claim, suddenly
 11 becomes shrunken to a supplemental jurisdiction rather
 12 than having its own jurisdictional peg. 
 13 MR. DABNEY: I don't know that the legal
 14 significance of the source of a district court's power to
 15 act in that situation has ever been a subject on which any
 16 legal consequences followed so that the body of law that
 17 developed on that would have any precedential significance
 18 in this situation. 
 19 The fact -- the critical distinction between
 20 this situation and the one Your Honor is positing is that
 21 in the situations Your Honor is talking about, you're not
 22 talking about a plaintiff who had a well-pleaded complaint
 23 who he prevailed on being ousted of his chosen court and
 24 forum. I don't believe that the appropriate disposition
 25 of a counterclaim in that situation sheds any light on

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 what should happen to a plaintiff who files suit under
 2 non-patent law and wins, and the plaintiff doesn't seek
 3 relief under Federal patent law. The plaintiff doesn't
 4 care what the defendant does with other claims the
 5 defendant has. If the respondent wants to have a patent
 6 counterclaim, go to the Federal court or litigate a
 7 Federal patent counterclaim in the International Trade
 8 Commission, more power to it. 
 9 This suit was brought to get preliminary
 10 injunctive relief against threatened, imminent,
 11 irreparable harm to the plaintiff's business which was
 12 granted. There was a preliminary injunction that was
 13 issued in January of 2000, which remains in effect to this
 14 day upon the posting of a $100,000 bond. The plaintiff
 15 had every right and entitlement to go into court, to plead
 16 his claim in the way that the plaintiff thought would best
 17 accomplish the plaintiff's objectives. That is a
 18 prerogative which this Court has said over and over and
 19 over again is the plaintiff's right. No well-counseled
 20 plaintiff could possibly file a lawsuit without thinking
 21 what court is most likely to give me the relief that I'm
 22 seeking. That's not forum shopping. That's good
 23 lawyering. And that's what happened in this case.
 24 QUESTION: And what about a defendant who would
 25 just love to have -- not particularly litigious, has a

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 claim, a good claim, asserts it as a counterclaim, goes
 2 into the district court because that's where it belongs? 
 3 I just don't understand why the rule that would apply to
 4 the district court carries over to the specialized court
 5 of appeals if you are, in fact, dealing with a patent
 6 claim that's been adjudicated. 
 7 MR. DABNEY: This Court has held and the -- the
 8 congressional choice of the arising under referent for
 9 Federal Circuit jurisdiction clearly recognized that there
 10 will be many, many times when patent law questions and
 11 patent law issues, including the issue of validity, will
 12 be decided not just in the regional circuits, but in the
 13 State courts. 
 14 Would it really have mattered in Lear v. Adkins
 15 if the defendant in that case hadn't just said, the
 16 contract is invalid because the patent is no good and
 17 there's no consideration, if it had filed a counterclaim,
 18 as was done in Cardinal Chemical and said, I want a
 19 declaratory judgment that the patent isn't valid? No
 20 legal consequence should follow from that. 
 21 And in the real world, Justice Ginsburg, if a
 22 defendant really is concerned about maintaining its access
 23 to the Federal Circuit, the defendant will file his own
 24 suit, as Your Honor suggested in that --
 25 QUESTION: This defendant did.

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DABNEY: I'm sorry? 
 2 QUESTION: Didn't -- this defendant did. He
 3 started in the -- in the --
 4 MR. DABNEY: The respondent -- and -- and it was
 5 free at all times to pursue all available remedies in that
 6 forum and that's not -- that's not even in question at
 7 this point. But just as the respondent was free to choose
 8 a forum that it thought was most favorable to it, which,
 9 by the way, would have been subject to Federal Circuit
 10 review, so was the petitioner. And the petitioner filed
 11 suit in accordance with the rules. It got a judgment. It
 12 won, and it's had its judgment taken away by a court that
 13 clearly does not have jurisdiction to hear the
 14 controversy.
 15 If there's no further questions, I'd like to
 16 reserve the rest of my time. 
 17 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dabney. 
 18 Mr. Gowdey, we'll hear -- hear from you. 
 19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER W. GOWDEY
 20 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 21 MR. GOWDEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 22 please the Court:
 23 In light of the colloquy that we've had, I want
 24 to make a preliminary point and then a couple other
 25 starting points. 

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 The first is that there's absolutely no issue
 2 that the Federal Circuit has failed to follow this Court's
 3 precedents and, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out
 4 previously, correctly anticipated this Court's holding in
 5 Christianson. 
 6 And to respond to a question that Justice
 7 O'Connor raised, in the Cardinal case, this Court did say,
 8 in this case Cardinal properly invoked the original
 9 jurisdiction of a district court by way of its patent
 10 counterclaim.
 11 QUESTION: Mr. Gowdey, do you think the court of
 12 -- the Federal Circuit's opinion here is entirely
 13 consistent with footnote 2 in our Colt opinion? 
 14 MR. GOWDEY: In the which opinion, Your Honor? 
 15 QUESTION: In -- in our Christianson v. Colt
 16 Industries? 
 17 MR. GOWDEY: I think -- I think that the
 18 position that the Federal Circuit has taken this Court is
 19 completely consistent with Christian v. Colt.
 20 QUESTION: And -- and with footnote 2 therein?
 21 MR. GOWDEY: Yes. And -- and I say that because
 22 of the reasoning and the procedures and the -- and the
 23 considered exhaustive review that the Federal Circuit made
 24 in Aerojet or the Christian v. Colt case. They started
 25 their Aerojet decision saying that the question was of

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 exceptional importance and, because of that, sat on their
 2 choice en banc. They exactly framed the question in that
 3 case, which was whether --
 4 QUESTION: Mr. Gowdey, may I suggest that you
 5 raise that a little higher? The podium. I'm having some
 6 trouble hearing. 
 7 QUESTION: We had the opposite problem. The
 8 first counsel had a very loud voice and yours is very
 9 soft. So --
 10 MR. GOWDEY: I -- I do have a soft voice and I
 11 apologize. 
 12 They framed the question in Christian v. Colt --
 13 in -- in Aerojet as being one where you do not have a
 14 patent issue as the complaint, but you have a patent
 15 counterclaim coming in. And in that case, it was a
 16 compulsory patent counterclaim. Should that be a
 17 sufficient basis for giving exclusive appellate
 18 jurisdiction to the Federal Circuit? They answered that
 19 it was. 
 20 The Aerojet opinion is -- is well-crafted. It's
 21 a thoughtful opinion. It goes through analysis --
 22 QUESTION: Well, that's -- that's this CAFC's
 23 ruling on its own jurisdiction.
 24 MR. GOWDEY: That's correct. 
 25 QUESTION: In the Aerojet case. 

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. GOWDEY: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. 
 2 QUESTION: So, in effect, we're trying to decide
 3 whether that's right in this circumstance. 
 4 MR. GOWDEY: That is absolutely correct, Your
 5 Honor. 
 6 They -- they looked --
 7 QUESTION: But it does seem to be unlikely, does
 8 it not, that where the counterclaim raising the patent
 9 issue hasn't been dealt with and what we're dealing with
 10 is an appeal from this injunction which was rendered in
 11 the plaintiff's suit below -- why should the CAFC get into
 12 it at all?
 13 MR. GOWDEY: Because we should look at
 14 jurisdiction for an appellate court at the time of the
 15 pleading stage of the case, Your Honor. And at the
 16 pleading stage, you have the complaint and you have the
 17 answer and counterclaims --
 18 QUESTION: I would think it would have to be
 19 considered also in light of what's happened in this case. 
 20 I don't see why you would be so limited necessarily. It
 21 seems so odd that this appeal would go to the Federal
 22 Circuit.
 23 MR. GOWDEY: I -- I don't think it's odd, Your
 24 Honor. I think that you have to establish appellate
 25 jurisdiction at the beginning of a case so that as a case

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 proceeds, if there are interlocutory appeals that -- that
 2 are going to happen, where is it that they should be
 3 properly directed? And there should not be a conundrum as
 4 -- as to that. And if you look at the claims in the case,
 5 if you look under 1338 and 1295, talking about civil
 6 actions and claims, the jurisdiction of a Federal Circuit
 7 should -- should be decided by what claims are pled.
 8 QUESTION: Well, what case of ours do you think
 9 most strongly supports your view of this jurisdictional
 10 question? 
 11 MR. GOWDEY: I -- I think you have to look at
 12 Christian v. Colt and the fact that in that case, the
 13 decision said it should be adapted to 1338. I think the
 14 Aerojet decision that comes along after that and its
 15 exhaustive review of Christianson makes clear that -- that
 16 you should look at claims. And as you're adapting 1338 to
 17 the patent situation --
 18 QUESTION: Mr. Gowdey, I -- I think Aerojet
 19 makes a whole lot of sense if -- if the issue before the
 20 -- the court there and the issue before us here were what
 21 makes sense. Then -- then Aerojet may -- may well be
 22 right. 
 23 But -- but it seems to me that the issue really
 24 before us is what does section 1295 mean. What was it
 25 understood to mean when it spoke of a claim arising under

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 any act of Congress relating to copyrights and trademarks? 
 2 And that's a different question. And when you have a long
 3 history known to every first-year law student that a case
 4 arises under a certain law, if the well-pleaded complaint
 5 invokes that law and does not arise under that law if --
 6 if a counterclaim invokes it, I find it hard to believe
 7 that anyone would interpret the statute, written with that
 8 magic language, in any other way. 
 9 Now, it -- it might well be the case, as you
 10 argue, that another disposition is more sensible for the
 11 Federal Circuit. But we have to deal here with what
 12 Congress said, and the -- and the whole issue is whether a
 13 claim arising under an act of Congress isn't magic
 14 language that -- that the whole legal community has known
 15 for many years, which means you have to have a well-
 16 pleaded complaint invoking it. 
 17 MR. GOWDEY: Well --
 18 QUESTION: And that's what I think we said in
 19 Christianson.
 20 MR. GOWDEY: Well, in Christian v. -- in
 21 Christianson, however, there was no counterclaim. That --
 22 that issue was not before the Court. That issue has not
 23 yet been addressed by this -- by this Court, which is why
 24 I think looking at the Aerojet decision and looking at the
 25 review that it made of Christianson is important for this

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Court to -- to undertake and to look at. There were --
 2 QUESTION: Not just Aerojet, but I would like
 3 you to pursue that because my understanding is the same as
 4 Justice Scalia's. You started out by saying, in response
 5 to the Chief Justice's question, that footnote 2 applies. 
 6 I take it that means we now have an issue that does not
 7 just concern patent law. It concerns all of Federal
 8 jurisdiction. 
 9 You then said we look to what is filed in the
 10 district court at the complaint stage. Again, all of
 11 Federal jurisdiction.
 12 You then say that all these other cases involved
 13 a well-pleaded complaint and an answer. This one, though,
 14 involves a well-pleaded complaint and a compulsory
 15 counterclaim.
 16 MR. GOWDEY: Yes --
 17 QUESTION: I agree. So, I look up Wright and
 18 Miller, and Wright and Miller says it is not sufficient
 19 for the Federal question to enter the case as a
 20 counterclaim asserted by the defendant. Now, he didn't
 21 just make that up. He has dozens of citations. So, at
 22 that point I think QED. You lose.
 23 Now, why don't you?
 24 MR. GOWDEY: Well, for the reasons set forth in
 25 Aerojet. First, had the --

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Aerojet, to my way of thinking, just
 2 said it's a counterclaim. It's not a defense. Okay, I
 3 accept that. But I still have Wright and Miller and all
 4 the cases they cite.
 5 MR. GOWDEY: And -- and I think most of the
 6 cases that I'm aware of that talk about counterclaims are
 7 removal cases. That's where you have a -- a State/Federal
 8 issue.
 9 QUESTION: Are what -- what kind of cases?
 10 MR. GOWDEY: Removal cases, Your Honor, where --
 11 where you -- and there is no issue of federalism here. 
 12 The -- the petitioner properly brought a case in -- in the
 13 Federal district court in Kansas.
 14 QUESTION: Then you're -- you're now defeating
 15 your first concession which was with footnote 2 in
 16 Aerojet, that we are to deal with this case exactly as if
 17 it were a removal case because it's a question of all
 18 Federal jurisdiction, not just patent. The word is
 19 arising under. That's in fact -- I flag it because that's
 20 what frightens me. I thought that if all that were at
 21 issue here were patent cases, we weren't going to make a
 22 big mistake either way.
 23 MR. GOWDEY: Well --
 24 (Laughter.) 
 25 QUESTION: But once you tell me that this

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 involves all cases of removal, I suddenly get quite
 2 nervous about departing from well-settled law. 
 3 MR. GOWDEY: Then -- then I must retract it. It
 4 does not -- it does not involve all cases of removal. 
 5 This is a patent case, and -- and I think we're talking
 6 about patent issues and whether the Federal Circuit has
 7 proper jurisdiction of claims in a case involving patent
 8 issues.
 9 QUESTION: Well, then that means we interpret,
 10 under your view, arising under in different ways in the --
 11 in the patent statute and in -- in the Federal
 12 jurisdiction statute. 
 13 MR. GOWDEY: I -- I think that arising under is
 14 not to be interpreted in a different way, but I think as
 15 this Court said in Christianson, that it should be adapted
 16 to 1338. It should be adapted to 1338 because, under
 17 1295, Congress was interested in getting as many patent
 18 claims to the Federal Circuit as it could. 
 19 QUESTION: But certainly Christianson gave no
 20 intimation that the phrase, arising under, should be
 21 interpreted differently in the statute conferring
 22 jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit as it has
 23 traditionally been in 1331.
 24 MR. GOWDEY: That's correct, Your Honor. 
 25 QUESTION: Is there a difference in interpreting

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 a different way and adapting? 
 2 MR. GOWDEY: I -- I think it's a question of --
 3 of looking at claims that are pled in a case. If -- if
 4 you look at the second point of Chief -- Chief Judge
 5 Markey in Aerojet, he was -- he was taking a -- a look at
 6 claims. And a patent claim, as Justice O'Connor pointed
 7 out earlier, has its own separate, independent
 8 jurisdictional base under 1338. Once you find that a
 9 patent claim comes in under 1338 with its own
 10 jurisdictional basis, under 1295 that is an appeal-
 11 directing mechanism that Congress put into place. 
 12 And -- and I think that if you go again to
 13 Aerojet, as Chief Judge Markey pointed out in his first
 14 reason for why the patent counterclaim should be
 15 considered arising under and give appellate jurisdiction,
 16 had that counterclaim been filed as a complaint, there's
 17 no question that -- that Federal Circuit jurisdiction
 18 would have been invoked. 
 19 QUESTION: But that's -- you can say that by
 20 analogy to 1331 too, that although you can have a -- a
 21 compulsory counterclaim will not change the result there. 
 22 It still goes to Federal court if -- if the well-pleaded
 23 complaint doctrine is applied. You could say, well, the
 24 compulsory counterclaim could have been in its own right a
 25 case of Federal question, but that doesn't change the

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 rule.
 2 MR. GOWDEY: It does not change the rule. I
 3 believe, Your Honor, you're talking about removal cases. 
 4 And certainly if -- if you have --
 5 QUESTION: But why does it make a difference if
 6 we're talking about removal cases? Because the language
 7 is exactly the same.
 8 MR. GOWDEY: Because I think in a
 9 Federal/Federal situation where there is no federalism,
 10 there is no issue with respect to States' rights and
 11 States' claims. And -- and we're not talking about a -- a
 12 reading of 1338 or 1295 where you -- where we're concerned
 13 about somehow taking away the essence of -- of a State
 14 court to deal with State court actions. And -- and we're
 15 not talking about that. This Court does not need to, I
 16 think, even go there. 
 17 We're talking about a situation where you have a
 18 Federal question that has been properly presented in a
 19 Federal court. Original jurisdiction has been applied. A
 20 -- a patent counterclaim comes in that has its own
 21 separate jurisdictional base under 1338. The question
 22 then is, from an appellate standpoint, has Congress set up
 23 and dictated an appellate-directing mechanism with 1295? 
 24 And I think they have. And they recognized when they
 25 said, as long as jurisdiction was based in whole or in

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 part under 1338, that not all of the case would have to be
 2 patent cases. It could be part of it. 
 3 And once you have the nexus between a district
 4 court having original jurisdiction under 1338, 1295
 5 directs that that appeal -- for the patent cases, 1295
 6 directs that appeal should go to the Federal Circuit.
 7 I -- I think the basic purpose of -- of the
 8 well-pleaded complaint rule was -- was to avoid the -- the
 9 sort of State/Federal conflicts. Since that's not here,
 10 then there is -- is no reason to say that there should be
 11 a compelled disregard of -- of counterclaims. And where
 12 Congress' intent was to get as many patent claims as
 13 possible to the Federal Circuit, again --
 14 QUESTION: But you -- you can say, I think, that
 15 when Congress used the term, well-pleaded complaint, its
 16 intent was to have the same sort of analysis as there is
 17 in 1331. 
 18 MR. GOWDEY: I -- I think the language is the
 19 same. But again, going back to what this Court --
 20 QUESTION: Congress didn't use it -- Congress
 21 didn't say well-pleaded complaint. It said -- it said
 22 arising under.
 23 MR. GOWDEY: Yes, Your Honor. 
 24 And I think, as this Court said in Christianson,
 25 by adapting that under 1338, there are -- there is a way

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to accomplish both the jurisdictional goals and the intent
 2 of Congress of getting patent claims --
 3 QUESTION: But you are giving arising under a
 4 different meaning for appellate purposes. You are
 5 including the counterclaim, a different meaning from
 6 original jurisdiction where, as Justice Breyer read,
 7 everybody agrees that for original jurisdiction purposes,
 8 counterclaims don't count.
 9 MR. GOWDEY: I -- I think --
 10 QUESTION: You're suggesting they do count for
 11 appellate jurisdiction.
 12 MR. GOWDEY: I'm suggesting that they do, and
 13 I'm suggesting that Congress recognized that in 1295 where
 14 -- where, unlike petitioner, I -- I think when -- when a
 15 plaintiff comes into court, clearly he has his choice of
 16 -- of what Federal court to go to, what State, and so on. 
 17 Under 1295, once you have patent claims in a case, I think
 18 Congress set up an appellate-directing mechanism that --
 19 that does not make it a litigant's choice. It defines
 20 where it goes. 
 21 QUESTION: Suppose you did do that, which -- I
 22 mean, suppose you took Justice Stevens' concurring view in
 23 Christianson, which was a view that would come closer to
 24 doing what you want. It would make sense. You'd look at
 25 the -- look at the case after it's decided in the district

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 court to see where -- whether there's a patent claim. 
 2 You'd still lose here, wouldn't you? 
 3 MR. GOWDEY: Well, I think Justice Stevens
 4 actually goes farther than we need to go because --
 5 QUESTION: Well, why farther? Because I would
 6 go just as far as he went. You went just as far as he
 7 went. You look at the whole thing after it's decided.
 8 MR. GOWDEY: Well --
 9 QUESTION: Now, how could you go further than
 10 that? 
 11 MR. GOWDEY: Well, I'm saying he -- he went
 12 further. He -- he's saying, I believe, that you could
 13 even look at -- at Federal Circuit jurisdiction being --
 14 being shown where you have amended a complaint later on,
 15 that you could get a patent issue under that -- in at that
 16 point. 
 17 In -- in this case here, there was a patent
 18 issue that came in at the pleading stage. And so that --
 19 that's the distinction that I -- that I would see. That's
 20 why I'm saying you don't have to go so far as -- as to say
 21 you look at the well-tried case.
 22 QUESTION: Was there patents issue adjudicated
 23 at all here? And there was not a judgment. The judgment,
 24 the 54(b) judgment, was on trade dress alone?
 25 MR. GOWDEY: There has not been a patent ruling

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 yet, Your Honor. We didn't get that far. We haven't --
 2 QUESTION: So, there's not only the no judgment,
 3 but no adjudication? 
 4 MR. GOWDEY: No adjudication, not even any
 5 discovery, Your Honor. So -- so, we have a patent -- a
 6 patent case that has, in essence, a -- a very young one,
 7 that has not gotten very far except for the fact that we
 8 have this preliminary injunction from Judge Brown in
 9 Kansas.
 10 QUESTION: I think it would be consistent with
 11 Justice Stevens' opinion to say you look to see what was
 12 adjudicated. His concurring opinion suggests that. And
 13 if what was adjudicated was the patent claim, whether it
 14 were a claim or a counterclaim, then that's what should
 15 count. If what were adjudicated were a trade dress claim,
 16 then that's what should count.
 17 MR. GOWDEY: 1338, however, talks about civil
 18 actions, and civil actions goes -- goes back to a
 19 description of being all claims for relief. We would say
 20 that you should look for the claims that are made for
 21 relief at the time the case is -- is being pled. That is
 22 the point at which I think you should have appellate
 23 jurisdiction being decided so that as interim or
 24 interlocutory appeals happens, you know appellate court it
 25 goes to.

1 If you waited until you -- you saw what was
 2 actually tried in a case and, as Justice Stevens
 3 suggested, you waited even to see if the -- if a complaint
 4 would be amended subsequently after the pleading stage,
 5 earlier -- earlier disposition of interlocutory orders
 6 might go somewhere else, and appropriately so. 
 7 QUESTION: If the district court has to decide
 8 which of two different circuits' laws you're going to
 9 follow, I guess he knows what the case is going to look
 10 like at the end -- or she. Maybe -- maybe the trial judge
 11 doesn't because the trial doesn't know which circuit to
 12 follow, so he doesn't know how it's going to come out. 
 13 MR. GOWDEY: Well, but if -- Your Honor, if --
 14 if --
 15 QUESTION: It's a circular analysis. 
 16 MR. GOWDEY: If -- if you're looking at the
 17 claims that are pled at the pleading stage, the district
 18 court judge will know what appellate court will -- will
 19 apply certainly under the Aerojet rule, which -- which
 20 again would -- would place appellate jurisdiction at the
 21 Federal Circuit if you have a well-pled patent
 22 counterclaim coming in at the pleading stage as part of
 23 the defendant's answer.
 24 QUESTION: But you will -- you will have the
 25 situation then in which the district judge is -- is going

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to have to defy the law of his circuit on a -- on the non-
 2 patent issue.
 3 MR. GOWDEY: Perhaps that's a more difficult
 4 question. I think the Federal Circuit, being a sister --
 5 sister circuit to the rest of the regional circuit courts
 6 of appeal, certainly would make an effort to apply the
 7 appropriate regional circuit law to non-patent issues.
 8 QUESTION: Well, the claim is -- and I -- I will
 9 be candid to say I'm not in a position to -- to evaluate
 10 this claim because I haven't gone back and looked at -- at
 11 many of the cases on it to find out what's really going
 12 on. But I mean, the claim is made that the Federal
 13 Circuit is not doing that.
 14 MR. GOWDEY: Well, I think the Federal Circuit
 15 is making an attempt to look at its -- its historical base
 16 for decisions with respect to those issues that relate to,
 17 in effect, patent law issues. Now, the way I read cases
 18 coming from the Federal Circuit, they're making an attempt
 19 to apply law of their own where they find either there --
 20 there is conflict or where there has not been a well-
 21 grounded set of policies or law to decide an issue. Where
 22 the regional circuit has laws that are not affecting
 23 patents, my reading is the Federal Circuit is applying
 24 regional circuit law in an appropriate way as they see fit
 25 from panel to panel. 

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: That's what it used to do. You say
 2 they -- you think it's still doing that? It's still
 3 following circuit rule on non-patent law issues?
 4 MR. GOWDEY: I think they are, and I think as
 5 the -- the court was started in 1982, and by -- by that
 6 measure, it's a relatively young court. Aerojet has been
 7 around half of its lifetime since 1990.
 8 QUESTION: Well, I understand at the time
 9 Aerojet was decided, they did that. But I thought there
 10 was a recent -- in the last year or 2, they had taken a
 11 different view and were applying their own law as opposed
 12 to the Tenth Circuit law in this case on the non-patent
 13 law issues. 
 14 MR. GOWDEY: Certainly in Midwest, they -- they
 15 were -- they were taking a look at trade dress law because
 16 of the interrelationship trade dress has on the Lanham Act
 17 with patent issues. To that extent, they certainly were
 18 looking at new law and saying where there is an
 19 interaction of laws and holdings with respect to patent
 20 issues, that that is an area that they -- they can and
 21 perhaps should get into. 
 22 QUESTION: But that seems somewhat inconsistent
 23 with the last part of 1295(a), which in effect says that
 24 when it's a non-patent law issue, they -- the 1291 and the
 25 1292 and 1294 shall apply. 

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. GOWDEY: Are you talking about the exception
 2 of 1295, Your Honor? 
 3 QUESTION: Yes. 
 4 MR. GOWDEY: Certainly that's a two-part
 5 exception, and where you have other claims pending, you
 6 can still have jurisdiction under 1338.
 7 QUESTION: Okay. So, now the trial judge has to
 8 say, well, there may be two circuits involved here. One
 9 is my own circuit and it's not related, and so the Federal
 10 Circuit won't control, but if it's somehow related to the
 11 patent claim, then the Federal Circuit would -- so, this
 12 -- this is a further metaphysical exercise. This -- this
 13 is great for the legal profession actually. 
 14 (Laughter.) 
 15 MR. GOWDEY: It keeps all well employed, Your
 16 Honor. 
 17 I -- I think that where -- where there are
 18 issues that relate to patent law, certainly they -- they
 19 will be looking to Federal Circuit precedent to help them. 
 20 Where there are non-patent law issues, it's the regional
 21 circuit law that can and should control. And -- and I
 22 think that as the court develops in time, there will be --
 23 there will be a larger body of law that -- that will help
 24 district circuit judges in that regard. 
 25 As respects this case, however, where -- where

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 we have a patent counterclaim, I think the Aerojet
 2 decision and looking at what went on before Christian --
 3 Christianson, looking at -- at the Christianson decision
 4 itself and the analysis that that court did with Chief
 5 Judge Markey speaking for the whole court en banc, very
 6 carefully and thoughtfully gives a legitimate basis for
 7 why a Federal Circuit should have jurisdiction over cases
 8 where there is a well-pleaded compulsory counterclaim at
 9 the district court level. 
 10 Chief Judge Markey also noted at 895 F.2d at
 11 742, in all events, the Supreme Court did hold in
 12 Christianson or in any other case that for all cases and
 13 circumstances only the complaint and never a counterclaim
 14 can serve as the basis of district court jurisdiction. 
 15 And under section 1295, the basis of district court
 16 jurisdiction is for this Court an appeal-directing
 17 mechanism. And I think that's where 1295 really is -- is
 18 important and the interconnection with -- with 1338.
 19 If there are no other -- no other questions, I
 20 thank the Court.
 21 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gowdey. 
 22 Mr. Dabney, you have 3 minutes remaining. 
 23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY
 24 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 25 MR. DABNEY: In response to your question, Mr.

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Justice Kennedy, there is no difference between different
 2 interpretation and adaptation. The respondent's position
 3 would call for this Court to retreat from Christianson and
 4 to adopt some special interpretation of arising under
 5 unique to 1338(a) that deviates from the arising under
 6 language as it was clearly adopted by Congress in 1295.
 7 Secondly, with regard to the question of -- of
 8 Federal Circuit choice of law, what Mr. Gowdey stood here
 9 -- I just would call -- call Your Honors' attention to
 10 page 94a of the joint appendix which is the district
 11 court's opinion in this case in which the district court
 12 says, Vornado -- that's the respondent -- contends that
 13 this change in the law exception is met because in Midwest
 14 Industries, the Federal Circuit expressly rejected the
 15 Tenth Circuit's Vornado I holding, ruling instead that a
 16 claim for trade dress protection was not barred by the
 17 fact that a product configuration has been claimed as a
 18 significant inventive element of the patent. As part of
 19 its ruling in that case, the Federal Circuit abandoned its
 20 prior practice of applying regional circuit law on
 21 questions involving the relationship between patent law
 22 and other Federal law rights and said, quote, henceforth,
 23 we will apply our own law to such questions. 
 24 There is no doubt whatever that the Federal
 25 Circuit has recently and radically changed how it

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 adjudicates trade dress claims, and it was the opportunity
 2 to try to take advantage of the -- of the Federal
 3 Circuit's view of trade dress protection which was before
 4 the Court in the TrafFix case, and rejected by the Court
 5 in the TrafFix case, which drove the case that's currently
 6 before the Court, which isn't to say that the Federal
 7 Circuit can't do that. But by doing that, whatever
 8 legitimacy could have been before it, even as a matter of
 9 common sense, Justice Scalia, in derogation of clearly
 10 expressed congressional intent, in 1989, the Federal
 11 Circuit has done a 180 degree U-turn in its approach to
 12 its choice of law in these matters. And therefore, the --
 13 a critical underpinning of the Aerojet principle has been
 14 completely wiped out.
 15 QUESTION: You're -- you're telling us that this
 16 is unqualified. I think Mr. Gowdey said that the
 17 relationship language is -- that it's -- it's only in the
 18 intersection of patent law, not just any -- any question
 19 that comes along. 
 20 MR. DABNEY: That -- it is the issue that was
 21 before this Court in the TrafFix case. It is a question
 22 of how far State law, how far Federal law can properly go
 23 in allowing a company like the respondent to claim
 24 unregistered, judge-made --
 25 QUESTION: And I don't see what the Federal

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Circuit meant when it said the relationship between patent
 2 law and other Federal rights.
 3 MR. DABNEY: The Federal --
 4 QUESTION: Questions involving the relationship
 5 between those two. The Federal Circuit has interpreted
 6 that to be unlimited? 
 7 MR. DABNEY: The Federal Circuit has taken the
 8 position that -- I'm sorry. My time is up. May I answer
 9 the question? 
 10 QUESTION: Yes, briefly.
 11 MR. DABNEY: The Federal Circuit has taken the
 12 position that Federal patent law does not create any right
 13 to copy or use anything, and therefore, it was wrong for
 14 the Court in Midwest to say that Iowa State law could not
 15 protect that. 
 16 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Dabney.
 17 The case is submitted. 
 18 (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the
 19 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
