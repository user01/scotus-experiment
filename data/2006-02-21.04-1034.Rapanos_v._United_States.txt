2 (10:12 a.m.)

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Rapanos v. United States and

5 Carabell v. the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

6 Mr. Hopper.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. REED HOPPER

8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1034

9 MR. HOPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

10 the Court:

11 This is a case of agency overreaching. In

12 this case, the Corps and EPA pushed the very limits of

13 congressional authority, contrary to the plain text of

14 the act and without any clear indication Congress

15 intended that result. They claim 404(a) jurisdiction

16 over the entire tributary system, from the smallest

17 trickle to the largest watershed, swapping in --

18 sweeping in remote, non-navigable wetlands 20 miles

19 from the traditional navigable water.

20 This limitless claim of jurisdiction shifts

21 the Federal/State balance and raises significant

22 constitutional questions. We believe this boundless

23 interpretation is inconsistent with this Court's

24 reading of the act in Solid Waste Agency.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It goes somewhat beyond the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 smallest trickle? Doesn't it? Doesn't it also include

2 ditches that currently don't have any trickle if they

3 obtain a trickle during a rainstorm?

4 MR. HOPPER: Yes, Your Honor. They actually

5 argued that it -- it makes no difference whether there

6 -- what the substantiality is or the directness of the

7 connection is. It's irrelevant to the jurisdictional

8 determination.

9 And as I said, they -- the -- the agencies

10 assert jurisdiction over even the entire watershed.

11 For example, the Mississippi watershed, the largest in

12 the Nation, covers 1 million square acre -- 1 million

13 square miles and reaches from the Rockies to the

14 Appalachians and drains 41 percent of the 48 lower

15 States.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So where would you --

17 where would -- where would you put the line?

18 MR. HOPPER: I'd put the line where Congress

19 put the line, Your Honor. Congress declared in 404(a)

20 that it would prohibit the discharge of fill and

21 dredged material into the navigable waters. So the --

22 these agencies can permit or prohibit any discharge, no

23 matter where it occurs, so long as it reaches a

24 navigable water. That would be the --

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then -- but you were

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- you are including at least wetlands that abut --

2 MR. HOPPER: Yes.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- navigable water.

4 MR. HOPPER: Yes. Traditional navigable

5 waters plus abutting wetlands inseparably bound up.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about major

7 tributaries?

8 MR. HOPPER: Congress cannot regulate all

9 tributaries. It could regulate some tributaries --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which ones?

11 MR. HOPPER: -- but would have to do so on a

12 case-by-case basis. The regulation of all tributaries

13 raises significant constitutional questions and

14 contrary to the regulation of -- of wetlands that are

15 inseparably bound up. And there's no clear indication

16 that Congress intended to regulate any tributaries, let

17 alone the entire tributary system.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, is your position no

19 tributaries or some tributaries?

20 MR. HOPPER: The -- the act, by its terms,

21 does not recognize the -- the regulation of any

22 tributary. It does --

23 JUSTICE ALITO: Does it make sense to say

24 that any wetlands that it abuts a traditionally

25 navigable water is covered, but a tributary that leads

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 right into a traditionally navigable water is not

2 necessarily covered?

3 MR. HOPPER: I think -- I think it's fair to

4 say that under this Court's determination in Solid

5 Waste Agency that the only wetlands that are covered

6 are those that are abutting and inseparably bound up.

7 It makes sense to do so because by regulating those

8 types of wetlands, the Government is essentially

9 declaring them the equivalent of the navigable

10 waterway.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but they're doing it

12 for a functional reason. The functional reason is that

13 if you put the poison in the adjacent wetland, it's

14 going to get into the navigable water. Exactly the

15 same argument can be made as you go further and further

16 up the tributaries, and it seems to me that once you

17 concede, as I think you have to, that there can be a

18 regulation that goes beyond literally navigable water

19 at the point at which the -- the pollutant is added,

20 then you have to follow the same logic right up through

21 the watershed to -- to any point at which a pollutant,

22 once added, will eventually get into the navigable

23 water.

24 MR. HOPPER: The reason that logic does not

25 apply, Your Honor, is because the regulation of -- of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 tributaries raises significant constitutional questions

2 that are not implicated by the regulation of a wetland

3 inseparably --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then you have to

5 accept the fact that -- that Congress cannot

6 effectively regulate the navigable -- the -- the

7 condition of the navigable water itself because if all

8 the -- the -- let's -- let's assume there's a class of

9 -- of evil polluters out there who just want to wreck

10 the -- the navigable waters of the United States. All

11 they have to do is get far enough upstream and they can

12 dump anything they want to. It will eventually get

13 into the navigable water, and Congress can't do

14 anything about it on your theory.

15 MR. HOPPER: That's incorrect, Your Honor.

16 We acknowledge that under the -- the act, the

17 Government can regulate any discharge that actually

18 reaches the navigable water.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're -- you're going to

20 -- you -- you then want to draw a distinction between

21 the dredge and fill addition and, let's say, a -- a

22 conventional synthetic poison.

23 MR. HOPPER: No. Either -- in either case,

24 if -- if the -- if the discharge of dredged material

25 actually enters into a navigable water, regardless of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 where it's discharged, it would be covered. Same for a

2 conventional toxin.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: You mean on -- on -- in

4 every -- in every case then, I mean, Congress would

5 have to -- I'm sorry -- a scientist would have to

6 analyze the molecules and -- and trace them up, and so

7 long as they could -- could trace it to a specific

8 discharge, they could get at it, but otherwise they

9 couldn't? I mean, that -- you know, you know what I'm

10 getting at. That obviously would -- would totally

11 thwart the regulation.

12 MR. HOPPER: I don't -- I don't believe it

13 would, Your Honor. The -- the -- certainly Congress

14 did not think so in section --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Couldn't you simply assume

16 that anything that is discharged into a tributary

17 ultimately goes where the tributary goes? Wouldn't it

18 be enough to prove the discharge?

19 MR. HOPPER: Well, it certainly wasn't true

20 in this case, Your Honor. The --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you don't think it would

22 be enough for the -- for the Government to prove the

23 discharge into a tributary in order to prove that the

24 act has been violated.

25 MR. HOPPER: No, Your Honor, I do not.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: You really think it has to

2 trace the molecules.

3 MR. HOPPER: Absolutely. That's -- that's

4 what the terms of the act require.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you -- how do

6 you define a tributary?

7 MR. HOPPER: Well, the -- that's one of the

8 problems here, Your Honor, is that -- is that the

9 agency has -- has established a moving target for --

10 for tributaries.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what's your

12 definition?

13 MR. HOPPER: Well, the -- the definitions

14 we're working with here, to which we object, is that --

15 is that it includes anything in the hydrological

16 connection.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know what you

18 object to, and I know that you think your client isn't

19 covered. But I don't know what test you would have us

20 adopt for what constitutes a tributary.

21 MR. HOPPER: Well, we're suggesting that --

22 that this Court need not define tributary because under

23 the act all tributaries are excluded. The only -- the

24 only prohibited act --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, but we

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 still don't know what you're excluding. I mean, the

2 Missouri is a tributary of the Mississippi, but I

3 assume it's still covered.

4 MR. HOPPER: Those -- anything that is not of

5 a -- anything does not constitute the channel, the

6 traditional navigable water, and anything not abutting

7 as a -- as a inseparably bound up wetland would

8 constitute a tributary.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it -- it seems to me

10 that what works in your favor is -- is it SWANCC? I

11 don't -- I'm not quite sure how to pronounce the case.

12 MR. HOPPER: Yes.

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Migratory Bird Rule

14 case where we said there had to be a significant nexus.

15 But I think what the Court is asking you is -- is how

16 to define significant nexus. We're -- if you want us

17 just to say, well, this case is too much, but then the

18 Corps of Engineers should use its expertise to come up

19 with a new regulation, that's rather an odd opinion for

20 us to write.

21 MR. HOPPER: Well, this Court did not --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that

23 that's what you're asking us to do here.

24 MR. HOPPER: This Court did not suggest in --

25 in SWANCC that a significant nexus constitutes the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jurisdictional standard for all -- for all waters.

2 That standard only applies to wetlands that are

3 adjacent to traditional navigable waters.

4 The jurisdictional standard is determined by

5 the terms of the act. In -- in SWANCC, this Court

6 determined that the act was clear and should be read as

7 written to avoid the constitutional questions raised by

8 a broad interpretation of the act. As written --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: From everything -- from

10 everything you said, it sounds like you're -- you're

11 taking issue with Riverside Bayview because if a

12 wetland adjacent to the river counts, then why not a

13 stream that goes right into it? What sense does that

14 distinction make?

15 MR. HOPPER: It makes perfect sense, Your

16 Honor, because the regulation of those tributaries and

17 streams, all of them in the entire tributary system,

18 raise significant constitutional questions that are not

19 implicated by regulating wetlands that are inseparably

20 bound up with traditional navigable water.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: More than that, Mr. Hopper.

22 I thought and I had expected you to -- to respond to

23 Justice Souter's question this way, his question about

24 how come putting poison in -- in the wetlands is bad,

25 but it's okay to put it in the tributary. But they --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 as I understand it, the reason we held wetlands were

2 included within the waters of the United States was not

3 -- not that, that you could poison the waters by

4 poisoning the wetlands, but rather, it was that it's

5 very hard to tell where the navigable water ends and

6 the wetland begins. And -- and we said, you know,

7 we're not going to parse that. If it's -- if it's

8 adjacent to a navigable water and it's wet, we're going

9 to say it's part of a navigable water.

10 MR. HOPPER: That's right.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was our

12 basis.

13 MR. HOPPER: That's exactly right.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And, of course, that basis

15 doesn't apply to tributaries, does it? You -- you can

16 always tell where the tributary ends. It ends at the

17 point where it goes into the main river.

18 MR. HOPPER: I think that's correct, Your

19 Honor.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You think that's correct

21 about what the Court said in Bayview when it phrased

22 the question as before discharging fill material into

23 wetlands adjacent to navigable bodies of water and

24 their tributaries. That's what the Court thought it

25 was deciding in Riverside Bayview.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HOPPER: The Court did frame the question

2 that way, Your Honor. However, the Court's commentary

3 about tributaries was not germane to its -- to its

4 holding. Tributaries was not a question before the

5 Court.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: At any rate, they could

7 not have been making the distinction Justice Scalia

8 suggested if, at least in the Court's thinking, the

9 tributaries rolled right into the navigable body.

10 MR. HOPPER: Well, as I said, the -- the

11 Court's commentary in Riverside Bayview is not good law

12 because the -- the Court was not addressing the -- a

13 tributary's question in that case, and it was not faced

14 with a Commerce Clause challenge as it is in this case.

15 And at that time, the agency did not interpret

16 tributaries to include every hydrological reach of the

17 -- of the tributary system.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but doesn't the

19 reference to tributary make it relatively plain that

20 what the Court was getting at was the impossibility of

21 drawing a functional distinction between wetlands and

22 tributaries on the one hand, navigable waters on the

23 other, when the purpose of the regulation is to protect

24 the purity of the ultimate navigable water? And isn't

25 the inclusion of the reference to tributaries an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 indication that it said if we want to attain the

2 objective, which is clearly constitutional, then we

3 have got to recognize these means, i.e., regulation of

4 -- of pollution in wetlands and tributaries, in order

5 to reach that objective? Isn't that the reasoning that

6 is apparent from what Justice Ginsburg just -- just

7 read to you?

8 MR. HOPPER: I don't believe so, Your Honor.

9 The -- the problem that -- that the agencies have in

10 this case, which was underscored in Solid Waste Agency,

11 is that the Government cannot show any clear indication

12 that Congress intended to regulate the entire tributary

13 system. In Solid Waste Agency, this Court did

14 recognize that because of congressional acquiescence,

15 Congress intended to regulate wetlands adjacent to

16 navigable waters, but as to other waters, this Court

17 could come to no conclusion because the Congress had

18 never defined other waters.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's -- except for the

20 -- it seems to me except for -- for your -- your

21 argument is -- is fine except for one problem. And

22 that is, if we -- if we assume that Congress was being

23 as -- as cautious as you suggest, then Congress'

24 caution, in effect, was -- was allowing an end run

25 around the regulation for the reasons we went into a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 moment ago. All you've got to do is -- is dump the

2 pollutant further -- far enough upstream in the

3 watershed and you get away scot-free. And it's very

4 difficult to believe that Congress could have intended

5 that.

6 MR. HOPPER: I don't think it's difficult to

7 believe that at all, Your Honor. We simply look at --

8 at the goals and objectives that Congress itself

9 adopted in furtherance of this mission to protect the

10 waters. If we look at 1251(a), Congress declares that

11 its purpose is to protect the integrity of the Nation's

12 waters. It used that term, Nation's waters. And then

13 in -- in 1251(a)(1), it says it will accomplish this by

14 eliminating the discharge of pollutants into the

15 navigable waters, showing that it knows how to

16 distinguish between all waters and navigable waters.

17 And then in 1251(b), Congress says we will respect and

18 defer to the States' primary responsibility to address

19 local water pollution and to manage local land and

20 water use. So the way that Congress intended to

21 address this issue was to defer to the States to

22 regulate pollutants upstream while Congress -- or while

23 the Federal Government regulates downstream. That's a

24 perfectly rational approach to this national problem.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if -- but your --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 but your answer earlier to Justice Souter's earlier

2 question was that if you dump the pollutants anywhere

3 and they make their way to the navigable water, you're

4 covered. Right?

5 MR. HOPPER: Are covered if they make it --

6 their way all the way there. If they don't, then the

7 States have that responsibility. And every State in

8 the Nation has antipollution regulation.

9 If there are no further questions, I'd like

10 to reserve my time.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

12 Mr. Stoepker.

13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. STOEPKER

14 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1384

15 MR. STOEPKER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it

16 please the Court:

17 After years of review by the State of

18 Michigan and the Respondent, the record is very clear.

19 Petitioners' wetland is hydrologically isolated from

20 any navigable water of the United States.

21 Further, the State of Michigan, exercising

22 the power specifically and traditionally reserved to

23 it, undertook responsibility to regulate the waters at

24 issue and pollution and, in doing so, issued Petitioner

25 a wetland permit.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 It is clear from the record in this case that

2 there is no hydrological connection between the

3 Petitioners' wetland and navigable waters of the United

4 States. Referring to the appendix filed, the joint

5 appendix filed in this case, specifically beginning

6 with the EPA letters dating back to 1994, as this

7 property has been under years of review, do not

8 reference any such connection.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did we talk about a

10 hydrological connection in Riverside Bayview?

11 MR. STOEPKER: The -- the connection there

12 was -- in essence, yes, Your Honor, based upon the

13 inseparable, bound-up nature of those wetlands which

14 were immediately adjacent to the navigable water.

15 There was nothing that separated those wetlands from

16 that specific body of water. They were immediately

17 adjacent and intersected with that body of water.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure what you mean

19 by a hydrological connection. Do you mean a constant

20 -- a constant body of water between the two, or do you

21 mean simply a -- a drain that at some times might carry

22 off rainwater from -- from this land? And -- would

23 that -- would that suffice to be a hydrological

24 connection?

25 MR. STOEPKER: In -- in this case, Your

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Honor, there was no connection at all. In this case,

2 there was no connection identified. It was speculated

3 that there might be a potential --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Water never ran off of this

5 -- of this land.

6 MR. STOEPKER: No. If you look -- that is

7 correct. If you look at the circuit court opinion, it

8 -- and even the district court opinion and the findings

9 made, there is no finding that any water has ever left

10 the Petitioners' wetland into the ditch.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do they have to make

12 this on a plot-by-plot basis, or can they make a

13 categorical judgment that even in cases in which, you

14 know, there's a berm, as there is here, when the water

15 is high, it spills over? And if the categorical

16 judgment is sound, do you have an exception because

17 they haven't proven it with respect to your particular

18 lot?

19 MR. STOEPKER: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. In --

20 in this case --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where do you get that

22 exception?

23 MR. STOEPKER: In the Respondents' brief on

24 page 18, they acknowledge that the traditional test has

25 been hydrological connection, that that's what they

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 have looked towards.

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the -- and the -- but I

3 mean, what I'm getting at is the traditional test is

4 the basis for a categorical judgment. Your land falls

5 within the general category. Your argument is I should

6 not be subject to it, to the statute, because of the

7 general category. I should be subject to it only if

8 they prove specifically that the water spills over in

9 rainy periods in my particular lot. In other words,

10 you're saying there's got to be a specific connection

11 as opposed to a categorical judgment. And my question

12 is what under the act supports that view.

13 MR. STOEPKER: Under the act, it talks about

14 the issue of discharge. That is the -- that is the

15 matter that is being regulated by the statute, an

16 actual discharge into the navigable body of water. If

17 you have an hydrologically isolated body of water, you

18 cannot physically have a discharge into the navigable

19 stream. It is an impossibility. And therefore, the

20 act does not allow the speculation that the Court is

21 referring to here.

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so your -- maybe what

23 you're saying is we have shown or the record shows that

24 this doesn't fit within the category because it never

25 spills over or whatever. Is that your argument?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. STOEPKER: That is correct. The record

2 in this case does not identify a connection between

3 this wetland and this non-navigable ditch.

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stoepker, your

6 friend, Mr. Hopper, would certainly not agree with you

7 that -- that a -- a hydrological connection is the,

8 quote, traditional test. What -- what is your

9 definition of tradition?

10 MR. STOEPKER: Our definition --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: How long has this test been

12 established?

13 MR. STOEPKER: If you look at Respondents'

14 brief in their arguments to this Court, they first

15 state, page 18, that in fact traditionally they've

16 looked at hydrological connection. Second, they --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Traditionally.

18 MR. STOEPKER: Traditionally.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes --

20 MR. STOEPKER: From the inception of the

21 rules.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: From the inception of the

23 rules.

24 MR. STOEPKER: Inception of the rules, that

25 they have looked at hydrological connection.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That that alone has been

2 enough.

3 MR. STOEPKER: No. They state that that is

4 the -- the beginning point. The beginning point.

5 They then state that they have historically

6 undertook a interrelationship analysis of the wetland

7 to the tributary or body of water and that they then

8 defer that to the permit review.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. So you're -- you're

10 not conceding that -- that hydrologic -- hydrological

11 connection is adequate. You're just -- is sufficient.

12 You're just saying it's necessary.

13 MR. STOEPKER: We're -- that is correct, Your

14 Honor.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to the

17 question earlier? What is a hydrological connection?

18 Is it enough if the water seeps through the ground and

19 underground is connected with the navigable water, or

20 does there have to be a ditch or -- or a culvert that

21 you can see the water flowing through?

22 MR. STOEPKER: Yes, Your Honor. The --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes?

24 MR. STOEPKER: Mr. Chief Justice, in -- in

25 response to that question, both potentially. In this

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 case, again, there was no surface water connection, and

2 due to the nature of the clay soils, it was found that

3 there was no groundwater connection --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it -- was it also clear

5 that after the improvement, there would be no drainage?

6 MR. STOEPKER: After the improvement, there

7 could be drainage. Ironically the Respondent in this

8 case actually recommends that the barriers between this

9 site and the ditch be removed.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask one

11 clarifying question? Was it found that there was no

12 connection, or was it not found that there was a

13 connection?

14 MR. STOEPKER: It was found that there was

15 not a connection.

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: It was. I didn't read it

17 that way.

18 MR. STOEPKER: If you -- referring the Court

19 to the Respondents' report dated May 5th of 2000, it

20 specifically states --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where are you reading from?

22 MR. STOEPKER: This is from appendix page 81

23 and 83. This is a report that starts with the term

24 jurisdictional at the top.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. STOEPKER: It notes a number of issues or

2 classifications there or points. First, that the

3 wetland is not adjacent to navigable water. It then

4 notes the wetland is not adjacent to headwater. And

5 then it makes a comment. It says, to a tributary to

6 navigable water, and it says, no.

7 The sole basis for jurisdiction in that

8 report is the Migratory Bird Rule. The Respondent took

9 out to the property who they believed to be the most

10 credible expert they had on migratory birds and then

11 state that the --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm sorry. I want to be

13 sure I follow you. You say that somewhere on page 82

14 there is a finding that there was no hydrological

15 connection?

16 MR. STOEPKER: They do not reference a -- I'm

17 -- this --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: They don't find a --

19 MR. STOEPKER: Right. They do -- they do

20 not.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: I agree with that. I'm

22 asking you if they found there was no hydrological

23 connection.

24 MR. STOEPKER: Yes, they make that in a

25 subsequent report.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: But not on page 82.

2 MR. STOEPKER: Not -- not in this first

3 report.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is the report in the -- is

5 the subsequent report in the record somewhere?

6 MR. STOEPKER: Yes. The next report is

7 issued September 11th of 2000. In that report --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: And again, where --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: What page are you on?

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where are you?

11 MR. STOEPKER: I'm going to refer you to the

12 specific pages.

13 They first referenced clay soils on page 93.

14 These are the same clay soils that the State

15 administrative law judge, after much hearing on the

16 record, found were impermeable to prevent groundwater

17 and surface water discharge.

18 Then at page 97 of the appendix, the

19 Respondent finds that due to site conditions -- I will

20 quote -- this wetland has been obstructed from

21 receiving runoff from surrounding area and from

22 circulation by flooding into the drain. End of quote.

23 Then referring to page 99 of the same

24 appendix, I quote. The parcel is not currently a part

25 of the S-O Drain watershed, being the Sutherland-Oemig

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 watershed.

2 Then referring to page 100 where they comment

3 on navigation, they state, no impact on navigation.

4 And then finally at page 106 of the appendix,

5 the features on this site -- and again I quote --

6 presently isolate the wetland from the S-O Drain and

7 receiving waters.

8 So it receives none and it gives none. They

9 used the term in their report isolated. There is no

10 finding anywhere to the contrary in any reports issued,

11 or thereafter at the public hearing that was conducted

12 by the Respondent, that there is any connection. In

13 fact, the Sixth Circuit noted there was no connection.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then what was the reason

15 they gave for rejecting the permit?

16 MR. STOEPKER: The -- the sole reason claimed

17 for jurisdiction at the agency hearing was adjacency to

18 this non-navigable, unnamed ditch, which was dug by the

19 county for a sewer system. That's the sole reason.

20 The same argument appeared at the district court level,

21 adjacency to the unnamed, unnavigable ditch.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I'm still not clear as

25 to what the findings were, if there were findings, as

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to what the condition would be after the improvement.

2 Would there be an increased likelihood of drainage into

3 the ditch after the improvement?

4 MR. STOEPKER: The -- it -- it could occur in

5 two different ways.

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and if that were so,

7 would that be sufficient for jurisdiction?

8 MR. STOEPKER: They -- that -- that was not

9 their finding because in this case they actually

10 recommended, whether or not anything occurred on the

11 property, that the berms or barriers be removed. They

12 actually recommend there be an interaction between the

13 wetland and the ditch. That's the irony of this.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, well -- suppose the

15 interaction were automatic. Would that suffice to make

16 this a wetlands after the improvement?

17 MR. STOEPKER: It -- it is our position in

18 this case no because the ditch next to the site has not

19 been regulated under the rules adopted by the

20 Respondent and -- nor under the statute adopted by

21 Congress. The ditch is -- has been historically

22 designated as a point source or a source point, as has

23 been the drain under the statute.

24 In 1975, after the district court ruled that

25 the Respondent's rules were too narrow from a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jurisdictional standpoint, the Respondent then expanded

2 its rules in 1975. In the preamble to those rules, it

3 specifically stated that ditches -- ditches of this

4 nature, drainage ditches, were specifically exempted as

5 waters of the United States. That is in the preamble.

6 We then go to 19 --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what -- what

8 is the test that you would have us adopt for a

9 significant nexus?

10 MR. STOEPKER: Our -- our test for

11 significant nexus would start with the -- the basis

12 that there must be an established, existing

13 hydrological connection between the wetland and the

14 body of water adjacent --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: By that, you mean

16 either a ditch or underground seepage?

17 MR. STOEPKER: Yes.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So there has

19 -- there has to be any -- and any hydrological

20 connection works.

21 MR. STOEPKER: Based --

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Hopper won't like

23 that, but for --

24 MR. STOEPKER: No.

25 (Laughter.)

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. STOEPKER: Using this Court's definition

2 in -- in SWANCC, it's -- it is our position that it

3 needs to be a substantial nexus or interrelationship.

4 We're saying --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't

6 have to define what -- everything that's necessary.

7 All you have to define is one indispensable element.

8 And all you're arguing is that a hydrological

9 connection is an indispensable element, whatever

10 additional elements --

11 MR. STOEPKER: That is correct.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- there may be. So you may

13 agree with your friend, Mr. Hopper.

14 MR. STOEPKER: We're --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you just haven't

16 reached that point. Right?

17 MR. STOEPKER: We don't -- we do not believe

18 that this case needs to reach that --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm still puzzled --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want to set you two

21 to fighting with each other.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- by your answer to

23 Justice --

24 (Laughter.)

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Justice Kennedy. What

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 if there's no hydrological connection today, but there

2 would be after you -- after you built your project?

3 MR. STOEPKER: At that point, then maybe the

4 Respondent could determine there would be some form of

5 regulation if, in fact, the discharge was into a ditch

6 that was, in fact, regulated. And --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it -- would it be a

8 sufficient reason to deny a permit based on the

9 judgment that after the project is completed, there

10 will be a -- a hydrological connection?

11 MR. STOEPKER: The test is from the outset,

12 Your Honor.

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. It seems to me you

14 could answer that yes or no.

15 MR. STOEPKER: Yes. No.

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Perhaps you don't want to

17 but --

18 (Laughter.)

19 MR. STOEPKER: The -- the resulting impact --

20 I would say no. The resulting impact has not been

21 determined for jurisdiction.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it sort of

23 foolish to say that we're concerned about pollution,

24 but only if you -- only if you catch it in advance?

25 That doesn't make sense because if the problem would

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 arise when you did what you're seeking a permit to do,

2 why shouldn't you be denied the permit?

3 MR. STOEPKER: The application for the permit

4 does not automatically equate to a request to

5 discharge. The fill of a wetland does not

6 automatically discharge into the ditch.

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but my hypothesis is

8 that we know it would happen, or they -- they would

9 find it would happen after the project is completed.

10 And it seems to me that -- that that's what you should

11 focus on rather than what's -- you know, rather than

12 what happens before.

13 MR. STOEPKER: This Court's test in SWANCC is

14 based upon the before, and also based upon Riverside,

15 it examined the before condition and the impact on that

16 navigable water. And what is to be prevented is the

17 discharge into that navigable water. And that is the

18 initial test that is conducted.

19 If the Court examines the Respondent's actual

20 test data, what they examined here was the

21 jurisdictional determination from the beginning. Is

22 there a connection? Is it isolated? Is it not

23 isolated? They didn't look at the after-effect. They

24 looked at the after-effect in relationship to issuing

25 or not issuing the permit.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: What we're talking about

2 here is -- is at -- at most, whether this is a water of

3 the United States. The condition for requiring permits

4 is that it -- it be a water of the United States.

5 Isn't that right?

6 MR. STOEPKER: That is correct.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it either is or it

8 isn't, not -- not that it will be. It either is or it

9 isn't. If it is, you -- you need a permit; if it

10 isn't, you don't need a permit.

11 MR. STOEPKER: That is correct.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: And Justice Stevens'

13 question I think in -- in that framework is -- is this.

14 If it will result in discharge after the project, is

15 it a water of the United States now?

16 MR. STOEPKER: Under the Court's definition

17 in SWANCC and Riverside, the answer again is no.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then Congress has

19 passed a statute that says we'll lock the barn after

20 the horse is stolen. I mean, that -- maybe that's what

21 it did, but that's -- that would be a very odd thing

22 for it to do, wouldn't it?

23 MR. STOEPKER: It did not do so, Your Honor,

24 because specifically under section 1251(b), it reserved

25 to the States the primary responsibility of regulating

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 pollution within its waters. The primary

2 responsibility. That primary responsibility is not

3 designated to the Respondent in this case. A shift

4 would -- in -- in that framework would shift the

5 primary responsibility to the Respondent and take that

6 primary responsibility away from the State.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- it would do so

8 in -- in cases of -- I guess, of the -- the sorts of --

9 of new proposed actions that require the -- the Corps

10 to get into it in the first place. But I also assume

11 that it would leave lots of -- of water pollution

12 regulation to the States. I don't see that it would

13 displace the States.

14 MR. STOEPKER: In this case, it actually --

15 the decision of the Respondent did displace the State.

16 The State, after years of examination and

17 determination of impact, made a decision to issue a

18 wetland permit to this project and, in doing so, found

19 specifically that the issuance of the permit would be

20 better, effective method of dealing with pollution than

21 not issuing the permit. That was the specific finding

22 made by the administrative law judge in that appendix,

23 and those findings are the first part of the appendix

24 in this case, detailed findings after a 2-week

25 administrative trial where witnesses were cross-

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 examined and examined.

2 In this case, the Respondent has ignored

3 those State powers given to its traditional waters and

4 has said, we're going to ignore, number one, your claim

5 of jurisdiction, and number two, we're going to ignore

6 your finding of no impact and completely disregard

7 that.

8 So, in fact, the framework in this case did

9 shift. The State did what it was supposed to do under

10 1251(b) and the -- the Respondent in this case usurped

11 that responsibility and those traditional powers

12 granted to it traditionally and both by this statute,

13 and then determined that what the State of Michigan did

14 had no relevance. It was unwarranted. So the

15 framework in this case did specifically change.

16 And in doing so, we get back to those same

17 factual findings they've made. We are here only today

18 because they found that it is adjacent to a ditch which

19 they have said is not a waters of the United States.

20 So in this case, the --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the only reason it's a

22 water of the United States is that there are some

23 puddles on this land. Right? And if there were no

24 puddles, it -- it wouldn't be a water of the United

25 States. It would just be land of the United States.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. STOEPKER: That's correct, because

2 there's some puddles on the land occasionally.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it -- it becomes waters

4 of the United States because there are puddles on it,

5 and you assert because those puddles have some

6 hydrological connection or if it is -- if it is water

7 of the United States, those puddles have some

8 hydrological connections with the navigable waters.

9 MR. STOEPKER: To -- to be waters of the

10 United States, they would have to have a hydrological

11 connection as a minimum test to be a part of the waters

12 of the United States.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the -- the

14 statute only prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill

15 material, which is what is going on here, into the

16 navigable waters, right, at specified disposal sites.

17 I'm sorry. The -- the permits that -- that are

18 required here --

19 MR. STOEPKER: That is correct.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- permit discharge into

21 waters, not -- not into lands that aren't waters.

22 MR. STOEPKER: No. The -- that is correct.

23 The permit permits the discharge into a navigable water

24 of the United States. That is the object of the

25 permit.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Again, the rules that the Respondent has

2 adopted since 1975 have specifically excluded the

3 Nundane ditch, as well as the drain next to that ditch,

4 as being defined as waters of the United States. So

5 therefore, even if they could show a connection, which

6 is a question that has been raised, would in fact the

7 wetland be regulated, by the -- by the Respondents' own

8 definitions and by the statutory definition which

9 excludes a ditch and a drain under section 1262(12) and

10 (14), neither the ditch or the Sutherland-Oemig drain

11 by definition is a water of the United States. It is a

12 point source and therefore not a water. So even if

13 they could --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask one question

15 about your -- your not -- no hydrological connection?

16 If this berm were next to a wetland that would

17 otherwise be adjacent to a river, the situation that

18 was presented in Riverside Bayview, is it the berm that

19 prevents there being a hydrological connection?

20 MR. STOEPKER: In this case, there are two

21 things. The first, the berm segregates the surface

22 water connection between the two, and then second, the

23 nature of the soils being clay, which are not permeable

24 soils, create the additional segregation between that

25 and the body of water.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it could -- there could

2 be a situation where the wetlands would be right next

3 to the river, but there's a berm in between, and that

4 would break the hydrological connection?

5 MR. STOEPKER: It would break the

6 hydrological connection. However, this Court has ruled

7 in the Riverside case that those wetlands which are

8 adjacent to navigable waters -- it did not reach the

9 issue whether they were not adjacent to non-navigable

10 waters. They only addressed the -- this Court only

11 addressed the issue of relationship to navigable

12 waters. In that case, this Court specifically found

13 that wetlands adjacent to navigable waters were

14 regulated.

15 The Court specifically reserved the --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it -- do you

17 think it mean adjacent with a berm in between? I -- I

18 thought the reason they -- they reached that conclusion

19 was you can't tell where the navigable water ends and

20 where the wetland begins. I -- I thought they assumed

21 a connection between the two.

22 MR. STOEPKER: In reading the opinion -- Your

23 Honor, my time is up.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may respond

25 briefly.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. STOEPKER: Yes.

2 In reading the opinion, it -- it appears

3 that this Court found, because it actually went to the

4 water's edge, there was an inseparable, bound-up

5 attachment between the wetland and the navigable water.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

7 MR. STOEPKER: Thank you.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Clement.

9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

10 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

11 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12 please the Court:

13 In United States against Riverside Bayview

14 Homes, this Court unanimously upheld the Corps'

15 jurisdiction over wetlands that were not themselves

16 navigable, but were adjacent to waters otherwise within

17 the Corps' jurisdiction.

18 The principal difference between the Rapanos

19 wetlands and the wetlands at issue in Riverside Bayview

20 are that the Rapanos wetlands are adjacent to a non-

21 navigable tributary, while the wetlands at issue in

22 Riverside Bayview were adjacent to a navigable creek.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you define

24 tributary?

25 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The tributary -- you

2 say they're adjacent to a nonnavigable tributary.

3 That's a -- a culvert, a ditch. Right?

4 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, not in all these cases,

5 Mr. Chief Justice.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in Rapanos'

7 case.

8 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, not -- not -- that's

9 actually not true. There are three specific wetlands

10 that are at issue in the Rapanos case. One of those,

11 the Pine River site, as its name suggests, is adjacent

12 to the Pine River, which is a body of water that has

13 water flowing through it all year-round. It's a river.

14 I don't think anybody would look at that and say

15 that's not a tributary of the downstream navigable

16 rivers. And I think that's why, in fairness --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what

18 about the other -- the other sites?

19 GENERAL CLEMENT: The -- the other sites are --

20 are adjacent to man-made ditches that also drain in.

21 If I just -- can I just say, though, I think

22 the fact that the Pine River site is so obviously a

23 tributary under -- under any definition is one of the

24 reasons, along with the theory that you heard advanced

25 by Petitioners, that this case --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your argument

2 assumes that the ditches that go to the other two sites

3 are also tributaries.

4 GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.

5 I just want to make the point that this case, because

6 of the theory Petitioners have advanced, has not really

7 unearthed or focused on the definition of a tributary,

8 but let me get to it because the Corps has defined the

9 definition of a tributary. And the definition of a

10 tributary is basically any channelized body of water

11 that takes water in a flow down to the traditional

12 navigable water --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even when it's not a body of

14 water.

15 GENERAL CLEMENT: Even --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: A storm drain, even -- even

17 when it's not filled with water, is a tributary.

18 Right?

19 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, absolutely.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

21 GENERAL CLEMENT: The Corps has not drawn a

22 distinction between man-made channels or ditches and

23 natural channels or ditches. And, of course, it would

24 be very absurd for the Corps to do that since the Erie

25 Canal is a ditch.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suggest it's very absurd

2 to call that waters of the United States. It's a

3 drainage ditch dug -- you know, dug by the municipality

4 or -- you know, or a gutter in a street. To call that

5 waters of the United States seems to me extravagant.

6 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, let me say two things,

7 Justice Scalia. First of all, this case has not been

8 litigated under the theory that the key difference is

9 whether it's man-made or natural, and that defines

10 somehow the scope of a tributary. And I think there's

11 a good reason for that, which is the second point,

12 which is as the Corps experts -- from the experts of the

13 Corps will tell you, the process of making the natural

14 rivers navigable has all been about the process of

15 channelizing them and creating man-made, artificial

16 channels in them to the point where the difference

17 between that which is a man-made channel and that which

18 is a natural channel is both difficult to discern and

19 utterly beside the point for purposes of this

20 regulatory scheme.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what percentage of

22 the -- of the territory of the United States do you

23 believe is -- is subjected to permits from the Corps of

24 Engineers on your theory whenever you want to move

25 dirt, whenever you want to deposit sand? What -- what

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 percentage of the total land mass of the United States,

2 if you define tributary as broadly as you define it to

3 include? Every storm drain? I mean, it's the whole

4 country, isn't it?

5 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: All the water goes down to

7 the sea and there's some kind of a drain or -- or a bed

8 that takes the water down there.

9 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think the precise

10 answer to your question being none of the land mass --

11 none of the land itself would be regulated. But in

12 terms of -- you want to talk about the --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're calling empty ditches

14 -- not unless you call empty ditches land, which I do.

15 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, the -- the Corps doesn't.

16 They treat those as water bodies.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that.

18 GENERAL CLEMENT: And that's not the gravamen of

19 the complaint here.

20 But just to be responsive to your question, I

21 think it's important to understand that the Corps and

22 the EPA's view of wetlands would cover about 80 percent

23 of the wetlands in the country. And that shows that

24 the impact of this Court's decision in SWANCC was real

25 and substantial because about 20 percent of the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Nation's wetlands are isolated.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you -- that's

3 just because this statute happens to refer to wetlands.

4 But under your theory, the Corps of Engineers would

5 have jurisdiction over any land that is part of that

6 tributary system as well. If any of that land has a

7 deposit of -- of some materials that could leach into

8 or -- or drain into the -- the tributary system, which

9 is to say any gutter, in theory, the -- the Federal

10 Government can regulate it all. No?

11 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think that's right,

12 Justice Scalia. The Corps has regulated this

13 channelized tributary system. It has done it without

14 regard to whether those channels are seasonally dry in

15 some areas, and I think that's a rational judgment.

16 It's not been the gravamen of this case, though. And

17 what's important is while the Corps and the Federal

18 Government regulate that channelized system of

19 tributaries, non-point source pollution is still

20 something that's in the primary providence of the

21 States. And so it's not true that the Corps is

22 asserting an authority to regulate land as such.

23 But to also get it on the table, if the

24 Federal Government wanted to -- if Congress changed its

25 mind and said that, say, the banks of the navigable

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 rivers or their tributaries are within the scope of

2 this program, as it did in 1899 in section 13 of the

3 Rivers and Harbors Act, we'd be here defending that as

4 a valid exercise of Congress' authority not just under

5 the Commerce Clause, but under the navigation power of

6 the --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But in 1899, it just said

8 navigable rivers, not -- not every -- every tributary

9 defined to include even storm drains.

10 GENERAL CLEMENT: No. With respect, Justice

11 Scalia, in 1899 in section 13 of the Rivers and Harbors

12 Act, the so-called Refuse Act, Congress regulated the

13 navigable waters and their tributaries. Now, in

14 fairness, the focus there was this idea that they only

15 regulated the tributaries if they could show that it

16 flowed into the navigable waters themselves, but they

17 asserted right in the text of the statute in 1899 the

18 authority to regulate the tributaries and the banks.

19 And that shows what I think is a very

20 important difference between this case and SWANCC.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your theory is

22 there is regulatory authority because there's an

23 interaction between the wetlands or the lands in

24 question and the navigable waters.

25 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Kennedy, that's not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 precisely accurate. The way it would describe it is

2 this.

3 As to the first question you have to ask,

4 which is are the tributaries covered, we think an

5 important component of describing the reach of the

6 tributary system is whether there's a hydrological

7 connection. On the second -- and that's subsection (5)

8 of the regulatory definition that brings within the

9 scope of waters of the United States tributaries.

10 Then you get to the second question which

11 actually implicates another subsection of the

12 definition, subsection (7), which is the adjacent

13 wetlands. And as to the adjacent wetlands, as the

14 Carabell case illustrates, the definition does not turn

15 on hydrological connection for purposes of asserting

16 the Corps' jurisdiction.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but wasn't --

18 wasn't the reason for including the adjacent wetlands

19 because of -- of the likelihood of an interaction?

20 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think they -- they were

21 included for the likelihood of an interaction both

22 hydrologically and otherwise.

23 I would say two important things, though.

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let -- well, please

25 finish.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 GENERAL CLEMENT: The two points I would make is,

2 first of all, I think the Corps' regulations, which for

3 30 years have ignored the premise -- the -- the

4 presence of a berm, are rational because in the vast,

5 vast majority of cases, that berm is not going to

6 prevent a hydrological connection, so to speak. And so

7 a test that focuses, first and foremost, on physical

8 proximity is a very rational jurisdictional test.

9 The second thing I would say, though, is it's

10 simply not true that even in the rare case where a berm

11 or a dike prevents all hydrological connection, that an

12 adjacent wetland will not perform an important function

13 for the adjacent water body. And the most obvious one

14 is the flood control possibility of the wetland.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, as you

16 mention that, you cited subsection (7), and there's a

17 -- what struck me anyway as a very interesting

18 provision in there. It covers wetlands adjacent to

19 waters other than waters that are themselves wetlands.

20 Now, everything that you've said today and in your

21 brief would lead me to think you would contend that

22 wetlands that are adjacent to wetlands ought to be

23 covered as well, and yet, the regulation leaves them

24 out. And I want to know why do you think the

25 regulation leaves those wetlands out.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 GENERAL CLEMENT: I -- I think, Mr. Chief

2 Justice, my own view is the reason that that caveat is

3 in subsection (7) is actually a vestige of the pre-

4 SWANCC scope of the regulation. And specifically, if

5 you look at subsection (3) of the definition which is

6 the isolated waters provision that was at issue, I

7 think, through the Migratory Bird Rule in SWANCC, that

8 includes wetlands in the available isolated waters.

9 And I think --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To me it -- it

11 suggests that even the Corps recognized that at some

12 point you've got to say stop because logically any drop

13 of water anywhere is going to have some sort of

14 connection through drainage. And they're -- they're

15 stopping there, and I wonder if we ought to take that

16 same instinct that -- that you see in subsection (7)

17 and apply it to your definition of tributary and say,

18 at some point, the definition of tributary has to have

19 an end. Otherwise, you're going to go and reach too

20 far, beyond what Congress reasonably intended.

21 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, several thoughts on that,

22 Mr. Chief Justice. I think the problem with that

23 approach is that the reason why it makes sense to

24 regulate that very first tributary that flows into the

25 Mississippi is the reason that it makes sense to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 regulate the entire tributary system. All of that

2 water is going to flow down into the navigable waters,

3 and if there's going to be --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's true of

5 the wetland that is adjacent to the wetland that is

6 adjacent to the tributary, and yet, the Corps says

7 we're not going to reach the wetland that is adjacent

8 to another wetland.

9 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Mr. Chief

10 Justice, the way that I would read that and the way I

11 understand the Corps reads that is that was really just

12 trying to exclude a wetland adjacent to a wetland that

13 was a water of the United States only because of the

14 application of subsection (3).

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your assumption --

16 GENERAL CLEMENT: And I think that's -- that's

17 supported by the --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but this -- this is

19 preliminary to my question. In SWANCC, we said there

20 has to be a significant nexus. It seems to me that you

21 have to show that there's some significant relation

22 between the wetlands you're regulating or seeking to

23 regulate and the navigable water.

24 GENERAL CLEMENT: I agree with that, Justice

25 Kennedy.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- and that's just,

2 it seemed to me, so far been missing from the

3 discussion.

4 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and I -- I guess there

5 is two ways to look at this. You can start with the

6 significant nexus test and see if it's met. I guess

7 the way that the Corps would naturally proceed is to

8 start with their definitions, and they would say

9 section -- subsection (5) covers tributaries. And you

10 can ask the question, is there a significant nexus

11 between the tributaries and the navigable waters in

12 which they flow into? And I think the answer to that

13 is yes.

14 And then there's the secondary question, as

15 to subsection (7) of the regulatory definition. Is

16 there a significant nexus between wetlands that are

17 adjacent to waters otherwise within the Corps'

18 jurisdiction, be they the traditional navigable waters

19 or their tributaries? And I think Riverside Bayview

20 answered that question and said, yes, there is a

21 significant nexus between adjacent wetlands and any

22 otherwise regulable water body to which they are

23 adjacent.

24 So that's the way we would ultimately satisfy

25 what this Court required, which is a significant nexus.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I wouldn't have understood this Court's

2 decision to transplant the significant nexus test and

3 say, that's what the Corps should administer, because

4 whatever ambiguity there is in waters of the United

5 States, I think significant nexus is precisely the kind

6 of test you'd want the Corps --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what about the

8 Chief Justice's question, wetlands next to wetlands?

9 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I -- I think that -- as I

10 said, I think what -- what the definition meant to get

11 at was to exclude wetlands adjacent to isolated

12 wetlands under subsection (3).

13 I think if you ask the question more broadly,

14 what about wetlands next to wetlands, I guess it

15 depends on what you mean by that because the one thing

16 we know from Riverside Bayview is that it's not a

17 requirement that the parcel and its wetlands be

18 immediately adjacent.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but we didn't

20 come up with the idea of wetlands next to wetlands.

21 The Corps of Engineers has it in their regulations.

22 GENERAL CLEMENT: And --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what do they mean

24 by it?

25 GENERAL CLEMENT: They meant wetlands adjacent to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 waters that would otherwise not be in the statute which

2 are isolated wetlands under subsection (3). It's the

3 only application it has in -- in the regulatory

4 structure, as they understand it.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is an

6 example of an insignificant nexus under the SWANCC

7 test?

8 GENERAL CLEMENT: Under insignificant nexus?

9 Well, I think it's the waters at issue in SWANCC, and I

10 think it's --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. There's no nexus

12 there.

13 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, no --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're isolated.

15 There's no nexus. The -- the notion in SWANCC of a

16 significant nexus suggests that there are some bodies

17 of water or puddles that are going to have a nexus, but

18 it's not going to be significant enough. We didn't

19 just say any nexus. It said significant nexus. So

20 what are you leaving out to give meaning to the test

21 that we articulated in SWANCC?

22 GENERAL CLEMENT: I'm leaving out everything that

23 this Court excluded in SWANCC, and I wouldn't have

24 thought that the -- that the Court necessarily

25 suggested there was going to be some subset that had a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 further insignificant nexus because it wasn't -- the

2 argument of the Government in those cases was obviously

3 -- we didn't just concede that those bodies of water

4 were utterly isolated. We said they did have important

5 ecological connections with the water. And I think the

6 way I read SWANCC is that we can't make that --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have a

8 wetland, you would say a wetland with a hydrological

9 connection to a tributary of navigable waters through

10 one drop a year is a significant nexus to the waters of

11 the United States?

12 GENERAL CLEMENT: What I would say, Mr. Chief

13 Justice, is that if the tributary flows in. I would

14 start with the tributary, and I'd say, now, there's

15 clearly a significant nexus between the tributary and

16 the navigable waters to which it flows. I would then

17 look at the wetland, and I would say for purposes of

18 the regulation of adjacent wetlands --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One drop.

20 GENERAL CLEMENT: For purposes of the adjacent

21 wetlands, it doesn't look to hydrological connection

22 per se. The way I would resolve that is I would

23 resolve it with reference to footnote 9 in this Court's

24 opinion in Riverside Bayview, and I would say, all

25 right, one drop? Fair enough. It's in the regulatory

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jurisdiction because it's adjacent and that's what the

2 Corps looks to. And I think that's a rational

3 judgment. But if there's one drop, grant the permit.

4 That solves the --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Adjacent to what? Adjacent

6 to a tributary. Right?

7 GENERAL CLEMENT: Adjacent to a tributary,

8 absolutely.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but here's -- here's

10 the fly in the ointment. You -- you interpret

11 tributary to include storm drains and ditches that only

12 carry off rainwater. I mean, it makes an immense

13 difference to the scope of jurisdiction of the Corps of

14 Engineers. I mean, when you talk about adjacent to a

15 tributary, I think, you know, maybe adjacent to the

16 Missouri River or something like that. No. You're

17 talking about adjacent to a storm drain.

18 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I think

19 if you had in mind a tributary, you'd probably have in

20 mind the Pine River which is at issue in one of these

21 sites. And I think that's why that's not the way

22 Petitioners have presented this case.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Only because I don't know

24 how a storm drain is a water of the United States.

25 That's all. I mean, all of these terms that you're

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 throwing around somehow have to come within a

2 reasonable usage of the term, waters of the United

3 States, and I do not see how a storm drain under

4 anybody's concept is a water of the United States.

5 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Scalia,

6 some things that you might classify as a storm drain

7 are actually very deep channels that have a continuous

8 flow of water that were --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I was referring to a

10 real storm drain.

11 (Laughter.)

12 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --

13 (Laughter.)

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay?

15 GENERAL CLEMENT: But therein is the problem,

16 which is some things that are part of the storm water

17 drainage system of a city are actually things that were

18 previous navigable natural waters. I mean, so --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And some aren't. But -- but

20 you would sweep them all into the jurisdiction of the

21 Corps of Engineers.

22 GENERAL CLEMENT: We would, Justice Scalia, but I

23 guess if we can start with the proposition that

24 tributaries are covered and then some things that the

25 Corps thinks are tributaries you disagree with, that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would be fine. But that would be a different case.

2 That hasn't been the theory that this case has been

3 presented.

4 As I understand, these drains here are

5 actually, you know, substantial channels that do have

6 water in them. I have no doubt that the Pine River

7 meets the test that it sounds like you would have for a

8 tributary, and the difficulty I'm having is I'd be

9 happy to defend what the Corps did if this Court, in

10 the -- in the litigation of this case, had focused the

11 court's and the Corps' attention on that issue.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Am I right that a

13 tributary is not a defined term in the regulations?

14 Right?

15 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's right. It's an

16 undefined term. The Corps has interpreted it in the

17 2000 preamble. The best place to find the Corps'

18 teaching on this is 65 Fed.Reg. 12,823-4. And they go

19 through -- it was part of a comment and they deal with

20 comments about their treatment of ditches and the like

21 and many of these issues.

22 And I guess what I would say is I think that

23 for purposes of this case, I mean, you heard the

24 Petitioners' argument. They have obviously, based on

25 the legal position they've advanced, not focused this

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Court or any other court's attention on subdividing

2 which tributaries count because their view is nothing

3 counts. Even the first tributary doesn't count. And I

4 think in this case what I would urge you to do, if --

5 if you have some concern with, you know, the extent of

6 the definition of tributaries, is to not make that a

7 basis for invalidating this -- the judgment of the

8 Sixth Circuit here. And that's an issue that could be

9 developed in other cases if -- if the parties want to

10 really focus the attention on that.

11 I think I would be comfortable defending the

12 Corps' judgment, even in those more finely focused

13 challenges, because I get back to the point, which is

14 that the same logic that has you regulate that first

15 tributary also suggests that you want to regulate

16 anything that's a channel that brings large quantities

17 of water into the navigable waterways.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that -- but that

19 doesn't follow. I mean, it is not a principle of law

20 that so long as the object is -- is lawful and within

21 the power of the United States, all means to which even

22 that object are lawful. That is simply not true.

23 There are various means of stopping that pollution, and

24 it may well be that one of the means, which intrudes

25 too deeply into the State's power to regulate land

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 within their jurisdiction, is not a permissible one.

2 That -- that's not an extraordinary proposition.

3 GENERAL CLEMENT: I absolutely agree with you,

4 Justice Scalia, and that's why I'm not up here asking

5 for Federal regulation over non-point source pollution,

6 although that obviously contributes to the -- to the

7 problem.

8 What I'm up here asking for is a recognition

9 that the tributary system is something that Congress

10 can validly regulate and did regulate in its broader

11 definition of waters of the United States in the Clean

12 Water Act. And I think that's something -- the

13 authority to regulate tributaries is something Congress

14 regulated starting in 1899 and, importantly, this Court

15 expressly upheld in 1941 in Oklahoma against Atkinson.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how non-point

17 source pollution is -- is any more remote from what the

18 Federal Government should be able to do to achieve its

19 ends than is a point source pollution that -- that

20 consists of -- of dumping sand on land that has some

21 puddles on it. I -- that seems to me just as remote.

22 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think one important

23 thing to focus on, Justice Scalia, is this case is not

24 just about the Corps' 404 program because the 404

25 program by its terms does not permit anything. As --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 as the permit word suggests, it's a -- it's a process

2 of granting permission. The relevant provision here is

3 section 301 of the statute which prohibits a discharge

4 into the navigable waters without a permit. And so

5 whatever this Court decides for purposes of the 404

6 jurisdiction, it's necessarily deciding for purposes of

7 the 402 jurisdiction of the EPA.

8 And so what you'd be suggesting is that if

9 some tributaries aren't covered, then it's perfectly

10 okay to dump toxins in those tributaries even though

11 you know that because they are a channelized system

12 that directly connects with the navigable water --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not

14 really fair. The Petitioners, as I understand it, both

15 concede the discharges that make their way into the

16 navigable waters would be covered.

17 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's right, Mr. Chief

18 Justice, but there's only two ways to do that. One way

19 of doing that and the one that I hear them advocating

20 would be this impossible sort of process of trying to

21 fingerprint or DNA test oil spills in a tributary to

22 figure out, yes, that's the guy that got it to the

23 navigable waters. And the one thing we know is that

24 there were some efforts to try to regulate pollution

25 that way before 1972 and they were a dismal failure.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The only other way to do it, as suggested by

2 one or two amici, is to treat the last -- treat the

3 tributary as if it were a point source. But I'd sure

4 hate to be the guy who owns the -- the land next to

5 that tributary that's dumping into the Mississippi

6 who's going to be responsible for the pollution of

7 everybody upstream. And what Congress recognized in

8 1972 is that they had to regulate beyond traditional

9 navigable waters.

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Congress in 1972

11 also, in its statement of policy, said it's a statement

12 of policy to reserve to the States the power and the

13 responsibility to plan land use and water resources.

14 And under your definition, I -- I just see that we're

15 giving no scope at all to that clear statement of a

16 congressional policy.

17 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Kennedy,

18 the States still have plenary control over the non-

19 point source pollution. They still have an important

20 cooperative role in -- in the overall program, as

21 you'll hear more about in the second case today. And I

22 would actually ask you to focus on one particular

23 provision that deals with the relationship between the

24 Federal Government and the States under 404 in

25 particular, and that's section 404, subsection (g) of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

58
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the statute. And that was added to the statute in

2 1977.

3 Unless Congress is going to be construed to

4 have given the States a virtual empty set, that

5 provision makes crystal clear that the waters of the

6 United States, for purposes of the Clean Water Act,

7 extend beyond traditional navigable waters and their

8 adjacent wetlands.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Though not necessarily as

10 far as storm drains. It would be enough to -- to say

11 navigable -- you know, non-navigable tributaries that

12 are real -- real tributaries.

13 GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice Scalia. I

14 concede that. But then you get to the question of

15 defining real tributaries, and that's neither been teed

16 up in this litigation, nor is it something that I

17 think, at the end of the day, you'd want to differ from

18 the Corps' judgment, which although you find it

19 striking that some things that are ditches are actually

20 included in the system, that is a product of the way

21 that the tributary systems have worked, the way that

22 certain cities have taken over a natural stream and

23 channelized it and make it look like a ditch, but it's

24 part of the system that carries water down from the

25 headwaters. And again, maybe that's an issue that we

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1 can try to divine the limits to in a subsequent case.

2 But I think what's important, as -- as your

3 very comments suggest, is that trying to give meaning

4 to that textual indication that Congress had clearly

5 wanted to capture something beyond traditional

6 navigable waterways and their adjacent wetlands.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a very vague

8 indication. I mean, I -- I agree with you that your

9 argument based on 404(g) is a strong one, but it -- it

10 perhaps is weakened if you believe that in order to

11 stretch to the -- to the limit of Federal jurisdiction,

12 you need a clear statement. I certainly wouldn't

13 consider 404(g) -- if -- if the act did not previously

14 include the kind of authority you're arguing for, I

15 would not -- I would not consider 404(g) a clear

16 statement of that -- of that new -- new authority.

17 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think even you would

18 concede it's a clear statement that something else must

19 be covered. Otherwise, other than is completely

20 meaningless in the statute. And so -- and -- and I --

21 I grant you that it might not be a clear statement as

22 to the nth tributary, and maybe that's a case on which

23 we can litigate in the future.

24 But I think what I would say is, for those of

25 your colleagues that want to look at the legislative

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

60
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 history, it provides some additional context for 404(g)

2 and makes it very clear that Congress, as this Court

3 found in both Riverside Bayview and in SWANCC, was

4 specifically focused on the coverage of adjacent

5 wetlands. And it's very clear that they understood

6 that whatever scope of jurisdiction was given to the

7 Corps, that it would bring along with it the adjacent

8 wetlands. And so there was this long debate.

9 As I say, the legislative history I think

10 makes quite clear that they were meant to include

11 the non-navigable tributaries and a substantial amount

12 of the non-navigable tributaries. And so, I mean, I

13 would invite others to look at that.

14 I also think that, to get back to a point I

15 made earlier, one thing that's exceedingly clear from

16 that legislative history is nobody in 1977, including

17 those that were advocating restricting the scope of the

18 404(g) program, wanted to restrict the EPA's

19 jurisdiction under 402. And so in the legislation that

20 they proposed that eventually found form in 404(g),

21 they expressly decoupled the 404 permitting process and

22 its jurisdiction from the 402 process.

23 Petitioners' argument, by contrast,

24 necessarily restricts the scope of both of those

25 programs because they are joined in the hip through

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

61
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 301. And so if they're right that they can dredge and

2 fill in these wetlands, then it is equally true that

3 they can dump toxic materials into those wetlands.

4 If I --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Could you just say a word

6 about the -- the ditch -- sorry -- the word about the

7 wetland next to a tributary that's separated by a man-

8 made object like a ditch? Are there many such

9 instances? It sounds to me like a scientific question.

10 Are there many such instances where there is no

11 transfer of water? And in those instances, is the

12 presence of water in the wetland anything more than a

13 coincidence?

14 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Insofar as it seeks to serve

16 a purpose of the statute to regulate this.

17 GENERAL CLEMENT: What I would say, Justice

18 Breyer -- I -- I think I can answer the whole question

19 -- is in the vast majority of cases, as I understand

20 it, a berm will not have the effect of actually

21 preventing all hydrological connection.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: And where do I look to

23 verify that scientific matter?

24 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think a number of the amicus

25 briefs have addressed that. I wish I could point to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

62
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you a specific one.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: No. I can't find any

3 quantitative assessment.

4 GENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, again, I didn't mean to

5 suggest a percentage. I just think that -- that -- let

6 me put it to you this way, and this is the argument we

7 obviously make in the brief. The best reason to think

8 that a man-made -- that a man-made berm or a natural

9 berm is unlikely to prevent all hydrological flow is

10 even those man-made structures that have as their

11 express design to prevent water flow, like dikes and

12 levees and dams, have seepage and leakage from them.

13 So --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine.

15 Now suppose we take a set, which you think

16 exists as not the null set, of instances where there is

17 no such transfer, which your opponents say is this

18 case. Now what's the justification for regulating

19 those? If it's simply flood control because water

20 flows over the top and sits there, I guess you could

21 say the same thing is true of any low depression, and

22 therefore, the presence of water would be just a

23 coincidence. Now, what's your -- the fact that they're

24 wet doesn't have anything to do with it. It's the fact

25 that they're next to a place that floods that has to do

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

63

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 with it.

2 Now, what's wrong with what I just said?

3 GENERAL CLEMENT: What's wrong with what you

4 just said is that wetlands have unique characteristics

5 that are different just from low-lying areas. And I think

6 this Court started to recognize that in the Riverside

7 Bayview case. And the image I would leave you with is

8 the image that wetlands actually act something like a

9 sponge, and because of that characteristic, they play

10 two important roles in helping to regulate the flow of

11 the adjacent water body.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I understand that.

13 Now, what specifically, since I think this is

14 scientific, do I look at to verify what you just said,

15 namely that a wet depression, even if there's no

16 interchange, has a lot to do with flood control that a

17 dry depression wouldn't have? That's a scientific

18 statement. Where do I verify it?

19 GENERAL CLEMENT: And, again, I mean, I would

20 direct you to the amicus briefs that discuss in length

21 the benefits of wetlands, but I understand you won't

22 find those --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: I read them, and I -- I just

24 perhaps wasn't reading them closely enough, but I just

25 can't find the verification directly there.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

64

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 GENERAL CLEMENT: And -- and I sense that you

2 found them lacking in that sense. I guess what I would

3 say is there's certainly anecdotal evidence in those

4 amicus briefs that I think is quite striking.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what am I supposed to

6 do with the case? I read them quickly. I don't

7 necessarily pick up everything. I'll read them again.

8 But if I don't find empirical verification for that

9 statement, what am I supposed to do with this case?

10 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, not surprisingly, I would

11 suggest that you defer to the agency in its exercise of

12 expertise.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. And where did the

14 agency, in its many, many proceedings over the course

15 of 35 years, say what you just said, namely that a

16 wetland acts as a sponge? It's very plausible to me.

17 It's just that there may be a need to drop a citation

18 somewhere.

19 (Laughter.)

20 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, you -- and you could

21 cite to the proceedings in this very case in the joint

22 appendix because although they didn't use the sponge

23 word, there was a specific finding in this case that

24 these wetlands played an important role in flood

25 control and pollution control for the adjacent streams.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

65
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if you wanted a

2 cite for the opposite proposition, you could cite subsection

3 (7) of the Corps' regulations where they have no

4 interest in wetlands that happen to be adjacent to

5 other wetlands that are adjacent to the waters of the

6 United States. If they act in the way that you've been

7 postulating, presumably they'd want to cover those

8 adjacent wetlands just as much as they want to cover

9 the wetlands that are next to the tributary, but they

10 don't.

11 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, I don't think

12 that follows because if you read subsection (7), as I

13 do, as only excluding those wetlands that are adjacent

14 to other isolated wetlands, then regulating those

15 wetlands --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't -- it

17 doesn't say that. It says other than waters that are

18 themselves wetlands. It excludes all wetlands that are

19 adjacent to wetlands that are adjacent to waters of the

20 United States.

21 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and as I said, I think

22 you have to read that in the context not just of the

23 rest of the regulations but of this Court's decision in

24 Riverside Bayview. The one thing we know from

25 Riverside Bayview is that it's not enough to simply say

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

66
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that your parcel of wetlands is not adjacent to the

2 navigable waterway because in that case, as the Court

3 remarked, it -- the parcel ended before it got to the

4 adjacent navigable body of water and there was another

5 wetland. There was a continuation of the same wetland.

6 Now, I don't know whether you'd call that two adjacent

7 wetlands. I might as a common locution. There might

8 be some different way of referring to that. But we

9 know that the one wetland was covered because that was

10 the holding of this Court in Riverside Bayview.

11 So I don't think I would give undue weight to

12 that reading of it especially when, if you read it as I

13 do, it makes perfect sense because a wetland adjacent

14 to an otherwise isolated wetland is not going to have

15 the same role to play in flood control in terms of

16 monitoring the stream volume as a wetland adjacent to

17 an otherwise regulable water body as you have at issue

18 here. And so I think that that regulatory decision

19 that the Corps has made is one that's perfectly

20 defensible and makes sense.

21 And I think that -- again, I think one other

22 point that I want to note that's kind of specific to

23 this case is part of the reason why it makes sense to

24 regulate a wetland adjacent to an otherwise regulable

25 water body, even if there is a berm present, is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

67

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 illustrated by this case because, as was alluded to,

2 the specific development plan at issue here -- and this

3 is clear at joint appendix pages 95 and 160 -- would

4 sever the berm and create the hydrological link between

5 a smaller, deeper wetland and the adjacent navigable

6 wetland -- waterway system. And so, I mean, it doesn't

7 make a lot of sense, as Justice Stevens suggested, to

8 have a regulatory regime where you have a regulable

9 wetland after but not before a construction project

10 that has the effect of vastly reducing the size of the

11 wetland.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that the

13 authority of -- I don't -- I don't even think the Corps

14 has ever suggested this. The authority of the Corps

15 extends not only to all that you've -- we've been

16 talking about and that you've asserted, but also to

17 lands that, if altered, could have some hydrological

18 connection.

19 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, that's not it, Justice

20 Scalia. What I'm saying is what the Corps has always

21 done for 30 years is said they are going to regulate a

22 physically proximate, adjacent wetland without regard

23 to whether or not there's a berm there. I'm just

24 making the subsidiary point that that makes sense

25 because the very construction project that might be at

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

68

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 issue might have the effect of changing the degree of

2 the hydrological connection.

3 I want to be very clear, though. The

4 hydrological connection has never been the sine qua non

5 of the assertion of regulation authority over the

6 adjacent wetlands.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is -- what is the basis

8 for their doing it? If there is currently no

9 hydrological connection, there is a berm, there is no

10 -- there is no connection to the navigable waters of

11 the United -- what could possibly be the basis for

12 their asserting jurisdiction?

13 GENERAL CLEMENT: The short answer is flood

14 control. If there is that berm that -- that allows the

15 sponge to soak up water, either rainwater or waters

16 from adjacent parcels, although I think in this case,

17 it would largely be rainwater, that -- the fact that

18 there's a berm actually helps in the flood control.

19 When you sever it, it changes the dynamic quite a bit

20 because then it's somewhat less helpful for flood

21 control --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I --

23 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- but actually is earlier in

24 term -- plays a better role --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: A statute could do that. A

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

69

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statute could do that. But this statute requires that

2 it be a water of the United States.

3 GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and when -- when

5 there is nothing but puddles that are isolated by a

6 berm, even from the storm drain which goes to

7 tributaries, I can't conceive of -- of how you could

8 consider that that's -- you know, at least where it

9 leaks sometimes into the storm drain and went down to a

10 tributary, I think it's an exaggeration, but maybe you

11 could call it a water of the United States. But where

12 there's a berm that prevents any water from going even

13 into the storm drain which then goes into a tributary,

14 how can you possibly consider that a water of the

15 United States?

16 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think the way I would

17 do it is you start with the tributary. And if you'll

18 concede for purposes of the illustration or the

19 argument that that's a water of the United States, then

20 what the Corps does as a jurisdictional regulation is

21 treat the adjacent wetland as a water of the United

22 States as well. That makes sense for two principal

23 reasons.

24 One, in the overwhelming majority of cases,

25 there is going to be a hydrological connection.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

70

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Actually tracing out exactly what it is and how it

2 works is very difficult and not the kind of thing you'd

3 want to get into at the jurisdictional stage, and

4 that's why the Court said that was fine in footnote 9

5 of Riverside Bayview.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the argument I

7 was addressing. I'm addressing the argument that in

8 changing the land, you may cause it to --

9 GENERAL CLEMENT: And that's not an independent

10 basis for jurisdiction. It's simply an illustration of

11 why disregarding the berm makes sense.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm happy to hear that.

13 That's all I was trying to establish. You -- you don't

14 assert that that's an independent basis.

15 GENERAL CLEMENT: It is not an independent basis.

16 It is part of the reason why, though, in the context

17 of wetlands in particular, a focus on physical

18 proximity and adjacency makes sense and a fixation on

19 hydrological connection does not make sense.

20 Part of the reason you can look at the record

21 here and find differing information about the extent of

22 the hydrological connection is that is not a term that

23 is relevant for the regulatory scheme. And the same

24 thing was equally true in Riverside Bayview itself. In

25 fact, in Riverside Bayview, the district court made a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

71
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 finding that the wetland there was hydrologically

2 isolated from the adjacent streams. Now, as the

3 Solicitor General pointed out in the petition at

4 footnote 7 in Riverside Bayview, we think the best

5 understanding of what was meant there was that there

6 was no overtopping and that there was some drainage.

7 But that just illustrates the point that hydrological

8 connection is not a statutory term. It's not a

9 regulatory term. It's a very loose term and it's not a

10 term the Corps has ever used in regulating adjacent

11 wetlands.

12 It's important to stress that the regulation

13 for adjacent wetlands that is at issue here, subsection

14 (7), is exactly the same regulation that was at issue

15 in Riverside Bayview. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out,

16 the Court, when it framed the question presented,

17 framed it in terms of whether or not the Corps could

18 rationally regulate wetlands that were adjacent to

19 navigable waters and their tributaries. And when they

20 got to the holding, this Court approved the regulation

21 and approved the fact that it asserted jurisdiction

22 over wetlands adjacent to otherwise regulable waters.

23 So if the tributaries are otherwise regulable because

24 they are waters of the United States, it follows

25 directly from Riverside Bayview that the adjacent

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

72
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 wetlands are covered as well.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you put a lot

3 of weight on the tributary question in your approach by

4 giving up the hydrological connection. Your response

5 is you don't need a hydrological connection because

6 it's right next to a tributary. But for those of us

7 who are having a little trouble with the concept of

8 tributary, you don't leave us much to fall back on.

9 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and -- and I'm -- I wish

10 that weren't the case, Mr. Chief Justice.

11 What I would say, though, is that this case

12 has just not framed up the question of tributaries, and

13 that's because -- I mean, to put it more favorably to

14 my client, the other side has never taken issue with

15 the fact that their wetlands are adjacent to

16 tributaries. And I think that's -- that's obvious for

17 a couple of reasons. I mean, first of all, if you look

18 at the property in Carabell, it's just a mile from Lake

19 St. Clair. It's right next to a substantial drainage

20 ditch which connects to a navigable water, Auvase

21 Creek, and then into Lake St. Clair. In fact, it's

22 kind of ironic, but the property in Riverside Bayview

23 was also a mile away from Lake St. Clair. So it's very

24 similar.

25 If you look at the three sites at issue in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

73
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Rapanos, one is right next to the Pine River. One of

2 the others -- the whole point of the dredge and fill

3 operation was to drain the wetland through the adjacent

4 tributary systems so the water would go away. And in

5 the third one, there also isn't an issue about whether

6 or not those are tributaries. In a different case,

7 that might be an appropriate focus for inquiry.

8 The last thing, I would say a couple of

9 points before I sit down. I do think, first, that

10 section 404(g) of the statute is very important because

11 it is the clearest textual indication that Congress

12 intended to regulate something beyond traditional

13 navigable waterways and their adjacent wetlands. And

14 as this Court itself remarked in SWANCC, the single

15 most likely candidate are the non-navigable

16 tributaries.

17 The second point to emphasize is that the

18 scope of the Corps' 404 jurisdiction is the same as the

19 EPA's 402 jurisdiction. They are joined at the hip

20 through the basic prohibition under section 301. So a

21 conclusion that somehow certain tributaries are excised

22 from the tributary system for purposes of 404 is

23 likewise excising those tributaries and creating a

24 situation where you can have a -- a free dump zone at

25 some point above the -- above what somebody might put

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

74

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 as the limits of the navigable waterway system or the

2 tributary system. And I think that is something that

3 even the proponents of narrowing the Corps'

4 jurisdiction in 1977 could not countenance.

5 The last point I would make is that there are

6 going to be real-world consequences to contracting the

7 jurisdiction of the Corps and the EPA to pre-1972 or,

8 really, pre-1899 levels, especially for the downstream

9 States. I think it's a bit much to ask a legislator in

10 Wisconsin or in Minnesota to stop local development in

11 order to protect the water quality and flood control

12 propensities of the Mississippi River in Mississippi.

13 That's why it was manifest in 1972 that there was a

14 need for a Federal solution to this problem. That

15 Federal solution includes as two of its most important

16 components first getting at water pollution at its

17 source, at the point source, and secondly, covering the

18 tributary system without which the navigable waters

19 will continue to be polluted.

20 Thank you.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.

22 Mr. Hopper, you have 4 minutes remaining.

23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF M. REED HOPPER

24 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1034

25 MR. HOPPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

75
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hopper, I hope you're

2 going to tell us what you make of section 404(g).

3 MR. HOPPER: I'd be happy to. In -- in Solid

4 Waste Agency, this Court looked at 404(g) and

5 determined that it had -- it was not enlightening as to

6 the meaning of navigable waters under 404(a) because

7 Congress did not define other waters in any way. And

8 this Court likewise concluded that 404(g) was simply

9 not before it and would not draw any conclusion from

10 it. So I submit that it is really irrelevant.

11 I note -- I want to draw this Court's

12 attention to our footnote 1 in our reply where we point

13 out that -- that in every formal rulemaking, the Corps

14 and the EPA have excluded drainage ditches from the

15 definition of tributary. It is here and now that these

16 agencies are redefining the term tributary to include

17 anything in the hydrological chain. The Sixth Circuit

18 decision says that any hydrological connection suffices

19 as a significant nexus to bring in wetlands under

20 Federal jurisdiction.

21 Of course, in -- in page 31 of the

22 opposition, the Government argues that neither the

23 directness -- excuse me -- nor the substantiality of a

24 tributary's connection to traditional navigable waters

25 is relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry. It's simply

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

76

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 not true that the Government is only identifying

2 channelized conduits as tributaries. Anywhere water

3 flows is a tributary in their book.

4 Let me also address something that this Court

5 did in SWANCC. It was not the lack of a hydrological

6 connection in that case that informed this Court's

7 decision to exclude those isolated ponds from Federal

8 jurisdiction. It was the fact that those -- that the

9 regulation of those isolated ponds did not meet the

10 terms of the act and there was no clear indication

11 Congress intended to regulate isolated ponds. I submit

12 that's this case. In this case, there is no clear

13 indication that Congress intended to regulate wetlands

14 20 miles from the nearest navigable water.

15 The --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're told that one of

17 them was much closer.

18 MR. HOPPER: The -- the record is silent as

19 to the distance between --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Pine River?

21 Are you -- that's not 20 miles away, is it?

22 MR. HOPPER: We don't know how far that is

23 because the record is silent as to the distance between

24 those water bodies.

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know? The -- the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

77

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Solicitor General represented to us that it was very

2 close. Are you disputing that as a matter of fact?

3 MR. HOPPER: I don't know what he means by

4 very close. The -- the Solicitor General would agree

5 with me that -- that there's nothing in the record to

6 indicate what those distances are.

7 And it's irrelevant in -- in our opinion

8 whether it's -- whether it's a mile or 20 miles or 50

9 miles or 100 miles, and that's the point. There does

10 -- under the -- under the Federal regulations a true,

11 significant nexus is not required, just any

12 hydrological connection. This is a presumption on

13 congressional authority.

14 This expansive interpretation destroys any

15 distinction between what is national and what is local

16 under -- as -- as has already been pointed out. Under

17 the Federal regulations, you can't dig a ditch in this

18 country without Federal approval. You can't fill it

19 in. You can't clean it out without Federal approval.

20 This reads the term navigable right out of the statute.

21 We -- we ask this Court not to allow these

22 agencies --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, when we're

24 talking about the scope of -- of Federal power, we're

25 not merely concerned with dumping refuse in the creek,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

78

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO
