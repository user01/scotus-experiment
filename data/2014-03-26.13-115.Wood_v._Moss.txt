1  P R O C E E D I N G S  2  (10:09 a.m.)  3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument  4 this morning in Case 13115, Wood v. Moss.  5  Mr. Gershengorn.  6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN  7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS  8  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may  9 it please the Court:  10  The Ninth Circuit held that individual  11 Secret Service agents could be held personally liable  12 for their onthespot decision to reposition a group of  13 about 200 to 300 demonstrators who were within weapon's  14 range of President Bush as he made an unscheduled  as  15 he made an unscheduled stop for dinner at an outdoor  16 restaurant patio.  17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I ask a question?  18 So were the proBush demonstrators.  In fact, the  19 proBush demonstrators were across the street pretty  20 much at a diagonal to the President, and they were  21 permitted to remain there the entire time.  He  they  22 had a throwing distance of a bomb or a shooting distance  23 as well.  24  MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, the  25 proBush demonstrators were differently situated from
3

1 the antiBush demonstrators in several fundamental  2 respects.  With respect to the weapons range, there  3 there was a twostory building between the proBush  4 protestors and the  where the President was dining.  5 It's in stark contrast to the open alley that led down  6 precisely to the sixfoot wooden fence behind which the  7 President was dining, which is where the antiBush  8 protestors were.  9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That was after the  10 second move, not the first.  11  MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, Your Honor.  At the  12 first move, when the President arrived for dinner,  13 the  the proBush protesters were on the north  the  14 antiBush protesters were on the north side of  15 California Street between Third and Fourth, and the  16 alley that led right down to the restaurant patio was  17 right there.  The  they were at the head of the alley.  18  So they were very differently situated from  19 the proBush protesters.  20  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, I don't understand  21 the government to be making the argument, and I can't  22 understand why it isn't making the argument, that it  23 doesn't matter whether there was any intent to suppress  24 antiBush demonstrations, that in this area, as in  25 traffic stops, we don't consult subjective intent.

1  If  if a policeman stops somebody,  2 and it's, oh, you stopped me only because I was coming  3 back from an antiBush demonstration, we wouldn't  we  4 wouldn't listen to that argument.  We'd say, did you  5 have a broken taillight or not?  If you had a broken  6 taillight, we do not inquire into the subjective intent  7 of the officer.  Why is it any different here?  8  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I don't  9 believe we are avoiding the argument that Your Honor  10 suggests.  11  JUSTICE SCALIA:  You haven't made it.  12  MR. GERSHENGORN:  We don't think it's  I  13 think, Your Honor, with respect, that we have.  Our  14 position is that it is not clearly established law, that  15 if there were an objectively reasonable  16  JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't even have to get  17 into that.  You don't have to get into clearly  18 established law.  It's a very simple case.  If you say,  19 was there objectively a reason to move these people?  If  20 there was, if you had an ulterior motive that was  21 unconstitutional, we don't inquire into it.  22  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, we agree with  23 that.  We just have framed it as terms of  in terms of  24 clearly established law, that if we think along the  25 lines of what this Court said in Reichle with respect to
5

Official
1 retaliatory arrest, if there is an objectively  2 reasonable basis for the move  for the repositioning,  3 such as a valid security rationale, it's not clearly  4 established that the presence of animus would be enough  5 to take  to raise a constitutional  6  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do you agree with  7 that, Mr. Gershengorn?  Because you have these  8 hypotheticals in the last page of your brief where you  9 say that a complaint could survive a motion to dismiss  10 if the Secret Service members had, you know, announced,  11 had admitted that they had an intention to discriminate  12 or if they had told the local police that.  13  So I took what you were saying there to say,  14 if there is evidence of a very clear nature, that it was  15 all about animus and it was nothing about security, then  16 the complaint would survive.  17  MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I think  18 that the way we reconcile the two positions is the  19 following:  If there is no objective legitimate security  20 rationale, and it is animus, we agree that it would be  21 clearly established law that the officers could not have  22 taken  the agents could not have taken responsibility  23  could not have taken the actions.  24  However, if on the record there is an  25 objectively reasonable security basis, then we don't
6

1 think it's clearly established that, even if the  2 individual officer didn't take the action for that  3 reason and took it for animus, that it's not clearly  4 established that that is a constitutional violation  5  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you get oblige us by  6 answering Justice Scalia's question.  Forget clearly  7 established.  What do you think the law is or ought to  8 be?  If the only motive for the officer's action, for  9 the Secret Service action, is one based on viewpoint  10 discrimination, but that nonetheless there was an  11 objective reason that could have justified the action,  12 what should the outcome be there as a matter of law?  13 Forget clearly established.  14  MR. GERSHENGORN:  We don't think they've  15 stated a constitutional violation in that context.  16 However, what the Court did in Reichle  17  JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't  what does that  18 answer mean?  19  MR. GERSHENGORN:  That means there is no  20 constitutional violation.  21  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you  so you say that  22 any time there is an objective basis for the Secret  23 Service to act to move a protester, the fact that this  24 wasn't the motive at all, but that it was viewpoint  25 discrimination is irrelevant.

1  MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I want  2 to  3  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that your position or  4 is it not?  5  MR. GERSHENGORN:  That is our position, but  6 I don't think that's what we need to win this case.  7  JUSTICE BREYER:  I know that, but the reason  8 that you  the reason I think these questions are being  9 asked, my impression is exactly what Justice Scalia said  10 in respect to a Fourth Amendment case against a police  11 stop.  12  But my impression also is that where you  13 have a First Amendment case and it's not against the  14 policeman, against Secret Service, this Court has not  15 said that.  16  Am I right about that?  And the reason that  17 your position, if I am right, is relevant is because I  18 think maybe we shouldn't say that for the first time in  19 a case where the government hasn't even argued it.  20  MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I  21  JUSTICE BREYER:  Now  and what is the  22 answer to what I just said?  23  MR. GERSHENGORN:  The answer to your Honor's  24  JUSTICE BREYER:  Am I right on part one, and  25 am I right on part two?
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, you are right  2 on part one.  The Court has never held it.  What the  3 Court  the closest the Court has come is in Reichle  4 where what the Court said was in a case of retaliatory  5 arrest, it was not clearly established  the Court  6 didn't reach the constitutional question.  The Court  7 said it was not clearly established that where there was  8 objective probable cause for arrest, retaliatory animus  9 was not relevant.  10  We think a number of the same factors that  11 motivated the Court in Reichle could motivate the Court  12 here as well, were they to reach that question, and I'll  13 explain why in a second.  But we do not need to win on  14 that question because it's not clearly established.  So,  15 Your Honor, with respect  16  JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, we all know you don't  17 need to win on that question.  The question is:  Should,  18 in your opinion, the Court reach that question.  And my  19 hesitation would be that it is one thing to talk about  20 ordinary policemen.  It is another thing to talk about  21 First Amendment matters where we are engaged with a kind  22 of special protective force, and certain residences  23 there that make  residences that may make a person  24 hesitate to extend into that area.  And so what is the  25 government's view?

1  MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I've been  2 asked the government's view on a couple of things, so I  3 want to be very clear.  4  The question of what is our position is the  5 position articulated by Justice Scalia.  The question of  6 what we need to win, it's qualified immunity.  7  The question of whether the Court should  8 reach the constitutional question, I think our answer  9 would be no, that the parties haven't breached it as  10 Your Honor said, that the normal course would be to do  11 what the Court said in Reichle and say that it's not  12 clearly established.  But  13  JUSTICE SCALIA:  I can't understand why you  14 didn't brief it then in that case.  I cannot understand  15 why you didn't brief it.  And  and talking about  16 things that we haven't  haven't held in the past, we  17 haven't even held in the past that  that there is a  18 Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment violation,  19 have we?  20  MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, Your Honor.  21  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we have any cases that  22 has held that?  23  MR. GERSHENGORN:  No.  And we agree with  24 that, but the argument was not preserved below, so we  25 have not presented it here.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that a  2 relevant  well, what is your position on that?  Is it  3 pertinent in analyzing qualified immunity that there's  4 no private right of action for the asserted  5 constitutional violation?  6  MR. GERSHENGORN:  We do believe, Your Honor,  7 that it is  it is  the Court would have jurisdiction  8 to reach it because it's a logically antecedent question  9 and that it would be something that the Court could  10 consider.  It's not something  11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I don't mean  12 what the Court could consider.  13  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Yes.  14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I want to know  15 whether or not  well, the question is simple.  Can you  16 only  can you not violate the Constitution if there's  17 no right of action against you, or do you look and say,  18 well, whether there's a right of action or not, it still  19 violates the Constitution?  20  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I think that  21 the presence of  the Court's hesitant to recognize  22 Bivens and the factors that go into the  that gave the  23 Court hesitance to extend Bivens to First Amendment  24 claims are relevant to the analysis here.  We didn't  25 raise this argument because it wasn't preserved below,

1 but we do think the very same factors that should  2 that would give the Court pause about recognizing a  3 Bivens actions are the ones that would cause the Court  4 to reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision here.  5  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, on  on the merits  6 of the case, if you were called to brief the Secret  7 Service, what would you say in response to this  8 question:  Do we have any duties under the First  9 Amendment when we are protecting the President with  10 respect to crowds and  and people that are close to  11 him?  Do we have any First Amendment duty?  12  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, we would  13 first of all, as the policy  I know Your Honor hasn't  14 asked this, but I just want to make clear.  There's a  15 policy that would generally prohibit the Secret Service  16 from doing that, an internal policy.  With respect to  17 what the Constitution  18  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They're asking about a  19 law, they say we want to know what the law is.  We're  20 law enforcement officers.  Will you please tell us what  21 the law is.  22  MR. GERSHENGORN:  I would say, Your Honor,  23 that the law is not clearly established.  This Court has  24 never held that the Secret Service  25  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They said that's why we've invited
12

1 you to lunch, so that you will tell us what the law is.  2  (Laughter.)  3  MR. GERSHENGORN:  And we may yet get  4 clarity.  But as  5  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You actually are arguing  6 that it's not  7  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could I  8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   that it's not  9  JUSTICE KENNEDY:   have an answer to this  10 question, please?  11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Answer Justice  12 Kennedy's question.  13  MR. GERSHENGORN:  We would tell  I think I  14 would have to say in candor, Your Honor, that in part  15 because of some of the discussion we're having, that we  16 think the better view of the law would be if you have an  17 objective security rationale for the action, that the  18 retaliatory animus would not render that  19 unconstitutional.  20  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, can I ask you a  21 question?  22  MR. GERSHENGORN:  But I would have to say  23 that that's not clearly established and there's a  24 rule  25  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think it's not
13

Alderson Reporting Company

1 clearly established that you can't discriminate  2 solely  I've used the word "solely."  No security  3 reason, no nothing.  You can't discriminate solely on  4 the basis of viewpoint?  5  MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's correct, Your  6 Honor.  We agree with that.  7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's constitutionally  8 established?  9  MR. GERSHENGORN:  And I take that as  10 different from the hypothetical that Justice Scalia  11 proposed.  12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no.  Let me  13 go  14  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Okay.  Yes.  15  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   step by step.  You  16 agree that's clearly established.  17  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Yes, Your Honor.  18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  What you  19 don't think is clearly established is a mixed motive  20 case.  21  MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's correct.  22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a different  23 issue.  So the question here is:  Is this a mixed motive  24 case or not?  25  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor 
14

Alderson Reporting Company

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That  the other side,  2 I think, is saying it's not, that there was no valid  3 security reason, no objective security reason for this  4 move.  5  MR. GERSHENGORN:  And I think our response  6 to that, Your Honor, is we would agree that's clearly  7 established.  If there were  if no reasonable officer  8 could believe there was a security rationale and it was  9 only on the basis of animus, then it would be clearly  10 established.  We believe  11  JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not a mixed motive.  12 Why  why do you accept the description of that as a  13 mixed motive case?  14  MR. GERSHENGORN:  I don't think that  I  15 don't think Justice Sotomayor  16  JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you agreed with my  17 hypothetical, the point is it doesn't matter what the  18 officer's motive was.  It does not matter.  If there's  19 an objective basis for a traffic stop, even if his sole  20 motive was discriminatory, the stop is nonetheless  21 valid.  This is not a mixed motive issue.  22  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I took Justice  23 Sotomayor to be asking me a different question:  If  24 there is no objective security rationale, which takes it  25 out of Your Honor's hypo, then we agree it is clearly
15

Alderson Reporting Company

1 established and we believe this complaint fails because  2 they have failed to satisfy Iqbal.  3  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then don't  just don't  4 call it mixed motive.  It confuses everything.  It  5 confuses everything.  6  MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, that I don't think is  7 mixed motive.  But what Justice Sotomayor was asking  8 was, I thought, something different, which is that  9 whether there is a sort of Mount Healthy butfor  10 causation.  And I would say  I just want to be very  11 clear what our position is here.  I know I'm being asked  12 on the merits, but just to get our the position on  13 qualified immunity.  14  It is not clearly established that taking  15 viewpoint discrimination into account in a security  16 situation violates the Constitution.  It is not clearly  17 established that if there is objective security  18 rationale, even if you act then in animus, that that  19 would violate the Constitution.  20  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice  21  MR. GERSHENGORN:  But we agree  22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito has  23 been trying to get a question in.  24  MR. GERSHENGORN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  25  JUSTICE ALITO:  No, no.  It's certainly not
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 your fault.  2  (Laughter.)  3  JUSTICE ALITO:  This question about the  4 the issue that you've been addressing in response to  5 Justice Scalia's question.  In  in the Fourth  6 Amendment context where it is purely  the inquiry is  7 purely objective, we have case law on what is reasonable  8 suspicion, what is probable cause.  Now, if you apply  9 that to a First Amendment case where there  where it's  10 asserted that there is a security  there may or may  11 not be a security concern, would it not be necessary for  12 us to identify a  a degree of suspicion or probable  13 cause that the Secret Service would have to have before  14 making  before moving people for security reasons?  15  I imagine whenever the President is out in  16 public, there is some degree of risk.  You want no risk?  17 You know, keep him in a bunker.  So at some point  do  18 you see what I'm saying?  They  19  MR. GERSHENGORN:  I do, Your Honor.  20  JUSTICE ALITO:  The Secret Service has to  21 make a decision about how much information they need  22 before they can  they should move people or change a  23 route or something like that.  So the courts would then  24 have to set that standard.  25  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I think it
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 would have to be a very deferential standard and it  2 would  and I think that that is proper under this  3 Court's case law.  4  If I could attack that in sort of two ways.  5 The way the Court addressed this issue in Reichle we  6 think is quite parallel to how it would address it in  7 this First Amendment context.  What the Court said in  8 Reichle was:  First, the existence of probable cause in  9 that case is likely to be an issue in every  in  10 virtually every case.  And we think in this situation,  11 the existence of a legitimate objective security  12 rationale, in part because that's what the agents do and  13 in part because of statute that  that requires the  14 agency to protect the President, a legitimate security  15 rationale is likely to be in every case first.  16  Second, what the Court said in Reichle was  17 that it's very difficult to distinguish animus from the  18 proper use of reliance on protected speech because  19 because the Court has recognized that it is valid at  20 times to take into account the nature of one's speech  21 in  in making arrests and other security decisions.  22 And the same would be true here.  23  And we think there's a third factor here  24 which is important, which this Court has recognized,  25 that the physical security of the President occupies a
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 special place in our constitutional structure, as  2 Justice Breyer put it in his Rubin dissent, and that the  3 Secret Service has a special role to play.  4  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you say that under  5 your view of the case, that there is a First Amendment  6 interest that protesters have, but that it is virtually  7 unenforceable in the context of crowd control?  8  MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, Your Honor, we would  9 not say that.  We think there are  10  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because it seems to me  11 that if this complaint doesn't survive, nothing will.  12  MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I'd like  13 to address that in a couple of different ways.  First of  14 all, there's a very big difference between whether  15 there's a Bivens action stated and whether there are  16 other ways to enforce constitutional rights.  So it is  17 possible and there have been suits that have sought  18 injunctive and declaratory relief before things like  19 inaugurations, political conventions, even just regular  20 presidential visits.  Those would be unaffected.  21  Second, there are  there are situations in  22 which plaintiffs, and there are pending challenges now,  23 have challenged Secret Service policies, for example a  24 Secret Service policy that no  that bars certain  25 supports for signs from a parade route.  That's being
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 challenged now in the court.  2  And then if there are Bivens claims, we  3 think there are allegations that would survive.  But we  4 do recognize that this would  that  that a ruling on  5 qualified immunity here would cut back on damages claims  6 against individual agents, but we think that's  7 appropriate in light of the difficulties they face.  The  8 agent  9  JUSTICE SCALIA:  You know, I really  I  10 really don't understand what the government is doing  11 here.  It seems to me you want to win this case, but not  12 too big.  13  (Laughter.)  14  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor  15  JUSTICE SCALIA:  In  in light of the  16 arguments waived below and the arguments not made here,  17 you want us to find for you, but on the narrowest  18 possible ground.  I would think it is in the interest of  19 the United States and the Secret Service to say there  20 are no Bivens First Amendment actions, but you don't  21 make that argument.  Didn't make it below; don't make it  22 here.  23  Likewise, it would be in their interest to  24 say, oh, this is just like a traffic stop.  It doesn't  25 matter whether we had a  a bad motive so long as there
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 was an objective reason, that's the end, but you don't  2 make that argument here either.  I  I really can't  3 understand what the government is trying to do here.  4  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, we are  we  5 are doing our best to make with the arguments that we  6 have before the Court.  We think that the  that the  7 qualified immunity standards that we have articulated  8 and the position on clearly established law we have  9 taken is sufficient for this Court to decide the claim.  10 Although.  As I've tried to say, we agree with both of  11 the propositions that Your Honor has said and in a  12 properly preserved case we would be likely to address  13 them.  14  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gershengorn, suppose  15 that we changed the facts here and that both the  16 proBush demonstrators and the antiBush demonstrators  17 were in the same place and they were at the foot of the  18 alleyway, so that there was an objective security  19 rationale, but that the Secret Service members  and  20 they were in all respects the same except that they had  21 different signs.  Some signs say the President is great  22 and some signs say the President is terrible.  And the  23 Secret Service members had only removed the ones with  24 the signs that said the President is terrible.  25  So what would your analysis of that be, both
21

1 under the clearly established, but also, I want you to  2 get to what you think the law is there.  3  MR. GERSHENGORN:  All right.  So under  4 under clearly established, Your Honor, I think we do  5 think that that would make a plausible case that there  6  that the agents acted without a valid security  7 rationale because they  because they moved the  8 antiBush protesters, but not the proBush.  9  JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think you're changing my  10 hypothetical, or let me just explain my hypothetical.  11  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Okay.  12  JUSTICE KAGAN:  I put them both at the foot  13 of the alleyway because that meant that both have a  14 straight shot, you know, that they can throw a grenade  15 into the patio, which is, I take it, what the nature of  16 your objective security consideration is.  So that's  17 true of both of them.  But you only move the ones that  18 say the President is terrible.  19  MR. GERSHENGORN:  So we would say, Your  20 Honor, first on clearly established, that it is not  21 clearly established that the Agency couldn't do that,  22 but we recognize that the Court is  is concerned about  23 that situation where an agent  an agent has a  24 legitimate  an objective security rationale, but acts  25 solely on the basis of animus and I think it would

1 support that kind of inference.  But I would urge the  2 Court to think, as it thinks about it about the flip  3 case, which is an agent who has an objective security  4 rationale  5  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But just  just tell me  6 what your answer to that case is.  What do you think  7  MR. GERSHENGORN:  The answer is it would not  8 be clearly established, that they  9  JUSTICE KAGAN:  And do you think it would be  10 unlawful?  Forget clearly established.  11  MR. GERSHENGORN:  The government's position  12 is if  although we haven't briefed it in this case  13 the government's position would be the one articulated  14 by Justice Scalia.  But we recognize that is not  15 something that the Court has yet held and so I think  16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't think that's  17 responsive to Justice Kagan's hypothetical.  Justice  18 Scalia's hypothetical, there is an objective reason for  19 stopping the car.  It's violating traffic regulations,  20 which is the broken taillight.  I understood my  21 colleague's question to be there is no objective  22 security rationale.  23  MR. GERSHENGORN:  I'm sorry.  I had  24 understood it differently.  Did you believe  I thought  25 you were saying there was an objective 
23

1  JUSTICE KAGAN:  I said both can throw a  2 grenade into the patio area, but in fact you only remove  3 the people who have the antiPresident sign  4  MR. GERSHENGORN:  So I took the fact  5  JUSTICE KAGAN:   notwithstanding that the  6 security consideration applies to both equally.  7  MR. GERSHENGORN:  So I took that to be that  8 there is an objective security rationale, and I think in  9 that situation, we would say that the  A, it's not  10 clearly established  but that we believe that the  11 better answer is the one from Justice Scalia because  12 there's an objective security rationale.  13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no.  I thought  14 the question was there's no differential security  15 rationale.  In other words, maybe it's not the question  16 my colleague asked, but I'll  17  JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, that is.  18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   I'll ask it.  19  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Okay.  20  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's say you have  21 to move the President in an emergency situation.  You've  22 got two options, go through the antiBush crowd or go  23 through the proBush crowd, and you've got to do it  24 right away.  Is it a justified security rationale to say  25 that we think it's more likely that it will be
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 problematic if you evacuate the President through the  2 antiBush crowd than through the proBush crowd?  3  MR. GERSHENGORN:  We do not think that would  4 be unconstitutional, Your Honor.  But  5  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So in other words,  6 the viewpoint itself constitutes a security  7 consideration?  8  MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's what this Court  9 said in Reichle, that there are times, not that it  10 inevitably  11  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so, your answer to  12 Justice Kagan is that it would be proper if you have  13 only 15 minutes, a limited amount of time, to move the  14 people with the  with the adverse  with the signs  15 that criticize the President?  16  MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's correct, Your  17 Honor.  We think that that  18  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So your answer to Justice  19 Kagan is that there is no violation if they move just  20 the Bush protesters.  That's your answer.  21  MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's correct, Your  22 Honor.  But I  and if I could just say a word or two  23 about the  24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know  I  25 thought what the Chief was going to say, there's no
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 differential reason to move one or the other.  Let's  2 assume you have an equal amount of time, you can get  3 everybody moved, and you just are choosing to move the  4 Bush  antiBush demonstrators.  5  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I understand  6 that this is an unattractive hypothetical for the  7 government's position.  And if I could explain why  8 nonetheless I think it's the right answer because the  9 flip side is if you have an agent who has a legitimate  10 security rationale and is going to move against somebody  11 who's hostile  who's showing a message that's hostile  12 to the President, you don't want that agent to hesitate.  13 That's what this Court said in Hunter.  The Court said  14 in Hunter there are times when we don't want a  15 reasonable official to hesitate before he acts and  16 nowhere is that more important than when the specter of  17 presidential assassination is in order.  18  But I want to be crystal clear that we don't  19 need that  I think I've said that before, but I just want to  20 make sure  that we don't that to win.  It just has to  21 be clearly established.  If I could  22  JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, suppose I add to my  23 hypothetical and I say  and the Secret Service goes to  24 the local police and says  and, you know, doesn't talk  25 about grenades at all and really just says we have got
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to get these antiPresident people out of here because  2 they're annoying the President; let's do it right now,  3 and that's what they do.  4  MR. GERSHENGORN:  I think, Your Honor, that  5 at some point you would cross over into a position where  6 you would say there  there is a real question about  7 whether there's an objective security rationale and we  8 would be in a situation  9  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, there is one.  I mean,  10 there is one in a sense of as we look back, we can see  11 that there's an alleyway and that somebody could have a  12 grenade, but there is evidence that that's not at all  13 what was in the heads of the Secret Service members.  14  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I recognize  15 that that is  as I said, I think that is a  that is  16 the  the hardest case for us and I recognize that's  17 why Your Honor posed it.  But I urge Your Honor to think  18 about from the flip side, which is if you adopted the  19 rule that Your Honor's question would  not attributing  20 to you, but might lead one to adopt, that the result is  21 an agent who has a legitimate security rationale but is  22 operating against people who are expressing a viewpoint  23 must hesitate.  24  And I think it's important in this context  25 to remember that what we have are Secret Service agents
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 who are making onthespot judgments while protecting  2 highlevel officials.  3  JUSTICE BREYER:  We understand that and I  4 think that that's the problem, and I think you're being  5 sort of picked at for this reason in my mind, and I  6 don't know if you have an answer to this.  I know  7 everyone understands the importance of guarding the  8 President in this country.  Everyone understands the  9 danger.  You can't run a risk.  At the same time, no one  10 wants a Praetorian Guard that is above the law, and we  11 have examples of history of what happens when you do  12 that.  So everyone is looking for some kind of line that  13 permits the protection but denies the Praetorian Guard.  14 And if you have anything to say that we're immersed in  15 details about how to get to that general objective, I  16 would love to hear it from either side.  17  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, very briefly,  18 then I'd like to reserve.  I think the simplest way to  19 reserve it is actually  to resolve this, is to hold  20 that it's not clearly established, that it's a mixed  21 motive case; it is not clearly established that the  22 situation Justice Scalia posed would be  23 unconstitutional; and that under Iqbal, that the  24 plaintiffs have not alleged what they would need to  25 allege under clearly established law, that it was the
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 sole motive for their actions and there was no  2 objectively reasonable security rationale.  3  I'd like to reserve the balance, Your Honor.  4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.  5  Mr. Wilker.  6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. WILKER  7  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS  8  MR. WILKER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it  9 please the Court:  10  The Plaintiffs have pled a plausible claim  11 for intentional viewpoint discrimination in violation of  12 core First Amendment principles.  We have done so for  13 three interrelated reasons and we've pled it as a sole  14 cause.  This was solely the cause, not security  15 rationale, but the sole cause of the move here was the  16 viewpoint being expressed.  17  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you have taken the  18 same position if all that had been was the first move,  19 that is, the move to Fourth Street?  Then there would  20 have been about an equal distance from the proPresident  21 demonstrators.  22  MR. WILKER:  I think that would be a more  23 difficult case for us to prevail because we wouldn't  24 have one of the prongs on which we rely, which is the  25 disparate treatment as one of the factors we rely on to
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 establish the inference of intent.  2  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then would you say  3 that you would have no tenable case if they moved them  4 just the one street over so they wouldn't be in a  5 position to throw a hand grenade to the patio?  6  MR. WILKER:  I think as a practical matter,  7 we would probably  we would likely not have as tenable  8 a case as we do.  If in fact the only reason for the  9 move was the officer's intent to move the antiBush  10 demonstrators further from where they were so that they  11 could be heard less well, that would in our view state a  12 claim for relief.  It would be a more difficult claim  13 because we are trying to establish intent and we're  14 trying to establish intent from the inferences from the  15 various facts that occurred that evening.  16  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, do you acknowledge  17 that  that the issue here is whether the law was  18 clearly established?  Do you agree with that?  19  MR. WILKER:  I think the  I think we  20 believe the law was clearly established by this Court's  21 precedents.  22  JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not saying whether you  23 believe it is.  Is that the  if you find it wasn't  24 clearly established, do you lose, is what I'm saying?  25  MR. WILKER:  Well, I think this Court's
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 qualified immunity precedents make that clear.  2  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Now, how can it be  3 clearly established if we have never held that there is  4 a Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment  5 violation?  We've never held that, have we?  How can you  6 possibly say that the violation here is clearly  7 established.  8  MR. WILKER:  I think you can, Justice  9 Scalia, hold  find from this Court's decisions in its  10 viewpoint discrimination holdings, like Rosenberger,  11 like R.A.V. v. St. Paul, like Pinette, where the Court  12 has clearly made it clear that viewpoint discrimination  13 is a pernicious form  14  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, it is pernicious.  But  15 is there a Bivens action for it?  The Constitution does  16 not create a cause of action for this.  1983 doesn't  17 cover this.  We invented it out of  really out of  18 nothing, and we have not extended that to First  19 Amendment violations up to now.  20  MR. WILKER:  Up to now.  And that argument  21 was not made below, nor preserved to  22  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, regardless of whether  23 it was made below, it certainly goes to the argument  24 that was made below and here, that the violation here  25 was not clearly established.

1  MR. WILKER:  Well, I think it's different to  2 say whether or not there is a remedy for the violation  3 as to whether the violation was clearly established.  4  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, okay.  5  MR. WILKER:  The violation was clearly  6 established.  Whether or not there is a remedy for that  7 violation under Bivens  8  JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a good point.  9  MR. WILKER:   is a different question.  10  JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a good point.  11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Wilker, let's  12 say something happens back in the patio area where  13 you  you're the head of the Secret Service detail.  14 You've got to evacuate the President right away.  Do you  15 go through the antiBush crowd or through the proBush  16 crowd?  You've got to decide right now quickly.  I'm  17 serious.  You have to make a splitsecond decision.  18 Which way do you go?  19  MR. WILKER:  I think whichever way provides  20 the clearest egress.  21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  They are  22 both the same.  That was one of your propositions, that  23 there is no way to distinguish there.  24  It's too late.  You've taken too long to  25 decide.  It's a serious point.
32

Alderson Reporting Company

1  MR. WILKER:  It is a serious point.  2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You've got to decide  3 like that.  4  MR. WILKER:  But that's not the position  5 that  that's not the position the agents were in on  6 October 14, 2004.  7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  I know.  But if  8 we're trying to decide whether viewpoint can ever be a  9 security justification, we have to consider all of the  10 possible situations.  11  So again, if you had to decide right now do  12 you go through the antiBush crowd or the proBush  13 crowd?  Guns are going off, explosions.  Which way do  14 you go?  15  MR. WILKER:  I truly don't know the answer  16 to your question because I'm not  17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Really?  18  MR. WILKER:   a security expert.  I don't  19 know where the guns are coming from.  I don't know what  20 the  21  JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're the farthest thing  22 from a security expert if you don't know the answer to  23 that one.  24  (Laughter.)  25  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's actually not much
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of an answer for lots of reasons, but the most, if you  2 don't know, how are we supposed to know?  3  MR. WILKER:  Well, because that's not the  4 issue that's presented to this Court for decision today.  5 We're  this is not a case in which the Secret Service  6 made a splitsecond judgment as to which evacuation  7 route to take with the President.  8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but with  9 respect, my point is that we do have to adopt a general  10 principle, and if we say viewpoint can never be a  11 consideration, then you have to say when there is an  12 emergency going on, it's just as likely there will be a  13 problem if we go through the proBush demonstrators or  14 the anti ones, which seems to me to be, on its face,  15 implausible.  16  MR. WILKER:  Well, in the context of an  17 emergency, there may be a different rule than there  18 would be in the context of a considered decision to take  19 viewpoint into account in making a decision, which is  20 what we have alleged here.  21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So then you think  22 there  well, there may be situations in which  23 viewpoint alone may be a security consideration.  24  MR. WILKER:  There may be.  And I think if  25 there were individuals directly in proximity to the
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 President, not, you know, 90 feet or 80 feet away, but  2 directly, could the Secret Service take into account, I  3 think that's what this Court said in Reichle, is that  4 the Court can into account where it said in the  5 proximity of the President, or in that case the Vice  6 President.  7  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Wilker, do you concede  8 that, looking back on this just in a hindsight kind of way,  9 that there is an objective security rationale here, that  10 they are standing at the foot of the alleyway, that you  11 could throw a grenade into the patio area?  Do you  12 concede that just looking at the situation and not  13 thinking, not taking into account any evidence of what  14 was in their heads, that there in fact is an objective  15 security rationale for moving people from this area?  16  MR. WILKER:  I think if you  if the  17 concern was the mouth of the alley and that the riot  18 geared police guarding the mouth of the alley were not  19 sufficient to protect the alley and protect against that  20 kind of incursion, the more simple solution in this case  21 would simply be to move people slightly to the east or  22 west where they had buildings between them and the  23 President.  24  JUSTICE BREYER:  The question is, what is  25 there are so many different theories floating in this
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 case that I've had a hard time trying to figure out what  2 you want me to decide  on what theory you want me to  3 decide.  Is your allegation that the Secret Service  4 agents were motivated in part by security reasons and in  5 part by bad  what you would say, bad viewpoint  6 reasons?  Or is your theory the Secret Service was  7 motivated only by viewpoint and zero by security?  8  MR. WILKER:  It's the latter.  9  JUSTICE BREYER:  It's the latter.  Okay.  So  10 then if it is the latter, I think you're hearing the  11 government saying, yes, that is clearly established,  12 that they could not in fact be motivated only by bad  13 viewpoint reasons and zero by security, and therefore,  14 you have stated a claim, if your complaint does say what  15 we both just agreed you wanted to say.  16  JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think the  17 government has conceded that.  18  JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Maybe they  19 didn't and I have to decide that.  20  JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think the government  21 conceded that at all.  22  JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Then I would have to  23 decide is it the case that if the Secret  if the  24 Secret Service was motivated not at all by security and  25 a 100 percent by viewpoint, does that state a claim?

1 Now, we'd running into the Bivens problem, et cetera.  2  But leaving all that out of it, the next  3 question would be, which I haven't heard argued yet,  4 which is why I raised this, what more do you have to do  5 than state a claim?  5 years ago, I would have thought  6 nothing, that if you have an absurd claim, I'm not  7 saying it's absurd, but if it were absurd, a district  8 court could deal with that.  They would deal with it by  9 giving you 5 minutes of discovery and then saying hum,  10 or 10 minutes plus summary judgment.  Or have you really  11 certified this under Rule 11?  Are you kidding?  Be  12 careful.  Or you know, they have five or six different  13 weapons.  Now, that is what you're arguing, I think.  14 But then along comes Iqbal.  15  MR. WILKER:  Uhhuh.  16  JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, it's a long way of  17 focusing you on that question.  18  MR. WILKER:  And so in Iqbal, this Court  19 said to be plausible it has to be something more than  20 possible.  But it  plausibility is not probability.  21 And the way we establish intent is rarely through the  22 admission to a local law enforcement or to someone else  23 that the agent acted for an impermissible reason.  24  What we do to establish intent is plead  25 facts from which intent can be inferred.  We believe we
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 have pled  pleaded facts from which intent can be  2 inferred, both with respect to the disparate treatment,  3 with respect to the time that elapsed from the  4 President's decision to dine, from the time he sat down,  5 and then 15 more minutes until the decision was made to  6 move the demonstrators.  7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Iqbal says a  8 little bit more than that, not that you just have to  9 allege facts.  In Iqbal, and just quoting here from page  10 681, the Court goes on to consider the factual  11 allegations in the complaint to determine if they  12 plausibly suggest an entitlement, and they go on to say,  13 but given more likely explanations, they do not  14 plausibly establish this purpose.  15  So based on just your complaint, we have to  16 determine whether there are more likely explanations.  17 And we have in your complaint the idea that they are at  18 the front of the alleyway, it's a sixfoot wooden fence.  19 Can we  we certainly can look at those in deciding not  20 simply whether you've pled the cause of action, but  21 whether it's more plausible than those other  22 justifications.  23  MR. WILKER:  I think, though, once we meet a  24 certain threshold of plausibility, unless the competing  25 inference is so compelling to make our claim
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 implausible, that it involves at the pleading stage such  2 a great burden that no plaintiff could ever satisfy it.  3 The Secret Service or any defendant could always  4 could always articulate some rationale for their action  5 that would create a competing inference.  6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's what we said  7 in  8  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Wilker, sorry to take  9 you back to this, but in this  10  MR. WILKER:  Right.  11  JUSTICE KAGAN:   case, do you concede that  12 a reasonable officer, even if not these officers, these  13 officers might have had a terrible motivation, but that  14 a reasonable officer could look at this map and say,  15 look at the distance between the alley and the outdoor  16 patio, you can throw an explosive in there, that seems  17 really bad, let's get these people out of the way?  18 Could a reasonable officer have said that?  19  MR. WILKER:  Could a reasonable officer have  20 said that, that given the proximity?  Certainly that's a  21 possible conclusion.  I can't say that that's an  22 impossible conclusion.  23  But the answer to that  it doesn't,  24 because the answer to that is to take a measured  25 response consistent with the Secret Service's own
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 guidelines, which is not to take viewpoint into account,  2 to be respectful of those First Amendment rights of  3 people who are demonstrating on the public streets in  4 the center of town.  This is core.  5  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And have you  you've  6 conceded that there would be a security interest, in the  7 hypothetical that Justice Kagan raised, that there are  8  people are in front of that alley where they could  9 throw a grenade.  Once you concede that, then you say,  10 but the security interest, the valid security interest  11 is washed away because, in fact, it was reported.  12  MR. WILKER:  I think there's a distinction.  13 Could there be a security interest?  Yes, there could  14 hypothetically be one.  Was there one?  We say there was  15 not, for the reasons articulated in our briefs and for  16 the constellation of facts that we have alleged in our  17 complaint.  18  JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not sure I understand  19 that, because it seems to me there either is or isn't a  20 valid security interest.  Now, whether they acted  21 because of that valid security interest is, of course, a  22 different question, and you might say, well, there was a  23 valid security interest, but that's not why they acted.  24  But as to the first question, I mean, there  25 either is one or there isn't one, no?  And we look at it
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and we say, what would a reasonable police officer think  2 of the security interest here?  What would a reasonable  3 police officer do?  Would he clear this area or not?  4  MR. WILKER:  The  the question is whether  5 proximity alone of a peaceful group of protesters is  6 enough to create a security; and in hindsight, you could  7 look at that and you could conclude that.  I  8 respectfully disagree that that means there was one on  9 the evening in question.  That's a factual question.  10 Was there, in fact  11  JUSTICE BREYER:  You say in your complaint,  12 "The Defendants claim that Defendant Secret Service  13 agents told Tao and the police defendants that the  14 reason for the Secret Service's request or direction was  15 that they did not want anyone within handgun or  16 explosive range of the President.  To the extent the  17 agents, in fact, made such an assertion, the assertion  18 was false, and the Defendant Tao and police defendants  19 knew or should have known that it was false."  20  So you think it's false.  They think it's  21 true.  That's called a dispute of fact.  And the normal  22 circumstance is that the judge has various weapons at  23 his disposal, legal weapons, to try to prevent  to try  24 to prevent court's time being wasted, officer's time  25 being wasted and other's time being wasted on factual
41

Alderson Reporting Company

1 allegations that are unlikely to be true.  That was true  2 before Iqbal as well as after.  That's your position,  3 isn't it?  4  MR. WILKER:  Well, yes and no.  I mean, I  5 think "unlikely" may be the wrong word.  And this case  6 in  Court in Swierkiewicz said it doesn't matter  7 whether the case  it's not a question of whether the  8 case is likely to be proven true.  The question is have  9 you pled enough.  Now, clearly that preceded Iqbal, but  10 Iqbal didn't purport to change that calculus.  11 Ultimately, we are still at the pleading stage.  We  12 believe we have pled enough facts to create a basis for  13 the inference of intent.  14  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what about the other  15 situation, which is similar to your case but not exactly  16 similar  not exactly the same.  You don't plead any  17 evidence of direct intent  any direct evidence of  18 intent on the part of the officers, but you have two  19 groups.  One's pro, one's anti, and the officers put one  20 group one place and one group the other place.  Now, the  21 distance from the President to the two groups is not the  22 same.  One is somewhat closer, one is somewhat farther  23 away.  The  the things that are in between the group  24 and the President are different.  Maybe in the group  25 that's further away, you might think the things are 
42

1 they might  one might think that there are fewer  2 obstructions, maybe there are more obstructions on the  3 other side.  So you plead that the  the placement of  4 the antigroup was less favorable than placement of the  5 progroup and is that enough?  6  MR. WILKER:  We acknowledge that's not  7 enough under this Court's precedence.  8  JUSTICE ALITO:  What more do you need?  9  MR. WILKER:  We  we do need to allege  10 personal participation and intent.  We understand  11  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you  you plead  12 intent.  Would you be  if you pled intent based just  13 on the disparate impact, would you be in violation of  14 Rule 11?  15  MR. WILKER:  I don't  I don't think we'd  16 be in violation of Rule 11.  I don't know that under  17 Iqbal that that would be enough.  I think prior to  18 Iqbal, that would have been enough.  19  JUSTICE ALITO:  What more would you need?  20  MR. WILKER:  I think you need other evidence  21 from which you can infer an intent and we've pled other  22 evidence.  One is the time that elapsed from the time  23 the decision was made, which lessens the  which  24 suggests and supports the inference  supports the  25 inference that it wasn't a securitybased determination,

1 but, in fact, was based on a viewpoint animus.  2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just to make sure,  3 we're talking about the 15 minutes between  4  MR. WILKER:  We're talking about both.  5  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Between when and  6 when?  7  MR. WILKER:  So we're talking about the time  8 the President made the decision and  and the initial  9 security arrangements were made approximately at 7  10 o'clock.  11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  12  MR. WILKER:  Then the President sat down at  13 approximately 7:15, and then another 15 minutes elapsed  14 before the decision is made to  to move the antiBush  15 demonstrators.  16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the first  17 they first cleared the alley, right?  18  MR. WILKER:  Yes.  19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then the  20 movement that you're concerned about.  21  MR. WILKER:  Right.  22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, doesn't it make  23 sense, just hypothetically, if you're the Secret Service  24 agent and you suddenly have this challenge dropped in  25 your lap at the last minute, you say, okay, here's the
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 thing, the first thing we've got to do is clear the  2 alley, right, because that's right up against where he's  3 standing.  So you take care of that.  You clear the  4 alley.  Then after you have more time to assess the  5 situation, you say, okay, now we've got to get these  6 people who are at the foot of the alley, we've got to  7 move them.  8  In other words, they had to act not in an  9 emergency situation, but reasonably quickly and they did  10 it step by step.  11  MR. WILKER:  And we understand that's the  12 competing inference that the government has offered  13 here.  We respectfully disagree that on the facts that  14 we've alleged that that's so compelling that it renders  15 our allegation implausible.  16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But here's where we  17 get back to Iqbal.  It doesn't have to be so compelling.  18 It simply has to be more likely, is the quote from Iqbal  19 on 681, and it has to be an obvious alternative  20 explanation.  And that's enough, no matter what you've  21 alleged.  22  MR. WILKER:  But we rely on the language  23 elsewhere in Iqbal, which we think has to be read  24 together, which is, plausibility doesn't mean  25 probability.  And so if  if the contention is that if
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 there's a more likely explanation, ours is then  2 then  then we're being held to a probability standard  3 that this Court said we weren't being held to on a  4 pleading standard, and which we would suggest to the  5 Court is not consistent with Rule 8 with a short and  6 plain statement of the claim.  Again, we haven't had an  7 opportunity to develop a factual record here.  8  JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  How do you do  9 that?  Because I want to follow up on just what the  10 Chief Justice said.  Imagine that what he just said is  11 the real case.  You have a client, imagine, who's quite  12 sincere, absolutely sincere, and really feels he was  13 very badly treated, and you can sign a Rule 11  14 statement, but suppose that the facts are just what he  15 said.  Then suppose that Iqbal were not the law.  Forget  16 Iqbal for the moment.  17  Now, you've got my hypothetical.  18  MR. WILKER:  I think so.  19  JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  What weapons  20 does the district judge have, which I have so blithely  21 been assuming, to prevent a waste of time by the Secret  22 Service, a demoralization of the service leaning in the  23 direction of being overly careful and therefore risking  24 the President.  What procedural weapons does the present  25 law, absent Iqbal, give him to dispose of a case quickly
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 without disturbance if the true facts are what the Chief  2 Justice said?  3  MR. WILKER:  Well, I think there has to be  4 some opportunity to develop a factual record.  And the  5 trial courts have ample authority to control discovery  6 under the Rules of Civil Procedure.  7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So discovery is your  8 answer.  And of course it is.  You've got allegations.  9 You're going to go to trial.  The first thing you're  10 going to do is file interrogatories, you're going to  11 file requests for admission, you're going to file  12 discovery requests to the Secret Service.  And the  13 district court's going to have to allow some of that,  14 isn't he, if he's allowed your allegations to go  15 forward?  16  MR. WILKER:  I think  I think the Court  17 would have to permit us to engage in some discovery of  18 the agents regarding are there reports of the events of  19 the evening?  Do they admit certain facts or deny them?  20 Should we have an opportunity to take brief depositions  21 of the agents?  And I think those are appropriate steps.  22 That's not full and unbridled discovery.  The rules  23 already limit discovery to a certain degree.  The  24 presumptive limits on depositions.  They  25  JUSTICE BREYER:  But what about  what
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 about the  2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The first thing  3 you'd want  I say the first thing you'd want to know  4 is whether this was a departure from established policy.  5 So the first question in  if I were drafting  6 interrogatories would be, what is your policy with  7 respect to moving demonstrators at a presidential event?  8 What do you do?  And I can see the Secret Service  9 saying, well, that's kind of a bad thing to make it  10 public because there are people out there who want to  11 kill the President, and if you go through your discovery  12 and say, this is how we look at that situation, this is  13 what we do, that gives people a  a guideline for how  14 to break through the security arrangements.  15  MR. WILKER:  Well, the court  the trial  16 courts, the district courts have  also have ample  17 authority to enter protective orders.  There has been no  18 assertion that the information that would be required  19 here, and we don't know because we haven't gotten to  20 that stage, and I think it's premature to get to that  21 stage whether there would be any claims of secrecy that  22 would limit what we could or could not do in the context  23 of discovery.  But those are matters that can be best  24 addressed by the district court in the first instance,  25 and can be addressed by the normal and appropriate means
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that district courts use all the time to address  2 sensitive information when it's presented as part of the  3 lawsuit in Federal court.  4  JUSTICE ALITO:  What  then what does  5 happen if a district court does allow discovery of  6 things what the Secret Service thinks are confidential?  7 Under certain  how far should demonstrators be away  8 from the President?  How high must a fence be before we  9 think that it provides security against a thrown object?  10 Suppose the district court allows discovery of all of  11 that.  What are they supposed to do?  12  They have to file a mandamus petition with  13 the court of appeals and get  have the court of  14 appeals  try to persuade the court of appeals to  15 review a discovery order?  16  MR. WILKER:  I think that ultimately is one  17 remedy and it's a remedy provided for in our system  18 whenever we have an issue in which sensitive information  19 may be involved in connection with a Federal lawsuit.  20 That's not  it's not an answer to say that simply  21 because there might be some information that the Secret  22 Service would rather not share, that that should stop us  23 in our tracks to begin with.  Those are the kinds of  24 determinations that a district court should be trusted  25 to make in the first instance and which district judges
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 make every day in this country.  2  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was  in Judge  3 Berzon's opinion, she seemed to think it was very  4 important that when the President got into the motorcade  5 to leave only one side had access.  So leaving aside  6 what happened when the group was moved, would you take the  7 position that not moving them back before the President  8 left was a violation of their First Amendment rights?  9  MR. WILKER:  We have not taken that  10 position.  We have not asserted that they had  that  11 there was an obligation to hold the President in  12 position so that the demonstrators could be moved back  13 to their former position.  14  Our position is they shouldn't have been  15 moved in the first place, because there wasn't a valid  16 security reason and that the reason they were moved was  17 solely because of the viewpoint they were expressing.  18 And the fact that that's not a separate claim that they  19 weren't moved back, but it is an indication that they  20 were removed from where the President would be passing,  21 in our view, that supports the inference of viewpoint  22 discrimination.  23  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The question of mixed  24 motive or improper motive, if we can get back to that  25 for just a minute.  Assume that the law  and this is
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the Wren case  is as follows.  If there is improper  2 motive for an arrest, but that there was an objective  3 basis that would have made the arrest and that did make  4 the arrest reasonable, there is no violation of the  5 Constitution.  6  Assume that's the law and forget clearly  7 established, forget  assume that's the law.  It seems  8 to me that for you to prevail, you have to say we should  9 make a First Amendment exception because the First  10 Amendment is so important.  Or that there has to be, in  11 another context, an amendment for racial profiling.  So  12 that the rule that I have just stated has to be  13 qualified in some way.  It seems to me you almost have  14 to say that in order to prevail in this case.  15  MR. WILKER:  I would suggest to you that  16 Wren is the exception, that Wren in the Fourth Amendment  17 context, that says if there is an objective  if there is  18 an objective basis, I think that's reflected in Reichle.  19 But as the Court in Iqbal noted, in the First and Fifth  20 Amendment context, at least in the context of State  21 actors, the Court has held that invidious intent is a  22 basis for liability.  Intent to violate those  23 constitutional rights is a basis, and so  24  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  I'm not sure.  25 If you stop a car because you think the participants in
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it were coming back from a protest against President  2 Bush, is that a Fourth Amendment case or a First  3 Amendment case, if that's your allegation?  4  The only reason the car was stopped was  5 because of the viewpoint that these people have.  Is that a  6 Fourth Amendment case or a First Amendment case?  7  MR. WILKER:  No.  That would be a First  8 Amendment case.  9  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah, I would think so.  10 And you think that so long as you make that First  11 Amendment allegation, it doesn't matter if you have a  12 broken taillight.  13  MR. WILKER:  I think for the terms of the  14 First Amendment claim, it wouldn't matter if the  15 circumstances demonstrated and created a basis for that  16 inference of intent.  17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.  18  JUSTICE ALITO:  Just out of curiosity, was  19 there anything to prevent someone from leaving one these  20 groups and going over to the other group?  21  MR. WILKER:  There was after the President  22 made the decision.  The allegations in the complaint  23 state that the local law enforcement restricted  24 movements between the two groups after the security  25 perimeter was established.  26  JUSTICE ALITO:  Somebody couldn't have just
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 walked away and taken a circuitous route and gone to the  2 other group?  That would have been  the police would  3 have stopped them from doing that?  4  MR. WILKER:  Is it theoretically possible  5 that they could have taken a large enough circle around  6 there?  I think that is a theoretical possibility.  But  7 the police did in fact stop movement across Third  8 Street.  9  One of the factors that we haven't addressed  10 today is the Secret Service's actual policy and practice  11 that we've alleged in our complaint.  And that plausibly  12 and convincingly supports the inference of intent here.  13  We've alleged not less than 12 other  14 incidents during the first 4 years of the Bush  15 Administration in which Secret Service agents were  16 involved in viewpoint suppression activities.  Now, we  17 haven't proven those, but again we are at the complaint  18 stage.  19  That allegation, along with the official  20 policy of the Bush White House to suppress dissent at  21 presidential appearances, also supports the inference  22 that these officers were acting for a viewpoint  23 suppressive reason.  24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose you would  25 then seek discovery with respect to those 12 other
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 episodes, because you're saying those are viewpoint  2 discrimination, how can you decide until you know the  3 facts of those?  4  MR. WILKER:  We would seek certain limited  5 discovery with respect to those incidents to see if they  6 bear out the allegations that we have made.  7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The same range of  8 things that we talked about earlier:  Interrogatories,  9 requests for production, discovery, with respect, not  10 just to your case, but to the 12 others?  11  MR. WILKER:  To the extent that the Secret  12 Service denies that those allegations or that these  13 officers deny those allegations in an answer, which we  14 haven't yet seen  15  JUSTICE SCALIA:  You wouldn't seek limited  16 discovery; you would seek unlimited discovery.  17  (Laughter.)  18  JUSTICE SCALIA:  You might get only limited  19 discovery, but  20  MR. WILKER:  I'm not sure I would seek  21 unlimited discovery, because then I might be  22 overburdened with material that would have no relevance  23 to the case.  What we would seek is information  24 sufficient to draw conclusions about those events and  25 whether they are sufficiently similar to support the

10  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 

11  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

12  MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

13 Justice: 

14  A couple of points.  First, I think, Justice 

15 Kagan, in response to your hypothetical, the concession 

16 that in hindsight there may have been a valid security 

17 rationale ends this case, because if it was true in 

18 hindsight, it was certainly true at the time in the kind 

19 of rapid  in the kind of rapid decisionmaking that was 

20 called for, as the Chief Justice alluded to.  I think at 

21 that point the case is over in our favor. 

22  Second, the kinds of discovery that 

23 my friend on the other side 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I just clarify a 

25 factual matter.  There are two alleyways.  There was one

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 on Third Street that the President went into, and then  2 there is one by the patio dining room.  What access was  3 there between Fourth Street and the patio?  Because I  4 thought that the alley was on California Street, the  5 entrance to the alley was on California Street.  6  MR. GERSHENGORN:  The entry to the alley is  7 on California Street.  That's the one where the  8 antiBush demonstrators were.  The alley that the  9 motorcade went through, which is on Third Street, which  10 is neither  neither group of protesters could get to because  11 the police had blocked off traffic north of California  12 Street so that  no protests, no demonstrators could  13 get there at all.  14  If I could return on the discovery point.  15 The discovery that my colleague has suggested he would  16 seek is exactly the nightmare scenario that the Secret  17 Service fears.  It's exactly what qualified immunity is  18 designed to prevent.  When there is a legitimate  19 security rationale, discovery into what the agents were  20 thinking, what the Secret Service's policies were is  21 exactly what there shouldn't be.  It's exactly what the  22 Court said in Hunter that it didn't want, which is  23 agents hesitating before they did their job.  24  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Gershengorn, suppose  25 it's originally set up by the police, the motorcade is
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 coming down, each side has roughly equal access.  Then the  2 Secret Service comes along and said:  Clear the  3 antiBush demonstrators.  Suppose that, that  those  4 were the facts.  Would there be a valid Bivens claim?  5  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, the question  6 would depend on whether there was a valid security  7 rationale.  I think in the context of a motorcade  8  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The rationale is just it's  9 more likely that the people who are against the  10 President would be harmful to him than the people who  11 are for him.  12  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I think that  13 would be a much more difficult case in the context of a  14 motorcade where the security of the President is much  15 different than when the President is on an outdoor patio  16 separated only by a small fence.  And I do think that  17 that is one of the major differences between where  18 the  the treatment of the proBush protesters and the  19 antiBush protesters here is that the  an allegation  20 that could be based on differential treatment because  21 the proBush protesters were in position to see the  22 motorcade when it left, and therefore, as the complaint  23 alleges in Paragraph 55, that that somehow undermines  24 the agents' security rationale for moving the antiBush  25 protesters during the meal, it just doesn't wash.
57

1  And then if I could turn just very quickly,  2 Justice Breyer, to your suggestion that the district  3 court could  could control discovery.  That's exactly  4 what the Court rejected in Twombly, exactly what the  5 Court rejected in Iqbal.  As a practical matter, once  6 that door is open, the agents lose the security and  7 peace of mind that they need and they're subjected to  8 the very burdens they shouldn't be subjected to.  9  And then if I could just close with a quick  10 point on the Iqbal.  We don't think under the  11 allegations here, as the Chief Justice pointed to the  12 key passage in Iqbal, that these allegations are any  13 more than consistent with the obvious alternative  14 explanation.  15  I've addressed the proBush protesters.  The  16 diners are very differently situated for a security  17 perspective because they had no anticipation of seeing  18 the President, and the Secret Service could screen  19 additional folks coming in.  It's very different from a  20 crowd outside an alleyway.  21  The advance manual that the other side  22 points to supports us, not them.  What it said is  23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish your  24 sentence.  25  MR. GERSHENGORN:  What it says, Your Honor,
58
