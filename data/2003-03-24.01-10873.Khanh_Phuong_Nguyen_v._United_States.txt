 2 (10:03 a.m.)
 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 first in Number 01-10873, Khanh Phuong Nguyen versus the
 5 United States and a companion case.
 6 Mr. Green.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 9 MR. GREEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 10 the Court:
 11 The issue in this case is whether the
 12 participation of a non-Article III judge on an improperly
 13 constituted panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
 14 renders the decision of that panel void.
 15 The parties are in agreement that the 16 designation of Judge Munson, who sits for a 10-year term
 17 on the Ninth Circuit panel, violated the statute
 18 pertaining to designations. But that statute does more
 19 work than simply govern designations. That statute
 20 protects the Article III character of the circuit courts
 21 of appeals by ensuring that only Article III judges are
 22 designated to sit on the Circuit courts of appeals.
 23 QUESTION: Counsel, may I ask you, in this case, is
 24 it possible that a quorum of the court would consist of
 25 two members of a three-member panel on the court of

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 appeals?
 2 MR. GREEN: Yes. A properly constituted
 3 quorum -- or a quorum of a properly constituted panel
 4 could -- could be two members. But our objection here,
 5 Justice O'Connor, is with the participation of a judge
 6 who, with all due respect, had no business being there in
 7 the first place.
 8 QUESTION: Right. Even -- even though the panel
 9 was unanimous.
 10 MR. GREEN: Even though the panel was unanimous.
 11 QUESTION: Now, if -- if we were to agree with
 12 you and it went back, could the same two remaining judges
 13 constitute a properly arranged panel and decide the case
 14 again?
 15 MR. GREEN: 
 No, for -- for two reasons. 16 Principally because the rules that govern quorum call for
 17 a -- a two-member panel rather than a three-member panel
 18 when there's some emergency that's certified or when
 19 there's a disqualification or recusal. So I -- I think
 20 there --
 21 QUESTION: The same two could be on a new panel,
 22 however.
 23 MR. GREEN: I would maintain not in this case
 24 for the simple reason that it appears that there has been
 25 some participation in the preparation of respondent's

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 brief by the Chief Judge, as well as Judge Goodwin. So we
 2 would maintain, given that involvement, it would be best
 3 to send this back to a newly constituted and
 4 properly constituted --
 5 QUESTION: Is this -- is this a right that can
 6 be waived? No objection was made to this.
 7 MR. GREEN: It is a right that can be waived,
 8 Justice O'Connor. There's -- there -- that's -- that I
 9 think is beyond peradventure. But I don't think there was
 10 waiver here because there's no record evidence that
 11 indicates that there was a waiver. This Court in New York
 12 v. Hill, for example, found a waiver --
 13 QUESTION: There was no objection.
 14 QUESTION: I'm surprised you say that there can
 15 be a waiver. 
 So the Ninth Circuit could routinely send 16 out to its litigants a waiver notice waiving participation
 17 of non-Article III personnel and there would be no
 18 structural objection? I -- I thought --
 19 MR. GREEN: Well, I think --
 20 QUESTION: I thought the whole point of -- of
 21 your -- of your error analysis is this affects the
 22 structural integrity of the court and it can't be waived.
 23 MR. GREEN: Well, the additional point I was
 24 going to make in response to Justice O'Connor's question
 25 is that, in fact, even though there may be consent or even

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 though there may be waiver, that has not stopped this
 2 Court from considering these important structural
 3 limitations in the past.
 4 QUESTION: Well, but what -- what is your
 5 position? Can the right be waived or not? I mean, if --
 6 if you say the right can be waived, then it's just a
 7 question of whether or not they knew or should have known
 8 or something like that.
 9 MR. GREEN: I think that the decision is void,
 10 and so the position -- the position would be that although
 11 all Article III provisions can be waived, in this instance
 12 because of the nature of the structural error, the consent
 13 or the waiver would not matter at all.
 14 QUESTION: Well, then -- then your -- counsel
 15 could have appeared in the Ninth Circuit fully aware that 16 Judge Munson was sitting, go all the way through the
 17 argument and the briefing, never mentioning a word about
 18 it, and still the counsel would have the ability to void
 19 the thing later.
 20 MR. GREEN: I -- I think that's -- that's
 21 correct. I think that would be the necessary consequence.
 22 QUESTION: And not to void if he -- if he won.
 23 Right?
 24 QUESTION: And not to void it if he won.
 25 QUESTION: That's a nice position to be in. You

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 just sit there, don't make any objection. If you win the
 2 case, everything is fine, and if you lose the case, you
 3 play dog in the manger and -- and come up here and say,
 4 oop, this was an improper panel. That doesn't sound to me
 5 the -- the -- like the way the system ought to work.
 6 MR. GREEN: But, Justice Scalia, I think that
 7 relies upon counsel in that situation being confident that
 8 this Court would grant a writ of certiorari. I -- I
 9 think that that kind of gamesmanship is really quite
 10 far-fetched. This Court does not sit as a court of
 11 errors. So even though I as counsel know that that might
 12 be error below, I would still have to -- I would have to
 13 be relying on the -- the equivalent of legal lightning
 14 striking, so to speak, in order to -- to be certain that
 15 that error would be corrected.
 16 QUESTION: Mr. Green, how does Article III --
 17 how can Article III be claimed by your client who was
 18 tried not before an Article III court, before a
 19 territorial court -- your client has no entitlement to an
 20 Article III court. So this seems -- you're addressing an
 21 abstract question about the proper composition of a Ninth
 22 Circuit panel. Yet, your litigant, your client has no
 23 entitlement to an Article III tribunal either at trial or
 24 on appeal. So I think that there's a serious problem of
 25 whether your clients are positioned to raise the proper

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 composition of an Article III court when they are not even
 2 entitled to an Article III court.
 3 MR. GREEN: That is true as a general matter at
 4 the trial court stage. However, it -- it's very much our
 5 position here -- and I would disagree with the premise
 6 only insofar as you said as to the court of appeals. 
 7 Congress vested jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.,
 8 section 1291, over appeals from the territories in the
 9 United States Circuit Court of Appeals.
 10 QUESTION: Yes, but it didn't have to. In other
 11 words, a case -- an Article III -- a case in which
 12 litigants are entitled to an Article III tribunal then
 13 must go to an Article III court. Here Congress did
 14 designate the Ninth Circuit to hear these appeals from
 15 non-Article III trial courts. 
 But your clients -16 Congress didn't have to do that with respect to your
 17 clients. Congress could have given them an Article IV
 18 appellate tribunal and that would have been okay.
 19 MR. GREEN: No. I -- When Congress vests
 20 jurisdiction in the United States courts of appeals, it
 21 does so not only to its -- in accordance not only with its
 22 plenary power over the territories under Article IV, but
 23 also pursuant to Article III. When Congress creates any
 24 inferior court and creates a jurisdiction in those courts,
 25 we would maintain that -- that Congress is acting pursuant

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 to Article III. And in this instance --
 2 QUESTION: But when Congress created the
 3 district court for the Northern Marianas, for Guam, what
 4 authority was it exercising?
 5 MR. GREEN: It was -- it was exercising its
 6 plenary authority pursuant to Article IV.
 7 QUESTION: I -- I assume you've got a -- maybe
 8 I'm wrong, but I assume you've got a fall-back and that
 9 is, okay, if you don't accept -- we don't accept the
 10 constitutional position, you're still claiming that you
 11 have a legal entitlement to the Ninth Circuit and, hence,
 12 to a completely Article III court.
 13 MR. GREEN: That -- that's exactly correct.
 14 QUESTION: And that could be true if Congress
 15 was acting under -- under Article IV.
 16 MR. GREEN: That -- that's correct. Even if
 17 Congress was acting under Article IV, the statute plainly
 18 vests jurisdiction, and it -- and it provides for
 19 independent -- independent review of these appeals by an
 20 Article III court.
 21 To -- to -- as respondent suggests, to -- to
 22 argue that a panel of the court of appeals could be
 23 specially constituted for these appeals would rewrite
 24 section 1291. Section 1291 says in very plain terms that
 25 jurisdiction shall vest in the court of appeals.

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Mr. Green, suppose -- suppose I
 2 disagree with you that -- that you -- you can sit through
 3 a trial and not object with -- with impunity, and -- and I
 4 think that you lose here unless you can show plain error
 5 and the usual requirements for avoiding the rule about --
 6 about contemporaneous objection. Why do you come within
 7 the plain error requirements and, in particular, the
 8 requirement that -- that there have -- that -- that the
 9 mistake seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or
 10 public reputation of judicial proceedings? Why -- why is
 11 that the case?
 12 You acknowledge that your client could have been
 13 tried by non-Article III judges. You acknowledge that the
 14 judge who sat, although he was non-Article III, was a
 15 Federal judge properly appointed. 
 He could have tried 16 your client. So how can I say that this -- that the
 17 proceeding -- yes, there was a -- there was a mistake, but
 18 did -- was it -- was it a mistake that seriously affected
 19 the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the
 20 proceeding? I -- I just don't see that.
 21 MR. GREEN: In the following senses, Justice
 22 Scalia, it did affect it.
 23 First of all, with respect to fairness, the
 24 Ninth Circuit is -- is a court of fully independent
 25 review, and I would maintain that precisely because the

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 petitioners here were tried by an Article IV court, it
 2 makes sense, and it may actually be constitutionally
 3 required that in some sense their -- their appellate
 4 review is had by an Article III court.
 5 But in any event, Congress statutorily vested
 6 jurisdiction in a fully independent Article III court, and
 7 as a result of doing so, to put Judge Munson who sits for
 8 a 10-year term on a panel as a co-equal participant would
 9 affect the fairness of the court. We have a unique --
 10 QUESTION: Suppose the panel had included a
 11 judge who was holding a recess appointment, a Federal
 12 judge who was appointed on a recess basis and therefore at
 13 that point didn't have secure tenure?
 14 MR. GREEN: I -- I think there would be issues
 15 of -- of qualification there, and there might even be -16 where a -- a recess appointment was -- was held in a -- in
 17 a qualified sense, then I would say that was an
 18 Article III -- an Article III qualification for an
 19 Article III court potentially. If there were issues as
 20 to the qualification, we might be in the realm of the
 21 de facto officer doctrine.
 22 QUESTION: But Justice Scalia's question, at
 23 least as I understood it, I think meant for you to
 24 concentrate on why -- why this would bring the
 25 administration of justice into disrepute, so to speak.

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. GREEN: Well --
 2 QUESTION: You -- you make your argument that
 3 this was improper, what was done, and the Government
 4 agrees. But there's an additional requirement here under
 5 plain error.
 6 MR. GREEN: Yes, and -- and I would add to my
 7 response to Justice Scalia that we have an amicus brief
 8 here from Judge Moore who sits in precisely the same seat,
 9 so to speak, that Judge Munson sits as a territorial judge
 10 in the Virgin Islands. The amicus brief of Judge Moore
 11 points out very plainly that he views himself as open to
 12 question with regard to his impartiality because he is
 13 subject to the hostile treatment -- to use Justice
 14 Douglas' phraseology, the hostile treatment of the press
 15 and the -- and the glowering disfavor of those who have in 16 their hands the power of reappointment.
 17 QUESTION: Gee, he -- he should resign if he
 18 feels that way, it seems to me.
 19 [Laughter.]
 20 MR. GREEN: He wants -- he -- he prefers that
 21 you convert him to an Article III judge, so --
 22 [Laughter.]
 23 QUESTION: I'm sure he does. I'm sure he does.
 24 QUESTION: I mean, you -- you have a -- a
 25 statutory argument.

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. GREEN: Yes.
 2 QUESTION: And you have a constitutional
 3 argument.
 4 MR. GREEN: Yes.
 5 QUESTION: All right. Let's assume away the
 6 statutory argument for the moment. There you have the
 7 problem -- you're -- you're right that it's contrary to
 8 the statute, but maybe it isn't plain error. I'm focusing
 9 only on the constitutional argument, and from the point of
 10 view of the constitutional argument, I would like you to
 11 assume the statute says the opposite. The statute says
 12 that this judge can sit.
 13 All right. So purposes of a constitutional
 14 argument, why can't your party waive -- why can't your
 15 clients have waived that? 
 My particular thought is that 16 we're just considering a case in which -- a different case
 17 in which it's at least arguable -- there are two sides to
 18 the argument -- whether two parties can get together and
 19 have a magistrate, who is not an Article III judge, try
 20 their case. The consent simply consisting of the fact
 21 they went ahead without objection. In that case, there's
 22 the statute, but for present purposes, we're assuming the
 23 opposite statute.
 24 So I mean, if it's at least arguable that you
 25 could have consent, shown only by the fact they went ahead

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 to a trial before a magistrate and that would be enough to
 2 validate constitutionally the magistrate trying the case,
 3 why isn't the fact that you went ahead here
 4 constitutionally sufficient to show that you agreed to the
 5 trial before -- the -- the appeal that included one judge
 6 from Guam?
 7 MR. GREEN: Because this Court has -- has said
 8 that the claims of structural validity, claims that go to
 9 the very validity of the tribunal itself, are claims which
 10 invoke institutional interests, not just personal
 11 interests --
 12 QUESTION: Now, I understand that, but my
 13 question is, how is that any more true or less true where
 14 what they've done is consent through behavior to trial of
 15 a case before a magistrate?
 16 MR. GREEN: Well, this Court has never -- this
 17 Court has never addressed the question of whether you can
 18 have --
 19 QUESTION: You think that magistrate trials --
 20 MR. GREEN: -- a trial --
 21 QUESTION: -- through consent are
 22 unconstitutional?
 23 MR. GREEN: I'm sorry?
 24 QUESTION: No, no. Sorry. I didn't mean to
 25 interrupt you. I jumped ahead to -- thinking what you

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 were going to say before listening to what you were going
 2 to say.
 3 [Laughter.]
 4 QUESTION: And I want to hear what you're going
 5 to say.
 6 MR. GREEN: I do that sometimes too.
 7 QUESTION: My fault.
 8 MR. GREEN: The Court has -- the Court has never
 9 before held that it would be permissible for a -- or for a
 10 magistrate to conduct a full trial. And that I would
 11 maintain because that also might affect institutional
 12 interests could also not be subject to waiver or consent.
 13 QUESTION: So are you saying --
 14 MR. GREEN: That's -- that argument is
 15 certainly --
 16 QUESTION: -- if we agree with you then, if we
 17 agree with you that consent through behavior is not good
 18 enough constitutionally, we would also be saying it is
 19 unconstitutional to have consent to a trial before a
 20 magistrate. You see, that's quite a -- a -- if you're
 21 going to say yes to that, that's a problem.
 22 MR. GREEN: No, I -- I understand that. But
 23 again, I'm -- I'm going to go to the dividing line between
 24 Article III interests and Appointments Clause interests
 25 and those structural limitations and structural

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 protections in the court system which are not quite the
 2 same as the kind of structural trial errors that this
 3 Court has addressed in -- in Gomez, that this Court
 4 addressed last term in Cotton. Those really are errors
 5 that go to the validity of the claim, not necessarily to
 6 the validity of the -- or to the very validity of the
 7 institutional interests.
 8 I think the hypothetical that you posit is
 9 actually Glidden, and in Glidden, this Court held that
 10 even where the designation of the judges from the Court of
 11 Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was
 12 lawful in that sense, the Court took pains to look and see
 13 whether the courts from which those judges were designated
 14 were Article III courts.
 15 QUESTION: 
 Well, Glidden -- really there was 16 no -- no opinion for the Court in that case.
 17 MR. GREEN: No, there wasn't, but the Chief
 18 Justice and Justice Clark in that case concurred in the
 19 result, and the difference that they had with the majority
 20 was that they didn't think that Bakelite and Williams
 21 should be deemed overruled, only that they had been
 22 superseded by subsequent events, including the grant of
 23 lifetime tenure to the judges on the Court of Claims and
 24 to the -- to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.
 25 QUESTION: But they -- they didn't join the

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 opinion, did they, of Justice --
 2 MR. GREEN: No. No, they did not. But I -- I
 3 would maintain that there was a -- a majority of five on a
 4 seven-member Court because two of the Justices had recused
 5 themselves. A majority of five.
 6 QUESTION: In the Government's brief, they
 7 mention a conversation with the Chief Judge of the Ninth
 8 Circuit by a former lawyer for your client. I'm curious
 9 to know, A, whether you disagree with what is said, and B,
 10 how did they get in -- how does that get before us?
 11 MR. GREEN: I can't answer the second question. 
 12 To be frank, I'd like to know the answer to the second
 13 question as well.
 14 But as to the first question, I really would
 15 start with the proposition that I don't think it matters. 16 I -- I don't think it matters here. The conversation,
 17 even as reported by respondents, would not in -- in my
 18 mind and in our position constitute a waiver or consent. 
 19 The issue of who hears your appeal is probably so
 20 important that it's necessary that that be done somehow in
 21 the defendant's presence.
 22 Respondent relies on Olano. In Olano, the Court
 23 took pains to point out that the defendants were present
 24 when the discussions of whether the -- the alternate
 25 jurors could deliberate or not. Here I would say this

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 is -- this would be the same sort of issue subject to the
 2 same sort of waiver and consent requirements.
 3 QUESTION: That's odd in a -- in a circuit that
 4 has the vast majority of its appeals decided without any
 5 oral argument. You said that the defendant has to be
 6 there? Your party has to be there?
 7 MR. GREEN: I think for -- he doesn't have to be
 8 there, but there would have to be some indication on -- on
 9 the record, in addition to the conversation that -- that
 10 respondents recite, that -- that Petitioner Nguyen
 11 understood that there was -- that -- that she was waiving
 12 some important right to a fully independent review by an
 13 Article III court.
 14 And I want to stress, as I say that, that --
 15 that this claim that respondents make with respect to 16 waiver and consent really affects only one of the
 17 petitioners here. We have to continue with the -- with
 18 the case of Petitioner Phan for whom no oral argument was
 19 made.
 20 QUESTION: But this important right that you --
 21 you were relying on, it's her right only because there
 22 happens to be a statute that sets up the Ninth Circuit as
 23 the appellate forum. You have recognized that she did not
 24 have any independent right to that kind of forum. She
 25 could have had -- since the court -- the -- the authority

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 at trial is determined by Article IV, similarly for
 2 territory authority on appeal.
 3 MR. GREEN: But even if she had only a statutory
 4 right in that sense, it's -- it is the case that Congress
 5 creates jurisdiction and creates the inferior courts
 6 pursuant to Article III under a statute. That doesn't
 7 mean that constitutional protections and constitutional
 8 rights don't attend the statutory grants of jurisdiction
 9 and -- and the activities of the courts that are created
 10 pursuant to Article III.
 11 There are numerous examples of -- of pure
 12 statutory rights. Let's take, for example, the right to
 13 appeal. That is merely a statutory right. This Court has
 14 not held that that's a constitutional right.
 15 QUESTION: 
 Yes, but ordinarily statutory rights 16 can be forfeited if you don't assert them at the earliest
 17 time when you reasonably could.
 18 MR. GREEN: That is -- that is true. But
 19 here --
 20 QUESTION: And I'm not using the word waiver. 
 21 It's not a question of a person consenting, but forfeiting
 22 by not raising it at the earliest reasonable stage.
 23 MR. GREEN: That is true, but this Court has
 24 held in cases that involve similar Article III issues and
 25 similar issues of the Appointments Clause that -- that

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 issues of consent and waiver are not dispositive. A
 2 fortiori then, I think issues of forfeiture would not be
 3 dispositive.
 4 QUESTION: I have one question on the merits I'd
 5 like to ask you. Let's assume we get to the merits of a
 6 constitutional question. I assume for that purpose that
 7 the statute says, the Ninth Circuit shall travel to Guam
 8 and hear appeals and for purposes of this -- for purposes
 9 of this voyage to Guam to hear the appeal, the make-up of
 10 the panel will be two Article III judges and one Article I
 11 judge. All right? That's the statute.
 12 Now, why is that unconstitutional? I cannot --
 13 it's very unusual, but I cannot think of any due process
 14 right of any Guam person who would be hurt, and I cannot
 15 think of -- why it's wrong to ask an Article III judge to 16 take on this additional adjudicatory function with an
 17 Article I judge sitting next to him. It's purely
 18 adjudicatory. It's not handing out radio licenses. It's
 19 not doing anything else that's unsuitable to a judge. Why
 20 not? That's the merits of the question, and I'm not
 21 saying it has an obvious answer, but I want to hear your
 22 answer.
 23 MR. GREEN: I'm going to give almost the same
 24 answer that -- that we would give as to -- as to our
 25 claims. It violates the Appointments Clause.

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: The Appointments Clause which wasn't
 2 even raised in the reply brief. I mean, that -- that's --
 3 or in the cert petition. Is that all? If it's not the
 4 Appointments -- I'll go look at that. Sorry. I just
 5 hadn't -- I was -- I was -- thought you were going to say
 6 something about the structural Article III problem.
 7 MR. GREEN: Well, I'm going -- I'm going to
 8 there as well --
 9 QUESTION: Okay.
 10 MR. GREEN: -- and -- and say that -- that if
 11 the judge was an Article I judge, that -- if that judge
 12 had lifetime tenure, then we would be back in the realm of
 13 Glidden again, trying to decide whether that court was
 14 actually an Article III court.
 15 QUESTION: No, no. 
 I say why -- why do you have 16 to -- the Ninth Circuit is an Article III court.
 17 MR. GREEN: Correct.
 18 QUESTION: My statute says that for purposes of
 19 hearing an appeal from Guam, two -- the Ninth Circuit
 20 hears it. The panel shall consist of two Article III
 21 judges and one Article I judge. Okay? Now, I want to
 22 know what in the Constitution forbids that statute. I'm
 23 not saying it's obvious one way or the other. I want to
 24 know. And it won't help just to say it forbids it. I
 25 want to know why it forbids it.

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. GREEN: It -- it forbids it because of the
 2 special nature of Article III courts. This Court has
 3 frequently noted that Article III courts are independent. 
 4 They have constitutional independence. They have
 5 constitutional salary protection. Article I judges are
 6 not independent in the same way.
 7 QUESTION: But this statute, in effect, says --
 8 if -- if you take that position, the statute, in effect,
 9 says, we don't want an Article III court. Let's -- let's
 10 concede that with -- with the one Article I judge sitting
 11 on it, it ceases to be an Article III court. But that --
 12 the statute says that. What's the matter with that?
 13 MR. GREEN: Well, we said in our brief that if
 14 Congress were acting to -- in accordance with its plenary
 15 power, which -- as I think Justice Breyer's hypothetical 16 poses, that might well be constitutional. I think
 17 there --
 18 QUESTION: So -- so that if Congress said, all
 19 right, we're going to have appeals from the territorial
 20 courts in a court consisting of one territorial judge and
 21 two Article III judges, however selected, no problem with
 22 that constitutionally. Right?
 23 MR. GREEN: I -- I think that is a very
 24 difficult and open question, and I -- and I think there
 25 might be a constitutional issue if we to back to Crowell

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 v. Benson, and -- and Crowell's reaffirmation in -- in
 2 Northern -- or rather, Thomas. There is a significant
 3 issue as to whether you can have territorial judges
 4 exercising precisely the same kind of almost Article III
 5 jurisprudence that district -- regular Article III
 6 district judges have and -- and not have some sort of
 7 Article III review from that.
 8 QUESTION: So you -- you would -- you would have
 9 the same problem if Congress said we're going to set up an
 10 Article IV court of appeals consisting of three Article IV
 11 judges. You'd have the same problem?
 12 MR. GREEN: I think that -- that claim can be
 13 made, as I say, on the basis of Crowell and -- and on the
 14 basis of Thomas.
 15 QUESTION: 
 Well, the claim can be made, but I 16 mean, would you make it? Do you think that is a sound
 17 claim?
 18 MR. GREEN: I think -- I think I would make it
 19 and I think I would make it for the following reasons. 
 20 Precisely because, as Justice Ginsburg points out, these
 21 Article IV judges, in trying cases and interpreting
 22 Federal law, are certainly doing the same kinds of work,
 23 exercising the judicial power --
 24 QUESTION: Yes, but you could make the same
 25 argument about trial judges and -- and Article III

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 district judges. They're doing the same kind of work. 
 2 They're subject to the same pressures and the same
 3 concerns, and if it's okay for the district court, why
 4 wouldn't it be okay for an appellate court?
 5 MR. GREEN: Well, I -- there is certainly
 6 Article III review. I'm not sure that -- that Article III
 7 review has been constitutionally mandated in that sense.
 8 But where there is no Article III protection in the first
 9 place with respect to -- to judges who are exercising that
 10 authority at the trial court level, Crowell v. Benson and
 11 I think Thomas indicate that -- that there is a -- there
 12 is an open question at least as to whether Article III
 13 review is mandated. And this Court said the same in
 14 Guam v. Olsen on -- on precisely the same issue.
 15 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for 16 rebuttal.
 17 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Green.
 18 Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.
 19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT
 20 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 21 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 22 please the Court:
 23 There is no dispute in this case that a
 24 statutory violation occurred, and there's also no dispute
 25 that no challenge was made to that violation below. The

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 narrow question presented is whether these individual
 2 defendants are entitled to reversal under the plain error
 3 doctrine --
 4 QUESTION: May I ask you a question at the
 5 outset? And actually two questions. Some years ago I was
 6 in London, and I was asked to sit with a British court on
 7 the bench. And I -- I didn't do it, but I often thought,
 8 well, I wonder if they would have let me participate in
 9 the decision.
 10 Supposing here, instead of the Article I judge,
 11 you had a British judge and they asked him to sit. That
 12 would be one question. Would that make it a different
 13 case? And secondly, what if they asked the President of
 14 the -- of the Guam Bar Association to sit as a third
 15 person on the panel? 
 Would that make any difference? 16 MS. MILLETT: The -- there certainly would still
 17 be a statutory violation in those cases absolutely.
 18 QUESTION: Yes. The same statutory violation
 19 you have here.
 20 MS. MILLETT: Absolutely.
 21 QUESTION: And would you just say that's
 22 harmless error?
 23 MS. MILLETT: Well, plain error I think is --
 24 QUESTION: Plain error.
 25 MS. MILLETT: -- a higher standard. I certainly

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 hope someone would object, but if they don't and assuming
 2 that it's a case coming out of the territory again, then
 3 we would go back to the same analysis and say whether --
 4 could Congress create -- if Congress could create a court
 5 that consisted of two judges and Guam --
 6 QUESTION: They could create a court with two
 7 judges and a British judge.
 8 MS. MILLETT: -- and a lawyer --
 9 QUESTION: Let's assume they could do it.
 10 MS. MILLETT: Yes.
 11 QUESTION: But with the statute we have now --
 12 MS. MILLETT: Yes.
 13 QUESTION: -- what would you do in that case
 14 that I asked you?
 15 MS. MILLETT: 
 The -- I think our position would 16 be the same as it is here.
 17 QUESTION: That would be perfectly okay.
 18 MS. MILLETT: I'm putting aside any sort of due
 19 process concerns that might apply --
 20 QUESTION: Well, wait.
 21 QUESTION: Well, that --
 22 QUESTION: To get -- to get due process, you --
 23 you get to -- you get to that portion of the plain error
 24 doctrine which says plain error applies if it seriously
 25 affects the integrity or fairness of the proceeding. And

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 if you have the President of the Guam Bar Association
 2 sitting on the court, doesn't that seriously affect the
 3 fairness of the proceeding in a manner that -- that having
 4 a -- an Article IV judge does not?
 5 MS. MILLETT: Well, in American Insurance
 6 Company versus Canter, which was opinion by Chief Justice
 7 Marshall at the beginning of this Nation, dealing with
 8 territorial cases, it addressed there a court that
 9 consisted of a lawyer and five -- I'm sorry -- a notary
 10 and five jurors in a territory --
 11 QUESTION: But that -- but that didn't -- that
 12 was not a court which in -- in other parts of its duties
 13 was not an Article III court. You're saying that you can
 14 become an -- be an Article III judge one day and Article
 15 IV judge the other day. 
 Or an Article III -- I should say 16 an Article III court one day, an Article IV court the next
 17 day. There's simply no authority for that proposition
 18 that I know of. Tell me if I'm wrong.
 19 MS. MILLETT: Justice Kennedy, I think there are
 20 difficult constitutional questions that would be raised if
 21 Congress were to prescribe this. I think based on the
 22 analysis in our brief, it is a statute we could defend. 
 23 But there would be difficult constitutional questions if
 24 that happened.
 25 What happened here was a mistake, not a

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 confrontation between the branches with Congress trying to
 2 change our --
 3 QUESTION: Well, but your position is there --
 4 there could be a waiver. I thought your answer to Justice
 5 Stevens was that the parties could waive.
 6 Suppose -- suppose that we issued this decision
 7 and -- and your position prevails. Everybody agrees that
 8 this appointment should not have been made. What's to
 9 prevent the Ninth Circuit from just asking the parties to
 10 please waive their rights under this case?
 11 MS. MILLETT: I think, Your Honor, what would
 12 prevent them is a decision from this Court declaring
 13 limitations on their statutory appointment power. And if
 14 this Court -- and if the Ninth Circuit --
 15 QUESTION: No. They waive that. 
 But suppose 16 the parties waive it.
 17 MS. MILLETT: And if -- and if the Ninth Circuit
 18 were to engage, which is not to be presumed by
 19 governmental officials, court or executive -- but were to
 20 engage in some pattern of violating the statute, I think
 21 this Court's supervisory authorities could take care of
 22 that.
 23 But in an individual case like this, where there
 24 was no assertion of the right, this question would still
 25 be the same. Did plain error occur that affected the

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 substantial rights of these particular defendants?
 2 QUESTION: Yes, but the interesting case
 3 under -- leave plain error out. I mean, you may be right
 4 on the plain error.
 5 MS. MILLETT: I hope so.
 6 QUESTION: But there is, I think, in Justice
 7 Stevens' question a very important implication. To get
 8 the due process part out of it, assume that the people in
 9 front of the court are not American citizens. Indeed,
 10 assume it's Judge Wald going to be appointed to the
 11 International Court. Now, there's no due process problem.
 12 So can the Congress appoint a sitting Federal
 13 judge to go to a foreign place where it's perfectly all
 14 right with the foreign people and hear their case? Now,
 15 I'm not sure. 
 But that's, I think, what they're arguing 16 is at issue here.
 17 MS. MILLETT: I --
 18 QUESTION: Not a due process problem --
 19 MS. MILLETT: Yes.
 20 QUESTION: -- but a question of what kind of
 21 function you can give to a sitting Federal judge because,
 22 after all, we have our two sitting Federal judges in the
 23 Ninth Circuit. They went out to Guam, in principle. They
 24 constituted themselves a different sort of tribunal,
 25 including the Article I judge, and no one claims that was

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 unfair to anybody in Guam. So there's no due process
 2 problem.
 3 Now, what's the answer?
 4 MS. MILLETT: I think, Your -- Your Honor,
 5 that -- that we would defend that statute, and we think
 6 that it would be permissible, assuming -- I mean, the -- a
 7 better way to approach it is that the analysis that would
 8 be applied would be as this Court did in Mistretta versus
 9 the United States. And you would focus on -- and a number
 10 of cases. You would focus on what is the nature of the
 11 job that's being imposed. It's a judicial function. It
 12 wouldn't be asked to do some sort of Article I function. 
 13 And would doing that function so distract or withdraw from
 14 the burden -- I'm sorry -- distract or interrupt the
 15 judge's -- or court's ability to function as an 16 Article III court. That would be the analysis.
 17 Now, to -- to put a finer point on it, in
 18 fact -- and the reason I have to take the position it
 19 would be okay, is Congress has enacted a statute,
 20 28 U.S.C. 297, which authorizes judges of the Ninth
 21 Circuit to go sit in the Freely Associated Compact States,
 22 which is Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, which are
 23 not --
 24 QUESTION: But that -- but that -- you're --
 25 you're -- there are two questions. One is can an

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Article III judge go to another court. That's not this
 2 case. This case is whether a non-Article III judge can go
 3 to an Article III court so that the Article III court is
 4 on some days an Article III court and some days not an
 5 Article III court.
 6 I -- I assume that the law of the circuit is
 7 something the Ninth -- Ninth Circuit is proud of. Is
 8 it going to now have under -- under your theory an --
 9 an asterisk by the opinions that are written by
 10 non-Article III judges so that that's not so much the law
 11 of the circuit? I mean, this -- this is the problem: 
 12 what happens to the court, not what happens to the judge.
 13 MS. MILLETT: No, I understand, Justice Kennedy. 
 14 There are two points to your question. I would like to
 15 get to them both.
 16 The first is, would it violate the Constitution
 17 to -- does it violate the Constitution to have someone
 18 who's not an Article III judge sit with the Ninth Circuit
 19 on a given day? And our position is that Congress could
 20 do it and that we would defend that statute based on the
 21 analysis I gave --
 22 QUESTION: So you think Congress could -- could
 23 authorize a State superior court judge to sit on this
 24 Court?
 25 MS. MILLETT: No, not on this Court. I think

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 this Court has unique status. The Supreme Court has
 2 unique status under the Constitution. There shall be one
 3 Supreme Court, and its composition is specifically defined
 4 by Article I and nobody in Congress has any authority or
 5 power to change that.
 6 But if you're talking about the territories,
 7 could Congress say they have no right to appeal at all? 
 8 Yes. Could Congress say your appeal will be within the
 9 limit -- as long as it doesn't violate due process or a
 10 fundamental right, will be to three State court judges? 
 11 Yes.
 12 Now, the more difficult question is, could you
 13 have the combination as we had here? And we think under
 14 the analysis of United States versus Mistretta, that would
 15 be okay, but in -- in particular, as to territorial 16 residents. But even if it's not --
 17 QUESTION: But, again, Mistretta involved the
 18 assignment of a judge to a commission. It didn't involve
 19 the delegation of duties to a court. And that's what
 20 you're -- and that's what you're saying, and that's quite
 21 different.
 22 MS. MILLETT: Yes.
 23 QUESTION: Under your theory -- forget the
 24 Supreme Court -- the Ninth Circuit could, if it was
 25 authorized by Congress, have a visiting State court judge

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 every day as the visitor of the day.
 2 MS. MILLETT: At least in territorial cases.
 3 QUESTION: And that would not impair its
 4 Article III character. I -- I just find that very
 5 difficult to believe.
 6 MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Kennedy, the way we
 7 get to this position is two steps. Is first -- there
 8 isn't, obviously, clearly on point, but if you add
 9 Mistretta to Morrison versus Olson, which had a delegation
 10 of non-Article III functions to -- to -- that's the -- the
 11 independent counsel case -- to the special division that
 12 appoints the independent counsel -- and so you combine
 13 that and you combine that with the precedents on sharing
 14 of power with magistrate judges -- those together -- and
 15 then add to all of that the very limited constitutional 16 rights to -- to a particular form of tribunal accorded to
 17 people in the territories.
 18 But I also wanted to get back -- we think that
 19 it could be defended. But even if the answer is no, we
 20 don't think the constitutional violation would be plain
 21 error.
 22 But to get back to your binding precedent point,
 23 which I think is an important one, it's -- there's three
 24 things to keep in mind.
 25 First of all, whether this is a binding

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 precedent or not has absolutely no effect on the claims of
 2 these individual defendants. Their position would be the
 3 same if the decision were unpublished. And I think the
 4 Ninth Circuit has itself in a difficult position here. It
 5 should address, in the first case, the power of this
 6 precedent.
 7 And it's not an issue this Court has never
 8 considered. In Glidden -- the Glidden Company case, the
 9 two concurring Justices specifically said -- they -- they
 10 agreed that the court was competent at least -- it was an
 11 Article III court -- after -- at least after Congress had
 12 passed the statute giving them that status. But if those
 13 two concurring Justices, which provided the most narrow
 14 ground for decisions in that case, specifically said that
 15 they would think -- they would uphold the validity of 16 those decisions that were issued prior to Congress'
 17 action. And I think this Court's de facto officer
 18 doctrine would speak to whether unchallenged --
 19 unchallenged opinions should at some point have --
 20 QUESTION: Ms. Millett, I'm surprised at the
 21 answers that you're giving, that they're not prefaced by
 22 what you said -- I thought you said -- in your brief which
 23 was that Congress did not enact a statute that allowed the
 24 Ninth Circuit to include one of these judges. The Court
 25 shouldn't speculate on the constitutionality of a

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 different statute. The statute that Congress, in fact,
 2 enacted said that it was wrong to include this judge, and
 3 so the only question should be what is the consequence of
 4 the Ninth Circuit having failed to follow the statute that
 5 Congress enacted instead of speculating on, oh, suppose
 6 Congress had, in fact, enacted -- enacted such a statute. 
 7 But you -- you seem to be engaging in the -- the
 8 hypothetical statute that Congress didn't enact to
 9 determine whether it would be constitutional.
 10 MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, we
 11 absolutely agree. I was trying to be responsive to
 12 questions that were posed. But we absolutely agree that
 13 this is not the appropriate case to address limitations on
 14 congressional power over appellate review in territorial
 15 cases.
 16 QUESTION: Well, I think it's -- I think it's
 17 sometimes not unusual for us to put a hypothetical case to
 18 test your proposition. And the proposition we are testing
 19 is whether there is a structural deficiency caused by a
 20 territorial judge sitting, either by accident or on
 21 purpose, if -- if there's such a -- a structural
 22 impairment of its constitutional role, of its
 23 constitutional integrity that there must be reversal. And
 24 the hypothetical is just simply designed to -- to
 25 illustrate the point.

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. MILLETT: Right. Well, Justice Kennedy, if
 2 we're talking about now reversal under the plain error
 3 doctrine, then the types of structural errors in which
 4 this Court has found reversal to be appropriate under the
 5 plain error doctrine to violate substantial rights or even
 6 to make harmless error analysis inapplicable have -- is a
 7 very narrow, small class. And those are -- those are
 8 errors --
 9 QUESTION: I -- I agree with you that that's --
 10 that that's a hard point in -- in the case.
 11 Let me ask you. Do we focus just on the rights
 12 of the -- of the litigant in this case? Or is it
 13 appropriate for us to consider the constitutional
 14 integrity of an Article III court? In other words,
 15 suppose we thought there was damage to the court, not 16 necessarily to the litigant. Can we take account of that
 17 in the plain error --
 18 MS. MILLETT: The -- the fourth prong of the
 19 plain error analysis is whether the -- the error seriously
 20 affected the fairness or integrity of judicial
 21 proceedings, which would seem to be responsive to -- to
 22 your concern, and that would be the appropriate place to
 23 put it.
 24 But I think it's important to understand that --
 25 that the types of errors that are deemed structural under

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the plain error -- I'm not talking about structure under
 2 Article III -- are things that go to -- and I think that
 3 would satisfy prong four -- are things that go to whether
 4 the court essentially functioned as a court. Does it --
 5 is it consistent with the basic precepts that underlie our
 6 judicial system? Was there race discrimination? Was it a
 7 public trial where they completely denied --
 8 QUESTION: But your position, as I understand,
 9 is this -- this right can be waived, and I'm not quite
 10 clear on why -- supposing we decide with you in this case,
 11 why next month the Ninth Circuit might go back and ask for
 12 written waivers from all the lawyers in Guam for -- to
 13 repeat the process and put on the president of the bar
 14 association as the third person on the panel. Why
 15 couldn't they do that?
 16 MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Stevens, we're
 17 asking this -- in theory that could happen, but I think
 18 we're asking this Court to decide this case on the
 19 assumption that judges, like executive officers, attempt
 20 to comply with the Constitution and don't intentionally
 21 file rulings of this Court or statutes --
 22 QUESTION: Well, they're complying with the
 23 rule --
 24 QUESTION: No, but if it's --
 25 QUESTION: -- if there's -- if there's a -- a

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 waivable right there, and they say we think it's in the
 2 interest of harmony between the judges and lawyers in the
 3 Ninth Circuit to let one of the lawyers sit with us and
 4 see how we work here a couple of times.
 5 MS. MILLETT: But -- right --
 6 QUESTION: And they're going to do this.
 7 MS. MILLETT: But, Justice Stevens, before this
 8 Court would address whether it's waivable, it would say
 9 whether it's wrong. This is isn't that something that was
 10 just --
 11 QUESTION: Well, you've already admitted it's
 12 wrong.
 13 MS. MILLETT: Right. And so I think it's one
 14 thing to have a right that -- that is -- that is, you
 15 know, parties can do with one way or the other and the 16 statute or the law doesn't speak to it. But where this
 17 Court -- if this Court were to agree with, I think, both
 18 of this in this case that this was wrong, that I don't
 19 think we would presume that the Ninth Circuit is going to
 20 go -- keep doing -- and -- and the Justice Department
 21 isn't going to defend it.
 22 QUESTION: No. But it's wrong only if you
 23 cannot waive it. In the -- the hypothetical is that --
 24 that the waiver is right up front, that the person says it
 25 would be wrong without the waiver, but I waive.

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. MILLETT: No, Justice -- Justice Souter. I
 2 think you can have errors that are wrong, but the question
 3 is whether in -- in -- by not objecting to that, they're
 4 entitled to relief. That's different --
 5 QUESTION: No, but the -- the question I --
 6 MS. MILLETT: -- than whether it's a right they
 7 can waive.
 8 QUESTION: Excuse me. But I think the question
 9 was why will this not -- this practice not be perpetuated
 10 if it is waivable. It is not an answer to that to say
 11 that -- the other courts will not gratuitously engage in
 12 unconstitutional action because, if the waiver is
 13 effective, there's no unconstitutional action. So it
 14 seems to me that on your position you have to face the
 15 fact that if it's waivable, it can properly happen again 16 if there's a waiver.
 17 MS. MILLETT: No, Justice Souter --
 18 QUESTION: Okay. Let me -- let me --
 19 QUESTION: The same --
 20 QUESTION: -- hear that with -- with what my
 21 follow-up question was going to be. And you can answer
 22 them both.
 23 Why -- instead of getting into waiver, why don't
 24 we say, under the plain error doctrine, look, everybody
 25 agrees that it was wrong? Everybody agrees that it was

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 plain. And there is, in fact, a serious question about
 2 the integrity of the court when the composition of the
 3 court is simply illegal.
 4 And so, if you want to stick to waiver, I don't
 5 know what the answer is to Justice Stevens' problem. 
 6 The -- the alternative to waiver is to face the fact that
 7 there's something seriously wrong with a court which is
 8 unabashedly illegally constituted.
 9 MS. MILLETT: Justice Souter, when we're talking
 10 about waiver here, we are talking about something that is
 11 unconstitutional, just like someone could waive their --
 12 can waive their right to an Article III tribunal, but if
 13 Congress passed a statute that violated it, it would still
 14 be unconstitutional for the court to sit in that manner. 
 15 We don't think this is an unconstitutional issue. But
 16 waiver is not the same as it's something the parties can
 17 freely take or drop because you have to go back and -- to
 18 the step before that and say this is wrong and it won't be
 19 done and it shouldn't be done.
 20 But if we assume that -- we're -- we're in the
 21 context of plain error analysis here. That's why the
 22 concept of waiver is being discussed. It's not whether a
 23 mistake was made or whether these people have the right
 24 freely to choose. They don't, under the statute, have the
 25 right freely to choose what the composition of the panel

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 will -- will be. We agree with that.
 2 But when no objection was made below,
 3 proceedings were completed, an appeal was completed
 4 without any objection, they fully and freely participated
 5 in that, and it was only after the outcome that they
 6 turned around to challenge the -- the composition of their
 7 court, that's an important value too.
 8 QUESTION: It seems to me the waiver would be
 9 stronger if it were in advance instead of afterwards. I'm
 10 positing a case where everybody agrees in advance we'll
 11 let the -- we'll let this director of tourism of our -- of
 12 Guam participate as a judge today because that will help
 13 the image of the court and so forth. Everybody agrees
 14 we'll let them try it. Why isn't that waiver more --
 15 QUESTION: The question isn't --
 16 QUESTION: -- more binding than the one we have
 17 here?
 18 QUESTION: And -- and Justice Stevens' question
 19 is important because this case has consequence --
 20 consequences and it tells Congress what might be done. 
 21 Congress might say, well, we won't put this burden of
 22 waiving a statutory right. We'll take away the statutory
 23 right and say that Article -- that -- that Article IV
 24 judges, territorial judges, can always sit on Ninth
 25 Circuit opinions involving Guam. That's -- that's why

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 we're testing whether or not there's a structural error in
 2 what occurs here.
 3 MS. MILLETT: And I think this Court's clear
 4 rules are that constitutional questions should not be
 5 decided unnecessarily. And it's not necessary to
 6 resolution of this case to say what would happen if there
 7 was a full decision by Congress to enact a statute to
 8 make it -- to engage a confrontation between the branches
 9 and to analyze whether that would be appropriate --
 10 QUESTION: Well, I thought --
 11 QUESTION: But -- but it is important because
 12 you're saying that it's just a statutory right.
 13 MS. MILLETT: And even if it's --
 14 QUESTION: And I'm -- and I'm suggesting that it
 15 might be more than that.
 16 MS. MILLETT: And -- and our position will be
 17 even -- we don't think it's a constitutional violation not
 18 because of what Congress can do or not do, but because
 19 even if it violates Article III, that's no injury to
 20 people who have --
 21 QUESTION: Right.
 22 MS. MILLETT: -- no Article III protections.
 23 QUESTION: There clearly is no due process
 24 problem. I'm mixed up now.
 25 MS. MILLETT: Mm-hmm.

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Suddenly we're talking about waiver. 
 2 Maybe I put that in as a -- it's a kind of red herring. 
 3 It's not a question of waiver. It's a question of whether
 4 this is plain error which turns into a question of does it
 5 seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public
 6 reputation of judicial proceedings.
 7 Now, I take it in all these hypotheticals where
 8 the Ninth Circuit is deliberately, which I don't think
 9 they'd do, defying a congressional statute, getting
 10 everybody to have waivers on the record, which are totally
 11 contrary to what Congress said, that it would seriously
 12 interfere with the integrity. But in a case where nobody
 13 even thought of the issue, where they raised it a lot
 14 later, it's all come up by accident, et cetera, and --
 15 that maybe it wouldn't interfere with the public 16 reputation. So what has waiver to do with it?
 17 MS. MILLETT: That -- no, I -- thank you for
 18 saying much more articulately than I've been able to
 19 what -- what our point is about waiver versus plain error. 
 20 And I think that's exactly right. And does -- does this
 21 affect the judicial -- judicial integrity has to be
 22 analyzed in the context of these individual defendants. 
 23 The decision should not be if this particular error
 24 occurred writ large across the Nation by courts, would it
 25 violate judicial integrity --

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, in the --
 2 MS. MILLETT: -- as to whether this --
 3 QUESTION: -- in -- in our Fulminante case, I
 4 think we held that even structural error was subject to
 5 harmless error review, that it was not simply an automatic
 6 reversal.
 7 MS. MILLETT: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice. 
 8 And there -- the -- the types of things that are not even
 9 subject to harmless error are not whether a mistake was
 10 made under Article III. In fact, in Ex parte Ward, this
 11 Court under the de facto -- de facto officer doctrine
 12 sustained the actions of the -- of a recess appointment
 13 judge. But the question is whether it's something that
 14 essentially means this wasn't functioning as a court. It
 15 is that profound. 
 This is inconsistent with our -16 QUESTION: May I -- may I ask you a very
 17 practical question that -- this case is now here. So it
 18 has gotten some notice. What is the Ninth Circuit
 19 currently doing with respect to panels that review
 20 decisions from Guam, from Samoa, from Northern Marianas? 
 21 Is the Ninth Circuit continuing to use territorial judges
 22 to fill out their panels, or has it stopped doing it?
 23 QUESTION: Please don't tell us that they're
 24 asking for express waivers.
 25 (Laughter.)

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. MILLETT: I'm grateful to say that we at
 2 least don't know of that if they are doing it.
 3 But as far as we know, this -- this was an
 4 isolated incident. The Ninth Circuit sat in the Northern
 5 Mariana Islands just last month, February, and had a full
 6 complement of Article III judges. It had never
 7 happened -- it had happened back in the '50s, but it --
 8 QUESTION: It seems it couldn't be pure accident
 9 because the -- the Chief Judge of the circuit would have
 10 to designate that judge. So that was an advertent act
 11 that she designated this territorial judge.
 12 MS. MILLETT: No, there's no doubt. And there's
 13 no doubt that -- that a conscious decision to appoint this
 14 judge was made, but I think the question went to
 15 whether -- as I understood it, went to whether there's an 16 ongoing problem or a policy.
 17 QUESTION: Right.
 18 MS. MILLETT: There is no policy that we're
 19 aware of of doing this. It hadn't happened for 50 years. 
 20 It hasn't happened since this Court granted certiorari. 
 21 No reason to think it -- that they're going to do it, at
 22 least until this Court rules, and on the assumption that
 23 this Court will agree with both parties in this case and
 24 tell them that it is wrong to do that, that it won't
 25 happen again. And that's --

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, we don't usually talk about a
 2 statutory violation as being something that's immoral. 
 3 It's just a violation of the statute.
 4 MS. MILLETT: It's wrong.
 5 QUESTION: But it's wrong without a waiver.
 6 MS. MILLETT: No, I think --
 7 QUESTION: So that doesn't decide much in my
 8 view.
 9 MS. MILLETT: With respect, Justice Kennedy,
 10 it's not that it's -- it's right with a waiver. It is
 11 still proscribed by statute. It is still unlawful. 
 12 The -- the waiver issue is only whether when the -- when
 13 an objection wasn't made, are -- are the defendants
 14 entitled to the extraordinary relief of plain error. 
 15 That's not a routine type of waiver. 
 That is -- is it was 16 wrong. We all know it's wrong, and -- and -- but do
 17 these -- does it -- did it really hurt the interests
 18 either of these defendants or, in this particular
 19 proceeding, did it offend judicial integrity.
 20 And we think because of the narrow context in
 21 which this was decided -- it was a territorial case -- to
 22 have a territorial judge sitting with two Ninth Circuit
 23 judges, statutorily wrong -- maybe there's debate about
 24 whether it would be constitutionally permissible. But it
 25 did not make this no longer a court. It did not rise to

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the level of race discrimination or total --
 2 QUESTION: Well, Ms. -- Ms. Millett, may I
 3 interrupt you there?
 4 I mean, you have said -- and -- and I understand
 5 what you're getting at. That does not make this no longer
 6 a court. But in -- in a way that sort of begs the
 7 question because the one thing that is plain is that this
 8 so-called court is not the court that the statute calls
 9 for. So far as the statutory definition of the
 10 appropriate court to hear this appeal, this court is
 11 illegally constituted. And don't we -- even if we confine
 12 our concern to this one instance, don't we have a reason
 13 to find that that fact does go to the integrity of the
 14 proceeding for the purposes of the plain error rule?
 15 MS. MILLETT: No, Justice Souter. Our position
 16 is that it would not because you had a quorum of Ninth
 17 Circuit judges here, and a quorum is sufficient under
 18 28 U.S.C., a quorum of two on this panel, to decide --
 19 QUESTION: Yes, but the quorum assumes that
 20 you've lost one who was also an appropriately constituted
 21 member of the court. And you haven't, so --
 22 MS. MILLETT: I'm not going to argue that this
 23 type of error is not what Congress was anticipating in the
 24 quorum provision. But it's not that far, if you think of
 25 what happens when a panel sits and then a judge recuses

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 himself after argument, once the case is submitted. And
 2 so they have participated. Their -- obviously their name
 3 would not be on the opinion. That would be one
 4 distinction. But the fact that the judge sat there and
 5 participated and could have had some influence -- it would
 6 be unknown -- would not go to the power of the court to
 7 act.
 8 And this Court has made the distinctions in
 9 Ex parte Ward, four Justices in the Freytag, and as far
 10 back as Martin versus Hunter's Lessee, the power of the
 11 court to act, the Ninth Circuit to act with a quorum here,
 12 is to be distinguished from the lawfulness which -- with
 13 which they acted. In Ex parte Ward, a -- a recess
 14 appointment Federal judge, who lacked tenure, by -- by
 15 definition lacked salary guarantees, sat.
 16 QUESTION: Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes.
 17 MS. MILLETT: And this Court said that this
 18 court, whichever district court it was -- I forget, I'm
 19 sorry -- had jurisdiction. The wrong person being there
 20 exercising it goes to the lawfulness with which the court
 21 acted.
 22 And so I think because we had a quorum here, the
 23 Ninth Circuit had power to act. It acted unlawfully in
 24 the exercise of that power, but --
 25 QUESTION: So long as it -- but -- but if -- if

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 power to act is the criterion, then your answer would have
 2 to be the same if the director of tourism had been
 3 substituted in this case because the power of the Ninth
 4 Circuit would be there to act, a quorum of Article III
 5 judges would be sitting, and -- and so I take it your
 6 answer would have to be the same.
 7 MS. MILLETT: My answer on jurisdiction would be
 8 the same. My answer on -- on the --
 9 QUESTION: No, but I thought your answer to the
 10 plain error question of integrity was essentially an
 11 answer that relied heavily on jurisdiction. And the
 12 jurisdictional answer was, this is the Ninth Circuit. It
 13 has power to act. There's a quorum of Ninth Circuit
 14 judges. And that would be the -- that would be the same
 15 if the third member were not an Article IV judge but had 16 been the director of tourism.
 17 MS. MILLETT: To clarify, Justice Souter, I was
 18 talking specifically about power. On prong four, I think
 19 we would have a much harder row to -- row to hoe if we had
 20 to show that it did not affect integrity to have a
 21 director of tourism sit on a panel, but we --
 22 QUESTION: Well, I -- I agree --
 23 MS. MILLETT: But --
 24 QUESTION: -- but -- which is simply to say
 25 there are other concerns than the jurisdictional concern.

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. MILLETT: Right. Right, certainly prong
 2 four goes far beyond jurisdiction. But what makes this
 3 not offend judicial integrity is that territorial
 4 residents who have no right to an Article III compliant
 5 tribunal had their case heard by three Federal judges. It
 6 was heard fairly. They had no disqualifying
 7 constitutional due process biases. They rendered a
 8 unanimous decision on overwhelming evidence in the face of
 9 highly discretionary challenges.
 10 And so -- and -- and you have combined with that
 11 what Justice Scalia referred to in discussing with -- with
 12 counsel for petitioner, the -- the counter-concern that
 13 there's a judicial integrity problem with allowing people
 14 to proceed before a court and then wait until there's an
 15 adverse outcome to challenge who it was that rendered that 16 decision.
 17 And so taking all of those factors together in
 18 the particular, peculiar context of territorial residents,
 19 we don't think this offended judicial integrity or the
 20 reputation of these proceedings. They had three judges,
 21 not a judge and a layperson, not a judge and a child. 
 22 They had three judges. There was no unconstitutional
 23 bias. There was full consideration of their arguments.
 24 They had every opportunity, if they didn't want this
 25 panel, to raise an objection, but they didn't. They took

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 it. They went with the judgment, and it's now, under the
 2 plain error doctrine, I think too late in the day to
 3 object to the composition of the panel.
 4 QUESTION: Given how small the community is, the
 5 bar is, in Guam and the Northern Marianas, it puts counsel
 6 in a somewhat difficult position for the judge to say, oh,
 7 do you mind if I sit on this case even though I'm not
 8 qualified. So I -- I'm not sure the waiver was all that
 9 voluntary. There's nothing in the record on the point.
 10 MS. MILLETT: Justice Kennedy, I think defense
 11 counsel are frequently -- had to -- have to make difficult
 12 decisions. They have to decide whether they want to
 13 alienate the jury by objecting to evidence. Do they want
 14 to alienate the judge by seeming too obstreperous? Do
 15 they want to seem like they're hiding something from the 16 jury? They have to make these difficult decisions, but
 17 the whole point of an adversarial system is that defense
 18 counsel is charged with doing that and you have to strike
 19 balances.
 20 And if on balance they decided, which I don't
 21 think counsel should think about their own reputation in
 22 defending their clients, but if they decided it would be
 23 better not to make the panel angry, I'm not going to
 24 object, that's a strategic choice that they've made. But
 25 at the same time, they may have made the decision, this is

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 a good panel for us. We don't know.
 2 There's nothing inherently prejudicial. Unlike
 3 most harmless error or plain errors where it's inherently
 4 prejudicial to a defendant to admit a confession or
 5 suppress evidence about the circumstances of the
 6 confession, there's nothing inherently prejudicial
 7 ex ante, up front about a particular judge sitting. And
 8 so there's important --
 9 QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Millett.
 10 Mr. Green, you have 3 minutes remaining.
 11 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN
 12 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 13 MR. GREEN: This case was not decided in that
 14 kind of narrow context. It is not the case that court of
 15 appeals from -- or decisions of the court of -- the Ninth 16 Circuit Court of Appeals from Guam or the Northern Mariana
 17 Islands are narrow decisions, or somehow limited. In Cruz
 18 versus the United States, the Ninth Circuit decided a
 19 question about the transportation of firearms in
 20 interstate commerce and -- and created a split on the
 21 basis of a Guam appeal with the Sixth Circuit.
 22 Judge Munson, in effect, would be deciding cases
 23 that would apply to district judges in Montana. I -- I
 24 think that is, in part, answer to your question, Justice
 25 Breyer, about the -- about the Article I judge.

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 With respect to --
 2 QUESTION: Why isn't the answer to that you just
 3 treat them like unpublished decisions? They have no
 4 precedential value.
 5 MR. GREEN: I think actually the Ninth Circuit
 6 couldn't do that because of its Article III nature. I --
 7 I think that would be a -- an exceedingly odd thing to do
 8 for the --
 9 QUESTION: But Article III courts do issue
 10 unpublished -- quote, unpublished. Of course, they are
 11 published, but non-precedential.
 12 MR. GREEN: That's true, but we know the issue
 13 of -- of unpublished decisions is -- is changing, and
 14 nonetheless there may be some knowledge, intra-circuit
 15 knowledge, about how these issues were treated. These
 16 judges are, as we discussed earlier, interpreting Federal
 17 law. This was a case about laws that arose from -- from
 18 18 U.S.C.
 19 And, Justice Souter, I would point out that with
 20 respect to integrity here, I -- I think it would be -- it
 21 would have more integrity, oddly enough, for the court to
 22 have sat with the director of tourism of Guam. Now, I say
 23 that because Judge Moore points out in his amicus brief
 24 that -- that he is open to attack on the ground of whether
 25 he's impartial to the Government. And -- and here Judge

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Munson was sitting on a case in which the Government was
 2 the opposing party.
 3 I would add too that this is the kind of case
 4 where the Court can -- can articulate a high wall, a
 5 bright line for Congress. When Congress vests
 6 jurisdiction in an Article III court, that means
 7 Article III review. That decision or that principle is
 8 implicit in Glidden, and this case represents the missing
 9 piece of that puzzle.
 10 If there are no further questions.
 11 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Green.
 12 The case is submitted.
 13 (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the
 14 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
