1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 105 on our original docket, 5 Kansas v. Colorado. 6 General Six. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF 9 MR. SIX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Article III makes a clear distinction 12 between the Court's appellate and original jurisdiction, 13 and expressly grants Congress power to make exceptions 14 and regulations for appellate jurisdiction, but Congress 15 is not granted the same power over original 16 jurisdiction. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an extremely 18 sensitive clause in Article III. We can decide this 19 case without relying on the distinction you just 20 discussed, can't we? 21 MR. SIX: Well, I think can you, and the 22 Court certainly can interpret the statute not to even 23 reach the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and 24 avoid that constitutional conflict. And I think the 25 stronger reading of the statute arrives at that very

1 result. 2 The statute at issue, the cost provision, 28 3 U.S.C. section 1920, states: "A judge or clerk of any 4 court of the United States may tax as costs the 5 following." And it lists six subparagraphs, including 6 subparagraph 3 at issue here, Fees and Disbursements for 7 Printing and Witnesses. 8 The statute has two terms in it that are 9 defined, "judge" and "court of the United States," and, 10 importantly, one term in 28 U.S.C. section 451 that is 11 defined but does not appear in the cost provision, and 12 that is "Justice of the United States." "Justice of the 13 United States" is defined as "the Chief Justice and the 14 Associate Justices of the Supreme Court." The cost 15 provision says "a judge." "Judge of the United States" 16 is defined as including judges on the court of appeals, 17 the district court, the Court of International Trade, 18 essentially the listed courts and the Article III 19 judges. 20 JUSTICE: But, on the other hand, "court of 21 the United States" is defined specifically to include 22 the Supreme Court. So you have a contradiction no 23 matter which way you flip it. On the one hand, it says 24 "judge," which does not include the Justices of the 25 Supreme Court. On the other hand, it says "court of the
4

1 United States," which does include the Supreme Court. 2 So why should we pick one -- one answer to the 3 contradiction rather than the other? 4 MR. SIX: You don't have to pick. And 5 you're correct, "the court of the United States" is 6 defined to include the Supreme Court. But the strongest 7 reading of the statute gives meaning to all of the words 8 in the statute, and it says you can be a judge who 9 appears in the court of the United States. And if you 10 think about it, there's a circle of judges that are 11 defined here and a circle of courts that are defined 12 here, and where the two overlap, where you are both a 13 judge and in the court of the United States, the statute 14 should apply. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -16 MR. SIX: And that -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It also says 18 "clerk." We may not be judges, but we certainly have a 19 clerk. 20 MR. SIX: You do, and 28 U.S.C. section 21 1911, another provision in Title 28, specifically deals 22 with the Supreme Court Clerk. And throughout title 28, 23 the Supreme Court is treated differently than the lower 24 courts. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is 1911 a stand-alone
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 provision that would justify relief for you, or do we 2 have to also refer to the general cost statute? 3 MR. SIX: I don't think the Court would 4 refer to the general cost statute in its original 5 jurisdiction cases at all or any authorization from 6 Congress. 28 U.S.C. 19 -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but let's assume 8 that we think Congress can control this, this issue, 9 this question. Now, I'm asking if 911 isn't a 10 stand-alone section so that you can interpret it without 11 reference to 1920. 12 MR. SIX: I mean, I would -- if your 13 assumption is Congress has the power to do it and has 14 done so through 1911, I read 1911 more as simply a grant 15 of the discretion the Court already has. They are 16 turning over to the Supreme Court the power to have the 17 clerk set costs. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I think this case is 19 controlled by 1911, do I have to refer to 1920? 20 MR. SIX: No. I don't believe you have to 21 refer to 1920. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't you rest your 23 case just on 1911? 24 MR. SIX: Because in the original 25 jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Congress isn't given
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 power to make exceptions or regulations over original 2 jurisdiction. And in the 219 years of the Court's 3 original practice, they have never referred to a 4 congressional cost provision, and -5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that 1911 6 doesn't cover expert witness fees because it's not 7 included within the term "other necessary 8 disbursements"? 9 MR. SIX: I believe the expert witness fees 10 in this case were vital to the resolution. They were -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were they within 1911? 12 MR. SIX: I don't believe they were other 13 incidental disbursements. That's not our position. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other necessary 15 disbursements. 16 MR. SIX: Other necessary disbursements. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Incidental to the case. 18 You don't that think that covers expert witness fees? 19 MR. SIX: If -- if this Court determines 20 that Congress has the power, and it's done so through -21 since 1911 -- has the power and done it from 1911, I 22 certainly would accept that position as the result. 23 However, I would point out to the Court that I think the 24 expert witness costs and the work was vital to the 25 resolution of the case here.

1 JUSTICE ALITO: If you're reading of the 2 statute is correct, then I take it we would have the 3 discretion to decide what would be appropriate expert 4 fees. Is that correct? 5 MR. SIX: Absolutely. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: If that's so, why shouldn't 7 we exercise that discretion by saying that the expert 8 fees that are available in case of the original 9 jurisdiction of this Court should be the same as the 10 expert fees that would be available in a district court? 11 Maybe they are too low in the district court, but why 12 should there be -- why should we as a discretionary 13 matter, if we have the discretion, provide for radically 14 different fees depending on the court in which the case 15 originates? 16 MR. SIX: Clearly the Court has the power to 17 make that rule for original cases. However, the 18 original jurisdiction was developed when the States 19 agreed to submit and ratify the Constitution, submit 20 their sovereign immunity to resolution in the original 21 jurisdiction to handle unique disputes between the 22 sovereign States. And as the Court said in Florida v. 23 Georgia in 1854, "The analogies and rules and 24 foundations of law that apply to private parties are not 25 necessarily a good fit for sovereign States.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but Justice Alito is 2 saying we have discretion, we look for guidance, we have 3 guidance from Congress. They have adhered to the $40 a 4 day limit in very important cases; why don't we just 5 say, Justice Alito is suggesting, that this is -- that 6 this is a good guidepost for us and we will follow it? 7 MR. SIX: Because what Colorado's position 8 is that they are telling you that the Special Master's 9 hands were tied; that the Special Master couldn't even 10 exercise that discretion in a bright line rule that 11 would save $40 a day. 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We are saying it's our 13 discretion and our discretion is guided by what Congress 14 has suggested so there is uniformity in the system and 15 so forth. 16 MR. SIX: Clearly, the Court would have the 17 power to do that. However, there has only been 18 approximately 200 original jurisdiction cases in the 219 19 years of the Court. To suggest that the rules -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In all those -- in all 21 those cases has the Special Master ever called a court's 22 witness, that is a court's expert, appointed a court's 23 expert, and if so what is the pay rate for such a 24 witness? I mean, courts of the United States, district 25 courts, occasionally appoint witnesses, court witnesses

1 as distinguished from party's witnesses. Do you know if 2 that's happened in Special Master situations? 3 MR. SIX: I can tell you it didn't happen in 4 this case. I certainly can't speak to whether it's 5 happened in other cases involving special masters, so I 6 don't know the answer to that. Certainly 1920 makes a 7 distinction for court- appointed experts rather than the 8 expert witnesses appearing under subsection 3 of 1920. 9 I think the important point to consider, 10 though, is in the original jurisdiction the Court in its 11 219 years of developing essentially an interstate common 12 law in these cases has never relied on the trilogy of 13 cost statutes that the court discussed in Crawford 14 Fitting, with is I essentially Colorado's position: You 15 have to apply Rule 54D first to have the court even have 16 the discretion to award costs; then you get to 1920, 17 which the Court said is the arena of costs; and only 18 after that do you get down to 1821, which tells you 19 you're limited to $40 a day. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How do Special Master fees 21 work? The Special Master always has fees and the 22 parties I think usually divide them. How does that -23 how is their authority to order them -24 MR. SIX: Sure. Rule 53 of the Federal 25 Rules of Civil Procedure deals with special masters in
10

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the lower courts. It has no application here and wasn't 2 used. The Special Master's fees, which total 3 approximately a million dollars, just shy of that, were 4 resolved by the parties after the Special Master was 5 allowed to exercise discretion on that area of cost. 6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what if they hadn't 7 -- what if the parties hadn't resolved it? 8 MR. SIX: If they hasn't resolved the 9 Special Master's -10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. How would the -- how 11 would the Special -- what would be the authority of this 12 Court to make an order that the Special Master be paid X 13 dollars? 14 MR. SIX: Well, I think the authority of the 15 Court comes from the order appointing the Special Master 16 to handle the case and to do the specific things that 17 were -18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. We just, we just 19 regressed one step. Where does the authority come from? 20 MR. SIX: To appoint a Special Master? 21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 22 MR. SIX: It's an inherent authority the 23 Court has in original jurisdiction cases. 24 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that the authority to 25 compensate is inherent?
11

1 MR. SIX: The authority to compensate is 2 inherent. In the Judiciary -3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you making -- would you 4 make an inherent authority argument here? 5 MR. SIX: Yes. 6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of original 7 jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction, would you say 8 that this Court simply has the inherent authority to, to 9 in effect to decree these sorts of claims. 10 MR. SIX: Well, again there is a distinction 11 between appellate and original and, focusing on 12 original, I think the Court has entirely the authority. 13 The Judiciary Act of 1789, which gave the Court 14 exclusive jurisdiction over these disputes, didn't set 15 forth any procedures to govern the disputes. That's 16 always been carefully preserved to the discretion of the 17 Court to apply each unique case. 18 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Six, under your 19 reading of the statute, 1934 particularly, would the 20 Court have authority to charge your fees to your 21 adversary, shift attorney's fees? 22 MR. SIX: Yes. In the original jurisdiction 23 the Court would have the inherent authority to do 24 fee-shifting if the -25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Did you make such a

1 request in this case? Why should -- why should 2 attorney's fees be treated differently from expert 3 witness fees? Let me put it that way. Or should it be 4 treated differently? 5 MR. SIX: The Special Master should have the 6 discretion to consider all the costs and unique 7 circumstances of the case. In this case we chose expert 8 witness fees -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: We should have the 10 discretion. Why do you keep talking about the Special 11 Master? He's just -- he's just our amanuensis. 12 Ultimately it's our discretion, isn't it? 13 MR. SIX: It is, and the benefit of having 14 the Special Master make a recommendation is we could 15 have gone through these different categories of costs 16 and come up with a recommendation. The Court certainly 17 could have learned -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it the usual 19 practice is for the parties to settle this matter and 20 submit an agreed amount to the Special Master; is that 21 correct? 22 MR. SIX: The way it's worked in this case 23 is the Special Master has provided guidance, like on the 24 Special Master's fees. The Special Master suggested it 25 wouldn't be unfair to award them two-thirds Colorado,
13

1 one-third Kansas. After that the parties resolved it, 2 just like we resolved every other issue of cost where 3 the Special Master was allowed to apply that discretion. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why didn't -- 5 then are we here? We are talking about limited amounts. 6 So much more is at stake on the merits and why wouldn't 7 the parties just say, well, when it comes to Special 8 Master fees this is what we are going to agree to. It 9 doesn't have to be limited to $40. You can agree as 10 part of a global settlement to whatever you want. 11 MR. SIX: Well, the Special Master's fees 12 we resolved. The experts fees at issue here, of course 13 that bright-line rule was drawn by the Special Master 14 and he never was allowed to make a recommendation to the 15 Court to consider that. In balancing -- the remedies in 16 these cases are highly equitable remedies. 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you just answer my 18 question of a moment ago. Why should expert witness 19 fees be treated differently from attorney's fees? 20 MR. SIX: Well, in this case they should be 21 treated differently because the model at issue that the 22 experts for Kansas developed, the HI model, was used to 23 prove our claims at trial, which would have -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: You used lawyers to prove 25 your case, too.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. SIX: Excuse me? 2 JUSTICE STEVENS: You used lawyers to prove 3 your case, too. Why should they not be compensated? 4 MR. SIX: Because we considered the special 5 circumstances of the model. It proved the claims at 6 trial. It was adopted by the Court in 2004 in Kansas v. 7 Colorado to monitor compliance in the Arkansas River 8 Basin. It's the water use -- it's applied by the 9 Colorado State water use rule. So it was special 10 features like that that we wanted to present to the 11 Special Master to explain why the fees should be fairly 12 balanced and divided in a way other than he did. 13 JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't understand that to 14 be an answer to why he didn't also ask for attorney's 15 fees. 16 MR. SIX: Well, in a particular case where 17 perhaps a order of the Supreme Court wasn't followed or 18 some other situation developed, fee shifting may be 19 appropriate. In this case we felt the expert model we 20 developed was so vital that it would be persuasive to 21 the Special Master and fair and equitable to award it to 22 us. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know whether any 24 other -- you didn't know, in answer to my last question, 25 what the practice had been, but with respect to expert
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 fees in other original jurisdiction cases, has the Court 2 ever deviated from the $40 or when it was $30, $30? 3 MR. SIX: In original cases the Court has 4 never referred to any of that trilogy of cost statutes 5 discussed in Crawford Fitting. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But have they ever 7 approved a Special Master's recommendation of a rate for 8 the expert witness that deviates from the $40? 9 MR. SIX: I think the answer to that is yes 10 and I would direct the Court to New Jersey v. New York 11 in 1931, which was a division of the waters of the 12 Delaware River. And the Court pointed out in that 13 opinion that a mass of evidence was presented to the 14 Special Master, and on costs the Court said: "The cost 15 of the cause shall be divided 35 percent to New Jersey, 16 35 to City of New York," and so on. The "cost of the 17 cause" I would argue is the cost to get the case to the 18 point where it was resolved. In the boundary dispute -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know -- do you 20 know whether there were expert witnesses in that case? 21 MR. SIX: It does not say in the published 22 opinion exactly what the cost of the cause is. However, 23 from a fair reading of the -- the water distribution 24 issues, I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to do 25 that without experts. But I would point the Court to
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the boundary dispute cases where the Court has discussed 2 the costs of surveyors, mappers, geographers, 3 historians, and divided the cost in boundary disputes 4 equally between the States -- not each State to bear 5 their own cost, but divided them equally. 6 And the -- the experts that are involved in 7 resolving a boundary dispute, I think, are no different 8 than the hydrologists and engineers and the type of 9 experts that we used in this case. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: You're right. They are all 11 different. They did a lot of work on that. I -- I know 12 they did a lot of work on this. Congress has a statute, 13 and the statute is: We don't care if the witness is 14 Albert Einstein, Steven Spielberg, or the local 15 zookeeper. Okay. We don't care. We don't care if they 16 did a lot of work or a little work. We want them to be 17 paid $40 a day, period. It's too much trouble to figure 18 out how much work they did. That's what we want. 19 That's the law. 20 Now, Justice Alito said: I agree with you 21 for argument's sake; we are not bound by that rule. But 22 I take it his question, which I heard no answer to, is: 23 Assume you are right; we are not bound by the law; 24 still, why shouldn't we follow it? 25 MR. SIX: Because in the original cases the

Now, despite that clear 6 statute, this court for exactly the same thing paid a 7 different amount. Is there any such case? 8 MR. SIX: I'm not aware of that. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And is there 10 anything in the -- in the nature of litigation? And 11 there might be. I'm not asking it as a rhetorical 12 question. Is there anything in the nature of original 13 jurisdiction lawsuits that, as a general matter, would 14 call for higher fees to be paid for witnesses, or to 15 make a distinction between expert witnesses and others, 16 or to do other things that would complicate it? 17 I'm not speaking of your case. You have a 18 wonderfully strong case in your case. I want to know 19 about in general, in original actions. 20 MR. SIX: I would suggest the only 21 difference is the parties. And the Court in its 219 22 years -23 JUSTICE BREYER: If anything, the parties 24 are in a better position to pay the money than the 25 average person.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume -- I assume 2 your answer is that it's -- that it's our business, and 3 we don't have to agree with Congress; that we -- we may 4 think $40 a day for the zookeeper and for Albert 5 Einstein is ridiculous. And, therefore, if it's up to 6 us, we would adopt a different rule. Isn't that your 7 answer? 8 MR. SIX: That's exactly my answer. And if 9 you think -- if Congress can adopt a congressional -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure that 11 answer is -- is at all adequate. Number one, what is 12 there, as Justice Breyer pointed out, that's so 13 different about this case? 14 Let's say one landowner secretly and 15 intentionally is stealing another landowner's water, and 16 -- and he has no legal right to do that. And the only 17 way the injured landowner can recover is to hire a very, 18 very expensive expert, a hydrologist. And by the time 19 he goes to court, he is really going to lose the benefit 20 of the damages. Congress has said too bad. That's the 21 way it is. 22 Why isn't it that way with States, 23 especially, as Justice Breyer said, when States can 24 really afford the -- afford it better than the 25 landowner. What's the difference?
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. SIX: The difference is the Court has 2 indicated for original cases: These are such disputes 3 of a serious magnitude that can affect whole populations 4 that the model case for even taking a case is where the 5 acts between the States would be a causus belli, a type 6 of thing that would lead to war. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I haven't seen -- I 8 mean the $40 limitation makes absolutely no sense, does 9 it? I mean I never saw an expert who would agree to 10 spend the day appearing in court worth being called an 11 "expert" for $40. 12 I mean the fact that -- I guess I'm just 13 repeating Justice Scalia's question. The fact that 14 Congress has picked an arbitrary number with no basis in 15 reality doesn't mean that we should do the same. 16 MR. SIX: I would agree. The special 17 master 's fees, for example, for one person -- and he 18 was an excellent special|master -- were almost a million 19 dollars. The appearance fees for the 22 experts Kansas 20 had amounted to approximately $30,000. So that 21 different there, I think, demonstrates the very 22 unfairness -23 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not unfair to have a 24 rule which says each party pays his own experts, win or 25 lose. That's the rule, isn't it?

1 MR. SIX: I don't think that's the rule in 2 original jurisdiction cases. At least the Court has 3 never said that. The Court has -4 JUSTICE BREYER: If you lose this case, if 5 we were to follow Congress, we would have adopted a rule 6 where, because the $40 is trivial, each party pays his 7 own experts. Is that right or wrong? 8 MR. SIX: I think that's correct, but we 9 didn't lose. And the Court found that Kansas proved 10 that Colorado violated a compact for over -- for over 50 11 years by clear and convincing evidence. But one point 12 I'd like to make -13 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, can we do this then? 14 I think maybe in many cases that are technical in nature 15 it might be quite a good thing for the losing party to 16 pay the winning side's lawyers. 17 MR. SIX: The Court would have that ability 18 to do that in original jurisdiction -19 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, should we do that, 20 too? If we are going to have them pay the experts, why 21 don't we have them, the losing side, pay the lawyers' 22 fees? That would be quite a revolution. 23 MR. SIX: Because in the original 24 jurisdiction cases involving prevailing parties or 25 litigious cases, the Court has traditionally and
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 historically awarded the prevailing party costs. And if 2 Congress can make a congressional limitation on cost, 3 Congress could pass a statute that says: You have to 4 take all original jurisdiction cases, or you can't use 5 special masters, or you can't use certain special 6 masters in cases involving Colorado and Kansas. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you save that for the 8 lower courts? I mean, you are -- you are trying to 9 distinguish what it can say for the Supreme Court when 10 the Supreme Court is the trial court vis-a-vis what it 11 can say, and has said, for the lower courts. 12 MR. SIX: Yes, It could say that for the 13 lower courts. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 15 MR. SIX: Because -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that, so long as 17 Congress could not create the lower courts at all, once 18 it creates them it can -- it can tie their hands to any 19 sort of absurd rules? 20 MR. SIX: I think they could pass a rule 21 like they did, Rule 54 -- 53, which allows for special 22 masters, and they could through the Rules Enabling Act 23 pass a rule that says you can't use special masters. I 24 think you get into whether that's -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I just don't agree
22

1 with your assumption that just because Congress need not 2 have created any lower Federal courts, the only Federal 3 court required by the Constitution is this Court, 4 therefore once Congress creates them, it can do whatever 5 it wants with them. I -- I don't agree with that. 6 MR. SIX: Well, I would certainly focus more 7 on the original jurisdiction issue here and haven't 8 focused as much on that issue, but -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When we award the -10 the special master's fees in original cases, do we 11 specify who will bear those fees? 12 MR. SIX: Yes, you do. In -- you do in the 13 cases that have discussed costs. For instance, in 14 boundary dispute cases you have suggested that the cost 15 -- the costs will be divided equally; in litigious 16 cases, that they will be awarded to the prevailing 17 party. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we include the 19 special master's fees as part of the costs that are 20 allocated? 21 MR. SIX: Yes, and in this case the parties 22 have agreed to that and never made an issue about that. 23 And there is no -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why -- why did 25 the parties agree to it if we do it? In other words, if
23

1 we say in our orders who bears the special master's 2 fees, why -- why would the parties agree to it? 3 MR. SIX: Well, in this case -- maybe I 4 misheard your question. The order appointing the 5 special master did not resolve the issue of fees. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 7 MR. SIX: And the parties did not agree to 8 that ahead of time. It was an issue to be determined 9 and decided at the end of the litigation. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it -- isn't it 11 customary for it to be divided 50/50? I mean, we 12 periodically will approve the fees that the special 13 master charges and then they are divided between the 14 parties. And I thought that they were divided 50/50. 15 Is that not so? 16 MR. SIX: Well, as the case progressed, the 17 special master submitted bills that were divided 50/50. 18 At the conclusion of the case the parties suggested 19 reasons and special circumstances that should allow the 20 special master to apply discretion. 21 He then suggested it wouldn't be unfair to 22 award the special master fee costs two-thirds Colorado, 23 one-third Kansas because of the unique features of the 24 case. And the parties then settled the special master 25 fees with that guidance.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, I think you 2 gave the answer earlier. Rule 53 allows for the -- an 3 order to say that one or both parties shall pay the 4 special master fee. So if we are going to follow other 5 analogies, we don't have much problem here with expert 6 witness fees -- pardon me -- with special master fees. 7 It's under Rule 53. 8 Of course, you say we don't have to follow 9 that as a model, but it is a model if we -- if we were 10 to look to congressional and -- and to other rules. 11 MR. SIX: It is a model; however, the Court 12 has always carefully preserved its discretion to treat 13 each dispute between the sovereign states as a unique 14 dispute. And the Court never even enacted an original 15 action rule until 1939, so after 150 years. And in 1939 16 the Court enacted Rule 5, which just set up the bare 17 minimums of commencing the action. And Rule 17 today 18 has essentially the same framework that tells the 19 parties how to start the action but reserves all the 20 other rules to the discretion of the special master. 21 It does point to the Federal Rules of Civil 22 Procedure and the Rules of Evidence as guides but not 23 binding, mandatory rules that tie the Court's hand. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is magical about 25 original actions? I mean, what -- what is magical is

1 that we are the only court that is required by the 2 Constitution. But we are -- we are not just the only 3 court for original actions in -- in -- in all appeals. 4 Can Congress prescribe division of costs and expenses in 5 the appeals that come to us from the lower Federal 6 courts? 7 MR. SIX: Well, the Court has, in 1913, 8 determined that -- excuse me, in 1912, that when a case 9 is affirmed, the Supreme Court can adjudge costs for 10 damages and delay. So they have directed, I think, a -11 a regulation at the appellate jurisdiction, but never at 12 the original jurisdiction. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean Congress 14 has done that? 15 MR. SIX: Congress, I'm sorry. 16 I would like to reserve the remainder of my 17 time for rebuttal. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 19 General Suthers. 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. SUTHERS 21 ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT 22 MR. SUTHERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 23 please the Court: 24 The special master in this case found clear 25 direction from the statutes and rightly so. Section
26
Alderson Reporting Company

1 1821 of Title 28 is unambiguous. It provides that a 2 witness in attendance at any court of the United States 3 shall be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day in 4 addition to travel and accommodation allowances. 5 Section 451 of Title 28 defines "court of 6 the United States" to include this Court, the Supreme 7 Court of the United States, and that definition has been 8 part of the statute since 1948. Because witness fees 9 are only at issue in the Supreme Court in cases of 10 original jurisdiction, it's apparent that Congress 11 intended the limits set forth in 1821 to apply in such 12 cases. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what if they said 14 in original actions no fees shall be allowed to any 15 special master appointed by the Supreme Court? 16 MR. SUTHERS: Chief Justice, it would then 17 be up to the Court to decide whether that's somehow an 18 intrusion into your -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we allow -- if we 20 allow Congress to regulate fees in our original 21 jurisdiction in that matter, it seems to me that we've 22 given up the principle and we are just negotiating over 23 price. 24 MR. SUTHERS: It would not be the first time 25 that you've allowed Congress to legislate some aspects
27

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of your original jurisdiction. Congress has told you in 2 what is now Section 1251 that your original jurisdiction 3 is not entirely exclusive. Only State versus State is 4 exclusive, and all the rest of your jurisdiction is 5 nonexclusive. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't this an area, 7 though, where we should be particularly sensitive? In 8 other words, one reason that we were given original 9 jurisdiction in these cases is that the States were 10 afraid of what Congress would do in its own courts, the 11 courts it set up -- might set up under the Constitution. 12 I think it would be surprising if you told 13 the States at the framing that Congress gets to regulate 14 this original jurisdiction where you, for example, can 15 sue the Federal Government, that -- I think that would 16 be surprising. It would not be regarded by them as a 17 significant safeguard. 18 MR. SUTHERS: Chief Justice, if it was such 19 a sensitive issue, why is it we are now in 2008 and this 20 Court has never decided to enact any kind of rules -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we don't know -- 22 General Suthers, do we know what has happened in past 23 original jurisdiction cases?

SUTHERS: Justice Ginsburg, we -- we 5 looked at it very carefully -- and it's difficult to 6 research -- but we could not find an original 7 jurisdiction case where there was an award of witness 8 fees outside the -- this $40 per day limitation. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you find any cases 10 where the special master had appointed his own witness 11 as distinguished from the parties? 12 MR. SUTHERS: No. We did not. But -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but you 14 recognize that if a special master appointed a witness, 15 or the court, that that witness would be paid a 16 compensatory fee? 17 MR. SUTHERS: Whatever the special master 18 determined was appropriate. That's correct. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, in a -- in a case 20 like this one, where the nature of the work that the 21 expert did seemed to be very helpful to both sides, 22 isn't it odd that the special master chose the court 23 expert, that expert would be compensated fairly but if 24 you have one party calls an expert who renders great 25 service to the Court, to both sides, doesn't get

1 compensated? Isn't that an anomaly? 2 MR. SUTHERS: The special master, Justice 3 Ginsburg, found clear direction from the statute and did 4 not believe that he had an option in the matter, if 5 you're talking about the unfairness of it. Number one, 6 this situation here is no more unfair to Kansas than any 7 litigant in Federal court. And number two, it's 8 appropriate matter to take to Congress. 9 The last time they changed it was 1990 from 10 $30 to $40. I think it's time to revisit it. But it 11 is, in fact, what Congress has dictated should be the 12 compensation -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a matter of 14 unfairness to Einstein anyway. I mean, you know, the 15 expert witness is going to get his money. 16 MR. SUTHERS: That's correct, Justice. They 17 certainly did in this case. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: The question is -19 MR. SUTHERS: Both sides can vouch for that. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: The question is whether one 21 side can get some money from the other to help pay for 22 it. 23 Do you happen to know whether at the time 24 the original jurisdiction of this Court was established, 25 there was such a thing as the charging of expert witness
30

1 fees? 2 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Scalia, I do not. We 3 do know -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't either. 5 MR. SUTHERS: -- that it's 1853 when for the 6 first time Congress, desiring to have uniform fees, 7 began the structure of expert witness fees. It started 8 at $1.50 a day, in 1853. 9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- may I ask you a 10 statutory question just about the application of the 11 statute. As -- as you have pointed out, if the $40 12 applies it's because I -- it is, in effect, a 13 determination of a particular item under section 1920: 14 Judge and clerk of any court of the United States may 15 tax its cost. My question is this. One of the items 16 covered by 1920, one of the items that a judge or clerk 17 may tax, is fees of the clerk. 18 Under section 1911, which relates entirely 19 to the Supreme Court, there is a provision that the 20 Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its 21 clerk. That is totally redundant if 1920 covers the 22 Supreme Court of the United States. 23 Doesn't it follow, therefore, that section 24 1920 was -- despite its reference to any court of the 25 United States, doesn't it follow that that statute was
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 not intended to apply to the Supreme Court; and doesn't 2 it follow from that that either the Supreme Court's 3 authority is to fix the fees if this is a fee to be 4 charged by the clerk or, in the alternative, that there 5 is no statute on it at all? 6 But the main point is unless 1911 is totally 7 redundant in -- in referring to fixing the fees to be 8 charged by its clerk, then 1920 must not cover the 9 Supreme Court. 10 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Ginsburg, 1920 -11 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm greatly flattered. 12 (Laughter.) 13 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Souter, Justice 14 Souter, sorry. Justice Souter. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're not the first to 16 have done that. 17 (Laughter.) 18 MR. SUTHERS: 1920 there may be some 19 redundancies in it, but it's much more expansive than is 20 1911. It talks about court reporter fees, printing -21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, we didn't -- no 22 question about that. I recognize 1920 goes a lot 23 further. But there is no -- there is no need in 1911 to 24 say to that the Supreme Court may -- may fix the fees to 25 be charged by its clerk if the Supreme Court is already

1 covered by 1920. 2 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Souter, I think if you 3 look at the history of it, 1911 was enacted at the 4 same -- there is a separate statute -- statute that 5 applies to the court of appeals and to the district 6 courts. I think it's like 1913 and 1914. So I -- I -7 I don't think that you can -8 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, if it's 9 redundancy it proves too much is what you're saying? 10 MR. SUTHERS: Yes. 11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 12 MR. SUTHERS: I think the important thing 13 about 1911, in response to Justice Kennedy's question, 14 it is limited to fees charged by the Supreme Court 15 clerk, cost of serving process and incidental 16 disbursements. It does not address witness fees in -17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think it includes 18 printing fees? 19 MR. SUTHERS: 1911 does not, unless -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't -- you don't 21 think that -22 MR. SUTHERS: Incidental disbursements? 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what number here? You 24 don't think that 1911 would allow the clerk to charge 25 for printing fees?
33

1 MR. SUTHERS: As an incidental disbursement, 2 it may. But it clearly does not address witness fees. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the reason I ask is 4 because printing, in 1920, printing and witness fees are 5 in -- in the same sentence. 6 MR. SUTHERS: And I -- I don't know whether 7 printing would be considered incidental disbursements. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So if you allowed 9 printing, then I think it would allow witnesses under 10 1911. Citing Crawford Fitting, this Court made clear 11 that no statute will be construed to authorize taxing 12 witness fees and costs, unless it refers explicitly to 13 witness fees. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: It is -- I mean, if you 15 want to really get a little complicated, the -- you 16 have -- you have 11, and 11 talked about the Supreme 17 Court fees and then we have 20 and that talks about all 18 the other fees, right? Okay. So the thing is, you 19 can't pay money in the United States unless have you 20 some authorization, but 1911 gives the Supreme Court 21 some authorization to fix fees. 22 Now we look back at 1821. And 1821 tells 23 you how much mileage per diem and subsistence will be. 24 It says he will be paid an attendance fee of $40 per 25 day. Doesn't say you couldn't pay him more. Just says
34
Alderson Reporting Company

1 that's what he is entitled to. Now of course, in the 2 lower courts, you can't pay him more because there is no 3 authority to pay him more. But in the Supreme Court, 4 there is authority to pay him more. That comes out of 5 1911. 6 I mean, I grant you that this is -- what I'm 7 actually doing here is I'm trying to avoid this problem 8 of whether Congress can start legislating the details of 9 original jurisdiction rules and so forth. Just -- there 10 is some desirability here constitutionally to prevent 11 ourselves from going down that road. That's -- I'm 12 deliberately being gimmicky, but what do you think of 13 this gimmick? 14 MR. SUTHERS: Well, not much. 15 (Laughter.) 16 JUSTICE BREYER: That's fair. 17 (Laughter.) 18 MR.

1 you have done it before in -- in highly procedural 2 matters where you do not -- no one here is doing 3 anything that prevents your exercise of original 4 jurisdiction, that expands your exercise of original 5 jurisdiction. The cases also say that your original 6 jurisdiction is self-executing, doesn't need any 7 statutory implementation; but this is a -- a totally 8 procedural matter, much as -- in fact, I think less of 9 an intrusion, when the -- when the Congress said to you 10 these cases will not be exclusive jurisdiction. Even 11 though they are part of your original jurisdiction. 12 This is a very procedural matter. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask you what -14 what are the fees to be charged by its clerk, referred 15 to in 1911. "Supreme Court may fix the fees to be 16 charged by its clerk," and then the next paragraph says 17 the fees of the clerk. Is that what the first paragraph 18 refers to, the fees of the clerk? Or does it mean other 19 fees that the clerk charges which could include costs? 20 Are the costs part of the fees to be charged by the 21 clerk? 22 MR. SUTHERS: I don't believe so, Justice 23 Scalia. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: They are not? Fees of the 25 clerk -- in 1920 says fees of the clerk in Marshall, but

A judge or clerk 2 can tax as costs the following. 3 1911 says Supreme Court may fix "the fees to 4 be charged by its clerk," and you say that doesn't 5 include costs. Boy, it's a messy, messy bunch of 6 statutes, don't you think? 7 MR. SUTHERS: Not -- not a whole lot more so 8 than others I've seen. 9 (Laughter.) 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -11 MR.

So there is that statute authority which 18 you indicated there should be. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that taxes costs, 20 and it doesn't say the Supreme Court may fix costs. May 21 fix the fees to be charged by its clerk, which you say 22 don't include costs. 23 MR. SUTHERS: I don't believe they do. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: So that wouldn't allow to 25 us fix that.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Except 1911 may do two 2 things. Number one it may authorize the Supreme Court 3 to fix the fees to be charged by the clerk. And then in 4 the second paragraph it for taxing of those fees, the 5 cost of serving process and other necessary 6 disbursements; so it does two things. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it tells you how they 8 are to be taxed. It doesn't say what their level is to 9 be. May be taxed against the litigants as the court 10 directs, but I don't see any authority to fix them -11 fix the amounts. It's not a very good statute, really. 12 MR. SUTHERS: If I may, once again going to 13 the issue of why I think some uniformity is important in 14 original jurisdiction cases, is because so many of the 15 cases are not exclusive jurisdiction; and there is in 16 fact a need for uniformity here; and the fact that this 17 Court has not chosen to issue a conflicting rule, I 18 think is very significant. 19 If in fact you had set an appropriate fee 20 for expert witness fees in case original jurisdiction, 21 and Congress came along and said gee, no; it shouldn't 22 be that, you should be stuck with $40, then we might 23 have some kind of a constitutional issue here; but 24 absent that, I simply don't -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if

As I understand it, you're 7 -- when you answered it, in a situation in which the 8 slate is completely clean, we would have inherent power, 9 you're using "inherent power" in effect to be a kind of 10 default power. If Congress hasn't acted, somebody has 11 got to do something. That's got to be us, so -- so we 12 would have the authority.

Because if in fact 9 parties are going to be reluctant to -- to hire the kind 10 of experts that are necessary, unless they think that at 11 the end of the day there is going to be some kind of an 12 equitable disposition of the expense, at that point that 13 starts interfering with the conduct of the kind of 14 business that the Court ought to be engaged in. 15 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Souter, it's not 16 telling you how to decide cases. And there is another 17 case before the Court in which Congress reinstated 18 time-barred cases. That's the kind of thing that 19 intrudes on your judicial function. Setting witness 20 fees doesn't come close to doing that. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if Congress -- really 22 you think Congress could set any -- there's not some 23 point at which it is so destructive of the process here? 24 What if Congress provides that the winning -- that the 25 winning party shall pay the costs of the losing party?

1 Can Congress do that? 2 MR. SUTHERS: It's -- I think the question 3 would be, Justice Scalia, is that a fundamental 4 interference with the Court's ability to decide cases? 5 I would suggest it might be to the -- did they do 6 something wholly irrational like that. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that would be a matter 8 of due process, not a matter of inherent power, I take 9 it. 10 MR. SUTHERS: I believe that's correct. 11 That's correct. 12 Members of the Court, Special Master 13 Littleworth spent a lot of time on this case. He has 14 been fair, competent, and conscientious in resolving all 15 the issues before this Court, including this issue of 16 expert witness fees. It was the plain language of the 17 statute and the clear direction of the case law that led 18 him to his conclusion that the expert witnesses' fees 19 were limited by statute in this case. We would ask you 20 to deny Kansas's exception to the final report, and that 21 the Court should enter the proposed judgment and decree. 22 Mr. Chief Justice. If there are no other 23 questions from the Court, I'll conclude my argument. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 25 General Six, you have four minutes

1 remaining. 2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX 3 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF 4 MR. SIX: 1920 didn't appear in 1948 5 magically. It came from the 1853 Fee Act. And the 6 language in the Fee Act was, "A judge shall tax costs." 7 "A judge" -- it says, "Costs shall be taxed by a judge 8 or clerk of the court." I'm sorry. And 1920 says, "A 9 judge or clerk of any court of the United States." In 10 1853, as the Court has discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, 11 the Fee Act applied to the circuit courts. It says that 12 in its title. And "judge" in 1853 meant a lower court 13 judge. In 1920, we have exactly the same word -- "a 14 judge" who can tax costs -- and we have a definition 15 that Congress tells us it means exactly the same thing. 16 Under Colorado's reading "court of the 17 United States" would expand to read "judge" right out of 18 the statute, and it would make the statute apply to 19 "magistrate judge," for example, which is not included 20 in the definition, but they're somebody who wears a robe 21 and presides over a court of the United States, and it 22 would apply to Justices, even though 451 in title 28 23 defines "Justices" as a separate group. So that's not 24 -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Constitution uses

1 the word "judge." A "judge of the United States" is a 2 Supreme Court Justice or a judge of an inferior court. 3 MR. SIX: And certainly Congress isn't tied 4 to the way the word is used in the Constitution, no more 5 than the paper I got on my way in here told me not to 6 refer to any of you as "judges." 7 The point, I think, is that the Fee Act was 8 carried forward to 1920, and the language is almost the 9 same. The only thing they have added is a definition of 10 "court of the United States." And if after 168 years, 11 Congress is going to tread on the Court's original 12 jurisdiction, they ought to at least have some express 13 language that they intend to do that -- do so, where the 14 Court could at the very least adopt a clear statement 15 rule that would require Congress to say, "We are going 16 to do this now. We've never done it in our history, but 17 now after 168 years we are." 18 Not only that, Colorado's position relies on 19 the fact that they did this in 1948, and it's gone 20 unnoticed by the Court, any major treatise, or 21 commentary -22 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. I got mixed up 23 on my dates. The words "in any court of the United" -24 what the words are now is "in any court." It says 25 "court of the United States includes" in 451 courts.

1 When did that language come in? 2 MR. SIX: In 1948. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: In '48? 4 MR. SIX: Yes. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: So the inclusion wasn't 6 there till then. Now, normally, in the '48 revision, 7 the rule is they intended to make no substantive change. 8 When they did intend to make a substantive change, they 9 said as much. So is there anything in the history of 10 that that suggests they intended to make a substantive 11 change here? 12 MR. SIX: No, there isn't. And they changed 13 -14 JUSTICE BREYER: No? 15 MR. SIX: They changed -16 JUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, the 17 language "in addition to the courts listed in section 18 451 of this title," that -- those words I just said have 19 no appearance in the statutes before 1948? Yes or no. 20 MR. SIX: Yes. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: They do appear before? 22 MR. SIX: No. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: No, they do not. 24 MR. SIX: First time in 1948. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: First time in 1948. So

SIX: Yes. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I got the argument. 8 Thank you. 9 MR. SIX: And they did change something 10 else. They changed "shall" to "may," and they gave a 11 reason for that change. 12 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 14 The case is submitted. 15 (Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in the 16 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
