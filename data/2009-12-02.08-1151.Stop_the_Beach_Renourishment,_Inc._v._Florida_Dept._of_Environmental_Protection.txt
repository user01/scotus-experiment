1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:02 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument this morning in Case 08-1151, Stop the Beach 5 Renourishment v. The Florida Department of Environmental 6 Protection. 7 Mr. Safriet. 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF D. KENT SAFRIET 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 10 MR. SAFRIET: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 11 please the Court: 12 Today we ask this Court to expressly 13 recognize that a State court decision, unpredictable in 14 terms of relevant precedents, which redefines 15 century-old property rights to no longer exist, violates 16 the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. 17 The Florida Supreme Court suddenly and 18 dramatically redefined littoral property rights, 19 converting oceanfront property into oceanview property 20 to avoid the finding of a taking. It did so in the 21 context of a beach restoration project which could have 22 been accomplished without taking any private property at 23 all. Given this Court's jurisprudence that a State's 24 legislative and executive branches cannot violate the 25 Fifth Amendment, we see no reason why the judicial
3 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 branch should be treated any differently. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your basic 3 position in the litigation in Florida was that the 4 Florida legislation violated the takings protection, and 5 so it's kind of strange to switch your target from the 6 legislature, which enacted this measure, and then say, 7 because the judiciary upheld it, the judiciary somehow 8 is complicit in this violation by the legislature 9 implemented by the administrative offices. 10 MR. SAFRIET: That is correct, Your Honor. 11 Below, the case was litigated as one of a taking by the 12 legislature when it passed the Act. 13 When it passed the Beach and Shore 14 Preservation Act, it contained a provision within 15 section 161.141, which is a savings clause, that said to 16 the extent the beach restoration cannot be accomplished 17 without taking property rights, the requesting 18 authorities have to use eminent domain proceedings to 19 take those rights. 20 At the First District Court of Appeal, they 21 agreed with us that the littoral rights were being taken 22 by the Act of the legislature and that those had to be 23 compensated for. When we arrived at the Florida Supreme 24 Court, again, all of the parties were arguing those 25 issues, whether there was a physical taking of these
4 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 rights or a regulatory taking of these rights by the Act 2 and whether the savings clause would apply. 3 To everybody's shock, the Florida Supreme 4 Court said: We're going to go back to step one and 5 decide you don't have any littoral rights. The 6 legislature didn't eliminate any protected littoral 7 rights that you thought you once had for over a hundred 8 years as the relevant precedents in common law indicate. 9 So it was that decision of the Florida Supreme Court, 10 that said you have -- no longer have property, that 11 gives rise to the issue before this Court is, can the 12 Florida Supreme Court redefine those 100-year-old rights 13 to no longer exist? 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Applied in a new 15 situation. It was never the kind of situation 16 involved here with the beach restoration project. The 17 -- the precedent did not involve the kind of situation 18 that this case presents. 19 MR. SAFRIET: Yes, Your Honor. There is no 20 precedent with respect to the Beach and Shore 21 Preservation Act as it has ever been applied. We do 22 concede that. 23 However, there are two fundamental 24 principles of Florida law that have existed for more 25 than a hundred years, and those are property that must
5 Alderson Reporting Company

1 ­- property that borders the mean high-water line and 2 must remain in contact with the mean high-water line to 3 possess common law littoral rights. If that connection 4 is not there, there are no common law littoral rights. 5 Common law littoral rights are constitutionally 6 protected and cannot be taken without due process and 7 just compensation. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're 9 eliminated -- at least the right of contact with the 10 water can be eliminated by an avulsion, right? 11 When there's -- when there's avulsion, even 12 at common law and under Florida law, it -- it can happen 13 that some land between the property owner and -- and the 14 water will be owned by the State. 15 MR. SAFRIET: That is correct, Your Honor. 16 Under the -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why wasn't this an 18 avulsion? 19 MR. SAFRIET: Well, because the avulsion in 20 this case, Your Honor, was the hurricanes that the State 21 cites as the reason for the beaches being washed away, 22 and -- and it was -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, well, well, well. 24 There were -- there were two avulsions. One was the 25 avulsion of its being washed away and the other was the
6 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 -- the rapid replacement of sand. That -- that is not a 2 natural, gradual phenomenon. 3 MR. SAFRIET: That is right, Your Honor, but 4 the -- there is no case law in Florida or no principle 5 that says avulsion can occur by artificial means. So 6 there is -- the beach restoration, where they placed 7 sand on the beach, is not avulsion. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: If there's no case law, it 9 seems to me you've lost your case. 10 MR. SAFRIET: No, the case law specifically 11 says that avulsion is a result of natural occurrences, 12 by the action of the wind and the water. That's what 13 avulsion is in Florida and has been -- you know, for at 14 least 50 years, I believe. It's -15 JUSTICE BREYER: They have a new situation. 16 It's sort of like an avulsion. It's sort of like an 17 accretion. The only precedent of -- you keep talking 18 about a hundred years -- it seemed to me some dictum in 19 a case called Sand Key, which does say that the upland 20 property owner has the right to touch the water. 21 So in this case, the Florida Supreme Court 22 says the purpose of that was to make certain that the 23 upland property owner could go to the water. And so 24 here we have a case that assures he can go to the water, 25 and they have a new situation, which, as I think
7 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Justice Scalia said, looks an awful lot like an 2 avulsion, though of course there are differences. 3 So it sounds like a typical common law 4 situation. A new situation arises. You try to apply 5 old precedent, and they reached the result they did. 6 Now, what's your response to that? Because that's the 7 argument the other side makes. 8 MR. SAFRIET: The response to that, Your 9 Honor, is the doctrine of avulsion -- as part of the 10 doctrine of avulsion is the doctrine -- or the right to 11 reclaim what was lost by the landowner. So when an 12 avulsion event occurs, the landowner that has lost 13 property has a right under common law to reclaim what 14 they lost. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't lose any. 16 It just went out the front door there. The land ended 17 here, and the new avulsion comes in and extends it 18 further. You didn't lose one inch. All you lost was 19 the right to touch the water. But the court here says 20 you in effect have that right because you can walk right 21 over it and get to the water. 22 MR. SAFRIET: What -- what was lost in this 23 case, Your Honor, is the right to contact the mean high24 water line, and I think there's a distinction between 25 the right to contact the mean high-water line and the
8 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 water's edge. The Florida Supreme Court didn't address 2 the former issue, contact with the mean high-water line. 3 That's -4 JUSTICE BREYER: Don't you have a right to 5 walk across and put your boat in the water and swim, and 6 nobody can stop you? 7 MR. SAFRIET: Right. Across the foreshore, 8 yes, Your Honor. And also, as part of the common law 9 rights of access -10 JUSTICE BREYER: Now you have that right. 11 They didn't take that away from you. The statute gives 12 it to you. 13 MR. SAFRIET: That's correct. We have that 14 right -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If somebody wanted 16 to put up a hot dog stand on this new land, would you 17 have the right to tell them they can't? 18 MR. SAFRIET: Absolutely not, Your Honor, 19 and that's the point I was getting to. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: You say "absolutely not." 21 I thought there was a provision in this law that said 22 they cannot put anything on that strip which destroys 23 your right of enjoyment of the upland right. Now, if 24 they put a noisy hot dog stand that keeps you up at 25 night, doesn't that violate the statute?

1 MR. SAFRIET: I think the statute provides 2 no permanent structures can be constructed on that new 3 property. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say anything 5 about your right to peaceful enjoyment? 6 MR. SAFRIET: It certainly does. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: And what does it say? 8 MR. SAFRIET: It says that the -- you know, 9 your regular common law uses that cannot be -10 JUSTICE BREYER: So what does the statute 11 say about your right to have peaceful enjoyment of your 12 land? 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you can have quiet 14 hot dog stands during the daytime. 15 (Laughter.) 16 MR. SAFRIET: Yes. Yes. It's says no uses 17 of that property can be injurious to the common law -18 JUSTICE BREYER: Injurious, okay. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But do you have any 20 -21 MR. SAFRIET: Of course, now -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any 23 reason to suppose that that's a redefinition of -- of 24 property that the legislature isn't free to change 25 tomorrow?
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. SAFRIET: Yes, the legislature can 2 change this definition of property. They can define 3 property in the State of Florida as to whatever they 4 want it to be, but if they do so and take property, they 5 must pay for it under the just compensation clause. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, before this 7 legislation, in the seaward side of the land that 8 belonged to the State, from the mean high-water mark, a 9 hot dog stand could have sat in the water, correct? 10 MR. SAFRIET: If somebody wanted to put one 11 in the water, yes, Your Honor. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And someone could have 13 stood there, a boat could have docked there, assuming 14 that it -- it was a shallow boat. 15 You had no control over anyone placing 16 anything on the seaside submerged lands that belonged to 17 the State, outside of whatever regulations the State 18 decided it wanted to impose? 19 MR. SAFRIET: We had no exclusive right to 20 exclude them from that property. But they could not 21 unnecessarily interfere with our right to view or our -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The ECL that has been 23 created by this legislation -- you gave up any challenge 24 to it -- it was established at that mean water mark, 25 wasn't it?
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. SAFRIET: Yes. The ECL in this case, as 2 the case was litigated, was assumed to be located 3 directly on top of the mean high-water line. We did not 4 abandon a challenge to the ECL. What we abandoned was 5 any challenge as to where the ECL was placed in relation 6 to -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, right now, we just 8 have to assume that it was -- that it -- it has 9 established the line at a point where the State owns all 10 the land seaward of the ECL, correct? 11 MR. SAFRIET: Yes, Your Honor. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So after this project 13 finishes, that hot water -- that hot dog vendor will be 14 on stateside land, correct? 15 MR. SAFRIET: That is correct, Your Honor. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No different than what 17 exists today, before the legislation, which is if the 18 hot dog vendor wanted to sit in a foot of water, it 19 could have? 20 MR. SAFRIET: It certainly could sit in a 21 foot of water. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So none of 23 your actual use rights, pleasure rights, or anything 24 else has been changed. What you're arguing is that -25 and what
12 Alderson Reporting Company

1 the Florida State Supreme Court described as the 2 contingent future possibility that the high-water mark 3 might change and you could push that hot dog vendor back 4 another foot or two. 5 MR. SAFRIET: That is correct, Your Honor. 6 Anybody allowed -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, such -- such 8 boats floating in -- in the water below the mean high 9 water mark are available with respect to all littoral 10 properties. Isn't that right? 11 MR. SAFRIET: That is right, Your Honor. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what can't happen with 13 other littoral property is that folks can't come in and 14 lay down beach blankets and occupy that sand, right, so 15 that you have open sand in front of -- in front of your 16 house? 17 MR. SAFRIET: That is correct, Your Honor. 18 The -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And people pay a lot more 20 money for beach -- beachfront homes, for that reason, 21 don't they? 22 MR. SAFRIET: Absolutely, Your Honor. The 23 value of beachfront property is a premium. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's quite different 25 from having a house behind the beach at Coney Island,
13 Alderson Reporting Company

1 isn't it? 2 MR. SAFRIET: Absolutely, Your Honor. And 3 in this case -4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, can you -- can you 5 explain something that's unclear to me from the briefs 6 and the records? That is, there -- this -- what is 7 referred to as "the foreshore," was that wet all the 8 time? I thought the suggestion was that that was in 9 effect beach, public beach, that people could walk on, 10 not swim in. 11 MR. SAFRIET: The foreshore, Your Honor, is 12 typically the land area between the mean high-water line 13 and the low high-water line, and depending on the tide 14 cycles of the day, some of that foreshore is dry, and 15 then at other times -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- and the public 17 -- what -- what was the situation here? Was there a 18 strip of dry land that the public has been using? 19 MR. SAFRIET: There's -- the foreshore, Your 20 Honor, which is periodically dry on any given day and 21 periodically wet -- the public can use that, and they 22 have always been able to use that. That is State-owned 23 land, and they can use that to traverse up and down the 24 beach. But, again, because it's wet every day, you 25 don't have hot dog vendors putting hot dog stands in the
14 Alderson Reporting Company

1 water. You don't have people laying their blankets in 2 the water to enjoy that beach. 3 And what we're talking about here is the 4 exclusive right to use the dry sand area that stays dry 5 all of the time in our case, which in our case was a 6 200-foot stretch of beach before this project began, and 7 we had 200 feet of beach, and we had the right to 8 exclude commercial vendors or anybody else from that 9 property. 10 Now what we have after that, according to 11 this project, is another 80 feet to 100 feet of dry sand 12 beach owned by the State where the landowners have no 13 ability to exclude commercial vendors or any other 14 obnoxious uses of that property. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who owns that land? I 16 mean, when it was submerged it belonged to the State. 17 And is it your position that the owners in your 18 organization, that they have title to that land that was 19 once owned by the State? 20 MR. SAFRIET: Absolutely not, Your Honor. 21 It's our position that the State, as a matter of public 22 use under the Takings Clause, can condemn that property 23 and make a public beach in front of a private one. They 24 absolutely can do that. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I mean -- I mean,
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 without condemning it, you say the title is held by the 2 private owners even though the title was held by the 3 State when the land was submerged. 4 MR. SAFRIET: No, Your Honor, I'm not saying 5 that the landowners own that new 80-foot stretch of 6 beach now, as it currently exists. What we argue is we 7 own to the erosion control line, which is the property 8 boundary that the State created in this case. And the 9 State, by operation of the Act, claims title to the new 10 80-foot strip of beach. And what we're trying to obtain 11 here is the State to go through eminent domain 12 proceedings to pay us compensation for the loss of 13 littoral rights that they're taking by creating this 14 public strip of beach. 15 Now, the State may at the end of the day 16 say, well, we're not going to claim title to that; we're 17 going to reinstate your boundary as the mean high-water 18 line -- that would be 80 feet further out -- and no 19 compensation, in that case, would be due. But -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be -- what 21 would your position be, assuming you still have title, 22 you still have the right of littoral title, contact with 23 the water? Would you concede that the State has 24 different regulatory interests with respect to that new 25 strip of land versus the old strip of land?
16 Alderson Reporting Company

1 It's still your property. The State can 2 regulate your property. Presumably, they regulate your 3 beach property now. Would their different -- would 4 their authority to regulate be greater with respect to 5 the new area? 6 MR. SAFRIET: As the owner of the property, 7 Your Honor? If the State owned that property? 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Your -- you 9 would still have the title to the property. 10 MR. SAFRIET: Okay. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's still your 12 property. You know, the State regulates property all 13 the time, in zoning -- would their authority be broader 14 with respect to that new land than with respect to the 15 old? 16 MR. SAFRIET: No, Your Honor, I don't think 17 so. The State already has broad authority to regulate 18 property already, and then would -- I wouldn't see any 19 need for them to have any broader authority for that new 20 strip of beach if our members owned it. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sometimes -- and I 22 don't actually know what the law is on this. Sometimes 23 the State builds, you know, sidewalks in front of 24 people. Maybe they do it on their own land, and they 25 say: We're putting this easement, and people can walk
17 Alderson Reporting Company

1 across it. Would this be in the same category of public 2 project? They say, well, it's your land because you 3 have a right to the mean high-water land, but we built 4 it so we have greater rights with respect to regulation 5 than we might have with respect to the natural beach. 6 MR. SAFRIET: No, Your Honor, I don't think 7 they would have any greater rights to that. I mean, if 8 -- if the landowners are the fee-simple title owner, 9 then the State has its basic police powers to regulate 10 as it would any other land, absent some type of easement 11 or reservation of our agreement with the landowners that 12 give them greater rights and -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: The State gave you some 14 quid pro quo for this, which is to say this new sand is 15 projected to last 6 years, has to be replaced regularly, 16 because your -- your property is being eroded, which is 17 the reason the State went into this. And what the State 18 has given you in exchange is that if and when there is 19 further erosion, you will continue to own up to whatever 20 this new line is called. 21 MR. SAFRIET: ECL. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: The ECL. You will continue 23 to -- to own up to there, despite the fact that under 24 common law when there's more erosion, your -- your line 25 would recede to the new mean high-water mark. So, you
18 Alderson Reporting Company

1 know, who -- who knows? Maybe that's sufficient 2 compensation. You know, if you go in and ask for 3 compensation, the State might say, you know, we've given 4 them -- given them this property right in exchange, and 5 the difference between that and what they have now is 6 two dollars. 7 MR. SAFRIET: That -- that may well be the 8 case, Your Honor, but, again, they haven't provided us 9 the opportunity to go to that trial, that jury trial, to 10 argue that these -- the value of this new 75-foot 11 stretch of beach on top of the 200-foot stretch of beach 12 provides value above and beyond the taking of the -13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you this 14 question on Florida valuation. Assume you prevail, 15 there's a cause of action for a taking. You have a 16 beachfront area, beachfront home, in which there's a 17 hurricane and there's a loss of the beach and a sudden 18 drop, so that it's now a 60-foot -- a 60-foot drop. The 19 State comes in and says the only way we can fix this 20 is to extend the beach and make it a larger beach on 21 what was formerly our submerged land. And it does that 22 that. Under -- and it -- and it has the same rule. 23 Under your view, is the State required to 24 pay you for the loss of your right of contact to the 25 beach, your littoral right, because there's let's say
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 another 100 foot of new beach? Are they entitled to 2 offset that against the enhanced value to your property 3 by reason of the fact that they've saved it from further 4 erosion and have given you a beach where there was none 5 before? 6 MR. SAFRIET: Yes, Your Honor, they are able 7 to offset that, and the -- the statute provides for that 8 offsetting such that in an eminent domain proceedings 9 whatever value the landowners lost as a result of their 10 -- losing their contact with the mean high-water line, 11 that any benefit provided by the additional sand would 12 be offset -13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the enhancement from 14 the post-project benefit is a credit to the State in the 15 takings action? 16 MR. SAFRIET: That -- that is according to 17 the statute that was passed, Your Honor. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did any of these beachfront 19 owners think this was a good deal, that the State has 20 prevented further erosion of their land and, you know, 21 the price they pay for that is that they have this 22 60-foot stretch that -- that the public can use, and 23 that may wash away in 6 years anyway, and if they're 24 lucky the State won't have enough money to put it back? 25 Or --

1 (Laughter.) 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did anybody -- I'm not sure 3 it's a bad deal. And they're guaranteed against -4 against further loss of property because they will 5 continue to own up to that -- to that new line, even 6 if it's all covered by water. 7 MR. SAFRIET: No, Your Honor. Our -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Nobody -- nobody thought it 9 was a good deal? Everybody thought that they had been 10 done out of something? 11 MR. SAFRIET: With respect to the 12 Petitioner's members, they thought it was a bad deal, 13 Your Honor. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Petitioner's members, but 15 other people along -- along the same coast? I mean, if 16 I had a place and it's being -- it's being eroded by 17 hurricanes constantly, you know, I -- I'm not sure 18 whether I wouldn't -- wouldn't want to have the sand 19 replaced, even at the -- at the cost of having a 60-foot 20 stretch that the State owns. 21 MR. SAFRIET: I think that's the fundamental 22 misunderstanding in this case. The beach was not 23 eroding. It was not lapping under these houses. There 24 was 200 feet of dry beach, and the beach is accreting, 25 meaning it grows gradually, day by day or week by week.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what happened? There 2 were a succession of hurricanes, I thought. 3 MR. SAFRIET: With the exception of 4 hurricanes. But hurricanes are, again, avulsive events 5 that don't change the property boundary line. We talked 6 about the right to reclaim earlier. So this is an a 7 accreting beach, 200-foot accreting beach. These 8 property owners did not view that they were gaining 9 anything. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It may not change the 11 property line, but all of your property might be under 12 water -13 (Laughter.) 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- right? That wouldn't be 15 very good. 16 MR. SAFRIET: That's a risk that they -17 Petitioner's members -- were willing to take. They 18 bought oceanfront property. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, your members were, 20 but I was asking whether some other people might not 21 have thought it was a pretty good deal. 22 MR. SAFRIET: Sure. Sure, Your Honor, there 23 are a lot of properties, probably even in this stretch, 24 where water is lapping under the houses, and the -- and 25 the landowners will want sand, and they'll be willing to

1 waive any types of property rights claims or 2 compensation claims to get that sand. But that's not 3 what happened -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could the State -5 MR. SAFRIET: -- in this case. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could the State sell 7 this new land to somebody else? 8 MR. SAFRIET: Yes. There's no reason they 9 couldn't, because they own the fee-simple title to it, 10 as well as they could send the sovereign submerged lands 11 in front of the property. 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it would be subject to 13 the easement that the State acknowledges you have, which 14 is the easement of access? 15 MR. SAFRIET: I'm not sure it would be, Your 16 Honor. The statute provides that right of access -17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the -- the -18 MR. SAFRIET: -- so basically it's not an 19 easement per se that inheres in our title. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. As I understand 21 the supreme court's opinions, you have several special 22 and exclusive -- or exclusive -- or exclusive, common 23 law littoral rights: right to have access, right to 24 reasonable use of the water, right to accretion and 25 reliction, right to the unobstructed view. They can't

1 sell that. 2 MR. SAFRIET: Yes, but we don't have common 3 law rights anymore, Your Honor, because we don't -4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. 5 MR. SAFRIET: -- contact the mean high-water 6 line. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the hypothetical is 8 the State says that the property owner, the upland 9 owner, has these rights. The Chief Justice asked you, 10 could this property be sold? I think the answer would 11 be yes, but it would be subject to the continuance of 12 that easement in the dominant estate. That has to be 13 the answer under the supreme court's opinion. Now, you 14 may not agree with that. 15 MR. SAFRIET: Under the supreme court's 16 opinion, yes, because it purports to reserve common law 17 rights across this new stretch of State-owned beach. 18 It's our contention that all common law rights have been 19 lost when we lose connection to the mean high-water 20 line. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. That gets to 22 the question, if we agree with you that there is such a 23 thing as a judicial takings, what is the standard by 24 which we decide when the Federal courts can and must 25 intervene to disagree with the -- with the State law and

1 to characterize it as a taking when the State has said 2 that it is not? Would we just find all sorts of 3 adjectives -- it's sudden, unexpected, unfounded -- we 4 just have a string of adjectives, sort of like an 5 adequate independent State ground rule or something? 6 MR. SAFRIET: Yes, Your Honor, that would be 7 the test that we would suggest, as Justice Stewart noted 8 in his concurring opinion in Hughes. And the test we 9 would propose is that a judicial taking occurs when a 10 State court effects a sudden and dramatic change in 11 State law, unpredictable in terms of relevant 12 precedents, that have no fair or substantial support in 13 well-established background principles of State law. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, I'm familiar with 15 that opinion. Now, in this case, number one, it seems 16 to me that in order to do that, we have to become real 17 experts in Florida law. 18 Number two, once we do that it seems to me 19 that this opinion really addresses something that's -20 that's new, and it's -- it's grounded in common law 21 doctrines. It's a close case. It might have gone 22 either way. Let's assume that. Does there have to be 23 some finding that the State decision is clearly 24 unreasonable? I mean, if it's a close case, does the 25 State win under your test?

1 MR. SAFRIET: Your Honor, I think the test  2 - again, the fair and substantial support -- provides 3 adequate deference to the State court. And in 4 objectively reviewing the precedents, this Court doesn't 5 have to become an expert in State law. It merely has to 6 review those precedents to make sure that the Florida 7 Supreme Court in fact relied on background principles of 8 law rather than creating nonexistent rules of State 9 substantive law -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that, 11 reading the opinion, I -- I can get there. There was 12 some talk about the Belvedere case as helping you. I 13 thought it did not at all. That was a very odd case 14 where the easement is wholly separated from the 15 dominant. It's the reverse. They take the main 16 property and leave the easement, rather than vice versa. 17 So I just thought that was irrelevant. 18 MR. SAFRIET: Yes, the case law, Your Honor, 19 and the incremental changes that we are dealing with 20 here that would be part of your test is the government 21 or the State can gradually change these property rights 22 or property laws so long as they leave the owner with 23 the rights. And in this case what the Florida Supreme 24 Court has done is said: We're not just gradually 25 changing them and leaving you with these common law

SAFRIET: It's not weird, because in 24 1987 in the Sand Key case, the Florida Supreme Court 25 said that the proposition that the State has cited that

It 3 didn't deal even deal with the doctrine of avulsion or 4 reliction or accretion. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that's true? 6 MR. SAFRIET: I'm sorry, Your Honor? 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: I know they said that. Do 8 you think that's true? When I read it, it seemed to me 9 to deal with reliction precisely. 10 MR.

1 Let me go ahead and address some issues that 2 have come up about Florida law. Number one, this idea 3 of artificial avulsion that was discussed earlier, the 4 Bryant v. Peppe case, which cites the Martin -- that was 5 discussed in the Martin case, talks about when the State 6 comes in on its own property and either lowers the water 7 or, in this case, puts sand on the -- on the State side 8 of the property line, that that's an artificial 9 avulsion, the State retains title to its State lands, 10 the upland owner, the private property owner retains 11 ownership of their land. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it depends 13 on -- or maybe not -- how quickly it all happens. I 14 mean, if the State project is such that they add a foot 15 a year, is that an avulsion or accretion? 16 MR. MAKAR: Well, it would be an avulsion. 17 It would still be the State adding sand to its side of 18 the line. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is your view 20 whenever the State does it, it's an avulsion? 21 MR. MAKAR: If it's on -- if it's on its 22 property, that's absolutely the case. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? I thought 24 avulsion by definition is a sudden change. 25 MR. MAKAR: No, no. Under, Florida Law the

1 Bryant v. Peppe case, which was an avulsion case that 2 arose out of a hurricane, where there was land that 3 was previously submerged, it came up, it was over State 4 property, the private owners wanted to get the -- get 5 it, and they asserted that it was theirs in accretion, 6 and the court said no, and it cited to Martin. There's 7 no right to having contact with the water. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- you're -- we're 9 wandering off the point. Why wasn't it an avulsion? It 10 was an avulsion in that case, wasn't it, because it was 11 sudden? 12 MR. MAKAR: But it was done by the State. 13 I'm sorry, maybe I'm confusing cases. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is -15 MR. MAKAR: Martin -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: You have a case for the 17 proposition that an -- what would otherwise be an 18 avulsion is an accretion if it's done by the State? 19 MR. MAKAR: Oh, no, no, no. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or vice versa. What would 21 otherwise be an accretion is an avulsion if done by the 22 State? 23 MR. MAKAR: No, no, no. An -- an accretion 24 would have to be a sudden, imperceptible change in the 25 shore line.

MAKAR: Well, that's -- but that's not 15 the way it is under -- under Florida law, if the State 16 comes in on its own property and adds to it, as it did 17 in Martin, where it lowered the -- the water or in this 18 case where they added the sand, it -- the State retains 19 the right to it. The upland owner doesn't get it.

1 of accretion and avulsion to things that are done by the 2 State? If someone owns beachfront property, they 3 accept -- they -- they understand the risk that a 4 hurricane may cause avulsion, a hurricane may knock down 5 their house. Does that mean the State could come in and 6 knock down the house and say this is an artificial 7 avulsion? 8 MR. MAKAR: No, absolutely -9 (Laughter.) 10 MR. MAKAR: No, absolutely not. I mean, 11 what the State did here is it -- 40 years ago, was to -12 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what's the difference? 13 You're taking a concept that has to do with a risk that 14 you bear because of the -- the vagaries of -- of the 15 weather and storms, and you're applying it to something 16 that's done by the State. 17 MR. MAKAR: Well, maybe we're on Mars and 18 Venus here because we're talking about a label. We're 19 talking about the State's -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, talking about a label, 21 and putting the avulsion label and the accretion label 22 on something that the State does, doesn't -- doesn't 23 eliminate the fact that there's been a fundamental 24 change. You have taken a doctrine that applies to 25 things that occur as a result of nature and you've
33 Alderson Reporting Company

1 applied it to things that are produced by the State. 2 MR. MAKAR: Well, there's no question under 3 Florida law that the State has the right on its 4 sovereignty lands to control those lands and use those for 5 the public trust. And what the Florida legislature did 6 40 years ago -- keeping in mind this has been on the 7 books 40 years, 200 miles of beaches have been restored 8 over those years, and no one has complained that this is 9 a taking of property. That -- it's a reasoned response 10 for the Florida Supreme Court to come in and say, okay, 11 they're challenging the Act. They say it denies 12 them two things: the right to future accretion and the 13 right to have contact with the water. 14 Martin v. Busch and Bryant v. Peppe say, 15 look, if -- you don't have a right of contact with the 16 water, if you have avulsion or if you have it in -- in 17 Martin, it was a State drainage project. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I can -- we're 19 arguing about the application of a doctrine to this 20 case. I'd like to step back if I can and talk about 21 the doctrine through a hypothetical, if that's all 22 right. 23 MR. MAKAR: Sure. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the -- let's 25 say the legislature passes an act saying the boundary of
34 Alderson Reporting Company

1 beachfront property is now where the sand starts, and 2 not the mean high-water mark but the mean high-sand 3 mark. All right? And -- and then -- so that's sued. 4 You -- you sue under that, and the court says: Yes, of 5 course, that's a taking; our precedents have always said 6 it's the mean high-water line and nothing else. 7 Florida has judicial elections. Say, 8 somebody runs for election for the Florida Supreme Court 9 and says: I'm going to change that law. I'm going to 10 say that it is not a taking. I think people should be 11 able to walk right up to the land. 12 And that person is elected, and the law is 13 changed. Now, is -- is that a judicial taking? 14 MR. MAKAR: I think under the scenario 15 you're posing that's a possibility. That's where the ­16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it a possibility 17 or is it a clear case? 18 MR. MAKAR: Well, I think it would -- if 19 it -- if it's -- it sounds like this is the Cannon Beach 20 situation, where the court judicially said, okay, you 21 don't own to the mean high-water line; now you own up -22 only up to the vegetation line. Or something along 23 those lines where it was an ouster. Here there's no 24 ouster of property rights. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I know.

1 You're changing -2 MR. MAKAR: Right. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand you 4 have a different view about here. But under my 5 hypothetical, would you agree that the action of the 6 Florida Supreme Court is a taking? 7 MR. MAKAR: Yes, I would -- I would 8 countenance that -- that here we have a far different 9 situation, which we have an act of the legislature that 10 draws this line, and that the two attributes that they 11 are claiming have no basis whatsoever in background 12 principles of Florida law. There is no case they can 13 point to, to say that we have a right of contact -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what they say is the 15 following -- this is what they say, I think: They point 16 to a case called Sand Key, and in Sand Key it says 17 littoral property rights include the following vested 18 rights: One, the right of access to the water, 19 including the right to have the property's contact with 20 the water remain intact. That's what the court said. 21 And in the court's opinion what it says 22 about that is it says, in this case, the Act expressly 23 protects the right of access to the water, which is the 24 sole justification for the subsidiary right of contact. 25

1 in Sand Key, and they're asking why was it there in Sand 2 Key, and that's what they come up with. 3 Now, after this sentence I just read you, 4 there is no citation. So I want you to add anything you 5 would like to say why this is, that sentence I read you, 6 justifiable under Florida law. 7 MR.

MAKAR: Oh, sure. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Tell me if I'm right, and 19 if I am right, that that is meant to be the answer, 20 justify it, if you can. 21 MR. MAKAR: Sure. What they're citing to is 22 some dicta in Sand Key that had nothing to do with the 23 holding of that case, and if you try to go back and look 24 at the citations to the cases that Sand Key cites for 25 that proposition of contact with the water, none of them

1 have to do with contact with water. 2 Instead, the most important point is to look 3 at Martin v. Busch, which was a case where the State 4 lowered the water in a lake, the upland owners at -- the 5 property line was determined not to have moved, they 6 didn't have any contact with the water any longer, and 7 the submerged sovereignty lands became the State's 8 property. There's no right of contact there. It's -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sand Key's statement 10 strikes one as -- as correct simply because I think 11 that's -- that's the view of the common law. I -- I 12 don't think that's unique or distinctive to Florida. I 13 think it would be very strange to have a principle that 14 all the -- all the littoral owner gets is a right to 15 access the water and not the right to be on the water, 16 to have his property on the water. 17 I think -- I think in every State, 18 beachfront owners would be astounded to learn that 19 that's the case. 20 So, I -- you know, I thought that Sand Key 21 was just expressing what -- what was the common law. 22 And the notion that -- that the only purpose of the 23 contact with the water is so that you can have access, 24 that is -- is that not silly? 25 MR. MAKAR: No. Well, two points here I
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 would like to make. Number one, let's assume there was 2 an avulsive event that added sand on the State's 3 property along the beach line, so now we have the 4 property line not changing, it's exactly where it was 5 before, but now we have, say, 75 feet of sand, new sand 6 seaward, over the State's property. That's the State's 7 property -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not the 9 question. I mean, you just said that, let's assume the 10 -- assuming the property line doesn't change. The other 11 side is saying the property line is the mean high-water 12 line, and so if you -- whoever adds sand, the State, 13 mother nature, you dumping it -- I guess you can't do 14 that, but whoever adds it, the property line is the mean 15 high-water line. 16 MR. MAKAR: But -- but -- well -- but under 17 this avulsive event where there is sand added seaward, 18 the contact by the upland owner with the water no longer 19 exists, and that's been on the books in Florida for -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that's 21 because you think the property line is the ECL rather 22 than the MHWL. 23 MR. MAKAR: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. 24 What I'm talking about is put the Act aside and just say 25 at common law in Florida. If the sand is added through
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 avulsive events, the upland owner has no contact with 2 the water any longer. They certainly have access. And 3 the Florida Act is so solicitous of protecting the 4 property rights of riparian ownership. You go through 5 the statute, and you see they preserve common law 6 littoral -- littoral rights. They have a section -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that person still be 8 considered a littoral owner? 9 MR. MAKAR: That was my second point. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: After there has been the 11 avulsive event that separates him from the ocean by 60 12 feet of State-owned land, would he still be a -- a 13 riparian owner? I thought -14 MR. MAKAR: Absolutely, absolutely. And 15 that's a major misnomer in this case, is that the upland 16 owner here, even after the beach restoration project, 17 has riparian littoral property. That's what the Florida 18 Supreme Court has held, that's what the Florida 19 legislation says. There's -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's not 21 -- it's not the same as the property right he held 22 before, right? 23 MR. MAKAR: I -- I would disagree with that, 24 Mr. Chief Justice. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he can exclude
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 people from the additional 60 feet? 2 MR. MAKAR: But it's not his -- it's not 3 their property. It's the State's -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, that's what 5 the case is about. 6 MR. MAKAR: Well, I -- I agree that's what 7 they have tried to make it about. What they've said is 8 the State now has this swath of sand. It's a barrier to 9 protect against erosion. It's no wider than this 10 courtroom. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose that -12 suppose that a city decided that it wanted to attract 13 more students who are going to the beach in Florida for 14 spring break, and so therefore it decided it was going 15 to create a huge beach in front of -- of privately owned 16 homes. Under the decision of the Florida Supreme Court, 17 I don't see anything that would stop the city from doing 18 that. So you could have -- you could have televised 19 spring break beach parties in front of -- of somebody's 20 house. Now, in -- as a practical matter, doesn't that 21 have a real effect on the value of the property? 22 MR. MAKAR: Well, Justice Alito, in 23 response, what I'd say here is keep in mind this is the 24 Beach and Shore Preservation Act. It isn't designed to 25 create some recreational playground for spring breakers.
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 It's designed to -2 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that, but 3 if the -- but the Florida Supreme Court said that there 4 isn't any right -- if there is a manmade extension of 5 the beach, there is no right to exclude people from it; 6 it's -- the beach is owned by the State. So all of that 7 could take place, couldn't it? 8 MR. MAKAR: Well, not under the Act, because 9 -- here's why: Under the Act, what has to be done is a 10 survey. And you'd have the -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's not talking about the 12 Act. He's just talking about your theory of the case. 13 Your theory of what the rights of beachfront owners 14 consist of would permit this to happen, if not under 15 this Act, under some other act, right? 16 MR. MAKAR: Well, if there was -- if there 17 were some other act where the legislature passes a 18 law -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Well, it's the 20 Spring Break Act of 2010, okay? 21 (Laughter.) 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: They could do that, 23 couldn't they? 24 MR. MAKAR: Well -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Under your theory of the
42 Alderson Reporting Company

1 case? 2 MR. MAKAR: Well, they -- they would, but 3 the point being is that they would have to preserve the 4 littoral rights of -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why do we have to say 6 that? I mean, they're writing a -- a -- an opinion here 7 against a background of an act, and as I read that 8 opinion -- you can add something to this if you want -9 I make a list of what they say in effect provides, not 10 perfectly, but provides, roughly, the same kind of 11 protection that the Sand Key statement provided. 12 One, you can go to the water; two, you have 13 a right of ingress and egress, if that's any different 14 from the first. I'm not positive. Three, you have a 15 right under the Act that nobody can put anything on that 16 strip which is injurious to the upland owner. All 17 right? 18 So those are at least three things, and I 19 think there's a fourth. Yes, the fourth is that nobody 20 can build anything there that is harmful, except if it's 21 to do with the environment; that's not harmful, that's 22 helpful to the beach owner. It's supposed to be 23 helpful. And, five, you get your beach guaranteed. 24 So all of those things are things you get 25 under this Act in an intermediate case where it's a
43 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 little like an avulsion and a little not like an 2 avulsion. Now, do I add anything to my list? And do 3 you have to go beyond that? 4 MR. MAKAR: No, well, there's -- there's 5 even more, Justice Breyer. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, that's what I wanted 7 to know. What more? 8 MR. MAKAR: What the legislature in Florida 9 did as well is to say that when they do the survey, as 10 you see in the document attached in the joint appendix, 11 they have to set out what the width of the berm will be, 12 the sacrificial sand that's there to erode away over 13 time. They put the width in there. And in this 14 particular instance, it's about 75 feet. And it's going 15 to erode away. That cannot be increased without the 16 consent of the owners. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why doesn't -18 why don't you take your list and Justice Breyer's list 19 and submit that in the just compensation hearing? When 20 the landowner comes in and says, look, you have taken my 21 property and it is worth $100,000, and you come in and 22 say oh, no, no; it's not worth $100,000; look at all 23 these things we saved and gave you. It's only -- what 24 you have lost is only worth $20,000. And a court will 25 review that and say yes, no, whatever, and that's what

1 you get. 2 MR. MAKAR: Well, because, Mr. Chief 3 Justice, under background principles of Florida law, 4 they have no right to contact with the water, and this 5 accretion right is -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Again, that is what 7 the whole case is about, whether they have a right to 8 contact the water or not. It seems to me if your only 9 answer to every question is they don't have the right, 10 you're just completely begging the question. 11 MR. MAKAR: But under -- with due respect, 12 under Florida law, they don't. And the -13 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, isn't the question 14 here that the reason they don't under Florida law is in 15 a situation where the law isn't clear, we draw the 16 Florida law this way rather than that way, and that is a 17 reasonable common law decision because of the six points 18 that we've listed on the list? 19 MR.

That is, 9 here we have an organization representing several 10 landowners. Is there any indication about how these 11 beachfront owners in these communities -- what their 12 view is, that they are benefited, that they are harmed? 13 Is there any indication of that? 14 MR. MAKAR: Other than these Petitioners, 15 Justice Ginsburg, no one has complained about this and 16 said that -- and brought an action or -- or otherwise. 17 This is a very beneficial program. It's basically a 18 beachfront property protection act, so it's sort of 19 anomalous that anyone would complain. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the problem with the 21 argument that I'm having is that in the last colloquy 22 with Justice Breyer, we heard how reasonable this act 23 was. That's one thing. But you have taken the position 24 that it's your property and you can do with it what you 25 want anyway. Now, maybe in this case it won't make a

There's cases that say that -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So on behalf of the 3 State, you concede if any of this list -- these -- the 4 list of good things that the land owner gets, if the 5 legislature next year takes them away, that would be a 6 taking? 7 MR. MAKAR: Sure, if they took away the -8 the swath of littoral rights or a substantial portion, 9 that would be highly problematic and likely be a taking. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that either 11 all of the time or some of the time a public beach 12 would -- that intervenes between the upland and the 13 water would be a substantial impairment of the upland 14 owner's rights? 15 MR. MAKAR: No, no, no. The -- the State 16 owns the beach, and let me make this analogy. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that's exactly my 18 point. You say that the State owns the beach, and it's 19 okay because there's a protection against unreasonable 20 use. And I'm asking whether or not a State beach with, 21 what do you call them, port-a-johns and hot dog stands 22 and so forth, isn't a substantial impairment of the 23 upland owner's use? And you say, well, the State owns 24 it -25 MR. MAKAR: Well --

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that takes away from 2 your earlier argument that we don't need to worry 3 because there can be no interference with substantial 4 enjoyment. And it seems to me that Justice Alito's 5 question has still not been answered in your argument. 6 MR. MAKAR: Well, I believe the answer is 7 that this is a facial challenge. There could be an 8 as-applied challenge. Keep in mind, the association 9 here owns no property. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want you to talk to me 11 about what the constitutional law ought to be in this 12 case as a general matter. We'll figure out facial and 13 -- and as-applied later. I still see that your argument 14 leaves open this question in my mind raised by the 15 concerns that Justice Alito has expressed. 16 MR. MAKAR: Well -- and the Florida Supreme 17 Court was very careful in narrowing its decision and 18 saying that the actual property owners may pursue, if 19 they feel -- beyond this opinion, they may pursue an 20 as-applied claim, where they -- this has no takings 21 record before this Court whatsoever, and that would have 22 to be developed, keeping in mind that much ­23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But when they do, they're 24 going to be met by you when you're in the trial court 25 and you say the State owns the property.

This is an analogy 4 to say this was a road where -- if I might -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can complete 6 your thought. 7 MR. MAKAR: Sure. That if this were a road 8 and the traffic -- there's a country road and there's 9 very little traffic, and over the years the traffic 10 built up, that somehow the owner of the property along 11 that road would have a cause of action. It's just not 12 the case. 13 Thank you very much. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 15 Mr. Kneedler. 16 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 17 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 18 AS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 19 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 20 please the Court: 21 From the outset, this case has been a 22 challenge to the actions of the Florida legislature and 23 its executive branch in enacting and implementing the 24 Beach Restoration Act. 25 That is a conventional takings claim and
50 Alderson Reporting Company

1 that is the way I think it is most useful for this Court 2 to approach it. Rather than seizing on particular 3 statements in the opinion of the Florida Supreme Court 4 and regarding the Florida Supreme Court's judicial act 5 as itself a taking, it's best to focus on the Act 6 itself. 7 And with respect to the Act itself, what -8 what has happened here is the State has exercised, not 9 just sovereign regulatory rights; it has exercised 10 critical sovereign proprietary rights. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler, that's 12 a clever ploy. We're talking about judicial takings and 13 you say, don't look at what the court did; look at what 14 the legislature did. That changes the whole ball game. 15 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, but -- but, in 16 fairness, first of all, that's how this case originated, 17 was a challenge -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no choice. 19 If their argument is what the court did constituted the 20 taking, they couldn't have raised that earlier -21 MR. KNEEDLER: No. My -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and said, oh, we 23 think we know that the court is going to change things. 24 MR.

1 It is that what -- what is -- what is being objected to 2 here is a -- is a -- this was not a judicial 3 declaration, for example, that somebody who has littoral 4 property can walk up to the edge of the water and can't 5 touch it. There was no abstract declaration on littoral 6 rights. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Judicial -- judicial 8 taking if that were the case? 9 MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that would be more 10 like Hughes. I'm not sure that I would analyze it as a 11 judicial taking. I think another way -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no -13 MR. KNEEDLER: -- to come at this -14 and this may even be suggested in -- in Justice Scalia's 15 dissent in the Cannon Beach case -- is that the -- the 16 usual principle that where State law is interposed in a 17 way that would -- would defeat a Federal constitutional 18 right, a court can look to see whether there is a fair 19 and substantial basis for it. 20 That's not really a -- there's no need to 21 fashion a new judicial taking doctrine when you have -22 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not? Because -23 because what they said is: We have a right to touch the 24 water, and you've taken it. That's what they said this 25 Act does.

1 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, and -2 JUSTICE BREYER: The court said: You've 3 never had that right. And it's just like a person who 4 owns 40 acres in the middle of Vermont, and the State 5 wants to build a nuclear power plant, and they say, you 6 have to pay us. No, says the State. And the court of 7 the State upholds it on the ground there is an implicit 8 easement under Blackstone to take land for power plants 9 without paying for it; it's called the power plant 10 easement. Okay? 11 Now, in such a case, it would be the 12 judicial taking because their ground is not -- whatever 13 you normally have, but their ground is you never had 14 that property right in the first place. 15 Now, how -- if that ever were to happen -16 and that probably, perhaps, is not this case, but if 17 that ever were to happen, wouldn't there have to be a 18 remedy under the Constitution for it? 19 MR. KNEEDLER: And -- and maybe so, but -20 but, again, I think it -- it would be possible to -- to 21 review it under the general principle about whether a 22 State interpretation of State law that would defeat a 23 claim to Federal right would be without any fair or 24 substantial basis, without -- without saying that the 25 supreme court itself has committed an unconstitutional

1 act. It -- it could be looked at that way. 2 But if I -- but if I could turn to the -3 the operation of this statute, what -- what has happened 4 here is -- as this Court has recognized in numerous 5 cases, the authority of the State over its submerged 6 lands is a critical aspect of sovereignty. It is held 7 in trust for the public and for public uses, and what 8 has happened here is the State, with respect to its own 9 sovereign lands, has filled that land. That does not 10 change the ownership of the sovereign lands. 11 They remain sovereign lands, and the State 12 has done it for a critical public purpose, to protect -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Accretion -14 accretion, of course, would change. 15 MR. KNEEDLER: Accretion -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would take 17 submerged State land and give it to the landowner. 18 MR. KNEEDLER: Accretion would, but -- but 19 avulsion or rapid change would not. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a foot -- I'll 21 get back to what I raised earlier. A foot a year, if 22 the State does it and it's a foot a year, does the 23 property owner get the foot, or does the State get the 24 foot? 25 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I don't want to quibble,

1 but I think it depends. The -- the Florida Supreme 2 Court's decision in Sand Key was a situation where the 3 State had -- had erected a jetty or an offshore 4 structure that caused sand to accrete on the -- on the 5 property, and the Florida Supreme Court said that 6 belongs to the littoral property owner under the 7 doctrine of -- of accretion. 8 On the other hand, if the State came along 9 once a year, on one day, and added a foot, that would 10 not be gradual and imperceptible, but would be quite 11 perceptible because the State would have added a foot of 12 property. And even though it's a small avulsion, I 13 think it -- I think it would still count as an avulsion. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it makes a 15 difference whether it's done in a day or done in a 16 month? 17 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the difference 18 between accretion and avulsion is whether it's gradual 19 and imperceptible or whether it's -- whether it's 20 dramatic or -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What authority is there in 22 Florida law or in general law to say that the act of 23 an -- an artificial person is an accretion or avulsion, 24 instead of just an act of nature?

1 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the Florida Supreme 2 Court's decision in the -- in the Peppe case relied on 3 Martin v. Busch, which -- I agree with Justice Scalia, 4 it's very critical here, where there was State action in 5 draining the lake, which exposed the surface -- the -6 the formerly submerged land, and the Florida Supreme 7 Court said that land belongs to the State, it was action 8 by the State in a dramatic way. 9 And Florida -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but did they call 11 it an avulsion? 12 MR. KNEEDLER: They -- they did not there, 13 but in -- but in -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that -- so that 15 doesn't answer my question. 16 MR. KNEEDLER: No, but my point was, in 17 Peppe, where -- where there was actually an avulsion, 18 the court characterized what happened in Martin v. Busch 19 as an avulsive act. But you don't need to label 20 avulsion, because there's a separate doctrine that when 21 the State fills its own land, it remains its own land. 22 And I'd like to point out -- this is not 23 a unique doctrine -24 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I just ask you this, 25 Mr. Kneedler, before your time expires, what --

1 I agree, Martin v. Busch seems to be the case that's 2 most -- provides the greatest support for what the 3 Florida Supreme Court did here. But what do we do about 4 the fact that the Florida Supreme Court didn't rely on it? 5 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think it is 6 surprising, although the Florida Supreme Court did 7 discuss avulsion, but if -- if I could just make one 8 point. This is not a -- a unique notion in Florida law. 9 This Court's decision in 10 Hughes v. Washington, which dealt with accretion, 11 responded to the -- to the point that was -- that was 12 made there and said, well, the -- the littoral property 13 right is vulnerable anyway because the owner of the 14 adjacent submerged lands can always take action on his 15 own lands that could affect what the upland property 16 owner did. 17 And this -- and this Court said, yes, that's 18 right, but we're talking, here, about natural causes. 19 And in -- in Hughes, the Court cited two cases, one in 20 Washington State, for example, where the -- where there 21 was an absolute right to fill the submerged lands even 22 if that completely cut off access. 23 It also pointed out another case, from New 24 Jersey, where -- where the -- a case of this -- from 25 this Court, where the Court said, you have a right to

1 accretion as long as nobody's filled the land 2 in between. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what is 4 your -5 MR. KNEEDLER: But once the land -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What -7 what is your view on the hypothetical I posed to your -8 to your friend? The legislature moves it to the 9 vegetation line. The State supreme court says that's a 10 taking. Somebody runs for election to the State supreme 11 court, saying, I'm going to change that. He's elected. 12 He changes the law. 13 Is that a judicial taking? 14 MR. KNEEDLER: Again, I think I would 15 analyze it under the fair and substantial basis. But, 16 yes, if there -- if there is no justification in 17 background law, if it's basically pretextual in the 18 same way that -- that any -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't -20 it's not pretextual. 21 MR.

1 Court has used in the due process is whether it's 2 unforeseen and indefensible. 3 I mean, if -- if there's just -- if there's 4 just -- if it's just ipse dixit. But there -- but 5 there -- but that's by no means true here. And it's 6 important that Martin v. Busch was cited in the two -7 and distinguished in the two principal cases on which 8 the Petitioner relies here. 9 In Sand Key, the court distinguished Martin 10 v. Busch on the ground that in Sand Key it was an 11 accretion, but -- and it distinguished Martin v. Busch 12 on the -- on the ground that there it was a -- it was a 13 sudden, dramatic action by the State, and the -- and the 14 same thing was also true in the Florida National case, 15 where the -- the court again distinguished -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -17 MR. KNEEDLER: -- Martin v. Busch on that 18 ground. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you have 20 answered Justice Scalia's question that there's a 21 common -- a generally understood common law right, 22 littoral right, to contact with the water? Would you 23 say there is not? 24 MR. KNEEDLER: I would -- I would say 25 there -- I would say it's tied up with the right of

1 access, as long as the littoral property owner remains 2 adjacent to the water. 3 But what you have here is a neighboring 4 property owner, the sovereign, exercising critical 5 sovereign rights over its property, which has its own 6 property interests, and if under Florida law the -- the 7 State is permitted to put sand on the beach -- this is 8 -- this is not filling for an amusement park. This is 9 adding something that is very germane to the maintenance 10 of the beach, for critical public purposes, the very 11 reasons -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It could be -- it 13 could be adding an amusement park, though, under your 14 theory, right? 15 MR. KNEEDLER: No, it -- I don't think 16 there's any universal theory of this. As I -- as I said 17 in -- in the Port of Seattle case -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the State's 19 property. 20 MR.

And in -25 that may be true in the Port of Seattle case discussed

1 in Hughes, where the State had the -- you're balancing 2 the rights of adjacent property owners, just like -3 just like 4 nuisance or other principles do. In Washington State, 5 apparently, you could completely fill the submerged land 6 and the upland owner had no rights. 7 In Florida -- Florida is actually more 8 protective than that. It has limited rights. You have 9 a -- you maintain a right of view, a right against 10 unreasonable interference. So there's no one 11 constitutionally based rule. It's a question of Florida 12 property law. And the background principles of Florida 13 property law under Martin v. Busch and the fact that the 14 State owns the adjacent land, I think, not only is there 15 -- there is more than a fair and substantial basis here. 16 There is a -- it's very solidly grounded in State law. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's see if there 18 are any further questions. 19 (No response.) 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 21 Mr. Safriet, 4 minutes. 22 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF D. KENT SAFRIET 23 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 24 MR. SAFRIET: Thank you, Your Honor. 25 First, Martin v. Busch does not stand for
61 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the principles that the Respondents suggest they do. 2 The court in Sand Key said, and in -- and in 3 distinguishing the Martin v. Busch case, and I quote, 4 "Our subsequent decisions show there was no intent to 5 change common law principles regarding the right to 6 accretion and relictions in Martin v. Busch." 7 And even if it did stand for that principle, 8 the Martin v. Busch case didn't discuss whether the 9 landowner was entitled to compensation for the severance 10 of their waterfront property as a result of the lowering 11 of the water. 12 What also must be noted here is the State 13 is changing the deeds. They're changing the legal 14 description and the deeds of the Petitioner's members. 15 These Petitioner's members own to the mean high-water 16 line. They have a right, not only under Florida common 17 law to own to the mean high-water line; under their 18 deeds, that's what they purchased. And there has been a 19 lot of discussion and, I think, maybe some confusion 20 about this right to contact the water. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: They wouldn't own to the 22 mean high-water mark if there were an avulsion, if -23 right? If -24 MR. SAFRIET: No, Your Honor. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: If by nature, this 60-foot
62 Alderson Reporting Company

1 beach had been put in, then their deed would be 2 changed, wouldn't it? 3 MR. SAFRIET: Temporarily, Your Honor, 4 because under the doctrine of reclamation, they can 5 reclaim the boundary line that they lost, just as if in 6 a case where the hurricane washes sand away, the 7 landowner, under common law, the doctrine of 8 reclamation, can bring in sand where the water is to 9 reconnect to that mean high-water line that would be 10 underwater following a hurricane. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, how does that work? I 12 mean, I have a beachfront property; I wake up one 13 morning and there's a little half-mile island attached 14 to half of it, and there we are. Mean high-water mark 15 is half a mile away. You say I can reclaim that under 16 Florida law? What's that mean? 17 MR. SAFRIET: Yes, Florida law allows, under 18 the doctrine of reclamation, which is what the Florida 19 Supreme Court relied on -20 JUSTICE BREYER: Which is -- how does it 21 work? 22 MR. SAFRIET: You'd have to remove the sand. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: You shovel away the sand. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, no. This is -- you 25 can't. You can't.

SAFRIET: I'm not sure the common law 9 envisioned rock coming up to -10 JUSTICE BREYER: It can happen. Okay. So 11 my point is, I think, which is the same, I think, as 12 Justice Scalia, that he -- that the upland owner no 13 longer, under the law of Florida, has a way of getting 14 his land out to the mean high-water mark. Am I right or 15 wrong? 16 MR. SAFRIET: I think that's wrong, Your 17 Honor. Under the doctrine of reclamation -18 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Because? 19 MR. SAFRIET: Under the doctrine of 20 reclamation, they can reclaim the boundary line. If 21 that's by depositing new sand where the water is to 22 reach the mean high-water line, where it was prior to 23 the hurricane. They can do that. 24 Conversely, if sand is washed up as a result 25 of a hurricane, they can remove the sand to bring the
64 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 water line back to them. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: They can go on the State 3 land to do that? Because that sand is sitting on State 4 land. 5 MR. SAFRIET: That wouldn't be State -- they 6 can -- the common law allows them to reclaim what 7 they're lost -- what they lost, Your Honor. And the 8 Florida Supreme Court tries to rely on this doctrine of 9 reclamation in this case. It asserts that the State is 10 only doing what it was allowed under common law, 11 reclaiming the land that it lost. 12 But in this case, the Florida Supreme Court 13 -- or the State of Florida didn't ever possess any dry 14 sand land, so they can't reclaim any dry sand land. The 15 only thing they have ever owned was the foreshore and 16 the sovereign submerged lands. So that's the only thing 17 they can reclaim. 18 I think there was another question about the 19 support for this case. There is more than five 20 landowners that don't support this case. In the lower 21 courts, there was another group, Save Our Beaches, that 22 had, I believe, roughly 150 members that opposed this 23 project as well in the City of Destin. 24 In this case, we're also dealing with a 25 physical taking.

What rights were physically possessed 6 by the Respondent's members -- the Petitioner's members 7 in this case are now possessed by the State. It's a 8 wholesale transfer of these rights, along with the 9 transfer of the deed -- or the description of the deed. 10 We're not asking this -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand why 12 isn't it -- it is equally an addition to the private 13 property owners' rights when they had a narrow beach and 14 now they're claiming that -- that it's all theirs, the 15 full 75 feet. 16 MR.
