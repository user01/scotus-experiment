    "speech": "We'll hear argument now in No. 02-819, Andrew J. Kontrick v. Robert A. Ryan. Mr. Poor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents a single question: Can the deadline for objecting to a bankruptcy discharge be altered by equitable exceptions? To answer that question, we start with the language of the rules. Bankruptcy Rule 4004 states that an objection to discharge must be filed no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors. This rule also allows for an extension of the time, but only by motion and only if that motion is filed, quote, before the time expires."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Poor, may I suggest that the question you have raised is not the one that I understood this case to involve. It's not whether the provision allows for equitable exceptions, it's whether you forfeited that claim, the claim that it does not - whether you forfeited it by letting the thing go past your answer. You didn't raise it in your answer. You let the case go off on summary judgment on the merits and remained silent until after there was an adverse judgment against you. So at least in my thinking, the forfeiture question, whether you forfeited, the argument that you would now like us to treat as the question presented, that is the threshold question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "And I - and I would agree with Your Honor that the question of waiver, or sometimes referred to as forfeiture, is - is part of - that is the question that's before your Court, whether that - the fact that we had not raised it until some later date is something that can be waived or forfeited."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, Mr. Poor -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I - I would agree with Justice Ginsburg that that's the way that the question reads on the petition for writ of certiorari. It's helpful that you did set forth, that the parties did set forth in the joint appendix the chronology here. I take it that the first time your client raised the late filing issue was June 23, 2000, or am I wrong about that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor. We raised it in March of 2000 in a motion to reconsider, but we also have maintained -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Oh, that was in the motion to reconsider?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Correct, but I would hasten to add that we have steadfastly maintained that we raised it in opposition to the motion for summary judgment in that we specifically said that the family account claim was not in the original complaint, and that to be timely, a claim had to be in that - that original complaint."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But in that very pleading you asked the court to strike a number of things in the complaint, and yet you did not ask to strike the family account claim."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, we have maintained that we did and in the context of this -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you didn't - did you expressly say that you wanted those certain allegations struck?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Well, we did as best we could at the time because this was part of a -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Did you - did you say, court, strike these allegations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, the answer is yes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Yes, we believe we - we did, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And you did not say, strike with respect to this allegation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Not specifically as to that, and that's - and that's what the - what the bankruptcy court found. However, at the time this was part of a mass of other allegations, and we felt that we had raised it sufficiently by -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What was your reason for distinguishing the two, for saying strike others, but as to this one all that you did was mention that it wasn't in the original complaint?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Well, we felt that that was - at the - in the opposition we raised the 4004 untimeliness issue. There were just a number of others that were not even in the - any complaint."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, if we're going to get into all of that, then they would say there's a relation back and none of those issues are really before. We took the issue on the pure question of whether or not, assuming that you were late in objecting that that - that that's a bar."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor, and I -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Poor, there are cases with which I'm sure you're familiar where a statute of limitations has been held to be deemed waived, even though there's nothing in the statute itself talking about waiver."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And this is much like that, is it not? There's a provision in the rules for a deadline for making a claim, but perhaps as in a statute of limitations case, it's not an extension of time to find a waiver. It's - it's a different concept, and maybe should be viewed much like a waiver of a statute of limitations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Well, in this case, Your Honor, this deadline is very much unlike a classic statute of limitations where you have a, say, a 2-year statute. This is different because here the language of the 60 days is modified or altered by Bankruptcy Rule 4 - 9006(b). The rulemakers didn't stop with the 60-day deadline. They stated that this rule will be incorporated into a special subgroup of other rules that may only be extended, quote, to the extent and under the conditions stated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But what's your answer to the argument That'sthat a waiver is not an extension, it's a waiver? a different kettle of fish."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Well, it - any - any attempt to excuse a late filing, whether it is waiver, equitable estoppel, and it could be waiver in the sense of it's an implied waiver where a debtor, by inaction, does not raise it, or it could be a situation where there's a stipulation by the debtor to - with the creditor and says, after the deadline the creditor goes to the debtor and says, I want you to stipulate to a late time period. In the language here, if you take the plain language of 4004 and 9006(b), that plain language simply does not allow for any type of equitable exceptions, whether they're deemed to be waiver or forfeiture or if -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you could make the same argument for an ordinary statute of limitations that doesn't talk about waiver or equitable alteration."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "You - and that's correct, Your Honor, for an ordinary statute of limitations. This one is different for this reason, that the presumption here is that when the drafters adopted 9006, what they did was they patterned it after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b), almost - almost virtually identically, and the language of 6(b), on which 9006(b) is patterned, has had a long history of being - had an established meaning as setting jurisdictional deadlines and - for its own subgroup of rules, and those rules, as this Court held in the Robinson case, we must presume that rules that are based on that 6(b) rule are presumed to be - to have the same meaning, that is, in the words of the Robinson case, as mandatory and jurisdictional."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, do you think that Rule 4004(a) limits the Court's subject matter jurisdiction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Not in the least, Your Honor, and I think that's a very important distinction in this case, because I think that's where the court below got off the trail in focusing on the concept of subject matter jurisdiction. This case does not deal with subject matter jurisdiction. That's the idea that - whether the court has the competency. We're not saying that the, for instance, the Circuit Court of Cook County was the proper court to hear this objection. In this case we're talking about an entirely different concept, and that is jurisdiction used in the sense that a court may not extend a deadline beyond the plain meaning of the rule with any type of equitable exception, whether it's called -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why do you pin the word jurisdiction on it at all when rules, whether bankruptcy rules or creditor rules, cannot alter or affect the Court's jurisdiction? That's what both rules' enabling acts say, so whatever it is, it - if it is jurisdiction, then it violates - the rule violates the statute. The rule isn't passed by Congress."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "I - and I - I, Your Honor, and as I recall in Your Honor's concurrence in the Carlisle case, you pointed out that to use the term subject matter jurisdiction for something like this, for a time prescription, is - is anomalous, where in - in this case if we're not - we're not dealing with subject matter jurisdiction, we're talking about jurisdiction as a shorthand for a time -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You're talking about a rigid time limit, a time limit that cannot be extended for good cause."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Exactly, and I - I know there are a number of courts that decline to even use the term jurisdiction, because they think that that's probably not the best term to use. It's used by many courts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Could you - could you have, according to your analysis of what this animal is, here you made your motion to reconsider after the summary judgment motion was granted, but before judgment was entered -"

    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "- final judgment was entered. Suppose final judgment had been entered. Could you then come into the court and say, sorry, court, I forgot to tell you that you couldn't enter any judgment here because an unalterable time bar had passed?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "I think, so long as it's within the same proceeding, Your Honor, you could, and that's - that was the holding in the Kirsch case, which the Seventh -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How about initially on appeal? Suppose you - you suffered the adverse judgment in the bankruptcy court and then you want to raise that, after all, the complaint was untimely, on appeal for the first time?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "I think that that would probably be a rare instance, but I think that in - if it is jurisdictional or unalterable, then so long as it's within the same proceeding that's just - that is part of what a jurisdictional rule is."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Do you have any authority with respect to this kind of rule, a rigid time limit, that it's okay to untimely bring that to the court's attention? I mean, all the precedent that your brief cites are cases where the party who opposes the time extension timely brings up that the complaint was untimely."

    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "Yes, and - and even more extreme, a more extreme example, if I would invite the Court's attention to the Dollar case, where after the time limit had passed, the creditor went to the debtor and says - said I want you to extend the time limit, and for whatever reason, the debtor said, okay, I'll agree to that, and then they brought that to the bankruptcy court for approval and the bankruptcy court said, no, this is a jurisdictional time limit, you can't have a side deal with a creditor -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That was a case where the court made an - an initial ruling without having expended any time in adjudicating the case. Here, you present the situation where the court grants a motion for summary judgment and then the debtor says, sorry, court, you never should have adjudicated this. We didn't tell you, but now you have to erase all - everything that you did."

The Kirsch case is one case where it - actually after trial, in Kirsch, the court found that since the rule - and I - it was not alterable under the plain meaning of the twin here, this 4004, 4007, that that could not be altered, even after a trial, and as I recall, the Poskanzer case is yet another one of those where -"

That's - that's just not the way we do things, and that's why we do have this terminology jurisdictional. There is something special about that, but the mere fact that something is unalterable certainly doesn't allow you to raise it whenever you like."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, no, no. That was the point of - of my question. It is not a synonym for - for the term jurisdictional that it can't be altered. There are a lot of things that - that can't be altered which you're not allowed to raise late."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "But if - if the rule itself, for instance, does not allow a - a debtor and a creditor to extend this time line themselves, then it would be, I submit, anomalous to allow the debtor to do, by inaction, what the Court could never do on its own or - or permit a rule that says that -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that - that's like saying you cannot let the defendant change the law by merely failing to raise a legal objection that was fully available. He's not changing the law, he's just forfeited the - that - the benefit of that provision of law."

I mean, I'm not saying there aren't any, I haven't faced this before, but I would have thought it comes up million - you know, quite a lot of times where people forget to - or they don't care or whatever it is, and they raise something very late.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "FIGLIULO",
    "speech": "But I think the court - the reason in the court, as I understood it, was that they could not agree to do that because extensions and enlargement of time is governed by the rule and that it wasn't permitted by the rule. But in this case I think we have a classic situation where we have a limitations period that's the - it should have been raised in the answer. It was not raised in the answer. It wasn't raised until after the court granted summary judgment. That's a classic case of an implied waiver of a limitations defense and the court recognized that at the bankruptcy level, it's been recognized that way at the district court level, it's been recognized that way by the Seventh Circuit, and it's a, I think, 100 percent right. It's also directly in accord with the background principles of waiver that apply to a civil-type action."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would you agree - do you agree with the Government that if the statute in question, not the bankruptcy rule, but at 157(b)(2)(J), if that required timely objection as some other statutes in the bankruptcy realm do, then you would lose, if the statute rather than the rule required timely objection?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FIGLIULO",
    "speech": "I think if the statute provided - if Section 157 provided timely, like it does for abstention, I think that would make the rules more of an exercise of the code and perhaps a stronger basis for arguing the mandatory strictness of the rules. I do not think it would make it jurisdictional."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, many - many statute of limitations are, of course, enacted by the legislature rather than by rule, and nonetheless you have tolling there, do you not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FIGLIULO",
    "speech": "Exactly, Your Honor. In fact, traditionally, and as this Court has recognized from time to time, that statute of limitations, which are phrased in mandatory terms, are silent with respect to whether certain exceptions or defenses traditionally apply, but regularly apply those, and that would apply particularly here where the bankruptcy court is a court of equity, and waiver is one of those principles."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In the typical case there's not a whole bunch of people who are hanging on the resolution of this issue. I mean, what's involved here is, I mean, it - it says no later than 60 days after the first date set for meeting of creditors. The problem is you have a whole bunch of people who don't know what their rights are going to be until this matter is settled and it - it seems to me that it's - it's quite reasonable to insist upon compliance with that time limit no matter what, because there are other people's interests involved."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FIGLIULO",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't quarrel with the fact that the time limit is important and it serves a valid purpose, but when we look at waiver - and we're not talking about exceptions to extend time here, we're looking at the defendant's obligation to - to assert a timely objection to the untimeliness of the complaint. That promotes finality because that brings the issue to a head and it - it conserves judicial resources - it does everything waivers should do."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, would you - would you agree that a district court could override that determination of the parties, say I'm not going to allow the late filing? Other - the rights of other persons are involved and the district court in the hypothetical case says, I know this is not jurisdictional but it is within my control."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FIGLIULO",
    "speech": "I think the - the bankruptcy court level, that probably would be within the court's discretion, but I - my view is that it's - it's like a tolling agreement and it should be permitted, because a statute of limitations or a limitations period is a personal defense. Now, if there's extraordinary circumstances where the court refuses to enforce the agreement, I can't conceive of why that would be permitted."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Isn't the difference between the statute of limitations and the case we've got here that in the statute of limitations case we make the assumption that the only two interested parties are the plaintiff and the defendant, and if they don't care, why should anybody else? In this case, however, there are other interested parties and there is a pretty well-articulated governmental interest in wrapping this up quickly. So it seems to me that in - in the bankruptcy case, the court would have every reason, if it was brought to its attention, e.g., in the form of a stipulation, to say, no, I'm going to keep the ball rolling fast. Isn't that the distinction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FIGLIULO",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I think that's a sound distinction. I - I happen to believe that dischargeability is a complaint for objecting to dischargeability primarily affects the objecting party and the debtor, and while there may be other rights of people implicated, it's still very personal with respect to the debtor and the creditor who's making the objection to discharge. And that would also be even more true with respect to dischargeability of particular debts as in 4007. So I understand the policy consideration, there is a distinction there. I - I've probably bitten off more than I should have with respect to whether that can be agreed on or not -"

    "speech": "- that this is simply - the question is essentially, where does one draw the line? And one might say, even if the objection to the timeliness isn't raised in the initial answer, it could be raised in an amendment to the answer. It could even be raised in opposition to the summary judgment motion. But there comes a point where it's too late to make that objection, and that's essentially the question for us: Where do you draw the line when it's too late? Now, it could be on appeal, it could be after adjudication on the merits in the trial court. So on that question of where do we draw the line about raising this objection, what is your position?"

  {
    "speaker": "FIGLIULO",

It can be as early as the failure to raise it in the answer, but I do recognize the liberal rules of amendment to answers and that may be permitted it by the court in its discretion, so it's not a bright line before judgment, it's not bright line where you draw the line, in my judgement, but in - and certainly once the court rules, it's too late."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "FIGLIULO",
    "speech": "No, that - it's pretty set, Your Honor. That - it can happen, but that's unusual. The date is - the set - there's notice that goes out and it's a relatively fixed point in time from which these deadlines then are calculated."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "FIGLIULO",
    "speech": "Your Honor, that was argued before the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court did not discuss it at all in its opinion. It was argued before the district court. It wasn't discussed by the district court at all. My client represented himself pro se before the Seventh Circuit. It was not raised in the briefs on appeal, so with respect to whether that's an alternative grounds for affirmance, that's been waived, somewhat ironically, but I think it has been."

    "speaker": "FIGLIULO",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I wasn't involved at that time. My - my understanding is that there was a lot of stuff going back and forth and there was a sanction of attorneys' fees of $1,000 or $1,500 assessed. That's - that's what my recollection is."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is your view on this as a bankruptcy attorney thinking, I mean, I don't see that it affects your client one way or the other, but, I mean, obviously the Solicitor General in this case has suggested an affirmance on the very narrow ground that maybe they're quite right about what the rule should be interpreted, but still they lost the chance to raise the rule because they didn't raise it. All right, that's a very narrow ground. On the other hand, the split in the circuits is more on the broader question of how absolute are these rules in - how absolute are the deadlines in this particular rule, and that's a broader question, which is also a possible ground for affirmance, so either way your client would win. But, as a bankruptcy lawyer, what's your opinion?"

I think it's different. I think tolling and excusable neglect overlap some cases, and to the extent it's excusable neglect, it's not grounds for extension, but a - a true tolling -"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What would be a cause for tolling if excusable neglect is out of it? It seems to me that this rule is saying there are no exceptions, period, and to say that even if you can show good cause you don't get it extended, but there's some other equitable."

  {
    "speaker": "FIGLIULO",
    "speech": "I - it's a relatively - I think equitable tolling, in the context of this rule, is relatively narrow exception, it's not - it's little broader than the unique circumstances that relate to if a party's misled by a rule of court.

Our position is waiver. I think we're classically correct. It's approached under the adversary proceeding rules, which engage all the rules of civil procedure, which we all know about, it's a familiar arena, and it should apply as - as it has been applied by the lower courts, and I ask that this Court affirm it.

The rules-based answer is alluded to by respondent, which is the Rule 4004(d) expressly incorporates through Part 7 of the bankruptcy code the pleading requirements of 8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Now, that means that the - the debtor has an obligation to plead his affirmative defenses at the answer or they would be treated as waived. This was an affirmative defense, and so just by applying the rules it was subject to waiver when it was not raised in the answer. We think the court was right in exercising its discretion to determine that when it's not raised until after the trial, or in this case after summary judgment was entered, it's plainly too late, and it was waived."

What was raised is the idea you can't waive it, and the reason that it was raised in that fashion is they said it's jurisdictional.

My point is that a court could allow the late-raised defense that it - that the complaint was untimely, up to some point it would have discretion to do that, but it exercised its discretion not to allow that late-raised objection, late-raised defense in this case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, the rule on amendment, which the pleading rules, the Federal rules would apply, says that it should be - if after you miss the time limit in which you are allowed to amend as a matter of right, then you may amend - and with the court's permission, and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires."
  },

    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "That's the discretionary standard and I don't - I will be frank, I do not know if there's a case that says that discretion stops at this point. That's not before the Court. It would just be odd for the Court to exercise such discretion after it had already determined that the judgment should be awarded to one of the parties. That's all I was trying to say."

  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "We did not make that argument. The respondent made the argument and the court of appeals made the point. That provision is quoted in footnote 3 of respondent's brief. It's a very short provision. It just says that the - the procedures of Part 7 will have governed, and then Rule 7008 says that incorporates Rule 8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Now, we have not addressed the question of whether equitable exceptions would be available under this rule, but we do think that the Court's decision in the Santos case provides a sensible explanation of how to address that question. In Santos, the Court made the point that the rules appear to say you cannot extend by excusable neglect, but that doesn't preclude equitable estoppel, because estoppel is based on the misconduct of the debtor, excusable neglect is the neglect of the creditor. So not allowing an extension for neglect doesn't preclude allowing an extension for estoppel."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You see, that - that's the argument the other way. The argument the other way is you don't really need to import these defenses into the rule itself because there are other ways in the bankruptcy law that an unfair kind of conduct that can be dealt with."

    "speaker": "JONES",

Can you just give me one word about whether my belief about the Rule 6 - it refers to a new trial motion in a civil case, motion to amend the opinion, JNOV, all those time limits it says are absolute. Now, I take it it's never been held or isn't at least normally held that a lawyer can sit there, notice that the time limits weren't complied with, wait to see if he wins, and then if he loses, bring it up for the first time on appeal. Am I right about that? Because they're saying, no, I'm not right about it."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "I'm not familiar with a case of that type, but there - I can imagine that there's a case out there that says something along the following, that this Court's jurisdiction, by statute, is based on the requirement, for example, that there be a notice of appeal filed within 30 days."

  {
    "speaker": "POOR",
    "speech": "I'd like to return to the - the fundamental point is when these were adopted, 9006(b) was patterned after 6(b), and that identical language, as this Court instructed in the Robinson case, should be read to be mandatory and jurisdictional, that is, not waiveable. And if we look at a case like Santos, there's nothing in the language that allows Santos to pick and choose between - between saying equitable estoppel would - would not apply but waiver would apply. The only possible way you can get there in Santos is not through the text, not through the language, which Robinson has told us is mandatory and jurisdictional. The only way you can get there is through the - a policy argument that says, we think it's a good idea not to have equitable estoppel, but on the other hand, yeah, for policy reasons, we - we should allow waiver to apply. And if you allow waiver, whether it is waiver in the implied sense of inaction or waiver in the express sense of allowing a stipulation, in that case, you will have really taken what is in the text and these are no longer jurisdictional rules without exception. Rather, they have become rules that the parties themselves may change, and this deadline has never been like a statute of limitations. It has always been different. It allows the parties to, before there's any - before there's any adjudication, any deadline, to take discovery and move the deadline along. That's not like a typical statute of limitation, and the reason for that is the text. The text says it may only be extended to the extent and under the conditions stated, the exact language that was at issue in Carlisle and in Robinson, and we would submit that you have to read the same language in the same way, whether it's 9006(b), 6(b), Criminal Rule 45(b), they all are based on the same language."
