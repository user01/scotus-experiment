    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1367 is a constitutional and sensible response by Congress to the serious procedural problems that were facing the Federal courts prior to 1990. Those procedural problems arose due to State claims that were pending in the Federal courts at that time under this Court's, what was then called, pendent jurisdiction and is now called supplemental jurisdiction. The problem specifically was what happens to those State claims that are pending in Federal court when the expiration of the statute of limitations on those claims occurs. The courts were faced with a dilemma at that point, do they dismiss these claims and risk having them not be refiled in the State court or do they retain those -- the supplemental jurisdiction over those claims and decide issues that might be better suited for the State courts when they don't -- when the Federal court no longer wants to exercise that jurisdiction."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "The problem with that solution, would be an agreement to waiver. The defendant is -- it's up to the defendant to agree to that waiver and to say that they will -- they will not bring up that statute of limitations defense in State court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Right, and if he doesn't waive, then -- then you proceed in Federal court because it's just not -- not a proper -- proper basis for dismissing it. What's -- what's the matter with that solution?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "In that -- in that situation, it might work. There might be supplemental jurisdiction and the plaintiffs will not lose their claims. However, that is just one court's potential solution. There were a number of solutions that were being attempted at the time with varying effectiveness. It didn't guarantee, across the board, that plaintiffs would be able to bring those State claims in Federal court and be assured that they would be -- that they wouldn't be forfeited if the statute of limitations ran out. One -- one possible solution to the problem doesn't make 1367 unconstitutional. 1367 was a -- was a general response to a general problem that was occurring below."

  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",

  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it wouldn't have been if you had filed a protective action.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "We -- we could have filed a protective action, but the -- that has -- I think there are two parts to that -- that answer. First, we could have filed a protective action, but there's no guarantees that the State would have stayed that action. It might have -- it might have forced litigation on that matter, creating res judicata and claims preclusion issues in the Federal court. It might have sought to dismiss it because of claims splitting. And the next part of the question is that the -- the Supreme Court of Minnesota said that this was a facially unconstitutional -- section 1367 --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But wouldn't it -- it wouldn't have occasion to say that -- as I understand it, when duplicative actions are brought, the second court, the one where you file second, generally although it's not compelled to do this, will say, okay, prior action finished."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "They -- they could do that, but the point is that it wasn't -- there was no guarantee that they will. They might also choose not to stay it and not to clog up their dockets and have -- have cases affecting their statistics."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You have -- you're using a lot of mights. Do you have any -- do we know how Minnesota State courts treat the prior action pending plea? Do they dismiss or do they keep it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "They -- if the claim is filed in Minnesota on -- they will not dismiss if it was clear that the Federal court would not have exercised jurisdiction over that Federal -- over that State claim. And in Minnesota, it was not clear at that time, and it's still not clear because the -- the university and the States have this constitutional defense which they can assert or not assert. It's at their discretion. In fact, some of the cases that we've cited show that Minnesota, the university, has litigated cases, on the merits in Federal court, State and Federal claims. So, the point there is that we didn't know that the court would not exercise jurisdiction over the State claims, and if we were to file with that knowledge in -- in State court, they could have dismissed on claims splitting or claim preclusion ground -- or claims splitting grounds because the Federal court might have exercised jurisdiction. It was not clear."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It seems to me the principle you're arguing for -- I'm just not sure what its -- what its boundaries are. The principle, as I take it, is when -- when the Federal Government creates a Federal cause of action, any State law that impedes -- and -- and allows that Federal action to be brought in Federal court, any State law that impedes the bringing of that action in Federal court can be repealed by the Federal Government. How does that apply, for example, to simple statutes of limitations? Let's -- let's assume you -- you have a Federal statute of -- of a year for certain -- for a certain transaction or occurrence. The State statute for the same transaction or occurrence and the State's cause of action is just 6 months. Now, would you argue that because of the difficulty of claims splitting and so forth, the Federal Government can prescribe by statute that the State cause of action shall be extended to 12 months?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "No, that's not what we are saying."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, why not? If you say no, then you acknowledge the principle that, you know, there are some problems that have no solution, and -- and the mere fact that you're making the Federal cause of action more difficult has nothing to do with whether there's Federal power to -- to solve that particular problem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "The -- the scenario that you just posed about the 6-month and the 1-year time limits -- you could still file that State claim in Federal court within 6 months. You have to comply with the -- the State cause -- the State statute of limitations. It's just in a forum that maybe the State will ultimately object to."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but the Federal Government wants to give you 12 months in its courts. That's -- that's the policy that it's decided. We want to give you 12 months, and here's a State which has a State cause of action. It is -- it is putting you to the choice. You either forego the -- the State cause of action or -- or you -- you file within 6 months. Doesn't that impede, to some extent, what the Federal Congress wanted to happen?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "I think in your -- in that hypothetical, it probably would impede, but that's not the situation that we have in front of us."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Oh, I understand it isn't, but -- but I -- but the principle you're arguing for, it seems to me, leads to that conclusion, that the Federal Government can -- can reconfigure State causes of action willy-nilly so that they don't impede the bringing of Federal causes of action in Federal court as Congress wishes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "What the -- what the statute does here, if it's applied to a State, is it tolls the time limit. It doesn't -- it doesn't change the time limit for the -- the statute of limitations. If we were to file this claim on the 50th day, 1367(d) wouldn't apply."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I -- I wonder about that. My understanding is -- correct me if I'm wrong, please -- that the Federal statute gives you an extra 30 days."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "It gives you the -- the tolling -- the tolling provision runs for 30 days after the time after the dismissal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, and so if you -- if -- if as in this case, I think you file on the last day or the next- to-the-last day in the Federal court, then you're given an extra 30 days. So, you do reconfigure the State statute, contrary to your suggestion. And -- and I have a significant problem with that. It might be that the tolling provision is necessary in order to make the Federal courts operate and exercise their jurisdiction in an efficient manner, but this statute goes beyond that and gives a longer statute of limitations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "Well, it gives a longer tolling --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It does reconfigure the statute of"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "I would respectfully disagree that it reconfigures the -- the statute of limitations because it's -- the statute -- the State statute has to be complied with in order for 1367 to -- to be triggered. It has to be filed within the appropriate time period. And -- and that meets the statute of limitations objectives that the State was seeking when it -- when it created that 45-day period. The fact that it's being tolled after it's been timely filed is not -- that's -- that's not a core interest that's protected by the State sovereign immunity. Tolling a statute that has been complied with, in this case filing within that 45 days --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it hasn't been complied with under State law. If -- if the State law acknowledged the filing in Federal court as -- as satisfying the statute of limitations, you wouldn't be here. The problem is the State law says you have to file the action in State court within the statute of limitations period, and we're not going to give you any grace period for a false start that you made in Federal court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "Well, the -- the State statute is silent on tolling. It's not a condition of -- of the State's waiver of that 45-day period and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But the State court here found that saying there wouldn't be any tolling, did it not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "That's what -- they found that there was no abuse of discretion, but that was -- that -- the State court's initial decision there was based on a -- an erroneous interpretation of Pennhurst II when --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but that presumably is up to the Minnesota courts to decide when the -- when the State statute is tolled."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "They have the discretion to decide that, but it's our position that the tolling provision of 1367(d) can also toll that time period because it's not abrogating the State's sovereign immunity. It's not --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but you know, you say it isn't tolling because it's -- it doesn't really go to the length of the statute of limitations, one. But it does, you know. If you say the -- if you want to say a statute of limitations is tolled for a year, obviously that extends the time that the State law would have allowed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "But it doesn't defeat the purpose of -- of the statute of limitations and -- and the need to file in a timely fashion with that State statute to begin with. And I think that's what the -- the State -- the -- if the State has a core interest in the statute of limitations, that's what it would be, is that claims are a -- in a jurisdiction to which the State ultimately objects is -- is another point."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That isn't self-evident. I mean, if what you're saying is true, every State would automatically allow tolling when suit is filed in a Federal court within the State statute period. If it were self-evidently true that the State policy is not at all offended by that, you wouldn't have a problem and you wouldn't be here because every State would say, well, it was filed in Federal court. That's good enough for us. But it isn't good enough for a lot of States. And -- and, you know, it's their policy we're talking about, and their policy is you must file in State court within the limitations period."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "Article III to control the lower Federal courts gives the -- the Government the power to create these -- these Federal practices and procedures, in this case, the -- the way to address combined Federal and State claims, as well as its -- its -- the powers to protect individuals from losing their due process rights to the Federal courts."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So, it's Article III you rely on."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It would just -- when Congress passed this, Congress I -- I assume was just thinking it was regulating the procedure in Federal courts, that it was exercising that power to implement Article III. And what you said about due process, I didn't see any sign of that in the history of 1367. But you're not suggesting that before 1367, people were denied due process because there wasn't a tolling provision."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "In some circumstances, they were because of the claims -- the combination of the claims splitting and claims preclusion laws in the State courts and States and the statute of limitations on those pendent claims if they were brought in Federal court could result in a denial of a forum for that State claim if -- if a Federal claim was also asserted."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but you're -- you're -- well, it does or it doesn't. But you -- you indicated earlier that the statute of limitations was not in any way extended because it was tolled by the filing. But it is extended by this additional 30 days. You basically have -- what was it? 45 -- the 45 plus 30. You have 75 days now, almost double."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "Well, I think that the tolling provision is different. I mean, it does give additional time, but it doesn't extend the time period that the State was open and exposed to liability. It doesn't extend that 45-day period. They were already notified of it. They -- they were put on notice. They had the -- they knew that they were going to be sued and it was brought in -- within that 45-day period. The fact that it was suspended during a time period where the State was in Federal court at its own -- its own discretion, it would be -- it would be harmful to the plaintiffs to have the State be able to use the delay in time that it's pending in Federal court to bar the claim from being brought after that in State court. if the only purpose of the statute of limitations were repose, being notified on time that you're subject to suit. But there are certain statutes that have been called so-called built-in statute of limitations where the limitation is considered part and parcel of the right itself usually when it's in the very same statute, and that seems to be the kind of limitation that we have here. We have a State that is giving up its sovereign immunity, but only on these terms. So, why isn't this a built-in statute of limitations? So, by necessity there would be harm when the State says it's the right -- we condition the right on you bringing suit within 45 days."

    "speaker": "BOLTER",
    "speech": "They didn't make, as a part of that condition, anything about tolling. That's -- that's I think the -- the first point, and -- and that's what this statute is doing, is tolling. It's not changing that -- that right, that built-in right that you talk about, to the 45-day period. That -- that still has to be complied with. But this is talking about tolling, which is a different -- it's a different animal here, but it doesn't extend that time limit, that -- that built-in time limit simply by tolling. It suspends it from running out but it doesn't extend it. I couldn't have filed that claim 75 days after it was sued. I had to file it within 45 days or else it would have been barred, and 1367 would not have attached."

There will always be some Federal power that justified the Federal cause of action which is the subject of this extension provision. Let's assume it's a Commerce Clause cause of action. Under the Commerce Clause, the Federal Government could have, if it wanted, eliminated the State cause of action entirely, couldn't -- couldn't it? It could have said, we -- we preempt any State action in this field, and the whole State cause of action would be washed away. If it can do that, why can't it do the lesser act of not washing away the State cause of action, but just saying, you know, if you bring suit in Federal court on this Commerce Clause cause of action, you get another 30 days or whatever, 45 days, whatever it is?"

So, the State common law claims could arise out of the same transaction and occurrence, depend on the same nucleus of facts, and yet not be just a State counterpart of the Federal statute.

I mean, that -- that is what supplemental jurisdiction is about in this situation. So, I don't think that that's -- that's appropriate to do that. And -- and it goes back to giving the State a choice of whether it wants to be there or not by exercising its constitutional defense of sovereign immunity.

The choice is its own.

The -- they filed in Federal court merely 48 hours before the statute of limitations would -- the 45- day rule would have expired even under their understanding, meaning that a filing in the wrong court suffices to be a filing in the correct court. So, there's nothing the university did to delay whatsoever. Moreover, we filed a dispositive motion at -- in a timely way, consistent with the normal course of litigation in this case. Most Federal trial courts prefer that dispositive motions not be filed seriatim. And we -- we noticed the motion, and there was a scheduling order, which plaintiff knew about, in the spring of 1997, and we filed the dispositive motion asserting our sovereign immunity in June of '97. And even if you would say that -- that somehow the petitioners here were not fully aware, as they should have been, that the university was asserting its sovereign immunity from the get-go, by June 3, they had a motion, a dispositive motion, and the filing in the State forum still exceeded the 45 days."

    "speech": "Yes, it is, Your Honor. But Pennhurst specifically suggests -- yes. Excuse me. Pennhurst explicitly says that the expedient of filing the claim in the State court will avoid any danger of this kind occurring. And -- and Pennhurst stands clearly for the proposition that a filing of the State claim, a protective claim, which petitioners' counsel here acknowledged would solve the problem, and filing the Federal claim in the Federal forum is a constitutionally appropriate expedient. Any contrary indication brings into question the -- the opinion of this Court in -- in Pennhurst by suggesting that filing concomitantly in the State and Federal forums is somehow a due process problem. Let me conclude with an -- a closing observation about the due process issue. Petitioners have not cited a single case, not a single case, holding that the State's handling of pendent claims, in the absence of section 1367, somehow violated due process. And equally important, Your Honors, petitioners do not seriously claim that 1367(d) is a valid exercise of Congress' power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to address any supposed due process problems. The record is simply bare. Moreover, due process cannot be the basis of any supposed abrogation here because the first element of abrogating the State's sovereign immunity, using section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, is an explicit statement of Congress. There is no such explicit statement of Congress here. In fact, the record is silent as to any due process case law, at least as cited or referred to by -- by petitioners. And most importantly, Your Honors, and in conclusion, whether there might conceivably be an unfairness in some hypothetical State situation, this question of unfairness does not trump the Alden principle, that Congress cannot, by an observation of unfairness falling short of a due process issue, force a State to submit to suit against itself in its own courts."

Ashcroft, Will against the Michigan Department of -- of State -- in those cases, this Court has applied clear statement principles even though they don't assume the answer to the constitutional question. And that, of course, is consistent with the way this Court approaches matter as a general matter and its preference to avoid constitutional questions.

You're -- you're purporting to forego reliance upon ambiguity and to say even assuming that the statute is clear, you should not interpret it to apply to the States.

    "speech": "And it could be just that --"

    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "It very well may be, as counsel for the University of Minnesota suggested, that States will have the good sense in those instances to waive their sovereign immunity defense. I mean, the same principles that are going to motivate the Federal Government to pass the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act are going to motivate State governments to waive their sovereign immunity defenses in those claims. Now, it seems to me that -- two points I'd like to make. First of all, it's worth focusing on the fact that even before 1367(d), the informal Federal court practices for dealing with potentially untimely State claims did not apply to nonconsenting States. Justice Scalia, you raised the -- the problem of conditioning a dismissal on a withdraw -- of statute of limitations defenses. But, of course, under Pennhurst II, a State has an absolute right to insist that the pendent claims against it be dismissed. So, in that context, the Federal court would not be able to condition the dismissal on a waiver of a statute of limitations defense, nor would it be able to retain jurisdiction over the claim. So, it stands to reason that 1367(d) should no more apply to cases against nonconsenting States than the Federal court practices it replaced. Lastly, I would emphasize that this interpretation of section 1367(d) does not place plaintiffs in an untenable position or in an unconstitutional bind. Plaintiffs, in cases where the State objects to Federal court jurisdiction as a blanket matter, have the same rights that they would have under Pennhurst II. They can file both claims in State court, the Federal and the State, which seems a complete answer to any due process objections, or they can file parallel proceedings. Even if the State makes a decision whether to consent on a case by cases, as Minnesota appears to do, the State -- the plaintiff can still attempt to get consent in the first instance, and if it's not, it can make a protective filing along the lines that Justice Ginsburg suggested. In the end, it seems that plaintiffs lack any case law to support their due process arguments. I think that respondent, in fairness, lacks any case law to support its -- its Article I legislative power argument. There's really no need for this Court to make any significant case law in order to decide this case if it simply applies the clear statement test we suggest in our brief. If there's no other questions, I'll submit."

It is -- their arguments -- the -- the university and the Solicitor General's arguments rely on the fact that they were a nonconsenting State throughout this whole procedure. And that's not an accurate characterization of what went on here. When they were sued in Federal court, they were not a nonconsenting State until 9 months later when they brought that motion to dismiss."

And none of those can be ruled upon by the court until they are affirmatively brought before them to rule on. They might have just decided not to do anything with it until the matter was tried on its merits, and they have done that in another case, the Eldeeb case, which they received summary judgment on the merits of both State and Federal claims."
