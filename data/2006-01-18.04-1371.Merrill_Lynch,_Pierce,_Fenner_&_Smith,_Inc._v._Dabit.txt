3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next

4 in number 04-1371, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith

5 versus Dabit.

6 Mr. Kasner.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY B. KASNER

8 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9 MR. KASNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11 In an effort to limit State-law securities

12 class-actions which undermine the market for nationally

13 traded securities, Congress enacted SLUSA, a statute of

14 broad preemption. SLUSA, which is reprinted at page 8(a)

15 of Petitioner's blue brief, preempts, subject to three

16 specific statutory extensions, all State-law-covered class

17 actions, quote, "by any private party who alleges

18 misrepresentations, omissions, or fraudulent behavior in

19 connection with the purchase or sale of a covered

20 security." The Second Circuit erred in implying an

21 exception, that nowhere appears in the statutory language,

22 and is wholly at odds with the purpose in the enactment of

23 the statute for holders claims, a type of claim in which a

24 plaintiff alleges, "I did not purchase" or "I did not

25 sell, but would have, had I known the allegedly false

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 information," a type of claim which this Court, in Blue

2 Chip Stamps, over 30 years ago, recognized as the most

3 vexatious and abusive type of securities class-action

4 claims.

5 The court below erred, for a number of different

6 reasons. First and foremost, it completely violated the

7 natural meaning of the statute. As I have mentioned, an

8 examination of SLUSA, beginning at page 8(a), reflects

9 that no covered class action may be maintained, quote, "by

10 any private party," a clause that this Court, time and

11 again, has interpreted as perhaps the broadest way of

12 phrasing "any and all private parties" making certain

13 types of allegations. Those allegations appear in (a) or

14 (b), focusing on the conduct of the defendant in

15 connection with the purchase or sale of a covered

16 security.

17 Now, Congress could have -- had it intended to

18 inject a purchaser/seller limitation, consistent with what

19 the court below concluded, Congress could have phrased

20 that language differently. As the Court is aware, in the

21 both the 1933 and 1934 acts, Congress has made express

22 causes of action, subject to an explicit purchase or

23 seller requirement. For example, section 11 of the '33

24 act affords a private right of action to purchasers of

25 securities in registered offerings. Section 12 affords a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 private right of action to persons from whom an offer or

2 sale of securities. Section 9(e) of the '34 act,

3 similarly, affords a purchase or seller requirement.

4 Significantly, SLUSA nowhere speaks in terms of

5 a purchase or sale. And it could have. For example,

6 Congress could have provided that no covered class action

7 by any private party alleging "his or her sale" of a

8 covered security is preempted. It could have said, "Any

9 private party alleging a misrepresentation or omission of

10 a material fact in connection with the plaintiff or that

11 party's purchase or sale." It did not.

12 The decision of the court below is also at odds

13 with this Court's teaching in United States versus

14 O'Hagan, which was decided 1 year before SLUSA was enacted

15 by Congress. In United States versus O'Hagan, this Court

16 concluded that the so-called "misappropriation theory"

17 stated a viable claim in a criminal case brought by the

18 United States Government. In responding to an argument by

19 the defendant that no one involved that had been defrauded

20 purchased or --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask you this

22 question about the plain language? If the word in

23 1(f)(1)(A) had not been "in connection with the purchase

24 of sale -- sale of security," had been "in connection with

25 his or her purchase or sale," then it would have been

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 covered, would it not?

2 MR. KASNER: Justice Stevens, if, by "his or

3 her," it's referencing "any private party," I would agree

4 with that. That would be a different case in --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, the question is whether we

6 should construe the word "the" to be the functional

7 equivalent of "his or her."

8 MR. KASNER: In essence, Justice Stevens --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that true?

10 MR. KASNER: -- that's correct. And I think

11 that that question has been answered by this Court, on a

12 number of different occasions. Again, in United States

13 versus O'Hagan, this Court concluded that the "in

14 connection with the purchase or sale of a security" does

15 not mean "in connection with the purchase or sale by

16 another party to the securities transaction," but, rather,

17 means "in connection with the purchase or sale by anyone."

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kasner, the -- does the

19 Securities and Exchange Commission have enforcement

20 authority in this -- in this area?

21 MR. KASNER: It does, Justice Scalia.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Have they issued any rules or

23 regulations on this -- on this point?

24 MR. KASNER: The point being, Your Honor,

25 whether --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: On the point that you're

2 arguing, whether the critical language means the person's

3 own sale, or not --

4 MR. KASNER: Yes, Your Honor. In adjudicatory

5 proceedings referenced in our brief, the SEC has

6 unanimously, and uniformly, taken the position that it

7 does not. In briefs to this Court in criminal

8 prosecutions, in civil prosecutions, the Government has

9 consistently taken the position, as it has in this case,

10 as an amicus, and as it did in the court below.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it your position that we owe

12 deference to the interpretation of the SEC?

13 MR. KASNER: That is our position, Your Honor.

14 We do take the position that this Court should defer to

15 the views of the SEC on that issue. What that deference

16 is, should it be Chevron or Skidmore, is not a question

17 Your Honor has asked. I'm happy to say that we believe,

18 vis-a-vis 10(b)(5) --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it's just Skidmore,

20 forget about it.

21 [Laughter.]

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's --

23 MR. KASNER: Well, Your Honor, I actually

24 carefully studied yesterday's opinion, where this Court

25 discussed the Skidmore deference, and, either way, we

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 think that this is -- the statute is so clear that,

2 deference or none, there really is no other way to read

3 the language of the statute.

4 As I say, this Court, in United States versus

5 O'Hagan, concluded squarely that this language does not

6 mean the purchase or sale of the plaintiff's securities.

7 Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion, joined in by

8 Justice Stevens, in the Holmes case makes that same point.

9 Significantly, Your Honors, the "in connection with"

10 language, as a statutory matter, has consistently been

11 construed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and

12 by this Court, as one of incredible breadth. Most

13 recently, in United States versus Zandford, this Court

14 concluded that the "in connection with the purchase or

15 sale" language means anything that coincides with a

16 securities transaction. And what is significant in this

17 case -- it is conceded by the Respondent at page 8 of his

18 brief -- that the conduct alleged by the plaintiff below

19 is in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.

20 There really can be no other conclusion. At myriad

21 paragraphs in the pleadings, appearing, among others, at

22 joint appendix 53, paragraph 4; joint appendix 53(a),

23 paragraph 5; joint appendix 59 to 60 --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kasner, may I just

25 interrupt those references to ask you -- one could agree

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that, for SEC-enforcement purposes, for prosecutorial

2 purposes, the "in connection with" is as broad as you

3 suggest. But for purposes of private actions, it isn't

4 that broad; it is limited, as this Court said in Blue Chip

5 Stamps. It is possible for the same words, even in the

6 same statute, in difference contexts, to mean different

7 things.

8 MR. KASNER: Justice Ginsburg, I believe that

9 this Court has answered Your Honor's question in the Blue

10 Chip Stamp case, where it specifically rejected that sort

11 of an approach, and the one that was consistent with the

12 court below. What the Court, in Blue Chip Stamp -- which,

13 of course, was a civil case involving an alleged holder's

14 claim was a class action -- what this Court said, for

15 purposes of a civil proceeding, is, "purchase or seller

16 requirement nowhere appears in the statutory language."

17 The statute clearly says "in connection with the purchase

18 or sale of securities." But, as a statutory matter, this

19 Court concluded, Your Honor, that a violation of 10(b)(5)

20 had been alleged, notwithstanding going on to conclude

21 that the plaintiff could not recover, as a matter of

22 private cause of action.

23 So, we understand -- we believe, Your Honor,

24 that it -- and it is undisputed on this record -- that all

25 parties agree, as the court below concluded, that this --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Congress intended to impart 10(b)(5) interpretation as a

2 statutory matter into SLUSA. We also think, Justice

3 Ginsburg, that, were Your Honors to conclude that somehow

4 "in connection with" means something different in a civil

5 context, a narrower reading than in the broader context,

6 that would, of course, violate, in our view, the rule of

7 lenity that is applied by this Court. It would also mark

8 what we believe to be the first time, insofar as we have

9 been able to determine -- and Respondent cites no

10 authority to the contrary -- in which the same provisions

11 in a statute that have civil and criminal --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you explain the rule

13 of lenity? Because, on criminal, it is as broad as can

14 be. I didn't know that there was a rule of lenity that

15 applied strictly to civil liability.

16 MR. KASNER: Your Honor, we -- and we have cited

17 authority, including the Leocal decision of this Court,

18 last year, in which, for statutory construction purposes,

19 where you have a civil and a criminal statute that has

20 both elements to it, the rule of lenity would dictate that

21 the narrower reading be the one that is written. So, in

22 other words, if this Court were to have concluded, in Blue

23 Chip -- excuse me -- in United States versus O'Hagan,

24 that, as a criminal matter, the "in connection with"

25 language is not tethered to the purchase or sale by a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 particular party in the case, that is a broader reading

2 than the reading that the court below adopted in a civil

3 case. And so, what we're urging is that the rule of

4 lenity would suggest that, if this Court, in U.S. v.

5 O'Hagan, took the view that the "purchase or sale"

6 requirement does not apply in a criminal context, that

7 should also apply in a civil context, that a narrower

8 reading should not be imparted into a civil context than

9 you would find in a criminal context.

10 We also --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But one reason you might

12 want to adopt a narrower reading, though, is, we're

13 dealing here with the preemption provision. It's one

14 thing to say that, when you're talking about the SEC's

15 enforcement powers, you adopt a broad reading; but it's

16 quite another thing, when you're talking about displacing

17 State law, that you would necessarily adopt the same broad

18 reading.

19 MR. KASNER: Mr. Chief Justice, I think, in this

20 case, there is no other purpose to be served by this

21 statute than to preempt. To the extent that embedded in

22 Your Honor's question is a question with respect to the

23 so-called presumption against preemption, we don't think

24 that those concerns, or the concerns to which Your Honor

25 just referred, apply in this case, because the statute is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 clear; there is no ambiguity in the language that Congress

2 used, and hence -- and it would have made no sense, Mr.

3 Chief Justice, for Congress to have --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's a lot of --

5 I think our cases establish that a phrase like "in

6 connection with" carries with it a lot of ambiguity. You

7 don't know exactly how rigorous the connection has to be.

8 I mean, a auto accident by a broker who's leaving his

9 office -- he wouldn't be in the office if he weren't

10 buying and selling securities. I mean, is that auto

11 accident "in connection with the purchase and sales of

12 securities"? No. And yet, you know, theoretically it

13 could be. It's a -- there's a lot of ambiguity in

14 determining how much breadth to give that phrase.

15 MR. KASNER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I would

16 agree with you that, in terms of deciding, for -- as a

17 substantive matter, for purposes of 10(b)(5), "in

18 connection with," such as in SEC versus Zandford, how far

19 the outer reaches of the "in connection with" language go

20 may well be susceptible of differences of opinion. There

21 is no difference of opinion to which there can be any

22 disagreement, in this case, about the plain language of

23 the preemption, because the conduct -- no matter what the

24 conduct is that is involved "in connection with the

25 purchase or sale of securities," one thing that is totally

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 crystal clear, based on this Court's cases and

2 congressional purpose, is that the "in connection with the

3 purchase or sale" language, as used here, does not

4 restrict its application to the purchase or sale by the

5 plaintiff such that --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but that's a normal

7 reading of the words, wouldn't you -- when you say a

8 purchase or -- it normally would be "in connection with

9 the purchase or sale of securities by the party to the

10 litigation." That would be your first take on it. But

11 then you say, "Well, we have cases out there that construe

12 it a little more narrowly." And is it not somewhat

13 unusual -- and I know it's not totally unusual -- for

14 Congress to preempt a State cause of action that without

15 -- where there is no parallel Federal remedy.

16 MR. KASNER: Justice Stevens, one misimpression

17 I believe that the court below was under, and I believe is

18 perpetuated by Respondent in his amici, this statute does

19 not preempt a State-law claim. This is not like the

20 cases, for example --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: It just preempts class

22 actions.

23 MR. KASNER: It preempts class actions. And

24 it's significant, because Congress made a policy judgment.

25 Originally, as originally introduced in the House, SLUSA

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would have preempted all State-law securities cases. All

2 of them. As the statute wound its way through the House

3 and the Senate, it -- and principally in response to

4 testimony by the SEC Commissioner Levitt, who went to the

5 Hill three separate times on this legislation -- specific

6 statutory exemptions were put in.

7 But it -- getting back, though, to the purpose

8 behind --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: In going through that

10 legislative history, did you find any evidence that they

11 intended to preempt any State-law claims that were not --

12 did not have a parallel Federal claim?

13 MR. KASNER: Justice Stevens, the --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Other than the language of the

15 statute?

16 MR. KASNER: Well, we believe that the --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

18 MR. KASNER: -- this inquiry --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you --

20 MR. KASNER: -- begins and ends --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you brought up the

22 legislative history.

23 MR. KASNER: Yes.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, you're an expert on that

25 subject.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 [Laughter.]

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

3 MR. KASNER: Your -- Justice Stevens, the only

4 reference to the purchaser-or-seller issue is one that is

5 referenced by the Respondent. And, in that instance, a

6 professor from Cornell, Professor Painter, went to the

7 Hill, and he said, "If you enact this statute, you are

8 going to be closing off claims of people who are not

9 purchasers or sellers, because those cannot be bought in

10 the Federal court."

11 But back for a moment, though, to the issue of

12 what is not preempted in the policy behind this statute,

13 there was another component that Congress was seeking to

14 remedy here, and that was the so-called "safe harbor." In

15 1995, when Congress enacted the Private Securities

16 Litigation Reform Act, one piece of that was an effort to

17 encourage public companies to make predictive statements

18 publicly. There had been a rash of litigation, at the

19 time, against public companies whose predictive statements

20 proved false. And so, Congress said, "Wait a minute. We

21 will allow you an insulation from liability, if your

22 forward statements prove false, if the plaintiff cannot

23 allege either that they were made with actual knowledge or

24 not accompanied by meaningful cautionary language."

25 Another purpose of this statute was to --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt? Because I'm --

2 MR. KASNER: Yes.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- your time is running out.

4 MR. KASNER: Yes.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is my understanding correct

6 that, on your reading, State class actions of less than 50

7 parties are also left unpreempted?

8 MR. KASNER: Justice Souter, the definition --

9 yes. The answer to --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

11 MR. KASNER: -- your question is, yes.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: So --

13 MR. KASNER: The definition --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- individual actions and small

15 State class actions.

16 MR. KASNER: Individual actions, less than 50

17 people, arbitrations, public enforcement.

18 And, with that, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like

19 to reserve the balance of my time.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kasner.

21 Mr. Hungar.

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 may it please the Court:

2 The fundamental flaw in the Court of Appeals

3 analysis is that it requires the phrase "in connection

4 with" to be given two different and irreconcilable

5 interpretations, depending on the identity of the plaintiff.

6 Nothing in the text or history of the securities laws

7 justifies that implausible interpretation.

8 The Securities and Exchange Commission --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hungar, I just wonder if

10 that's correct. Is -- am I not right to say that the word

11 "the" had been read to mean "his or her," that argument

12 would not apply?

13 MR. HUNGAR: I think that's correct, Justice

14 Stevens, but --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then you don't have to

16 have differing interpretations of "in connection with."

17 You just have to know what the word "the" means.

18 MR. HUNGAR: Well, the "in connection" -- that's

19 not the approach that the Court of Appeals took, of

20 course, but -- and also, as Mr. Kasner indicated, that

21 issue has been dispositively resolved by this Court and

22 the Commission in concluding that the purchaser/seller

23 rule is not a limitation on the scope of the prohibition

24 in section 10(b). And if your interpretation were the one

25 that were adopted, that would not be the case.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I always thought "the" meant

2 "the."

3 [Laughter.]

4 MR. HUNGAR: Certainly, that would be our

5 submission.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: And "his or her" means "his or

7 her."

8 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. And, again --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but you --

10 MR. HUNGAR: -- if it --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- think it means "any."

12 MR. HUNGAR: I'm sorry?

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think it means

14 "any," right? You're reading "the" to mean "any."

15 MR. HUNGAR: Right, it's "the" -- well, it's

16 "the," in the sense of "the activity of purchasing and

17 selling securities," yes. It's -- and that's how this

18 Court has interpreted, in the O'Hagan case, for -- if that

19 interpretation -- if "the" were read as "his or her," then

20 it's impossible to see how the SEC could bring an

21 enforcement action, or the Justice Department could bring

22 a prosecution, in a case like O'Hagan, where the -- where

23 the Court specifically said that the purchaser or seller

24 was not defrauded. It's not that -- it's not true that

25 section 10(b) requires that the purchaser or seller be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 defrauded. And so, we submit that this would be --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it certainly doesn't

3 require the Commission to be a purchaser or seller,

4 either. You know --

5 MR. HUNGAR: Well, we certainly would agree with

6 that, Your Honor, that --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

8 MR. HUNGAR: But, more generally, it doesn't

9 require that there be a purchaser or seller who's

10 defrauded, and yet the purchaser/seller rule, for the

11 purpose of implied actions, does require that.

12 Justice Stevens, you asked about whether there

13 is any indication in the legislative history that Congress

14 intended this act to preempt class-action claims where

15 there would be no Federal remedy. The answer to that is,

16 absolutely yes. It is perfectly clear from the

17 legislative history that Congress knew, and expected, that

18 claims that could be brought under State law as class

19 actions, such as aiding-and-abetting claims or negligent-

20 misrepresentation claims, claims that would not satisfy

21 the Federal --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

23 MR. HUNGAR: -- scienter requirements for --

24 and, of course, the claims that would not satisfy the

25 requirements of the PSLRA. None of those could be brought

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in Federal court, because they're barred by the various

2 provisions of Federal law.

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but they would be at --

4 adjudged under a different standard, you're dead right.

5 As far as the parties involved, the -- that's what I was

6 really asking.

7 MR. HUNGAR: Well, in cases where the -- where

8 the only claim is against aiders and abetters, those

9 parties would be -- would be out of court; or, likewise,

10 cases where parties could not satisfy the scienter

11 requirement, those parties would be out of court. So,

12 Congress knew that it would be foreclosing remedies for

13 certain categories of claims, and that was part of the

14 point of the act, as the conference committee report makes

15 clear.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the --

17 MR. HUNGAR: Congress was --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the claim that's made

19 here, the second claim, where the broker said, "We lost

20 clients, so -- as a result of this deception -- and we

21 want to be compensated for that," nothing about the

22 inflated price of the security --

23 MR. HUNGAR: Your --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- just that "our clients

25 don't trust us anymore, because we gave them such bad

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 advice."

2 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the -- that issue is

3 not before this Court --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know, but I --

5 MR. HUNGAR: -- because it was not --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- wanted to know what the

7 Government's position was on that claim. Could that be

8 brought in a State court --

9 MR. HUNGAR: The --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- even as a class action?

11 MR. HUNGAR: The Commission addressed that

12 question in its amicus brief in the Court of Appeals, and

13 took the position that that claim was not in connection

14 with the purchase or sale of securities, because the

15 injury occurs after the fraud has been completed, and is -

16 - and has to do with the lost future relationship, rather

17 than fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of

18 securities. And so, we didn't address that in our brief

19 here, obviously, but the Commission took the position,

20 below, that that would not be preempted, because it's not

21 in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you deal with the

23 Court's -- the footnote in the Blue Chip Stamp -- that

24 the court says -- in the Federal court -- "these 10(b)

25 actions have to be limited to actual purchasers and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 sellers," but that limitation is attenuated, because

2 deserving claims by nontraders would lie under State law,

3 including the very suit that was involved in Blue Chip

4 Stamps and in the Second Circuit case that paved the way

5 for Blue Chip?

6 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, that was an accurate

7 description of the state of the law, as it existed at the

8 time, at least in theory, although, as a practical matter,

9 Respondents have not been able to point to a single

10 reported case a -- of a holder class action in State court

11 prior to the adoption of the Uniform Standards Act. So,

12 while it was true, as a theoretical matter, that such

13 claims could be brought under the law of some States,

14 there are -- there is no history of State class actions in

15 this area, which is one of the reasons why we think the

16 reliance on the assumption of nonpreemption makes no sense

17 here. Securities class actions prior to the PSLRA were

18 brought in Federal court, and it was only the PSLRA that

19 resulted in cases, such as the type of case at issue here,

20 being brought in State courts. And Congress -- once it

21 saw that problem, Congress was concerned that the

22 requirements of the PSLRA were being evaded, and it was

23 also concerned, as the conference committee report makes

24 clear, that, now that these securities class actions were

25 being brought in State court, there was the potential

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 danger of 50 varying State standards being applied, as

2 this very case suggests, and Congress acted to remedy both

3 of those problems, as the conference committee report

4 makes clear, both the risk of nonuniformity in securities

5 class actions that are targeted by the act, and the risk

6 of evasion of the PSLRA.

7 Respondent's position would frustrate both of

8 those objectives, because it would -- it would permit the

9 most abusive category of lawsuits to proceed in State

10 court, and it would permit such holder claims to be

11 brought -- for instance, based on negligence, if State law

12 permitted that; based on conduct that would be protected

13 by the Federal safe harbor for forward-looking statements

14 under the PSLRA. So, the PSLRA protections would be

15 frustrated by their interpretation.

16 So, the very goals that Congress explicitly

17 sought to achieve, stated in the -- in the text of the

18 statute, in the purposes section and also in the

19 conference committee report, would be frustrated. And,

20 again, that approach requires the Court to accept an

21 inconsistent interpretation of the text of the "in

22 connection with" requirement, depending on the identity of

23 the plaintiff, which would be an extraordinary way to

24 construe a statute, particularly when there's nothing in

25 the legislative history that provides even a hint of a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 suggestion that Congress would have intended that result.

2 And with respect to Blue Chip, Your Honor, it's

3 important to remember what Blue Chip was doing. Blue Chip

4 was not a case about the scope of the "in connection with"

5 requirement or the section 10(b) prohibition. Instead, it

6 was a case about what to infer about what Congress would

7 have wanted to authorize as an -- as a right of action, if

8 it had addressed the question. And that's why the Blue

9 Chip court made very clear that the conduct at issue there

10 involving injuries to holders can be a violation of

11 section 10(b) -- i.e., it can be in connection with the

12 purchase or sale of securities -- it's just that they did

13 not think that Congress would have wanted to authorize a

14 private right of action.

15 So, again, when we're talking about the scope of

16 the "in connection with" requirement, which is what is at

17 issue here, that approach is the same approach that should

18 be followed here, the same approach that was in --

19 followed in O'Hagan and in Zandford, and compels the

20 conclusion that, since the conduct at issue here is

21 unquestionably "in connection with the purchase and sale

22 of securities," as this Court has construed that phrase,

23 it is preempted by the Uniform Standards Act.

24 If the Court has no further questions, I thank

25 the Court.

2 Mr. Frederick.

3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

4 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

5 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

6 and may it please the Court:

7 Our position is that SLUSA does not preempt

8 class actions asserting holder claims. Congress

9 incorporated this Court's interpretation of "in connection

10 with" from Blue Chip Stamps when it enacted SLUSA. SLUSA

11 rechanneled State suits to Federal court. It was not

12 designed to eliminate State remedies that could not be

13 pursued as Federal 10(b)(5) claims. That interpretation

14 is the better reading of the text, the context, and the

15 history of SLUSA's handling of private securities actions.

16 If I could start with the text --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, do you agree

18 that a holder action falls within 10(b)(5), generally?

19 MR. FREDERICK: No, because this Court, in the

20 Blue Chip Stamps case, said that it did not. In footnote

21 5, Justice Rehnquist --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about enforcement

23 actions taken by the --

24 MR. FREDERICK: In enforcement --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- SEC?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FREDERICK: -- actions, the SEC can bring

2 enforcement authority, pursuant to 10(b)(5). And so, to

3 that extent, misconduct that would be connected to what,

4 in a private context, would be deemed a holder claim, does

5 fall within the SEC's --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then, the --

7 MR. FREDERICK: -- jurisdiction.

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- then it does fall within --

9 holder actions do fall within 10(b)(5), for some purposes.

10 MR. FREDERICK: They do, for enforcement

11 purposes; they do not, for private civil-action purposes.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, you want us to interpret

13 the text two ways, depending on the purpose.

14 MR. FREDERICK: No. What I want you to do is to

15 understand what Congress intended. And what Congress

16 intended, in SLUSA, I think is quite clear if you start at

17 the beginning of the statute and you just start reading

18 your way through it, because what Congress did in SLUSA

19 was attempt to stop a flight of cases that had been

20 brought in Federal court heretofore, but were migrating to

21 State court, Congress perceived, as a result of the

22 enactment of the PSLRA.

23 Section 2 of SLUSA -- and it is very important,

24 Your Honors, that you look carefully at section 2 of

25 SLUSA, because it has five congressional findings. They

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 are not adequately briefed, or even discussed, by the

2 Second Circuit, but one of them says that the PSLRA sought

3 to prevent abuses. The second one says, since an

4 enactment of that, Congress perceives that a number of

5 securities class-action lawsuits have shifted from Federal

6 to State courts. The third one says, that shift has

7 prevented the act from achieving its objectives. The next

8 one says, State securities regulation is of continuing

9 importance. And the then, the fifth one says, in order to

10 prevent certain State private securities class actions

11 alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives

12 of the PSLRA, it is appropriate to enact these national

13 standards.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Government doesn't say that

15 "all" are covered. The Government acknowledges that there

16 are some actions that could still be brought in State

17 court.

18 MR. FREDERICK: The point, though, Justice

19 Scalia, is that what Congress, in the PSLRA, was doing was

20 attempting to ratchet up the pleading requirements for

21 Federal-law claims.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- it's so

23 counterintuitive. As the Government points out, these

24 holder claims lend themselves to abuse much more than do

25 the narrow purchase-and-sale claims.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FREDERICK: Absolutely --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: And why --

3 MR. FREDERICK: -- not.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why the Government would

5 want to police the one, and let the other, you know,

6 proliferate, seems very strange to me.

7 MR. FREDERICK: That's not correct, Justice

8 Scalia. And it's important to emphasize this. What the

9 Court addressed in the Blue Chip Stamps case was a very

10 different kind of case. It involved nonpurchasers. And

11 the Court reasoned that it would be speculative for

12 somebody out there to say, "Well, I would have purchased

13 the security, had I known." A holder claim, as recognized

14 for a century in various State courts, involves a claim by

15 somebody who holds a security and is induced by fraud not

16 to sell that security. The restatement set of torts,

17 section 525, recognizes that the fraud by forebearance of

18 -- to cause you not to take an action is just as much a

19 fraud as one that --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the --

21 MR. FREDERICK: -- induces you.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the fraud is caused

23 -- the fraud causes other people to want to buy the

24 security. They do so at a higher price. It causes the

25 price to go up. It's "in connection with a purchase or

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 sale," maybe not of the holder's securities. But it's

2 certainly -- the holder's claim wouldn't exist, but for

3 purchases and sales that caused the price to go up.

4 MR. FREDERICK: In most circumstance, that's

5 correct, Mr. Chief Justice. But that, I don't think is

6 material. The level of damages that a holder sustains

7 should not determine what the elements of the liability

8 are. And what is striking about the Government and

9 Merrill Lynch's position here is that intentional fraud is

10 going to be given a pass because of those persons who are

11 uniquely harmed, because, for 20 years --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what your clients

13 want to do is cash in on the fraud. They don't -- their

14 claim is that they didn't get to sell the stock at an

15 inflated price to somebody who didn't know about the

16 fraud. That's the damages that they want to collect. And

17 that seems to be an odd claim to recognize.

18 MR. FREDERICK: That's the same kind of claim

19 that in -- to get back to Justice Scalia's question --

20 arises in the purchaser/seller context. The only

21 difference is that the measure of damages is computed by

22 when you purchase or sell, as opposed to when you bought

23 it, before the fraud occurred. I mean, Wall Street has

24 been telling investors, for two or more decades, "Buy and

25 hold. Rest your retirement, hold your securities."

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: In that --

2 MR. FREDERICK: In --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in -- suppose a person

4 bought the stock at price 30 before any fraud took place,

5 and then he holds it, and then the fraud, and then,

6 subsequently, the word of the fraud gets out, the price

7 falls a lot, and he sells it. Does he have a claim, under

8 Federal -- ordinary -- you know, does he -- can he go into

9 Federal court?

10 MR. FREDERICK: No.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: No.

12 MR. FREDERICK: Blue Chip --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

14 MR. FREDERICK: -- Stamps said no.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

16 MR. FREDERICK: In State courts, in the

17 Weinberger case that we cite, they -- they very carefully

18 say this was not a State-court class action, but what

19 Judge Friendly, in the Weinberger case, addressed was a

20 State-law holder --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, then --

22 MR. FREDERICK: -- class action --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- then -- I see that -- then

24 what's worrying me is this, that -- one thing worrying me

25 is that -- let's take an ordinary buyer case. All right?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And what happened is that the -- some buyers would like to

2 bring a fraud suit in Federal court. They have to go to

3 Federal court now. They can't go into State court. But

4 they have a little brainstorm, or the lawyers do, and they

5 say, "Well, in any case where a buyer would have a claim,

6 and we don't want to go into Federal court, there surely

7 are going to be a class of holders that would also have

8 the kind of claim you say." So, there we are, same

9 actions, all in the State court, just happens to have

10 found a different class of claimant. And there always

11 will be such a class.

12 MR. FREDERICK: There will be, in most

13 circumstances. There are some circumstances where harms

14 are unique to holders. But, Justice Breyer, can I point

15 out to you that, in the antitrust context, there is, under

16 Illinois Brick, a requirement that you must be in the

17 direct chain, in a direct purchaser, but there are some 30

18 States that have allowed standing for people --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's fine. And I --

20 MR. FREDERICK: -- that are indirect purchasers.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and what I'm not facing, in

22 the antitrust area, is what, it seems to me, on your

23 interpretation now, would be, Congress passes a law, which

24 becomes a futile act, because what they're anxious is --

25 to do is to get the cases in the class actions -- not all

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the cases -- but the class actions in the Federal court.

2 And then, in every single case, or 99.999 percent, where

3 we've kept this action out of Federal court, there's going

4 to be a comparable action, with holders as the plaintiff,

5 in a State court.

6 MR. FREDERICK: Well --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what -- that's a -- my

8 concern. What do you --

9 MR. FREDERICK: And let me address that this

10 way. What court -- what -- Congress was very clear in the

11 legislative debates, was -- it did not want to cut off

12 meritorious claims. It simply wanted to rechannel them.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- can you ease my

14 concern there? Is there anything you can say that could

15 ease my concern that we'll have the same set, that they'll

16 just be in State court with a different class?

17 MR. FREDERICK: Many States doesn't recognize

18 holder claims as a matter of State law, and they have the

19 same kinds of heightened pleading requirements that were

20 imposed under the PSLRA.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: And, by the way, my concern is

22 not that it's a "bad thing," in quotes. My concern is

23 that it's hard for me to think Congress would have done

24 something that wouldn't have had much effect.

25 MR. FREDERICK: I think your concern should be,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 What did Congress intend? And --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what do you make of --

3 MR. FREDERICK: And --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. That's just --

5 MR. FREDERICK: And I don't think Congress

6 intended to eliminate a swath of class actions concerning

7 a type of claim that this Court had said could not be

8 brought under --

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then --

10 MR. FREDERICK: -- Federal law.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- what do you make of the

12 legislative history? I mean, your friend on the other

13 side pointed out that there was very clear testimony to

14 the effect that if the statute passed, with the text that

15 we're dealing with, that it would, indeed, cut out a

16 series of claims.

17 MR. FREDERICK: I don't think that that was --

18 if you read that in context, I don't think that it was a

19 statement by the speaker, in that instance, of Congress's

20 intent to go beyond those claims that were cognizable

21 under Federal law, and to cut off a whole category of

22 claims that were unique to State law.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, you mentioned

24 cutting off a whole category of claims. And, earlier, you

25 said they didn't want to give a pass to this kind of a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 claim. But this is not a pass, because there are all

2 sorts of remedies retained -- derivative suits, 49-person

3 actions, and so forth. And are you aware -- you mentioned

4 the 100 years of State precedent -- is there any precedent

5 in the State law for class actions for holder claims?

6 MR. FREDERICK: Well, we think the Weinberger

7 case recognized that class actions could be brought, under

8 New York law. It was a Federal case --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But this --

10 MR. FREDERICK: -- but it was --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- is not a case where we have

12 a 100-year body of law of class action after class action

13 brought on State-law grounds for this type of claim.

14 MR. FREDERICK: True. But, in the '90s, you had

15 a unique form of fraud that was being perpetrated on Wall

16 Street that did affect holders in a unique way. And we've

17 highlighted market timing in our briefs. In that

18 circumstance, it would be futile for 49 holders to get

19 together and assert that they had been harmed by market

20 timing, because the aggregate of their harm is so small

21 that you really have to look at it in a large context.

22 John Vogel, the head of Vanguard for many years,

23 and one of most respected mutual-fund advisors, says that

24 there are as many as $5 billion lost by people who buy and

25 hold, as we've been taught to do by Wall Street, but whose

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 aggregate losses accrete every year by virtue of market

2 timing. That is a unique harm caused to holders, which,

3 under their theory, would not be cognizable, because it

4 would be preempted, and it would be impossible, as a

5 practical matter, for someone to get together with 48 of

6 his or her fellow victims and try to bring a claim to

7 redress that. There's --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you're --

9 MR. FREDERICK: -- no evidence --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you're describing the

11 present importance of the -- that. But I don't think

12 you've answered my question about historic -- as a matter

13 of history, we don't have a history of timer claims.

14 MR. FREDERICK: We don't have a history of timer

15 claims, but what we also don't have, Justice Stevens, is

16 an indication by Congress, throughout the entire

17 legislative debate or the conference reports or anything,

18 where holder claims which had been brought were perceived

19 to be a problem and were perceived to be within the ambit

20 of what Congress was doing. Because, remember --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, because they -- I mean, the

22 argument made by the Government: "Of course not, because

23 the only reason they're brought is precisely to evade this

24 congressional legislation." They didn't exist, before;

25 and they've become common, afterwards. Now -- you know, I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- you can say --

2 MR. FREDERICK: They could --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that they --

4 MR. FREDERICK: -- they could not be brought

5 under Federal law, before. And I would acknowledge that,

6 because of a series of this Court's decisions, it is

7 easier to prove a purchaser/seller claim, where the facts

8 warrant that, under 10(b) prior to the PSLRA than it was

9 to prove a holder claim. Judge Friendly, in the

10 Weinberger opinion, makes very clear that the value to be

11 attributed to the class-action settlement there has to be

12 diminished because of the difficulty of proof of such

13 claims. But that --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that there were --

15 well, never mind.

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: There would --

17 MR. FREDERICK: I'd like to address the point

18 that the Government makes about how this would supposedly

19 affect the SEC's enforcement authority --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before --

21 MR. FREDERICK: -- because --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you get to that, just --

23 Mr. Frederick, the logic of it -- but -- here, Congress is

24 tightening the requirements for class actions, but then

25 there is this class, which -- Blue Chip did say there's a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 lot -- room for a lot of abuse in holder classes -- would

2 be left to the State courts for whatever strict or lenient

3 rules. So, why would Congress, with respect to this

4 category, want there to be a more plaintiff-friendly rule

5 than the rule that Congress has just put in place for the

6 purchaser/seller 10(b) actions?

7 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think

8 that it's correct to characterize it as more plaintiff-

9 friendly. If you're in Minnesota, you can't bring one of

10 these claims, because State law doesn't recognize it.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, at least in some

12 States.

13 MR. FREDERICK: In some States, you -- where the

14 common law or the State statutes recognize these claims,

15 all that we're arguing is that Congress didn't focus on

16 these. In the normal presumption against preemption, you

17 don't, you know, cut through a wide swath of claims where

18 Congress hasn't expressed an intent specifically to

19 preempt them. That's our position, and particularly where

20 the congressional findings --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you're admitting

22 that an -- that anomaly could be part of the scene, that

23 you'd have a State that allows you to sue for negligence,

24 and doesn't have heightened pleading requirements for

25 holder claims; and so, those claims would be treated more

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- in a more plaintiff-friendly way than Federal claims.

2 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. Certainly, just as "breach

3 of fiduciary duty" and "breach of the covenant of good

4 faith and fair dealing" are State-law claims, negligence

5 is a State-law claim, all of those give rise to

6 variations, State by State. But what Congress was getting

7 at were fraud claims that were Federal-law fraud claims.

8 And, when it did so, it was heightening the pleading

9 requirements and, seeing what people were doing was taking

10 what were Federal-law claims and migrating them to State

11 court under, ostensibly, more lenient standards --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: But why, in your theory --

13 suppose you're right. You're right. I assume that.

14 You can have these holder claims. But why couldn't

15 any buyer, who's -- has to go to Federal court because he

16 has a buyer claim, just say, "I'll bring the holder claim"?

17 MR. FREDERICK: He can't do that under the --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

19 MR. FREDERICK: -- under the Second Circuit's

20 test, because --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: I know. But what I'm asking

22 is, What's the logic of that? I mean, you're either right

23 or you're wrong. If Congress didn't want to cut off the

24 holder claim, they didn't. So, what's to show that they

25 wanted to cut it off for some people, but not other

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 people?

2 MR. FREDERICK: The logic is that, for the

3 buyers of those claims, they are meeting the Federal

4 standard of "in connection with" --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Not in this suit.

6 MR. FREDERICK: -- "purchase or sale."

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Not --

8 MR. FREDERICK: Yes.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in this suit.

10 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, they are, because they're

11 buying -- the reason why these people have -- under the

12 Second Circuit's standard, which we think is correct, is

13 that you had to have bought the stock before the fraud,

14 and you were holding it throughout that period of fraud;

15 and so, your purchase is not "in connection with" the

16 fraud, the misrepresentation. But somebody who sees the

17 prospectus, who sees what Mr. Blodget was saying, which

18 was that there were stocks that were, quote, "a piece of

19 crap," but they were giving them the highest buy

20 recommendation -- those people are making their purchase

21 "in connection with" --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: So, if I'm both --

23 MR. FREDERICK: -- "a fraud."

24 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I bought it in May, in

25 reliance on this ridiculous thing. "Buggy whips make

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 gold." I believed it. I bought buggy whips. Now --

2 we're now in December. And every month, they kept

3 repeating it. And my claim is, "Yes, I know, I bought it

4 in May, in reliance, but I kept it in July, because I kept

5 seeing it repeated and repeated." Do I --

6 MR. FREDERICK: I think --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: -- have a claim?

8 MR. FREDERICK: I think, actually under the

9 Second Circuit's standard, that --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: In the Second Circuit, I do

11 not. But I want to know why not.

12 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that the reason

13 why not is that if the fraud is affecting the plaintiff's

14 decision to purchase, then that falls within SLUSA, and

15 that is preempted, although it allow -- you are allowed to

16 have a Federal remedy under that standard. You're

17 rechanneled to Federal court. But if you buy -- to use

18 your hypothetical, you buy in January, but the fraudulent

19 misrepresentations are not made until May or June, you're

20 precluded from bringing a Federal-law claim.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if I choose not to

22 complain about my buying, I just choose to complain about

23 my holding? It's true, I was harmed because I jumped in.

24 And that's one harm. But it's an entirely separate harm

25 that I was induced to hold it --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FREDERICK: That's --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- by these continuing

3 misrepresentations. Why can't that part of the suit be

4 brought in State court?

5 MR. FREDERICK: That's our position.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is? Okay. So, you --

7 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. Our position --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you --

9 MR. FREDERICK: -- is that --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you agree --

11 MR. FREDERICK: -- is that --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you agree that a buyer --

13 MR. FREDERICK: I --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- who -- whose purchase is

15 excluded, can nonetheless sue --

16 MR. FREDERICK: No, I --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in a State --

18 MR. FREDERICK: No, I'm sorry, I misunderstood

19 your hypothetical. I thought your hypothetical was that

20 if you bought, prior to the fraud --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no. You bought --

22 MR. FREDERICK: If you bought --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in reliance --

24 MR. FREDERICK: -- in connection with --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- on the fraud --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FREDERICK: -- a fraud --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

3 MR. FREDERICK: -- then you are -- you are --

4 you are forced into Federal court --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?

6 MR. FREDERICK: -- under SLUSA.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I have --

8 MR. FREDERICK: Because --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a buying claim, and I have a

10 holding claim. Why do --

11 MR. FREDERICK: That was --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is there in the statute

13 that says the two have to go with each other?

14 MR. FREDERICK: That was the decision that

15 Congress made.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where?

17 MR. FREDERICK: In this preemption provision --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not making --

19 MR. FREDERICK: -- that your --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a buying claim. I -- and

21 there's nothing in my complaint about my buying the stock.

22 I say --

23 MR. FREDERICK: Your --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- "I was induced to hold the

25 stock by these representations that occurred in February,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 March, April, and May. I bought, in January, also in

2 reliance on fraud, but I'm not complaining about that."

3 MR. FREDERICK: What the Second Circuit said,

4 which I think is correct, is that -- is that your damages

5 have to be totally and apart from the fraud as a

6 purchaser, and that where --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are --

8 MR. FREDERICK: -- the reason why they set this

9 timeframe for holder claims is that those kinds of claims

10 that you're talking about, Justice Scalia, would be a

11 classic purchaser/seller-type claim, and you can bring

12 that in Federal court. And that's the point here, that,

13 where you've got long-term holders, and you've got people

14 who purchased in the '80s or in the '70s, and they're being

15 induced to hold for decades, and they may want to make --

16 they may suffer their damages as a result of collateral

17 that they want to borrow against -- they have no practical

18 means of recovery --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: As a practical matter, my

20 damages from the holding may be much greater than my

21 damages from the initial purchase. And you're saying,

22 "Tough luck, Charlie. You bought a month too soon -- or a

23 month too late. You should have brought -- bought before

24 the fraud."

25 MR. FREDERICK: What the Second Circuit said,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 which I think is correct, is that that becomes a level of

2 line-drawing that we don't think Congress did intend to

3 get into.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you. But that's

5 the trouble. Because, in order to make the Second

6 Circuit's argument, you have to say the following,

7 "Congress couldn't have intended to allow people who have

8 a buyer claim to make a totally separate holder claim,

9 because that would gut the statute, and they wouldn't want

10 to engage in a futile act." But now you're asking us to

11 do about the same thing, when you talk about a person who

12 doesn't have the buyer claim and you're trying to get us

13 to say, "Congress thought -- Congress thought an

14 individual action there, their own separate action in the

15 State court, wasn't good enough; it would have wanted to

16 preserve the holder claim for them." Now, that's

17 possible, but it requires me to think Congress is going

18 through quite a few hoops here.

19 MR. FREDERICK: The hoops that Congress went to,

20 and which I have articulated, in the congressional

21 findings, are that the particular harm that Congress was

22 addressing in SLUSA -- this was a narrow -- you know, this

23 was a narrowly framed preemption as to Federal-law claims,

24 because a -- the PSLRA only governed Federal-law claims.

25 And if you could not bring a holder claim under Federal

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 law, because of Blue Chip Stamps, you were forced into

2 State court. Okay? So, when Congress is debating the

3 evasion of the PSLRA, it is only talking about Federal-law

4 claims. And there's nothing in the legislative history

5 that they've cited, or that we have found, to suggest that

6 Congress gave any thought to preempting a class of holder

7 claims. Now, certainly --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, can I ask sort

9 of a background question? Ever since Blue Chip -- it's

10 been on the books for a long time -- has Congress ever

11 considered legislation that would expand the 10(b)(5)

12 private remedy to include holder claims?

13 MR. FREDERICK: I'm not aware of legislation,

14 Your Honor.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not, either. I -- just

16 wondering if there was some we could --

17 MR. FREDERICK: But what -- what this Court did

18 say, in Blue Chip Stamps, was that, when the Birnbaum

19 decision -- and it was an interpretation of "in connection

20 with purchase or sale" by what one Justice on this Court

21 described as the "Mother Court of the Court of Appeals" --

22 it was Chief Judge Swan, Judge Augustus Hand, and Judge

23 Learned Hand -- and they construed the words "in

24 connection with purchase or sale" to mean the plaintiff's

25 purchase --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but Blue --

2 MR. FREDERICK: -- or sale.

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- but Blue Chip did not adopt

4 the rationale of the Birnbaum case.

5 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think it -- it did adopt

6 the rule, though, as a basis of the wording. And if you

7 look at page 733 of the Court's opinion, it was adopting

8 the rationale, in the sense that it saw Birnbaum as a

9 construction of the language, and it adopted that. And

10 then in note 5, when Justice Rehnquist's opinion says, "It

11 would be odd to read 'in connection with purchase or sale'

12 to give a," quote, "'cause of action to everybody in the

13 world,'" I think it's clear that that was suggesting that

14 State law could recognize something that this Court said

15 was not recognized under Federal law.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, it seems to me

17 that the language "in connection with," you know, whether

18 it means what Blue Chip meant or whether it means what the

19 statute meant, is at least ambiguous. And, if that's the

20 case, why shouldn't we be guided by the Securities and

21 Exchange Commission's determination, under Chevron, Mead,

22 you know, anything but --

23 MR. FREDERICK: This statute is a -- about

24 private civil actions, and it doesn't affect the SEC's

25 enforcement authority or any action. In fact, the SEC

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 doesn't derive any greater power, or lesser power, as a

2 result of the enactment of SLUSA. It is entirely

3 legislated against private civil actions.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The --

5 MR. FREDERICK: So, the SEC --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Have we not given any weight to

7 SEC determinations, as to its interpretation, where civil

8 actions are involved? I'm surprised at that.

9 MR. FREDERICK: This is an act, Justice Scalia,

10 where the SEC's enforcement authority isn't affected one

11 jot. And so, I think it would be a strange application of

12 Chevron, or even Skidmore, deference to say that the SEC

13 gets some special weight because it's construing words in

14 an enactment --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

16 MR. FREDERICK: -- that's addressed to private --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you know --

18 MR. FREDERICK: -- civil litigation.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- whether the SEC filed an

20 amicus brief in Blue Chip?

21 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. And it took the position

22 there that "in connection with" did have a broad

23 construction. And that position was rejected.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: It took the position that the

25 Seventh Circuit took in Eason, didn't it?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

3 [Laughter.]

4 MR. FREDERICK: But the Court, there, I don't

5 think was -- it said that it was not in -- giving any

6 deference to the SEC's position, because it was an implied

7 private right of action that this Court had recognized,

8 and that the lower courts had recognized.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you finish -- there's

10 two questions I would like to ask him. One is -- we know

11 about the holder claims. They are saved for State

12 actions. They're not preempted. What else would fall in

13 this category that is not -- that SLUSA doesn't affect,

14 that can be brought as class actions in State court?

15 MR. FREDERICK: Well, there are class actions

16 that concern breaches of fiduciary duty, negligence. And

17 the question of whether or not they are "in connection

18 with purchase or sale" is going to have a profound impact

19 on whether or not those claims are also preempted. I

20 can't spell out for you what the necessary consequences

21 are, but there are a lot of State-law claims brought under

22 Blue Sky laws and other State remedies that traditionally

23 have been observed and brought, even as State claims, but,

24 under a -- you know, the all-encompassing parameter of "in

25 connection with purchase or sale" advanced on the other

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 side, a decision that would favor that could have unknown

2 preemptive consequences, which I would submit would be

3 contrary to the normal way you would put Congress to the

4 test of determining, "Did it intend to preempt those

5 claims?" before adopting a broad interpretation that would

6 do so. And if I could point out --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You --

8 MR. FREDERICK: -- one of the strange things

9 about this case and the SEC's position is that district

10 courts are going to be put in the rather unusual position

11 of paying a rather high cost, because if they are

12 confronted with a removal of a case brought under State

13 law, where the defendant asserts that it is preempted

14 under SLUSA, and the SEC hasn't taken any action at all,

15 and has expressed no interest in this particular area, the

16 district court, to determine preemption, has to intuit

17 whether or not this is within the SEC's enforcement

18 authority. So, you have -- ordinarily, you would have

19 private plaintiffs suing for wrongdoing on the same side

20 of the case as the SEC, as the public enforcer. But,

21 here, you have them at loggerheads. And the only way that

22 the district court can properly figure that out, whether

23 or not the private victim can get a private remedy, is to

24 cut back on the SEC's enforcement authority, will -- if

25 you will -- would exact an awfully high cost.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I would submit that that kind of an anomaly is a

2 rather unusual one, particularly where the SEC isn't a

3 party in the case, and it is not being invited to submit a

4 brief. And yet, district courts, in order to determine

5 the preemption question here, are going to have to rule

6 against the SEC in order to give a private remedy -- to

7 recognize a private remedy under State law, or to cut back

8 on a remedy under State law by holding that it is within

9 the SEC's enforcement jurisdiction.

10 Ultimately, what Merrill Lynch here is asserting

11 is an immunity for a fraud that uniquely affects a certain

12 class of holders who do not have a remedy under Federal

13 law. And I would submit that, where any party is seeking

14 to get an immunity from an intentional fraud, the party

15 bears a heavy presumption that that is, in fact, what

16 Congress intended. And I would submit to you that, both

17 with the language of the statute, the findings that

18 Congress made in the legislative history, Congress did not

19 express an intent to eliminate holder class actions of

20 greater than 49 persons.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with that presumption

22 against preemption, where the question is, Does this

23 Federal statute, which says nothing about preemption,

24 accidentally preempt some State law? -- that there, the

25 presumption makes sense. But here, you have a statute,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the whole object of which is preemption. And I'm not sure

2 that what you shouldn't do in that case is just give the

3 language its most reasonable meaning, with no thumb on

4 either side of the scale.

5 MR. FREDERICK: But it's preemption to

6 rechannel. And that's the important point, Justice

7 Scalia. The point was not to allow State-law claims under

8 State-court systems, but to rechannel those actions into

9 Federal court. And if there are a category of victims of

10 frauds who have no Federal remedy, it doesn't make sense

11 to infer that Congress, without saying so, left those

12 people without any remedy whatsoever.

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, I want to be

14 sure of one question. I'm not sure I understood your

15 argument about how the district court has to deny the

16 right to the SEC. But the SEC wouldn't be bound by the

17 district court's decision, would it?

18 MR. FREDERICK: Well, it depends on how the

19 courts would construe the SLUSA cases as affecting the "in

20 connection with purchase or sale" in the SEC enforcement

21 authority. If you were to accept the premise that the

22 Court's Zandford and O'Hagan decisions are binding on the

23 SLUSA preemption language, anytime a court is construing --

24 May I finish, Mr. Chief Justice?

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FREDERICK: Anytime a court is construing

2 that language, in the SLUSA context, it would necessarily

3 have a collateral impact on the SEC's enforcement

4 authority in 10(b).

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the SEC could

6 relitigate it, I would think. It wouldn't be bound by the

7 judgment in a private suit.

8 MR. FREDERICK: It could certainly relitigate

9 it. But the point of the persuasive authority of a

10 construction of "in connection with purchase or sale," I

11 think, would have effects that are inappropriate.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

13 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you.

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kasner, you have 3

15 minutes remaining.

16 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY B. KASNER

17 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

18 MR. KASNER: Counsel referred to the findings in

19 the legislation. And I know this Court will go back and

20 review those. The -- finding number 5 does not use the

21 word "certain" anywhere in it. What finding number 5 does

22 say, however, "It is appropriate to enact national

23 standards for securities class-action lawsuits involving

24 nationally traded securities while preserving the

25 appropriate enforcement powers of State securities

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 regulators and not changing the current treatment of

2 individual lawsuits," quote/unquote.

3 Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg asked

4 questions that I think illustrate that Congress could not

5 have intended such an anomalous result by allowing

6 holders' claims to proceed as nonpreempted.

7 Justice Breyer, as a practical matter, you are

8 100 percent right in the premise of your question. If

9 this Court agrees with -- that the court below is correct,

10 every single securities class action that is brought in

11 Federal court from that day forward will have a companion

12 claim brought with it, asserted by holders. And it's not

13 simply holders in the fashion that Mr. Dabit appears,

14 which is somebody who claims, "I would have sold, had I,

15 essentially, known inside information," a proposition

16 which Judge Friendly expounded on in the Levine case in

17 the Second Circuit, but you will also have holders -- you

18 will also have claims by people who come to court, in the

19 State court, and say, "You know, I would have bought

20 securities if you had not issued such unduly pessimistic

21 projections," just as was the case in the Blue Chip Stamp

22 case. And imagine the impact that that result would have

23 on the safe harbor, which Congress enacted with the PSLRA

24 to protect public companies in the United States and

25 abroad, encouraging them to make forward-looking

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statements. If you allow a result which affords putative

2 people, who would have bought and would have sold, in

3 State court where the safe harbor doesn't apply, you will

4 absolutely be gutting the statutory protections that

5 Congress was seeking to protect.

6 I'd like to just make one point about the

7 Weinberger verse -- the Weinberger v. Kendrick case that

8 is mentioned. That involved an approval of a Federal-

9 court class action where State-law holders' claims were

10 being released. In fact, the consideration that was

11 approved there was less, because the claims were weaker.

12 We've heard a lot, Your Honors, about why

13 Congress didn't mention holders' claims by name. The

14 reason they didn't mention holders' claims by name is that

15 it wasn't until SLUSA was enacted and creative plaintiff

16 strike-suit lawyers brought holders' claims, in an effort

17 to avoid SLUSA, that this problem became exacerbated. But

18 there is no doubt that the plain and natural meaning of

19 SLUSA picks up all claims by any private party in

20 connection with the purchase or sale of security.

21 If there are no --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's surprising that the

23 holder claims didn't respond to Blue Chip. I think your

24 argument would suggest they should have responded to Blue

25 Chip by bringing a whole host of holder claims in the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

4 MR. KASNER: Thank you.
