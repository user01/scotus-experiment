The question in this case is whether that choice should be taken away, and a suspect's decision to speak presumed involuntary, when a police officer first makes an improper comment. The answer should be no when the impropriety is cured. When, under all of the circumstances, a reasonable person in the suspect's position would understand that it was the suspect's choice whether to speak or remain silent and that the police would honor that choice and stop questioning, a decision to speak should be deemed initiation, under Edwards."

And there was also no explanation, after they left Blake in his cell, Reese just having said, \"I bet you want to talk to us now, huh?\" -- there was nothing said to assure Blake that that was not a \"You'd better talk to us, or you're going to be in trouble\" kind of thing. There was just the statement by Blake and another Miranda warning. All of those things, the judge said, weighed on his mind, and he reached the conclusion that the Government hadn't sustained its burden on the basis of those factors. So, is that clearly erroneous?

So, it's not badgering, only. And when the Petitioner says that Edwards is only about badgering, this Court has said that it's about more than badgering.

The Government would have you pay no attention to the trial court's finding when the trial court heard Officer Reese -- in fact, heard Officer Reese sit on the witness stand and lie under oath -- the court found that Officer Reese was not worthy of belief. Not only did he violate Mr. Blake's right, he then sat on the witness stand and lied about it. Now, do we want to encourage that kind of police abuse, where the police will abuse the rights of someone, then sit on the witness stand and lie, and then we say -- well, the trial judge, who had a chance to observe the demeanor, to watch the witnesses, trial judge, Judge North, who is actually present here, and who had a chance to observe each witness testify -­"

That had an impact. And, in fact, in Seibert, the Court again made reference to that, and, in Justice O'Connor's dissent, made reference to that.

And I will point the Court to Miller versus Fenton, 478 U.S. 104, where this Court said, \"Equally clear, an issue does not lose its factual character merely because its resolution is dispositive of the ultimate constitutional question.\" This Court has made clear that you give deference to the trial judge's findings, even if it may have an impact on the ultimate resolution, even where it is a mixed question of fact and law. And that's all we ask for in this case. I believe, Your Honor, that when we consider that -- in this particular matter, the evidence is clear that Mr. Blake was responding to the comments by Office Reese. And the trial court made that finding. The trial court made a finding that Office Reese's comment was intended to elicit a response. Same thing this Court has said in Innis. When you get to the next step, the question is, What that interrogation? The trial court made a factual finding it was interrogation. In fact, Petitioner concedes it was interrogation. Next step was, Was it a response, or was it new initiation of a new conversation, by Blake? The trial court found that it was a response by Mr. Blake to the comments by Officer Reese. The trial court also made a finding that there, in fact, was no cure. That factual finding was given deference by the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals considered several things. It said you should consider the attenuation. This Court said you should consider change in interrogation, location of interrogation --change in the interrogator -- excuse me -- change in the location. And I believe that we add the fact that there would have been no further advice to the -- to the suspect that he did not face the death penalty. Parties agree here. In fact, in the SG's, Solicitor General's, brief, on page 25, they say, \"If there has been any intentional coercive violation, there should be not be a cure.\" The trial court found that the act of Office Johns was intentional. I don't think anyone -- anyone, even under -- in -- under any standard of review -- could find that Officer John -- Officer Reese's -- excuse me -- comment was not intentional."

We think that it is a dangerous path to go down to allow the police to abuse a suspect's rights, and then cure it.

The trial court that found that what Officer Reese did was designed to elicit a response. This Petitioner agrees that it was interrogation; therefore, designed to elicit a response. The next question is, Was it -- did Blake respond? The trial court found, after hearing Blake testify, hearing other witnesses, that Blake was merely -- and I'd say merely, but very importantly -- responding to what Officer Reese said, not initiating a new conversation, that it was a continuous matter of only 28 minutes."

With respect to the standard of review, this Court said, in Thompson versus Keohane, that custody is a mixed question of fact and law, and voluntariness -- in Miller versus Fenton -- that voluntariness is a mixed question of fact and law. And so, the historical facts are entitled to deference. But there is de novo review of the ultimate question of custody and voluntariness. And, given the questions here about what constitutes a cure, shows that that same standard should apply. It should be a legal standard, not a factual finding."

Whether what -- Detective Johns cured it and allowed Blake to initiate should be reviewed de novo. And with respect to initiation, it's important to note that, in Bradshaw, the Court said that there's a two-part inquiry. You look at, one, did the defendant initiate? And, two, if he did, that's when you get to the voluntariness analysis."

Did it motivate him totally that his -- this thing about his codefendant, or was he moved, in significant part -- moved, motivated -- by the earlier, 30­ minute earlier, improper questioning? That sounds like a fact. Or do you think it's not a fact?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAEFF",
      "speech": "I think that is a fact, but, under Seibert and Elstad, is not the proper analysis. You don't look at -- in Seibert and Elstad, the court did not look at whether the prior unwarned statement caused the second statement. The court looked at whether the cure effectively advised the suspect that he did not have to speak. And we're suggesting that the same analysis applies in the Edwards context. You don't look at whether the improper comment caused the initiation. You look at whether the cure effectively conveyed that there would be no more questioning, that the choice was up to the suspect and the police were going to honor that choice. And once that cure happens and the suspect indicates he wants to speak, there's initiation. And then the court can go on to the voluntariness analysis. The Edwards presumption of involuntariness imposes a high cost to the truthseeking function of a trial, to society's interest in having relevant evidence admitted at trial. And when the purpose of Edwards is not served, when a suspect understands that questioning will cease, that high cost is not justified."
