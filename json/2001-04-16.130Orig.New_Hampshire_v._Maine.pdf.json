The consent decree approved by this Court in 1977, according to New Hampshire at the time in a brief reproduced at 149a of New Hampshire's Appendix, that decree, quote, contains specific findings and rulings and sets forth the precise factual basis and legal principles upon which it, the decree, is founded, closed quote. Paragraph three of that decree sets forth the pertinent provision of the 1740 King's order, the, quote, middle of the river, closed quote, language. Paragraph four of that decree is a ruling or legal principle or finding that as used in the 1740 order, quote, middle of the river, closed quote, means, not surprisingly, middle of the Piscataqua River, middle river of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River."

If one looks at 2a, paragraph four, without reservation, gives meaning to the term, quote, middle of the river, closed quote, from the 1740 decree as the middle of the main navigational channel of the Piscataqua River. Paragraph five that I wanted to get to applies that principle to the river. It applies the principle by laying out a mile portion of the river from its mouth all the way up to Fishing Island. Of note, in the dissenting opinion written by Justice White, it's noted that Maine strongly objected to the proposed geographic midline of the special master because of the substantial areas that Maine would lose to New Hampshire in both the river and harbor and seaward thereof. Before this Court, Maine's Assistant Attorney General argued, and it's at 104 to 105a of New Hampshire's Appendix, that as much of an objection as Maine had to the effect of the geographic line with respect to losing territory off the coastline outside the harbor, Maine felt much more -- a much greater prejudice from the effects inside the harbor.

But you could deal with your motion and say, sure, we dismiss it because at least it isn't that the low-water mark of the Maine shore, and not decide whether it means the thalweg or the geographic middle of the river."

We'd still have to make that conclusion. And while we're making that conclusion, we may as well go the whole hog and accept what that decree said was, namely the middle of the channel of navigation, rather than the geographic middle.

      "speech": "Well, I think the other approach is illogical. I mean, there's no basis for saying that we can resolve this matter without deciding where it is in the River, because the only thing the decree says is that the line outward into the ocean depends upon the line inward in the harbor and in the river, and it then goes on to say, and that line is the middle of the navigation channel, so it seems to me if we buy into the binding effect of the decree, we buy into the middle of the navigation channel."

      "speech": "We agree, Your Honor. To the extent that there's a suggestion that New Hampshire had no reason or no incentive to press a claim to the shoreline back in the 1970s, that is simply wrong. Indeed, in response to the special master's report, New Hampshire filed exceptions seeking to move the middle of the river line three hundred and fifty feet closer to Maine's shore. If the shoreline boundary was correct, if they pressed it back then, the line would be moved not three hundred and fifty feet but over half a mile onto Maine's shoreline, obviously resulting in a substantial additional amount of territory being in New Hampshire rather than Maine. To the extent that there is the suggestion that the middle of the river could possibly mean the shoreline, that's defused by New Hampshire's own -- not only the decree on its face, paragraph four in particular and its application in paragraph five, but also with respect to New Hampshire's own pleadings at the time, own briefs, where at -- in a brief at 459a of Maine's Appendix, New Hampshire explained that when, quote, middle of the river, closed quote, must be interpreted, there are two possible interpretations -- thalweg or geographic middle. New Hampshire at the time did not identify Maine's shoreline as a possibility, because New Hampshire had the --"

      "speaker": "STERN",
      "speech": "That's what we have been saying, Your Honor. We are here on a complaint seeking to in effect that, quote, middle of the river, closed quote, does not mean the middle of the river, but it gets more peculiar because as a result of the decree in 1977, at least the first mile of the river is laid out as the middle of the river. New Hampshire appears to agree that once we get up to the head of tide near Salmon Falls, we jumped back into the middle of the river again, because apparently the 1740 decree describes the boundary up there as the middle of the Nuashanog. So the middle of the river means middle of the river at the mouth. Middle of the river means middle of the river at its head, but middle of the river does not mean middle of the river, according to New Hampshire, in the middle section of the River. It becomes even more peculiar, because it appears that New Hampshire concedes that virtually all, if not all, of the islands on Maine's side of the middle of the river, except the Shipyard Island, are in Maine. So it would have this jogging boundary with all of the islands except one in the State of Maine."

As I understand it, the special master said that the geological line, and this Court said, no, the parties have agreed on what middle of the river means, but it was -- one could say that agreement was for that controversy, and then all bets are off, and we're talking about a different portion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STERN",
      "speech": "We would disagree with that for a number of reasons. First, we've argued both claim and issue preclusion. And our view is because the transaction of the meaning and applicability of the 1740 King's decree was before the Court in the 1970s, in particular with respect to the location of the boundary in the river, New Hampshire is precluded from today coming in presenting a different theory as to the meaning and applicability of the 1740 decree."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "First, on claim preclusion, it isn't the same claim because it was one portion that was in contention in '77 and a different portion now, so I don't see how it could be claim preclusion. The dispute over lobster fishing is not dealing with the same land as the current case, is that right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STERN",
      "speech": "Not exactly, because back in the 1970s, as it has been explained previously, by necessity it was essential to determine the location of the boundary in the river and, in fact, the decree applied the principle to a portion of the river. But we understand, as is obvious by comparing the United States' brief and Maine's brief, that reasonable minds can differ as to whether we're talking about a claim or an issue. We believe the claim preclusion and issue preclusion are different paths that get to the same spot res judicata, but --"
    },
    {

If it is a, quote, consent decree, closed quote, and we would argue that this is not the type of consent decree described in, for example, International Building, because here this Court made an independent determination that the 1740 King's Order and not the proposed consent decree permanently fixed the boundary as the middle of the river. We would also suggest that looking at, in particular paragraph four of the 1977 decree, that that according to New Hampshire, as we've related, is a specific finding or ruling or legal principle with respect to the entire river because, in particular, in paragraph five, it was applied to a portion of the river. If there are no further questions now, I reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal."

But by terms of the consent decree, it also extended the line up into the harbor. This is the line that runs almost north-south that is marked here. That is -- that line is described in paragraph five of the consent decree. You notice it's a straight line, and the reason why it's a straight line is it follows the range of lights that mariners use to navigate up the channel, and that's why we call this the main channel of navigation. And you'll see it ends at a point where there is another line that crosses perpendicular almost east-west. That's another set of range lights where people who are navigating would follow as well, going further up the river. But the important point to recognize with regard to the consent decree is that it did define the channel as the middle of the river, as the middle of the main channel of navigation, and it extended that line up into the river to a considerable decree."

      "speech": "I think in actuality it is the channel that is in fact used by the ships. As Justice White pointed out in his dissent in No. 64 Original, the thalweg would normally follow the deepest channel or where the current is fastest, and so it would not necessarily be a straight line. But by the terms of the consent decree, and as the line that is drawn show in here, they compromised their meaning of the consent --their meaning of the 1740 Order by using where the ships actually travel."

They're very faintly marked, and they begin at, actually at Pierce's Island which is not marked here, but up north you see Seavey Island. The important point for purposes of the motion to dismiss is under any interpretation of the 1740 decree we think that New Hampshire's complaint must be dismissed."

If that is true, I can't understand how the Court could have simply invented -- certainly in 1740 they meant either the thalweg or the geographic center of the river. I mean -- I don't think anybody thought in 1740 they meant the usual channel of navigation. Did anybody say that?"

And second, that the parties are entitled to compromise their claim because this is a reasonable interpretation of the decree, not perhaps the only interpretation of the 1740 decree, but one that was permissible.

And of course boundaries are ambulatory, they move, and maybe the main channel of navigation is followed differently then as now. But for purposes of resolving this dispute, the Court accepted the parties' agreement that the range light line would be used to determine the main channel of navigation as to this settlement. We think that the Court's consent decree does preclude further litigation, at least to the extent that certainly the middle of the river is not on the low-water mark. And furthermore, we would argue that the main channel of navigation should be continued to be used to continue up the river. To do otherwise would provide a discontinuous line, and we do think the 1740 Order of the King ought to be interpreted in one way as we go from the mouth of the harbor up the river. Any other interpretation will lead to discontinuous lines the Court will have to connect. New Hampshire suggests that's all right, you simply use your equitable powers. We suggest that the better approach here is to read the consent decree as reasonably determining that the King's Order would have one meaning for purposes of the 1740 Order, and that should be applied consistently throughout the length of the river."

As to the line that was drawn, this Court noted in Arizona v. California, and it noted in United States v. International Building Company that if questions of law in fact are resolved in a consent judgment, those can be binding on the party. And we think it's reasonable to read this consent judgment as providing a single interpretation of middle of the river, it would apply henceforth to all applications of the 1740 decree. After all, this decree only affects these two states. It's reasonable for them to conclude, when they drew the boundary, that they were looking at one definition. And in fact, the text of the order suggests -- of the 1977 decree suggests that as well. It says what the word middle of the river means, not what it's meant to -- what it's deemed to mean for purposes of this case only. If the parties -- the parties were well- represented. And if the parties had intended that this case was only good -- that this ruling was only good for this stretch of the river, they would have clearly indicated that by the terms of the consent decree and they would have put the Court on notice that that's exactly what it was determining."

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start by framing what appears to be the central issue before the Court, and that issue is as follows: Maine and the United States argue that New Hampshire is bound by its position in the 1976 case concerning the meaning of the 1740 boundary decree. That case involved the determination of the State's lateral marine boundary that ran between the mouths of Portsmouth Harbor and Gosport Harbor. Now the boundary decree in question which was issued as an order in council in 1740, describes the boundary as follows, and I will paraphrase the description. The boundary passes up through the mouth of Piscataqua Harbor and up the middle of the river into the river Newichwannock and through the same to the furthest head and it divides the Isle of Shoals. In 1976 Maine and New Hampshire agreed that three phrases in the 1740 decree had relevance in determining the location of their lateral marine boundary, and those phrases were as follows. Phrase number one: The boundary passes up through the mouth of the harbor. Phrase two: It passes up the middle of the river. And phrase three, it divides the Isle of Shoals. Since that time, New Hampshire has determined for good historical reasons after a searching review of original records and maps that the phrase up the middle of the river has no relevance to determining the location of the boundary in the harbor and the tidal portions of the Piscataqua River. Maine and the United States claim that the stipulation in 1976 preludes New Hampshire from arguing in this case that that phrase, up the middle of the river, has no application to the location of the boundary in Portsmouth Harbor. New Hampshire contends that it isn't precluded from arguing that, because that phrase, up the middle of the river, was not essential to this Court's jurisdiction to enter judgment approving the consent decree. We say that it wasn't essential to the Court's jurisdiction and we say that if anything, it impeded this Court's ability to enter that Order."

And the Court could have entered the decree as a valid agreement of the parties establishing the location of the boundary simply by reference to the phrase in the 1740 decree that describes the boundary as passing up through the mouth of Piscataqua Harbor. And the point that I attempted to make before is that if anything, that was an impediment. The Court entered the decree despite that, not because of it, and the reason is is because there's no legal authority for using a modern ships' channel as a divisional principle in boundary cases. There are a number of boundary cases that do use ships' channel, but the ships' channel is always --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUDTKE",
      "speech": "And well -- that's why I think that the 1976 order issued by this Court does stand for the proposition that the States have broad latitude in coming to agreement as to the location of a boundary when the underlying boundary instrument is imprecise, and I think the second corollary of that is this Court need not adjudicate the actual true and correct historical meaning of the underlying decree in approving such an agreement of the parties. And I think later on in the Multistate Tax Commission that we've cited in our brief, in that case the Court explicitly cited this case as well as the Virginia v. Tennessee case for the proposition that an approval of an agreement relative to a boundary line didn't implicate the Commerce Clause when the underlying instrument was imprecise. So I think it goes to the point of whether this Court could have approved that consent agreement entered into between New Hampshire and Maine, had that stipulation not been there, regarding the meaning of the phrase middle of the river. And the answer to that has to be yes, and particularly for the reasons you state regarding the dissent that was raised, because there is no legal or historical authority for defining the term middle of the river as it was used in 1740 to mean a ships' channel marked by 1956 range lights that clearly was not located at the location of the thalweg."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I think the Court would be surprised to learn that the real disagreement between the majority and the dissent in the case was not over where the line was, but rather over whether you can accept the parties' stipulation or not. There is no indication in the writings as I recall it that that was the difference between the majority and the dissent. I think both the majority and the dissent understood that they had to be determining what the line was, giving some allowance to the parties' concessions, but that the Court had a responsibility to determine the line. Both opinions seem to indicate that, and you're telling us that the basic distinction is that the majority just thought that they had no responsibility to come to an independent determination. I just don't read the order that way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUDTKE",
      "speech": "Well, the consent decree that was approved stated specifically in the first paragraph that the master's decision is approved, and the master's recommendation provided for a line at the geographic middle. Then the dissent raised questions that it was not the thalweg -- no representation was made that it was the thalweg -- that it was a 1956 ship channel that was being used, and raised questions about the legal authority of those devices to determine a 1740 boundary. New Hampshire at oral argument told the Court this decision is arbitrary. It's based on administrative convenience, we want a straight boundary line. And the reason why that dogleg went up into the harbor instead of emerged from a closing line is that Maine insisted at that time that a closing line not be placed across the harbor so that it could take advantage of the reservation that this Court had allowed it in the United States v. Maine case to litigate the legal extent of its seaward boundaries. So this was not a case where the parties intended to negotiate or to conclude a boundary in the harbor. The dogleg portion of it was done to accommodate Maine's interests in reserving its right to litigate the question of the legal extent of its seaward boundaries. Moreover, as the State has submitted to the Court, the Solicitor General at that time was expressing grave concern regarding the question of whether this would implicate rights in the United States v. Maine case by establishing a ruling that colonial charters had a legal effect in determining boundaries in the marginal sea."

We do not think that that term is properly applied to the harbor boundary.

Now, you've read it closely and you say that this part of it wasn't actually at issue. Well, maybe that's true, but if we start reopening boundary decrees, it seems to me we're going to get into a lot of trouble because there may be a lot of boundary decrees among States that have parts that, if you really looked at them, they might not have been perfect or perfectly described. So why not just hold you to this, even though it was all done by mistake and with the best of intentions and so forth."

      "speech": "Your Honor, the issue wasn't actually adjudicated. The applicability of this phrase was an assumption that the parties brought to the negotiations, and the boundary was set out based upon those negotiations. There was no actual -- no actual adjudication of whether this phrase applied. The portion of the boundary at issue was not the harbor boundary. There is no intent to make this apply, that was clear. And I think that the most troublesome aspect, and that's why I addressed this question first, is whether this Court could have entered the consent decree in 1976 had the parties' stipulation pertaining to the meaning of the middle of the river not been there. And I think the Court could have entered it, because the boundary description describes the boundary as passing up through the mouth of Piscataqua Harbor, and it would have been reasonable, given that description of the boundary, for the parties to agree upon a location in the middle. But the point is is that neither the application nor the meaning of the phrase, up the middle of the river, was actually adjudicated in 1976."

      "speech": "The second one, which is the one that the dissent addressed, was where in the river was the boundary because depending upon where it was -- geographic middle, thalweg, or the Maine shoreline, it would determine how much territory was in each State. To suggest that New Hampshire didn't have the incentive to claim a shoreline on Maine's -- in Maine, I mean, borders on implausible because it would have resulted in hundreds if not thousands of additional acres of territory being in New Hampshire rather than Maine. You'll recall that New Hampshire filed special exceptions to the special master's report and argued to this Court that the boundary should be moved over a bit, three hundred and fifty feet in the middle of the river, to get some additional territory. A shoreline boundary would have increased that manyfold, so New Hampshire had the incentive to press a claim to the shoreline boundary. The notion that we can suggest today that the Attorneys General in the 1970s didn't know anything -- didn't know what we know today -- is exactly why we have res judicata. The circus of what we almost would have to do is bring those folk back in and cross-examining them is why we have res judicata. New Hampshire had the opportunity to press a shoreline boundary, which had all the incentive and the fair opportunity to do in the 1970s. Its failure to do so precludes it from doing so now. And the reason we have these specific findings, rulings and legal principles according to New Hampshire, as they explained in the 1970s, was to avoid the Vermont v. New York problem where there was a decree without findings, without an adjudication of any issues. Because of that concern that this decree might not be approved, these specific findings and rulings and legal principles were laid out here, and they are made without reservation. And getting back to Justice Breyer's questions, paragraph five, if we can read the line, says, quote, the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River, commencing in the vicinity of Fort Point and Fishing Island, closed quote. It's an effort, maybe not an exact effort, but it's an effort to lay out the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River. There may have been reasons to have it as a straight line in that channel, but it is an effort."
