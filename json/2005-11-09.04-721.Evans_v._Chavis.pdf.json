It adopted a rule that frustrates Congress's intent to protect Federal Courts from hearing stale claims and to respect the finality of State Court convictions. It does so by improperly and arbitrarily adopting a conclusive presumption that misunderstands or ignores State law and practice. And it is inconsistent with this Court's decision in Carey versus Saffold. If the Federal Courts, on the other hand, complete their analysis of the Federal question of tolling the AEDPA statute of limitations by deciding whether a State petition was timely before granting tolling, it can properly dismiss more Federal petitions on statute-of-limitations grounds and can avoid litigating stale claims on the merits. Any difficulties in doing so can be ameliorated by the limited nature of the State-law inquiry and adoption of a 60-day presumption of timeliness."

So, they look at how long the prisoner proceeded from conviction to their court, as a whole.

And the problem that's presented by this case is one of Federal line-drawing. And it presents serious federalism, comity, and fairness concerns. And if we could step back from the facts of this case for a moment -- and I will discuss them -- I think it -- I hope, at least, it will become clear that the Ninth Circuit, in light of what it's dealing with in California, adopted the only sensible rule. So, the place to begin in answering some of your questions, Justice Breyer, is with California's timeliness standards. And to give some background, I would start with the principle that was articulated in the Warden's brief and that the California Supreme Court has articulated, which is that California does enforce its timeliness standards. It's usually done by -- in the summary-denial context, by citing to In re Swain or In re Robbins --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRIS",
      "speech": "Okay. The standards are that a prisoner must file within a reasonable time. And that requires a two-part inquiry, Justice O'Connor. The first part is, Was there substantial delay? It's determined based upon a set standard, when the delay begins. But California's never articulated any standards for what period of time constitutes \"substantial.\" That's the first problem. It's essentially an ad hoc determination that's made by individual California Courts. And that's why former Justice Brown described that as \"an abstraction,\" and former Justice Moss described it as \"vague and indeterminate at its very core.\" But that's what the Ninth Circuit is dealing with when it reviews these cases. So, to put it context for a moment, the way the State Courts do enforce this on a case-by-case basis, to be practical, is, the State Supreme Court often summarily dismisses cases on procedural bars, including timeliness. And, to give you some statistics from the Warden's brief, in 2004 there were 1,223 unexplained summary denials -- in other words, just denied -- and there were 1,174 denials with a citation to a case. And this is significant, because this means that, in about half of the cases in 2004 that went to the California Supreme Court, they enforced one of their procedural bars, and, in many of them, it was timeliness."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
      "speech": "So, the difficulty of looking to that, which may be a good difficulty -- I mean, that is a serious problem, but I thought what we wrote in the case -- see, there are two problems here. First, which was bothering me, had to do with our Court's relation to the Ninth Circuit, which may be simple and -- as far as legally is concerned -- but I'm not sure about it. The other, which is much more interesting, is what you're talking about. All right, now, on the first one, I read the words. It says the words \"on the merits.\" The Ninth Circuit thought those three words meant that the California Supreme Court could not have considered the petition too late, for, after all, it decided it on the merits, just as with the cite. Now, whether these words are right or wrong that follow, that's what we wrote. The next words were, \"There are many plausible answers to this question.\" Sometimes, a court addresses the merits of a claim that it thought was presented in an untimely way. Why? Because they don't present any difficulty, and the timeliness issue does, or because it wants to give the reviewing court alternative grounds for decision, or maybe it just wants to show the prisoner we thought about the claim on the merits. He, after all, doesn't have a lawyer. He gets a postcard. That helps him. So, there are a lot of reasons. And it says, \"Conclusion.\" Given the variety of reasons why they might have put the words \"on the merits,\" the fact that they are there, those words cannot, by themselves, show that the petition was timely. So, then I read what they wrote. What they wrote is, \"When the California Court denies a habeas petition without comment or citation, we have long treated the denial as a decision on the merits.\" Okay? And then it cites a pre-Carey case. \"Therefore, the summary denial was on the merits, and the petition was not dismissed as untimely,\" citing two pre-Carey cases. Now, I don't see how, since I just said the words \"on the merits do not end the issue\" -- here, the words weren't even there, but they say, \"We're treating it as if they were, and that ends the issue.\" So, what do we do about that? Then the next question, once I figure that one out, is, What do we do about the issue you're raising, which is quite important and interesting and so forth?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRIS",
      "speech": "Okay. Well, as to the first question, the explanation that you just provided clearly requires the Federal Courts, when there's some indication from the State Court that it might have been untimely, to look into it. And that was the very problem with what the Ninth Circuit did in that case. It said \"on the merits and for lack of diligence.\" So, to presume that that was just on the merits, that's flatly wrong. You'd need to do some further investigation. In light of the context of what's happening in California, however, when the State Court says nothing, there has to be some process by which the Federal Court can make a decision as to what that means, because if, in fact, in that case it was denied on the merits and the State Court thought it was timely, it would be extremely invasive for the Federal Court to re-review the case, potentially come to a different conclusion, and, we would suggest, dramatically alter the landscape of how prisoners exhaust their remedies in California, because now you're developing a Federal body of law that may be very different in deciding what's substantial and what's reasonable than California did. And so, what the Ninth Circuit, I believe, did in this case was look to context and come up with the presumption that was most reasonable in light of what's going on. So, the first thing that is relevant, from a --"

And that illustrates the very problem with this case, which is that in cases where there is 90 days, 2 months, 4 months, the very difficult questions that a Federal Court would normally look to State law, if it was determinant, to apply, California is giving no guidance. And our case falls within that once you look to the particular explanations that our client put forward. And so, we would suggest that if there is a concern on the part of the Court about certain cases getting through and essentially allowing prisoners to abuse the writ, that this Court will use its equitable discretion to look at individual cases and to decide, \"Hey, is this a situation where the behavior is dilatory? Is this a situation where the behavior is abusive?\" And that would restrict the number of cases where Federal Courts would need to engage in a factual inquiry. The alternative is adopting a presumption, that the Attorney General suggested, that the California Courts have flatly rejected. That presumption has been adopted -- has been imported from the direct-appeal context. It has no significance in California habeas law. In the direct-appeal context, prisoners have the right to counsel. In the habeas context, they don't, except in capital cases. And, unsurprisingly -- pardon me -- unsurprisingly, the California Supreme Court has adopted a presumption of 90 days, in the capital context. So, in the -- in the noncapital cases, like my client's, where individuals have no incentive to delay -- my client has been up for parole twice already, he has no incentive to delay the habeas process -- and where people like Mr. Chavis think that they're, in good faith, complying -- and it's not just an issue of excuse -- and this goes back to a -- to a question that Justice O'Connor asked earlier -- there are specific policy reasons why the State of California has adopted the standard that it has.

You might lose under this, but it -- see, so you say -- look, in every other State, the time for appealing from an appeals court to the State Supreme Court, asking them, is 20 days, normally, or sometimes 30. So, if the Ninth Circuit gets a case in which it was longer than 30 days, then, irrespective of whether they say \"on the merits,\" whether they cite a case, whether they don't say anything and just have a postcard, what the Ninth Circuit should assume that they've done is consider it untimely, in the absence of the kind of excuse that the California Courts might accept as an excuse. So, then they'll look into that. And if California, in the future, wants something different -- which I'd be surprised -- they will say that their system means that a 3-year delay, or whatever it is, is actually timely. But, in the absence of some reason to think that, why not use the words, which would give you a chance to go back, and you could say, \"This is not a case of total lack of excuse. There is excuse of the kind that California would accept.\""

The very nature of a conclusive presumption is that sometimes there will be cases that don't fit the presumption. But, on this record, and on anything I've seen from my review of California procedure, there's nothing to suggest that a -- the Federal interest in avoiding substantial delays is compromised by the specific rule that the Ninth Circuit has adopted.

So, I would restrict your characterization to the fact that California is not saying something in some cases. Now, because the Federal statute necessarily imports a State standard, that's the very problem with the statute. I can conceive of many instances where --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRIS",
      "speech": "That's true, Mr. Chief Justice. But if you took that to its logical conclusion, then, when State Courts made errors -- they didn't see that a case was properly filed, they just missed it -- the Federal Court would go in and review. Or in a case where they did claim the reverse, the Federal Court could say, \"No, there was clear error.\" But this Court has rejected that in Saffold. It's rejected it in Pace. And -- because that is informed by the very view that the tolling provision was included to encourage one round of State exhaustion free of Federal interference."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRIS",
      "speech": "Well, I would be lying, Justice Breyer, if I didn't say that I haven't thought about that. And the problem is that the rule announced in Saffold isn't the right rule. It's trying to deal with a problem that's been created by the California State Courts. And so, the solution that the Ninth Circuit has adopted -- that's our proposal. We essentially think that it has a minimal harm to Federal interests, because maybe certain cases will get in that Congress didn't intend, but if you don't adopt it, there's no alternative. You can't certify the question. In California, you can't certify to the Court of Appeal. You can't certify from a District Court. So, if the California State Courts aren't going to change, it's not incumbent upon this Court to read the statute differently than the proper interpretation. And I concede the arguments that were made in the dissenting opinion in Saffold are very interesting, and they don't compel, in my opinion, a different interpretation of the statute; they recognize the difficulty that the statute presents. And it presents that difficulty because it does incorporate, in some measure, a State standard, and because there's one State out there, California, that's doing something that's very difficult to deal with."

I'm not going to get up here and suggest that there's no risk to a conclusive presumption that some cases are going to make it into Federal Court that Congress didn't intend. But it's a balancing that's inherent in the notion of federalism. There is a risk that, by not reviewing clear statements by the California State Court, that cases get in that shouldn't. A case could not have been properly filed, and the State Court didn't find it. But, in Saffold and in Pace, this Court announced the principle that once the State Court decides, that's the end of the matter. And I guess, in summation, what I suggest is that atmospherically this case presents a difficult problem. The Ninth Circuit is involved. There is a five-four decision in Saffold. We recognize those things. However, there is no easy solution. The Ninth Circuit has adopted a rule that balances the very interest in federalism that the tolling provision was intended to preserve, and there's no suggestion that some corresponding Federal interest is compromised. And, in fact, if the Federal Courts are required to review these cases, they'll be required to do it in 60 days, in 70 days, in 80 days, and, if they make a mistake, and they find a case to be untimely that the California Court didn't, will deprive first Federal habeas, one Congress didn't intend.
