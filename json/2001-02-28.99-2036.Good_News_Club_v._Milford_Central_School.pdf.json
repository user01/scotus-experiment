On page 13 of its brief in opposition to certiorari, Milford concedes that State law, the same State law at issue in Lamb's Chapel, requires it to censor petitioner's speech from its broad community forums at all times, to all audiences because they had a religious purpose. This Court rejected such an argument in Lamb's Chapel. It should reject it in this case as well. The Second Circuit circumvented this Court's decision in Lamb's Chapel by resurrecting a distinction that this Court buried in Widmar. A distinction between constitutionally-protected speech and unconstitutionally-protected religious worship and instruction."

      "speaker": "MARCELLE",
      "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, I'll give you two answers to your inquiry. One, I think this is like Widmar. For example, in Widmar would essentially be the cornerstone group which was the student group that sought access to the school was a religious group singing religious songs, reading the Bible and praying, and this Court didn't find a constitutional problem in that case because it was --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "The age of the, the -- that played some role in the Court's decision, didn't it? That these were college students who had a degree of sophistication and could distinguish between just opening it up to everybody, and the school endorsing it?"

    {
      "speaker": "MARCELLE",
      "speech": "That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. And in this case, in Widmar, the appropriate community was the students so you would look at the observer student, but in this case, Milford has ended school and has opened up a community forum for parents to initiate and parents to run these community groups."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I'm sorry. Isn't the nub of the problem in this case that you're not dealing with college students, you're dealing with grade school kids, kids from, I think it was ages starting at six going up to 12. You're doing it -- in this particular case, the meeting was being held immediately after the school and the meeting sounds to me as it was described as Sunday school. They pray. They sing sort of children's religious songs, and they have a teaching lesson and I guess some discussion, but it sounds like Sunday school, and isn't the problem in this case that you don't have a sophisticated group of people of college age who know that the university is not proselytizing them or approving of their particular religious practice, whereas in this case you have a bunch of kids who just don't make those kinds of distinctions, and isn't that the nub of the establishment clause problem here, which didn't exist in Widmar?"
    },

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, that, that might be the case, and it might be the case that you would have a different case before us if those were your facts, but whether State law would prohibit it or not, my question is, don't we have here at least a substantial, I won't decide it from the bench, but don't we have a substantial establishment clause issue, which we simply didn't have in Widmar so that you can't take Widmar as being direct authority for what was going on here?"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

We might have done it for some other reason, do we normally remand to give him a second bite? Aren't they stuck with the reason that they gave?"

It really isn't that, the history in New York law is a little more entangled. The State legislature had opened up it for these broad purposes if the school board so chose. In 1978, there was a mid level appellate court in the State that was decided prior to Murgens that said because the State legislature didn't specifically include religious purposes in the statute, the court interpreted as it meant to exclude religious purposes, although the State doesn't, the statute doesn't say that, that has become part of the judicial interpretation of the statute, so I don't want to mislead you and it's contained in the statute, Justice Stevens."

If you win this case, and the school board says we want to revamp our regulations, and our regulations are going to be that although religious purposes do not exclude a group from, from use of the facilities, religious worship does, and we are going to draw the line there, or they might say we are going to draw the line against any use that could be regarded reasonably as an establishment clause violation when young kids are involved. Would you take the position then that because you think the, the New York statute is unconstitutional that the school district could not draw that restriction or either of those restrictions that I have just described, and which if the statute is unconstitutional does it render the school district in fact, in this respect, does it render the school district incapable of drawing any distinction whatever that has any reference to religion?"

      "speaker": "MARCELLE",

If I say ha ha, I'm allowed in the forum, but if I say amen, I'm excluded and it seems to me what makes one worship and the other not worship is my internal attitude."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No. But -- is, you are saying that the State cannot exclude what's going on -- that the district could not exclude what's going on here. But is it because the statute is itself unconstitutional in drawing a religious distinction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARCELLE",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Okay. No. I don't, I don't mean to cut you off, but I just wonder, you answered Justice O'Connor's question, as I recall, by saying yes, the State could go back and revamp the policy and draw it more narrowly, and I understood you to say, or to imply that if it wanted to draw a policy that says no religious worship involving young kids or something like that, that, that would be open to it and I want to know whether your position on the statute leads you to say no, the school district would not be, even without State, would be without State authority under State law even to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARCELLE",
      "speech": "My position is that the First Amendment prohibits drawing that distinction, if that, whatever you called the worship fits within the otherwise religious neutral boundaries of the forum. So, for example --"
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But is that because the State statute is simply inoperative to give the school districts the authority to redraw a policy more narrowly?"

That's open for us to say, so if we said, that would certainly foreclose the line of questioning that, the suggestions that Justice Souter is making about further lawsuits."

This is a broad community forum, and parents, it would seem to me the establishment clause was crafted to defend the rights of the religious people to participate in broad community forums and to exclude Andrea Fournier from a forum because of her religion would seem to be the very value that the establishment clause was, was crafted to defend, so if she wears her daisy scout uniform, for example, she is okay to come in, but if she wears her Good News Club uniform, she is not. And it, I think not only the free speech clause protects her right to meet under those circumstances, but not to be excluded from a broad community forum and the parents not to be excluded from the broad community forum also is protected by the establishment."

You are saying that if you win this case based upon the ground that the exclusion broadly of religious viewpoints is unconstitutional, is it your position that if they then redraw the policy more narrowly and say we are going to exclude Sunday school type of meetings held on the school grounds immediately after school, is it your position that they would be foreclosed by the judgment of this Court in this case from doing that?"

And now my question is, why isn't that contrary to the Constitution? It's after school. It's not a school activity. And it doesn't help me to talk about open forums or not open forums or whatever. I want, I want to know what, what the principle is, what the theory is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "speech": "Well, the theory is, Justice Breyer, that we have set limits to exclude on a reasonable basis certain activities from occurring in the school. Just as we exclude partisan political activities. We exclude commercial activities. And we exclude various other activities, the school system has made a decision that it wanted to exclude this activity from its forum. Now, consistent with a decision, for example, in Cornelius vs. NAACP, where the issue of partisan political speech was excluded from a limited open forum. We have acted similarly in this circumstance. Because of concern about some of these establishments."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well that -- yes, but as I understand it, as it has been represented to us, that wasn't the basis for the school district's exclusion here. The basis, as I understand it, was what you just told Justice Breyer a moment ago, that the district had chosen to exclude religious discussion from those which were, were open. And that's, that's a very different criterion from saying, we're excluding the use of the facilities just for religious worship. Which was it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "speech": "Well, Justice Souter, I think perhaps the actions of the school district have been somewhat mischaracterized. I believe that there is a letter in the record from the superintendent that had indicated precisely what they were excluding, and the letter from the superintendent to the Reverend indicated that uses consistent with Lamb's Chapel would be permitted, but that religious worship would be excluded under the description of this forum. So it was not excluded because of a viewpoint. It was excluded because the entire subject matter of religious worship was excluded from the forum."

      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "speech": "Justice -- Justice Souter, we advanced both. For example, an examination of our answer would reveal that we raised the establishment clause as an affirmative defense. But I believe it's the next to the last page of the district court opinion, and I could find it if the Court wishes. The district court, for example, concluded that because we had found that the limited open forum was properly created and properly limited, it did not need to reach our establishment clause arguments or the establishment clause issue."

What we are concerned about is, is that there may be religious groups that do not have a substantial representation in this small town community, and that the majority religion, such as Reverend Fournier represented would be able to run a Good News Club, but the other groups that didn't have the numbers or the personnel couldn't run a similar club, and that would show a favoritism to this particular club."

We have also relied, to some extent, upon the mandate of State law that the school is bound to follow, and may I point out, please, that in the complaint there is no challenge to the constitutionality of section 414 of the education law. That relief was not asked for at the district court, it was not asked for at the court of appeals, and it is not, in my judgment, at least from what I read in the complaint, it is not before this Court."

      "speech": "If the Court -- if it would please the Court, I have two quick points to make on rebuttal. First, I believe there is a slight misstatement of the record. At the cert petition, appendix H, page 6, it describes Milford School as a housing -- building of both elementary, junior high, and high school. The school building contains grades K-12, not just elementary school. Second, with respect to the Equal Access Act, I believe Justice Scalia is right, it is only a mandate that Congress passed it. If a high school did certain things, they would have to allow certain other high school groups. There is nothing in the statute that makes it a prohibition to it, even in the absence of the law, to allow other groups."

To take the opponent's point on the establishment clause, suppose the city hall says every Sunday we can use the city hall as a church, we'll let church groups use it. So every Sunday the city hall becomes a church. Does that violate the establishment clause?"

I believe as long as the forum is open, the -- and the State is neutral, that a reasonable observer would be aware of the policy and the history and the context of the situation and wouldn't view that the State was endorsing the religious ceremony, but, rather, the adherents who chose to avail themselves of the forum, the endorsement belongs really to the people who attend and not be accredited to the State as long as the State didn't really encourage or promote or recognize the --"
