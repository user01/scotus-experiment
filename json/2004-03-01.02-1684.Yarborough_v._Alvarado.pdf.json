  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For nearly 4 decades, the ultimate inquiry as to whether a person is in custody is whether there is formal arrest or restraint in freedom of movement to the degree associated with formal arrest. The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the State court had identified the correct legal standard for determining custody, that no Supreme Court case had addressed whether age and experience needed to be considered for that determination, and that it was borrowing legal principles from another area of jurisprudence. Yet, it held that it was objectively unreasonable for the State court to have abstained from innovating such a new role. This case illustrates why Federal habeas relief cannot be granted under 28 U.S.C., section 2254(d), when a State court decision does not extend Supreme Court precedent to a new context. Such relief is incompatible with the provisions of section 2254(d) for three reasons. First, to require a State court to extrapolate Supreme Court precedents from the voluntariness context to the custody context cannot be fairly characterized as applying this Court's custody precedents."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Ms. Chuang, there are two questions presented in the petition for certiorari. One is what I took it to be -- is the rule that the Ninth Circuit announced correct under our precedents, and the second, under AEDPA, was it objectively unreasonable for the State court to rule otherwise. Are you going to address both those questions?"

And third, to say that an extension of Supreme Court precedent to a new context is clearly established law would define clearly established at such a high --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But how is it a new context? I mean, the -- the rule was how a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation. So is it new to say you -- I mean, it might be new if in fact there was blind person and the agent who was holding him wrote on a note, you are free to leave. You know, he can't read it. Now, would you need a new, special Supreme Court case to say that's ridiculous?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, we haven't considered blind people either. We haven't considered deaf people whom someone might whisper, you're free to go. I mean, the point is it's so obvious that -- that being a child or a juvenile would make a difference, that you don't have to write it in all the cases. So my question is, why isn't that obvious?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, I don't believe that a 6-year-old -- that age and experience should be considered because the test -- the ultimate inquiry is whether there is a formal arrest or restraint in freedom of movement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but that depends upon what a reasonable person in the circumstances would understand to be his situation whether a reasonable person would believe he was being detained. Isn't that the test? So, I mean, it doesn't -- it doesn't help to simply say that, you know, the question is whether there's an arrest. Yes, there is. That is the question. But our standard for whether there has been an arrest is what would a reasonable person believe. Would he believe he was arrested? Which gets you right back into the determination of what a person would believe. Now, would we take into account the fact that somebody is 6 years old?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "We don't deny that a 6-year-old would certainly be more vulnerable to overall coercion. Yet, that is -- overall coercion is addressed by the voluntariness test and really the custody question is only concerned with one aspect of coercion and that is custody. And to --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why -- why isn't it? Look, I'm not -- I guess let me try again because I can understand you'd say there's only 6 months difference here. So in this case, being a juvenile didn't matter. But that's not what you're talking about. You're talking about the standard that says the nature of a person as a child or an adult is something that can make a difference. All right? To custody. You agreed being blind could make a difference to custody. You agree being deaf could make a difference to custody. Why can't being a child in principle make a difference to custody? That's the question. And it has only to do with whether the first part of your argument, not the second."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I suppose that a blind person, if you hand the blind person a note saying, you are free to leave, would not -- you could not use that note as an indication that he was free to leave. You couldn't use that as a circumstance to show that he was free to leave."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, isn't what you're objecting to in the Ninth Circuit's decision the idea that there is some sort of a bright line cutoff date when the person turns 18? You don't deny that a person 6 -- 6 years old would be treated differently than a 17-year-old, I suppose, for determining the objective test."

But then again, that might not mean that he could use it to show that he was in custody as well."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let -- let me ask you about two facts in -- in this particular case. The first one is this. And correct me if I'm wrong. I think I'm right on these. When the -- when the sheriff's department wanted to question this -- this young man, they went to his parents and the parents said, in effect, yes, we will -- we will bring him down or take him down with us, and they took him to the station, so that as I understand it, the sheriff's department didn't ask him to make a choice as to whether they would go down to the headquarters and talk with him. The parents did that. The second fact I want you to comment on is that when they got down there, the parents said, in the boy's hearing, can't we go in with him or can we go in with him? They -- they made it clear that they would like to go into this interrogation. And the deputy sheriff said no, kept them out. The sheriff and the boy disappeared. Are those two facts relevant in making the determination of whether he would reasonably understand that he was being under -- held under conditions equivalent to a formal arrest?"

    "speaker": "CHUANG",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "Because once -- again, if his -- if his parents were asked for permission to interview, the detective had asked the parents for permission to interview him, and his parents said yes, the meaning of that question was that he could have said no, and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Wait a minute. You just lost me. How -- how is it that he could have said no?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "He could have refused to have submitted to the interview, and there's no indication in the record --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but he -- but he -- he didn't. His parents said, yes, you can interview him. We will bring him down, and the boy came along. That's all we know."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. That's -- that's what we know."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And why is that? And that is irrelevant you say because the boy might have said, well, I won't go?"
  },

    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "That -- yes, Your Honor. It's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You don't know whether he would have felt free to say that or not, do you? Do we have anything in the record on that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "There's no indication one way or the other. But there was no indication that he was not voluntarily being interviewed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, there is an indication. I -- I mean, that's what I'm trying to get at. The -- the indication is that he was taken down to the station house by his parents. He didn't make the choice. And when they got down there, the parents, who wanted to be present during the interrogation, were told that they couldn't. The -- the -- it seems to me that the objective appearance of -- of these two facts is, number one, the boy appears to be under the control of his parents and his parents appear to be under the control of the sheriff's department when they get down to headquarters. And on those two facts, I would think it would be difficult -- standing alone, those two facts, it would be difficult to infer that this boy would have felt that he was free to turn around and -- and walk out of the interview and leave. And -- and I don't understand why those facts are not relevant."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- there's no indication, though, that he was at the station involuntarily. Certainly he came with his parents, but --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, the indication is that his parents brought him. That's all we know."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, Mr. Alvarado -- it indicated in the record that Mr. Alvarado lived at home with his parents and that he did not have a car."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "He's a minor, isn't he?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "He has to go where his parents tell him to, doesn't he? Isn't that what being in the status of -- of a minor means, that if your parents tell you stay at home, you're grounded, you're grounded? Isn't that essentially the disability of being a minor? So I guess maybe the proper inquiry is whether his parents thought that they could let him leave if they wanted to. Either that's the proper inquiry or perhaps no minor can be interrogated in -- in a police station because it always requires the consent of the parents, and when the parents tells him, you know, you go be interrogated, he thinks he can't leave. It's a terrible problem, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe that custody by -- custody in the sense of a parental and juvenile situation is not the same as custody as you are under formal arrest or restrained in freedom of movement to the same degree --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, then that's the whole point. That's why I think Justice Souter asked that question, saying, look, you're -- you're used to your parents telling you what to do and maybe even sometimes you do it. All right? (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So the parents bring them down -- bring him down. He doesn't think he has any choice. He then asks Ms. Comstock, I guess, who was the arresting officer that brought him in there, can I take my parents in this room. The parents say we want to go in the room. And the policewoman -- I think it was a woman, wasn't it? I think she said no. And they, who desperately -- or certainly want to get into the room, can't. So he's sitting there and that, together with all the other things that are going on -- and there are quite a few -- would lead a reasonable person, who's used to being under the -- the rule of his parents, to think, my goodness, this police woman controls the situation. Of course, I have to do what she says, and of course, I can't leave until, as she said, I've finished answering the question and she can -- tells me I can leave. I'm in custody. Now, maybe an adult wouldn't be thinking that. Maybe he would. But that's a reasonable question. But our standard here is, you know, not whether they were right in the State but whether they were reasonable. But a juvenile certainly would be thinking that. That's -- that's I think what the point is. Now, I'd like to hear sort of a full-blown response to that."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I mean, not just yes or no. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. A juvenile -- unless the Court is willing to say that the parents in this case operated as agents of law enforcement by bringing him into the sheriff's station and that when the officer -- the detective had asked him if he -- if the parents would give permission, that somehow that really wasn't an option that the detective was giving, Mr. Alvarado was not in custody."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What I -- what I can't understand -- and this was Justice Souter's question. Forget how these factors play out one way or the other. Are these factors -- the circumstance that the parents brought the juvenile to the station; two, that the parents wanted to go in or asked someone -- asked to go in and they couldn't -- are those objective factors that the Court can consider in the custody determination?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, because --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHUANG",
    "speech": "Because as this Court alluded to in Colorado v. Connolly what the Fifth Amendment is concerned with is government coercion, and to the extent that the parents brought Mr. Alvarado to the station, that is not government coercion. And as far as the parents not being allowed in the interview room, there -- Mr. Alvarado actually did not present any evidence that his parents were not permitted into the interview room. And indeed, the interview room door was open, as indicated at joint appendix page 150."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, would yo just correct me on the facts? I thought the -- the record indicated that the parents had asked to go in, and as Justice Breyer pointed out, that in fact the boy at one point said, you know, do I have to go alone? Isn't anybody coming with me? Are -- are -- is there testimony to that effect in the record?"
  },

    "speaker": "CHUANG",

While this Court did mention age in the Kaupp case, which was cited by Mr. Alvarado, it's uncertain to what degree age actually was relevant for the seizure question, whether a person felt free to leave. A better reading of Kaupp is that it was -- the Court may have mentioned the Mr. -- the age of the defendant in that case for the voluntariness of accompanying the officers to the station, as this Court indicated with a citation of Royer v. -- Royer and also Schneckloth. Both of those cases indicate that age does go to the voluntariness of consenting to go with officers.

Now, you said, no, that isn't the right way. Then what is the right way?"

They have to take into consideration that when you hand them a written notice, they're not going to see it, just as though -- just as if you whispered it to them in a voice too low for them to hear. The basic point is that you didn't communicate anything to them. And our objection to the Ninth Circuit's standard is they're trying to make you view the entire world through the viewpoint of a reasonable juvenile, which means that we're not talking about whether or not the person was unable to leave the room when they wanted to because they couldn't reach the doorknob because they  were short. The point is that we're trying to infer something about the way they view the entire world because they're a juvenile. Because they're a juvenile, they're more likely to be submissive to authority. Because they're a juvenile, they're more likely to feel that -- that anything that the police officer says is a command. And I think that it's very different to adopt a whole different world view thing versus simply asking police officers to take notice of things that are objectively very plain or rather observable and very plain, such as a blind person cannot see the warning that you give him. And I think that that is the basic difference between what is permissible under the reasonable person test, as it has always been applied, and the Ninth Circuit's innovation of it. Now --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "On -- on your view of this case, is it -- suppose we say, all right, reasonable person doesn't mean 16. Could -- would a remand be appropriate to view the totality of the circumstances and see if they add up to in custody using the reasonable person standard?"

  {
    "speaker": "ELWOOD",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, I think that a remand isn't necessary because I think that what the State court of appeals did is approximately right, or at least it's within the range of reason. So, no, I don't think  that you would need to do that. Now, if I could get back to one -- one of the questions that Justice Scalia asked, which was do we apply the same standard for a 6-year-old. And although it may seem kind of intuitively wrong, yes, we would apply the same reasonable person standard that we would to anybody else, with the point being that it's a very difficult thing to require police officers not only to know that a 6-year-old is more vulnerable, but also to know exactly where along the continuum of custody versus non-custody that -- that puts them because they have to take themselves out of their reasonable person mind-set that they're used to applying and figure out how it applies differently here. And I think that it doesn't make a lot of sense to develop this whole different kind of sideline to the normal Miranda reasonable person test for 6-year-olds because the very factors that would make them more likely to view themselves to be in custody would also make them less likely to be able to use these Miranda rules if they were actually -- Miranda rights if they were given them. If -- if a -- if a 6-year-old is going to feel too submissive to authority, it doesn't make a lot of sense to apply a lower custody threshold if then he's not going to be able to take advantage of it."

We have to have a rule that is workable for police officers with respect to 17-year- olds and people who are 17 years and 7 months and 18 years and 1 month. And when you -- when you can say with some certainty that a 6-year-old is going to be feeling more vulnerable, but you can't say with a lot of certainty that an average 16-year-old is going to be feeling more vulnerable than an average 18-year-old, and if so, by how much. So that, for example, they know that when they say --"
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ELWOOD",
    "speech": "Justice -- Justice Stevens, our point is that it's not relevant because the law says it's not relevant, that the police officer -- all they're accountable for is the way a reasonable person would view the circumstances, and they shouldn't be required to figure out -- get inside the head of a reasonable 16- year-old, a reasonable 15-year-old. They just have to apply one reasonable person standard to the circumstances that are before them."

There was some contention about whether Mr. Alvarado, Michael, was referred to as a suspect. That can be found in the joint appendix, page 189. That was argument of trial counsel during the motion to suppress. It was not disputed at that point. It hasn't been disputed until now. But I would assert that in addition to that, even if he had not heard another officer refer to him as a suspect, it was obvious by Detective Comstock's word and deed to him during the interrogation that he -- he indeed was a suspect.

Stansbury found that anytime that it's communicated to a suspect by word or deed that he is a suspect, that that goes into the totality of the circumstances of whether that person would reasonably feel free to leave. Secondly, I would like -- well, one more thing on the facts. The fact that Michael said, can't somebody come in here with me, is found at the joint appendix, page 185. That's also trial counsel's argument at the motion to suppress that was not disputed until now. But next I would like to -- to move to this idea of this being a new context. Miranda is the son of voluntariness and coercion. This Court found in 1948 in Haley v. Ohio that juveniles in general are more susceptible to police coercion than adults."

It follows --"

They are not contesting that -- that you cannot get in the age of the -- of the individual when it comes to deciding whether the confession was voluntary or not. They -- they agree that you can for that. But just for the question of whether the person was in custody and therefore has to be given a Miranda warning. It seems to me strange to say that you take into account for that purpose the age of the individual even though you don't take it into account for the purpose of whether he can understand -- can get any benefit out of the Miranda warning at all. You recite a -- a Miranda warning to a 6-year-old. It's not going to mean anything to him."

Or maybe they didn't mention it because the lawyers then didn't make that much of an issue of it. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why, when I write an opinion, I don't mention things.

That's a cumulative totality of the circumstances test. The California court did not look at the factors together cumulatively. They took two factors to distinguish this case, neither of which was proper: one, that the police did not tell him affirmatively that he could not leave until he told the truth, which would be a finding of custody straight off. You would never even get to the totality test. And two, that the tactics weren't intense and aggressive enough to prove coercion. And as this case said in Kaupp, interestingly, just as you can't require the perversity of resisting arrest to prove coercion, here you can't require the perversity of -- of this being coercive to prove custody. You can't use a -- say that the -- the police had to have enlisted intense and aggressive tactics in order for this to be custody. That's not even part of the custody determination. There are things like location. Here it was at a police station. Who initiated the contact. Here it was initiated by the detective. Whether the defendant voluntarily came. Here he was brought by his parents at the behest of the detective. Whether he was informed that he was not under arrest. Not only was he not informed of that, he wasn't given anything to sign to say the interview was voluntarily -- voluntary. The length of the interview. He was interrogated for over 2 hours. The familiarity of the surroundings. And this is where his inexperience may go into a -- a circumstances test. He had never been in a police station or an interrogation room. And whether it was communicated to him that he was a suspect, which it was certainly by Comstock --"

    "speech": "You're -- you're not meeting their argument, though. Their argument is it doesn't matter that although voluntariness of the confession later on is indeed a subjective inquiry, was it really voluntary on the part of this person, custody or not, is not a subjective inquiry. It is purely objective. Was this person in custody or not in custody? And their argument is that determination is to be made from the standpoint of what a reasonable adult would -- would deduce from the situation. It is objective. It has nothing to do with the subjective feelings of the particular individual, whether because he's too young or because he's -- he's mentally not -- not competent or anything else. It is an objective determination. Did the police have this person in custody?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALLEN",
    "speech": "It is an objective determination, and nobody is arguing that it should be subjective. The petitioner is the one who has created this facade that we're trying to turn an objective test into a subjective test. We're not. The Ninth Circuit is not trying to do that. No one is asking whether Michael Alvarado felt free to leave. We're asking whether a reasonable person in his position would have felt free to leave because of such factors as his age and the parental involvement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, every subjective inquiry uses objective factors. I mean, you're -- you're not making it non-subjective simply because you say whether it's a -- you know, an objective 17-and-a-half-year-old who had been abused by his parents and who was, you know, off from Sunday school or whatever and put in every factor in his life and say, well, of course, you know. That -- that's subjective. That's not an objective test at that point when you're using all sorts of factors that -- that go to what his thinking was. When -- when you use all of that, you're using the subjective test."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALLEN",
    "speech": "There's a fine line here. Because the custody test asks how a reasonable person in the suspect's position would have felt free to leave, it's saying how would a reasonable person have felt, how they would have felt free to leave. And that sounds subjective, but you're using objective factors. And the fact of juvenile status -- it's not subjective. It's not a state of mind. It's a status. It's a class that this Court has recognized from the beginning."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but not in this particular context."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALLEN",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But up -- up to now, it's been concerned with respect to the custody inquiry to the external circumstances of -- of the person. You know, how would a reasonable person have reacted to these circumstances? Now, you're -- you're saying we don't any longer limit it to that. We look inside the person and try to figure out on his background how we would react, and that of course, is -- Justice Scalia says I think -- is -- is not a -- an objective standard."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALLEN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I respectfully disagree. We're not asking what was in the mind of the person. We're simply saying that this Court and other courts in the land and the police need to recognize what is obvious, that juveniles do not assess their freedom to leave the same way as adults do."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but you say juveniles, and you're saying the 17-and-a-half-year-old will not assess his freedom to leave in the same way an 18-year-old. That just doesn't make any sense at all."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALLEN",
    "speech": "This Court in its juvenile jurisprudence has drawn lines with juveniles versus adults. When things are close to the line, it's going to be fuzzy, but to say what the petitioner is arguing, that it never matters, that a 12-year-old would assess their freedom to leave the same as a 35-year-old, it can't be true."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If juvenility must be taken into account for the custody determination, how -- how is it that it is not taken into account for the purpose of what the nature of the warning has to be, assuming custody? I mean, we have one Miranda warning that presumably I have always thought is given to everybody from the 6-year-old to the senior citizen."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALLEN",
    "speech": "And --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Now, if -- if, indeed as you say, relevant to this whole thing is -- is the age of the person, we ought to have different Miranda warnings, an 8- year-old Miranda warning, a 17-and-a-half-year-old Miranda warning, and so forth."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALLEN",
    "speech": "I have two things to say about that, Justice Scalia. One is many States do employ a different Miranda warning for juveniles in their statutes. Secondly, this Court in Miranda, when putting down the warning, I assume it applies to both juveniles and adults, and ignoring the -- the juvenile status is basically making it an adult standard. If you're applying an adult standard to juveniles instead of providing for the greatest care, you would actually be giving them less protection to which they're entitled under the clearly established Federal law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And is it also not true that in many, many cases, voluntariness may remain an issue, for example, as in Oregon against Elstad. If there's a preliminary question followed by Miranda warnings, you first have to look at the voluntariness of the first interrogation. So we haven't abandoned voluntariness as a relevant issue in these cases."

    "speech": "No, not at all, Your Honor."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Does that help your case or hurt your case? I -- I -- I would think -- I thought that was the argument of the other side, that you -- you can raise all of this on the voluntariness point. You don't have to get it in on the -- on the quite objective factor of whether there is custody or not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Sure you can, but voluntariness is retrospective, and Miranda is prospective. So if you're trying to protect people's rights from the beginning, it should be taken into account at the beginning instead of waiting until the end when it's too late essentially. It's very hard to meet a voluntariness test when this could be taken care of on the front end by police giving people their 15-second Miranda warnings, particularly juveniles who they know are going to assess their freedom to leave differently than adults. So unless the Court has any other questions."
