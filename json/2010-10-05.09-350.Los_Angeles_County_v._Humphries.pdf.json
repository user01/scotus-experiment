    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Monell v. Department of Social Services, this Court held there could be no liability against a local public entity under section 1983 unless the plaintiff proved causation, namely that the injury that was inflicted was inflicted as a result of a custom, policy, or practice of that local public entity. The Ninth Circuit, however, in this case has imposed ex post facto declaratory relief on the County of Los Angeles as well as a substantial fee award, while acknowledging that it has not, in fact, determined whether the injury suffered by the plaintiffs and subject to declaratory relief was the result of a policy, custom, or practice fairly attributable to the County of Los Angeles. It did so because the Ninth Circuit has developed a digression from the Court's jurisprudence in Monell; namely, in the Ninth Circuit, claims for prospective relief, both injunctive and declaratory relief, are not subject to the Monell requirements. We submit that this is flatly inconsistent with Monell and erodes the important principles of federalism that are the motivating factors for the Monell causation requirement."

  },

Because we may have information showing culpability, information showing not culpability, but we don't have a standard to tell us when to remove them from the database and when to leave them in, because that's defined by the State. More importantly, we don't have any procedures on how to go about that, because the statutory scheme doesn't have any for doing that."

Declaratory relief against both of you."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Well, that's your adversary's argument, which is by this lawsuit, you have been told that there's something wrong -- it seems pretty natural -- that a report would be kept on the registry that has been declared just plain wrong. The court has said there's no foundation whatsoever for the accuracy of what's in that report, and you have failed to establish a procedure to remove the name. Why aren't you liable under Monell?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COATES",
    "speech": "Well, as a factual matter, the one thing the Ninth Circuit said it wasn't doing was figuring out whether this met the policy, custom, or practice requirement of Monell, because under its case law it doesn't have to do so. And, in fact, in the fee order, it said -- declined to do so and, in fact, it has remanded on the damage portion of the case, acknowledging that Monell claims remain open. We also contend that for purposes of potential Monell liability that we may not be free under State law to add additional procedural protections. That area may be pre-empted by the State through implied pre-emption under California law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Now, if that's the case, why wouldn't one of the following be possible? If you -- you say we have no discretion here. We are required to -- we are totally bound by the State procedures; we can't add any new procedure. They say, well, that's unconstitutional. So -- and you're choosing to do something that's unconstitutional because it's required by State law. Then, haven't -- in that situation, won't you have adopted a policy?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COATES",
    "speech": "The way the lower courts have, in the context of liability, viewed this requirement where State law requires a local entity to do something is they have virtually said that they're standing in the shoes of the State. Under those circumstances, it's essentially the State making the decision. They are just using the County as a -- the local entity, as an instrument. And so it's essentially an Ex parte Young Eleventh Amendment-type case."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

The Department of Justice issues the regulations on how local entities go about -- are required to report to the database. And so that's -­ that is the defendant in this case, and that's who they would sue. And I submit they could get relief by being removed from the database or require the State to enact procedures to allow them to have a determination made as to whether they should be removed or not. As it now stands, the statutory scheme doesn't have that, and the County's view is that it's not free to just go out and invent procedures, and other counties throughout the State of California aren't free to invent their own procedures. And that's one of the elements of this case that I think really underscores the Monell concerns with federalism, because it's an important question of the manner in which States relate to their municipalities and the way States divide up responsibility for who does what, and in a fairly important area of the law."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "This -- this is getting further removed from the situation that we're dealing with, because the State has already admitted liability and not has contested that its fees -- it owes fees. So, what is the relief that is left? If the -- if the State has admitted liability, what happens at that point? Shouldn't the record be expunged?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COATES",
    "speech": "I believe the appropriate argument for the plaintiffs would be to apply in a district court if they believe they have a valid injunction and valid declaratory relief vis-à-vis the State and move forward from there. They could certainly do that and have themselves removed from the database or order the State to create statutory procedures to allow them a hearing to determine whether they should be removed from the database. They're perfectly free to do that, because it's the State statute and it's the State database, and the State is a party here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But the State has already conceded. It's been adjudicated a constitutional violator, and the State is now saying, yes, we are not going to contest that anymore. Doesn't the State have to do something?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COATES",
    "speech": "They should. They absolutely should. And if the State drags its feet, the appropriate remedy is to file a motion for an injunction as against the State, to have them issue the proper procedural protections or to remove them from the database. But we submit that it's, at this point, not appropriate relief as against the County. That issue still remains open. We could still go back into district court and lose that, but at this point you still have to make the inquiry whether it's a county policy, custom, or practice that's inflicting the injury that's the subject of declaratory relief here. And, I mean, I think at bottom, at the end of the day, the point is that Plaintiffs really haven't identified any circumstance in which, in a proper case applying the Monell standards, you would not be able to get relief. And the danger of going forward with the Ninth Circuit's kind of amorphous standard where you just impose declaratory relief, independent of whether or not there's a policy, custom, or practice, is the kind of sloppy order that we have here, granting declaratory relief where we have a 90-10 fee split, and it's unclear how that decision was made, because it's not made through the prism of any sort of causation standard articulated by this Court. So we would submit that Monell provides clear guidelines, although sometimes difficult to apply in certain cases, but they are clear guidelines. And the Court in Monell said that those causation requirements applied to damages, injunctive and declaratory relief. And we believe that is a solid rule that supports the interests of federalism and -­"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "It's true that all cases that at least have come to us under Monell have involved damages."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COATES",
    "speech": "That is correct. They have been damages cases. But the -- but Monell itself doesn't talk in terms of guarding the public fisc, which is how Chaloux, the Ninth Circuit case that departs from Monell with injunctive and declaratory relief -- the way it characterizes it. It doesn't. Monell was concerned with interpreting the language of section 1983, the \"shall subject,\" the \"shall cause\" someone else to subject a person to a violation. They said that did not really conform to respondeat superior principles. And looking at the legislative history, the 42nd Congress in enacting section 1983 was critical to Justice Brennan in Monell that the rejection of the Sherman Amendment, which he said was concerned mostly with not imposing coercive liability on the municipality for the actions of others. They were concerned not to save money necessarily, but the way in which a Federal court would exercise coercive power over a local public entity. And we submit that it is just as important to have those guidelines when directly coercing through injunctive and declaratory relief as it is indirectly doing it through the threat of damage claims."

    "speaker": "PINCUS",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin, perhaps, by trying to answer Justice Alito's question about what is at stake here. Monell held that 1983 has a causation requirement. And the Court has, in a series of decisions, elucidated what a plaintiff must prove in the context of claims for damages to satisfy that causation requirement, and it's held in particular that the mere fact that a city employee committed a violation under color of State law in the past is not itself a sufficient link to the municipality itself. And the decisions have been devoted to elucidating precisely what else is required in order to show the sufficient link to the municipality. The question here arises in what, we submit, is the very different factual context of ongoing constitutional violations. And we think that although the jurisprudence that's developed under Monell has been done a -- has been devoted to fleshing out this other context, the Court should take a look at whether that jurisprudence is the appropriate way to determine whether the causation test is satisfied when there is an ongoing violation, because there's an easier way to do it."

The plaintiff says there is an additional element that may or not be present, and our submission is that the Ninth Circuit, although its rationale may have been slightly off, was correct in saying once a plaintiff has shown an ongoing constitutional violation and that the plaintiff is entitled, under standing principles and principles governing prospective relief, to relief, the plaintiff has necessarily shown a link to the municipality.

And I -- my concern is not that, properly applied, a causation requirement would weed out cases. It's that because the focus of the Court's jurisprudence up till now has not been on the ongoing violation as the possible source of a policy, but rather was there a policymaker involved in the initial denial, unless if the Court were to say there's an extra step, it were to make very clear that the focus of attention is not the initial action, in terms of finding a policy, but on the day -- as the matter ends up on the day the district court is deciding whether or not to grant relief, that those facts are relevant in deciding whether there is a policy, as well."

And so the Ninth Circuit has rejected the statement in Monell itself that it applies to all forms of relief. And so that's the question we are confronted with.

And we think that although the Ninth Circuit may not have had its reasoning quite right, what -­ the -- the bottom line was right, in the conclusion that when there is an ongoing violation and the other requirements for relief are met, Monell/the 1983 causation requirement doesn't impose an incremental burden on the plaintiff.

So that, in the hypothetical we've been talking about, if policymakers know of the ongoing conduct and they are indifferent to it, which they would be presumably if they're letting it continue, that that might be satisfied. But -- but, to us, that just goes to the notion that -- it's hard to come up with a situation where there will be an entitlement to prospective relief and the requisite causation won't be satisfied. And, therefore, saying there is this additional element, it sort of creates more harm than good because it's going to serve -- send courts on a search for it."

Do we bracket this with the -- with damages, because that's money, and that's what's involved here, attorneys' fees? Then the only thing that's before us is the award of attorneys' fees, right?"

And so, although this -- it happens to arise here in the attorneys' fees context, but if this causation requirement is more than just an extra box to check in terms of something that's -- for which the requirements will be satisfied, if it does screen out some cases, then it will not just mean no entitlement to attorneys' fees; it will mean no entitlement to prospective relief, and we think that's significant."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "COATES",
    "speech": "In the second lawsuit, the municipality is being held liable for its unconstitutional conduct. That's because the injury in the second case is absolutely inflicted as a result of a municipal policy, custom, or practice. That's why. It's fairly attributable there. In the first one, you're talking about an injury that has been inflicted by the employee. You know, I see the significant point here, again -- and the Ninth Circuit Court recognizes because, again, it didn't apply Monell in granting declaratory relief and issuing the attorneys' fees. It conspicuously did not. It expressly reserved the Monell issue in the main opinion. It did so because, on rehearing -­ the initial opinion didn't say anything about Monell. On rehearing, we pointed out that those issues were still open, more specifically the issue of whether we were even free under California law to create these additional procedures. That issue remains in this case. It's a significant issue. Even the Ninth Circuit admits that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "But whether you were free to do it or not under California law, how can there not -­ how can it not be your policy that you have refused to provide these procedures which they say are constitutionally required? Your policy is to follow an arguably unconstitutional State requirement, rather than comply with what is arguably required by the Constitution. Why isn't that a policy? Now, all that's at stake is -- and, of course, it's a matter of practical importance, but all that's at stake is a monetary dispute between the State of California and the County of Los Angeles, which, as far as the federal Constitution is concerned, is the same thing as the State of California. So why should we be concerned about this at all? I don't understand why there's not a policy here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COATES",
    "speech": "For a couple of reasons. The lower courts in talking about this issue in the context of Monell claims against local public entities have said, look, if you are just enforcing State law, if you have no discretion, you're not really making a conscious decision, you have to do this under State law, you're essentially acting as an arm of the State Eleventh Amendment Ex parte Young. I think we cite the Bockes case, which is an employment case where they sued a local entity for employment decisions that were dictated by a State board."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Yes, but all that's involved is money between -- between California and a creature of California. As far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, California could abolish the County of Los Angeles. California could subsidize you for your attorneys' fees, or they could levy some sort of -­ something upon you and require you to pay them additional money. None of that -- what's the constitutional concern in all of that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "COATES",
    "speech": "Well, the constitutional concern is that it injects a Federal court directly into the way that municipalities operate under California law. I mean, injunctive relief -- it's even worse. To issue an injunction against the County saying you have to do these procedural protections, notwithstanding the fact that the State says you shouldn't be able to do that, is inviting a lack of uniformity in these procedures throughout the State, and the State might want uniformity. If you hold a local public entity automatically liable for declaratory injunctive relief for -- for enforcing State law, you really have circumstances where a local entity is going to say: We don't need this fight. We're not going to enforce this law. It may be defensible, but it's not on our dime. And then you get local entities not enforcing State law, and that seems to be a significant State interest. And I submit that these are the kind of federalism principles that, you know, Mozell -- Monell is designed to take into account."
  },

And the Court said that determination is informed by State law. It ends up being a question of Federal law, but it is informed by State law. So, the short answer is that the court does that all the time in Monell damages actions -­"

As I noted, I think this goes to important principles of federalism. It goes right into the way the States interact with their local governments. And it can have a profound impact on the way in which local governments view their obligation to enforce State law. If the Court has no further questions, I would submit the matter."
