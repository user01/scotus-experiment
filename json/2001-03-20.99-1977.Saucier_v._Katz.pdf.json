      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Qualified immunity has an important role to play in Fourth Amendment unreasonable force cases just as it does in Fourth Amendment unreasonable search cases and in other constitutional contexts. The decision below effectively merged the qualified immunity and Fourth Amendment tests in the case of unreasonable force cases. The court reasoned that because both tests are framed in terms of objective reasonableness, the qualified immunity test had nothing to add to the underlying Fourth Amendment test. This Court rejected a virtually indistinguishable line of reasoning in Anderson against Creighton and with good reason. The Fourth Amendment and qualified immunity tests are distinct and serve different purposes. The Fourth Amendment test governs primary conduct. It looks at the force used and asks whether that force was reasonable. The qualified immunity test by contrast looks at the preexisting law and asks whether that preexisting law would have put a reasonable officer on notice that his or her conduct was unlawful. Qualified immunity thus recognizes that even competent officers will make reasonable mistakes and government officials should not be held personally liable when they make reasonable judgment calls just because their judgment turns out to be mistaken."

      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Well in many cases, once the case is -- the issue of qualified immunity is brought before the judge, the judge can rule on whether there's a qualified immunity protection in the case and there'll be no issue that needs to go to the jury in that case."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Well that may actually end up being the only issue that jury really needs to focus on. If I could give you an example, in a recent Tenth Circuit case called Cruz against City of Laramie, the Tenth Circuit decided that the use of a hog-tie restraint was unreasonable when used with an individual who exhibited signs of diminished capacity. In that same opinion, they reserved the question about whether that restraint was unreasonable when used on an individual who did not exhibit signs of diminished capacity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I mean the reason I'm asking is that, if the jury hears both questions, I want to know what the instructions sound like, and whether or not the jury can make this distinction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "In many cases, I think the jury will not really, if there's no liability -- I'm sorry, if there's no issue about injunctive relief, it may just be a situation where the court can simply decide what the clearly-established law is and instruct the jury on that clearly-established law and then the jury can make its determination. To pick up the example from the Tenth Circuit case, if in a subsequent decision, the Tenth Circuit extended its rule and applied the rule to all individuals, saying the hog-tie restraint is never reasonable, I think because the court had previously expressly reserved the question of whether the hog-tie restraint was reasonable when applied to an individual who did not exhibit signs of diminished capacity. In that case, the issue for the jury would be whether or not the individual who was arrested exhibited signs of diminished capacity and that would really be the only issue the jury needed to decide because if the individual had exhibited signs of diminished capacity, under the court's prior decision in Cruz, that -- that conduct would be not only unlawful but clearly established. On the other hand, if the jury decided that the individual had not exhibited signs of diminished capacity, then in that instance, although the conduct was unlawful, by virtue of this hypothetical second decision, the conduct would not be clearly established and there'd be no liability in that situation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So you're saying the only situation in which the two increase in effect will be exactly the same, is the situation in which the general standard has, by course of judicial decision, been reduced down to a kind of pinpoint specific rule for certain cases, e.g., hog-tie cases. And in the case in which immunity is claimed, the facts in that case are precisely duplicative of the facts, which have been found to result in this pinpoint rule. That's the only I case, I take it on your view, in which the two increase will, in effect, reach precisely the same result necessarily."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Oh, I'm not saying that there is a requirement, but I'm saying that, if in fact the previous case law has got to the pinpoint stage and the facts claimed by way of defense precisely fall within that pinpoint, then the two increase will not be different, but that's the only case I take in which that will be true on your view."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "I'm not sure if that's the only case where that's going to be true. I think there other cases where the preexisting law, although not showing the way with pinpoint accuracy, it still provides the officers with sufficiently clear notice that there's no real rule for qualified immunity in those particular cases."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Clement, it might help if you gave us, what would be the -- suppose the judge thinks, I don't want to decide the qualified immunity myself because I think there's some fact questions involved about what happened here. So let's take this very case and the judge wants to charge the jury so they'll understand the difference between excessive force that violates the Fourth Amendment and qualified immunity. How would the judge charge in this very case?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "I think the judge in this case would charge by using the language from this Court's previous qualified immunity opinions, language from cases like Malley and Hunter against Bryant and would charge the jury with finding -- in order to find liability in this case, the jury would have to find that the individual officer exhibited -- either was plainly incompetent or exercised judgment that was outside the range of professional judgment. I'm not sure it would really be necessary in a case where the only issue is liability to really direct the court's attention a great deal to the liability standard because that issue's going to effectively drop out of the case. To be sure, the jury may need to be instructed on what the relevant law of excessive force is, but once that instruction is put in place as sort a background instruction then the real question that the jury needs to focus on is the question of whether or not the officer's conduct was so unreasonable that it put it outside the range of professional --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "All I meant by that is that since there will be no liability imposed in the ordinary case without a finding that the officer's not entitled to qualified immunity, it'll be the qualified immunity question that will really be the ultimate focus of the jury's attention because that'll determine whether or not they find sufficient cause to award damages."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But if -- then the jury, if a jury decides that there is not qualified immunity then they have to go further, do they not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "I don't believe so. No, I'm sorry you're right. If they do find that there's not qualified immunity because the conduct was clearly established. I don't know that they really need to go further because that perforce will already incorporate the underlying Fourth Amendment test."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But that is what Justice Ginsburg was asking and what I was asking. I'm not sure how the jury distinguishes between these two tests and you seem to be telling us they don't have to and that seems to be inconsistent with your position that there are two tests."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "I'm sorry. I think -- perhaps my focusing on the cases that go to the jury, we're obscuring the fact that the real virtue of qualified immunity is in many of these cases, even under the plaintiff's versions of events, the conduct will not be so clearly unconstitutional by virtue of higher precedent that the court can just end there. And after all, as this Court emphasized in Harlow against Fitzgerald and subsequent cases, the qualified immunity is not just an immunity from liability, but it protects the officers from the chilling effect of the inconvenience of having to stand trial in those situations where prior decisions have not clearly marked the individual's conduct as being unlawful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Clement, in those situations where there are factual controversies, both questions will have to be submitted to the jury, won't they? I mean let's say in the present case, if there's a dispute as to whether more force was used than was necessary, the jury would have to determine whether more force was used than was necessary. And then the jury would also be asked, if that is the case, was that use of excessive force so obvious? Would it have been so obvious to a reasonable officer that this officer does not enjoy the qualified immunity that our cases provide? Wouldn't both questions have to go the jury?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "I think both questions certainly could go to the jury. It just seems to me that the second question actually entails the answer to the first. So if the jury's instructed and finds that the officer's conduct was so excessive as to put it outside the range of the conduct of a reasonable officer under the circumstances it would necessarily entail a finding in liability. And because by hypothesis I'm talking about a case where all the individual plaintiff seeks is monetary damages, the court may well have a forum that asks the court -- the jury to find the liability -- I'm sorry, the constitutional issue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I see what you mean. You really don't have to determine the question of whether it violated the Fourth Amendment so long as you determine that, even it did, this didn't go beyond what a reasonable officer might have thought was okay."

      "speaker": "CLEMENT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "I guess what I'm envisioning is that the jury would first be instructed on what the law is of excessive force based largely on this Court's decision in Graham against Connor. Then at the end of the instructions, the Court would focus in on what it is the jury needs to find in order to find liability and impose liability on the officer."

I think the instruction, I mean the instruction that the Government typically uses in these cases or typically offers in these cases, is based on this Court's decision in Malley and Hunter against Bryant and it asks the jury whether or not the officer's conduct was such that it was plainly incompetent under the circumstances and the use of force was outside the range of professional and competent judgment. And then the jury -- that's the question that jury ultimately focuses on."

      "speech": "The difference is -- well there's a couple of ways of expressing it, one way to express it is that the Fourth Amendment test looks only at the conduct and asks whether the force used was unreasonable. The qualified immunity test takes a broader look at what the preexisting law was and asks whether the officer was on notice that his or conduct violated clearly-established law. Another way of looking at is that the question in the first case is simply, looking at what the officer did, was what the officer did reasonable?"

I mean, our view you can take every fact in this case in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and the proper analysis should still be that the Petitioner was entitled to qualified immunity.

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It's that last bit. Sorry, that last bit that I'm confused on, why isn't it the same standard? I was just listening to the answer and I agree that in Anderson v. Creighton it isn't, but in Anderson v. Creighton the underlying constitutional standard is what society thinks is reasonable, basically. Here the underlying constitutional standard is what an officer thinks is reasonable and since it's what a reasonable officer thinks is excessive, they become the same standard. That's just a coincidence, but it happens to be so. That is, I don't see how -- think of an example. Can you think of a single example in which you're prepared to say it is excessive force. It is excessive force, i.e., an officer, a reasonable officer would have known it is excessive because otherwise it isn't excessive force. And you're prepared to say it is excessive force, but you'd also say he has qualified immunity, i.e., a reasonable officer couldn't have been expected to know it was excessive.

He thinks the suspect is resisting arrest, but he's really not. The Graham against Connor standard takes the perspective of the reasonable officer and grants deference to the officer. But in a situation where there's no question. The person wasn't resisting and the court announces a rule that says that, absent that kind of resistance, the use of force in this case is unreasonable. The officer may still be entitled to qualified immunity, if the prior law did not put the individual officer on notice that that use of force under the circumstances, was unreasonable."

And so isn't the relationship between the two inquiries this, if the first standard, the Fourth Amendment standard has never been stated by the courts, except in general terms, then probably there will be room for some reasonable disagreement about its application. You're saying in this case the Graham and Connor standard is at a pretty high level of generality and therefore you can charge a jury on the Graham and Connor standard and they'll decide whether in their judgment the officer's conduct was or was not reasonable.

Now that kind of speak first or warning requirement, at least in a nondeadly-force context, seems to us to be a new rule or something that's certainly not clearly established on which a reasonable officer would be on notice of. If the Court of Appeals had approached it that way, focused in on that as being the key factor that made the actions of the officers here unreasonable then we could very legitimately ask the question, was that clearly established?

The first and most important thing this Court can do is to disabuse the Ninth Circuit of that notion. Then applying the principles to this case, it could usefully decide whether or not there's qualified immunity in this case. In doing so, it could very well follow the reasoning that I just outlined which is to say what would make this case an example of excessive force, if anything, must be this failure to warn first. Now, the Ninth Circuit -- this Court can either decide that issue if it's liked or just kind of, for purposes of the annunciation of the rule, assume it, but then it could say that principle is not clearly established. If possible, I'd to reserve the remaining to time for follow-up."

Step one is, judge take the facts as the plaintiff asserts them insofar as they survive summary judgment.

Now the starting point is with a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment and at that point and I know this both from representing police officers and from representing plaintiffs at trial in the federal trial courts. The first step is, you move to dismiss on the defense side and you take out Anderson and you say could the officer have -- whether the officer could have reasonably believed that they could use the amount of force that they did. Anderson sets that straight out. And then the next thing you do is you take Graham to inform the decision, which is why the opinion is such a brilliant one, because it provides the specifics. It provides a three-step test. How severe was the crime? Was the person armed and dangerous, dangerous to the police and to the other members of the public and was there resistance? And so if you take this case for instance, they claim that Dr. Katz had resisted arrest. Now if Dr. Katz resisted arrest in this case, Judge Jensen, a seasoned trial lawyer himself, would have thrown this case out in an instant using Anderson and using Graham. He would have said the reasonable officer could believe that because there was resistance, you can use additional force."

There's still a question of how much force you can apply and there will always be an issue no matter how much he was resisting, no matter how violent the crime was whether you applied too much force.

And then this is a police officer who does use the hog tie but for a person who has no diminished capacity. Now I would read it to be, you know, an open question whether that is excessive force or not. And suppose that it is finally decided that that is excessive force.

That's what they're looking for and I think that is contrary to Graham. It would supplant Graham, it's unnecessary, and it would make it unworkable in that he jury instructions that would be given would be -- the way that this works in practice is that the instructions that they've asked for, and I've seen them, they ask, after the jury has decided that the officer acted in objectively unreasonable manner then they ask whether the officer could have reasonably believed that he could act unreasonably and they expect the jurors to do this."

And in thinking about that, I thought, well, maybe that's an instance where suddenly the underlying substantive rule, which I previously thought turns 100 percent on whether the policemen in the field would reasonably have thought this was too much force or not is suddenly changed. That is, if you're going to have a set of practices that define the reasonableness of it, i.e., hog tying, diminished capacity, is by law excessive force, then we do have Anderson/Creighton, then we do have the Fourth Amendment search and seizure and then the standards do diverge. Now without the hog tie, if we just have first standard, they don't diverge. Now is that right?"

      "speech": "But the Ninth Circuit said that Anderson doesn't apply with respect to excessive force and I would like to know why that is correct? Just because you have a reasonable test for excessive force, you also have a reasonableness test for probable cause. Would a reasonable officer have believed that a crime was in progress, for example. They're both reasonableness tests and in Anderson we say nonetheless you have an antecedent question of whether there's qualified immunity even though -- even though it may be determined by the jury that this was unreasonable, nonetheless an officer would still be protected if the law was not that clear about what was reasonable and he can be allowed to go a little bit over the line. Why is excessive force any different from probable cause in this regard? And that's the point of the Ninth Circuit: Anderson doesn't apply."

      "speaker": "BOYD",
      "speech": "But Anderson does apply except it applies at the same level as the Fourth Amendment. And the difference, Your Honor, is that with an excessive force case like this, this is where you're right at the juncture where physical force is being used by federal officials against individuals. What you have here are federal lawyers asking federal judges to make federal officials immune from the Bill of Rights."

      "speech": "Mr. Boyd, I think you answered Justice Scalia's question a second ago and I wanted to come back to it. You said something a minute ago that suggested the following to me. You were saying, I think, that the way the unreasonable or reasonable excessive force test has been articulated in Graham is that it gives the officer the benefit of the doubt, you know, none of the 20/20 hindsight and so on, the guy in the field and all of that. And I think what you're arguing is that qualified immunity gives the officer the benefit of the doubt. It says, if it wasn't clear enough, he gets the benefit of the doubt. And I think what you're saying is, in this particular case, in excessive force cases, the benefit of the doubt is already part of the substantive test. So it makes no sense to say, after getting the benefit of the doubt on the substantive standard, you then get the benefit of the doubt again. Is that your position?"

Why is that double benefit not conferred in the Anderson type case, in the probable cause type case? It is either, there in fact was no crime in progress, but a reasonable officer could have thought that there was a crime in progress. That's the probable cause test, but then we add on top of that a qualified immunities test. Now, why don't you decry the benefit on a benefit in that situation? Maybe Anderson's wrong, but then you should be asking us to overrule Anderson. I don't see any difference between the probable cause test and the excessive force test. Would a reasonable officer have thought this was excessive force? Would a reasonable office have thought that there was a crime in progress? I don't see any double counting in one case any more than in the other."

And Graham has set forth some very specific standards that can apply where you --"

He said the crux of the excessive force case here was that they didn't give him notice, some kind of notice, and I didn't understand that to be your position. I thought that your position was they didn't need to give him the bum's rush. They didn't need to push him in. He was elderly, frail and they could have treated him gently. Now there this -- they didn't notify him to stop or something part of your case?"

It is how they treated him that raises the question of fact. And the important thing here, and this gets to the crux of the qualified immunity and the interactions with the Fourth Amendment, is that they are providing the means for the trial court judges to take care of the insubstantial cases now and to provide the officers with the insulation they need while still preserving a remedy."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But that doesn't really answer the legal point that Justice Souter and Justice Scalia have asked you about.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOYD",

      "speech": "But why should that make a difference for Fourth Amendment purposes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOYD",
      "speech": "Because of the nature of it. This cuts right to the heart of the intent of the Fourth Amendment to serve as a check on federal officials and there's nothing in the Fourth Amendment making a textural analysis of it that provides for an immunity. And so there should be one, but it should not be untethered and so in the excessive force case we have the benefit of Graham. Graham has left a wonderful legacy. It's been cited 2,685 times and the reason for that is because it's working and it's working along with Anderson. And what they're talking about now is an expansion of the qualified immunity that would just supplant Graham, unnecessarily so, and raise Seventh Amendment issues."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But, you know, without Graham we have the legacy of several centuries of probable cause law, which gives the policeman the benefit of the doubt. He doesn't have to be correct about whether there are exigent circumstances so long as it was a reasonable judgment on his part and yet on top of that giving him the benefit of doubt, we also have a separate immunity doctrine. I don't see why it's any different for excessive force even though he thought -- even though the force was in fact excessive, we're going to give the policeman the benefit of the doubt if a reasonable policeman would not have thought it was excessive. That already gives him one benefit of the doubt and the Government is arguing just as in Anderson you give a second benefit of the doubt for immunity so also in the case. I don't see any difference between the two. Now maybe Anderson is wrong, but that's a different issue."

      "speaker": "BOYD",

And the fact is that now, and I see that my five-minute light is on, and I don't feel that there's a need to try to make every single point but what's essential here is that there's no better way to preserve rights than to put them in writing. And there's no better guardians of written rights than judges and here in this context, well ought to remember the words of Justice Marshall saying that if we're to be a government of laws and not of men that there must be a remedy for the violation of a constitutional right. And at the same time we have balance that against the need to insulate the officers, I recognize that, but this is a case where judges --"

This is where there's confusion in the Circuits and some of the time it's going to the jury on Graham and then they give it to the judge, as in McNair, to apply qualified immunity after the jury. And that's when you run into direct conflict with the Seventh Amendment. And that's why the most important thing for this Court to make clear and why to adopt the Ninth Circuit standard is because it sets forth a clear workable test so that after the jury has decided based on jury instructions incorporating both Anderson and Graham, that then there's no second guessing by the judge. Because, Your Honors, it's in the -- there are moments when it's up to the judges to decide to make sure that the rights are not deteriorating and that's exactly what's happened here both with Judge Jensen and with Judge Thompson in the unanimous decision of the Ninth Circuit. And so we would urge this Court to follow the decisions of the Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth and D.C. Circuits that strike the proper balance between preserving the remedy for the individual and insulating the police officers in the performance of their duties. With that I have nothing further and I thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."

    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Like to make three points. First for those of you who have reviewed the videotape, the very fact that this Court could disagree with Ninth Circuit about whether there was excessive force used in this case underscores the need for qualified immunity for officers in the field because clearly Graham against Connor did not answer every case and did not provide officers on crystal clear notice of where the lines were in the excessive-force context. The second point I'd like to make is simply that jury instruction issues and the question of what goes to the jury and what the judge should decide, those issues are not unique to the excessive-force context. Those same issues arise under probable cause and exigent circumstance in Anderson against Creighton. And Mr. Boyd's actually correct that some of the Circuits have taken divergent views on that. It may be appropriate for the Court eventually to take up that issue, but as Justice O'Connor has pointed out, this case would be an incredibly poor vehicle to do so since we're here on summary judgment and the Ninth Circuit's denial of summary judgment and the Government's position continues to be that that grant of -- that denial of summary judgment was inappropriate and this Court should reverse that. Finally, I want to clarify that despite what may have been said here it is not accurate to say that the Ninth Circuit, or at least Graham itself, incorporates the test of Anderson against Creighton. Graham itself does allow officers the benefit of the doubt when it comes to reasonable mistakes of fact. It doesn't grant them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to reasonable mistakes of law. And it doesn't incorporate into its reasonableness test the notion of what the preexisting law was and it's a good thing that it doesn't because if that were the case, then the Fourth Amendment law would be frozen in place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It seems to me that what you're asking is to say that the police officer is entitled to know in every case precisely what he must do and I'm not sure either under qualified immunity and then certainly under general Fourth Amendment principles we can do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "I don't think that's what we're asking, with all due respect Justice Kennedy. I think what we're asking is that the officers be put on fair warning that their conduct is unlawful. Justice Souter in an opinion for the Court in United States against Lanier addressed this issue in the context of 18 U.S.C. 242 and made clear that what's required in that context, and he noted that the same rule applies in qualified immunity, is the officers have fair warning because the principles, the general principles, have been made specific is the term he used, by application through prior cases. The Eleventh Circuit in a case called Lassiter against Alabama A&M expressed the same concept by saying that what you need is the prior case law that's materially similar."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "All right. Well, if the standards are the same, sometimes by coincidence it could turn out that the qualified immunity standard and the underlying substantive standard are the same. And if so, there's only one question to ask and if not there are obviously two questions to ask. All right, I thought all they're arguing is that this and the Ninth Circuit says by coincidence they happen to be the same."

      "speaker": "CLEMENT",

It's the same idea as to why this Court asked lower courts to deal with the liability -- the constitutional issue first and only the immunity question second. The last point I'd like to make is in response to Justice Ginsburg's question about what the rationale of the Ninth Circuit below was in a subsequent case decided last week."
