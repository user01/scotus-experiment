The purpose of it was not to enable people to get information, per se; it was to enable people to see how their government is working, so that they could attend to any malfeasance that is occurring in the process of government. It seems to me entirely in accord with that purpose of these laws to say it's only Virginia citizens who -- who are concerned about the functioning of Virginia government and ought to be able to get whatever records Virginia agencies have.

It -- it can't be based on -- on the traditional property interest. It's based on the ability of the citizens of the State to find out what the -- what the government of the State is up to."

They're not part of Virginia's political community. So why isn't this -- if you're not part of the political community, then you don't fall under FOIA, which is a peculiar statute, in that everybody who is covered by it can get whatever they want, and they don't have to give any reason for it."

And -- you know, when we're looking under the Dormant Commerce Clause or under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, this Court's cases have said repeatedly you don't look to uncover the original legislative purpose, you look to whether there is discrimination, which there is here, on its face, and you look to whether there is a discriminatory effect.

Virginia does not deny that the -- the vast majority of the requesters are commercial requesters -- the vast majority of out-of-State requesters are commercial requesters. Their -- the amicus brief supporting their side, the Local Government Attorneys of Virginia amicus brief, at page 30, explains the way this policy -­ policy is being implemented, is that noncommercial requests are typically honored, but out-of-State requests by data miners are being categorically denied under the policy."

So maybe it would be helpful if I try to unpack that. If it means incidental in terms of the effect on my client's business, I think, as I've explained, it's anything, but incidental; it completely forecloses him from the market. If it means incidental in terms of the -- the aggregate effect of this statute, again, it's not incidental because the vast majority of -- of affected parties under this policy are out-of-State commercial requesters, particularly data companies. And -- you know, if it means incidental compared to the purpose of the statute, as I've said, transparency was one purpose of the modern FOIA laws, but they also subsumed and sit on top of all of the longstanding rights of public access that have been around since the -- the first settlements in the United States -- or before the United States, when, in order to have a functioning property system, we recognized that you've got to have records of who owns what and -- and those records have to be made available to anyone in order to exercise property rights."

      "speech": "Right. And I -- I think the test that I just laid out would work for both clauses. It's a limiting principle on the justification side. But -- but that's right, Mr. McBurney does not have a dormant Commerce Clause claim. His claim is based on equal access to proceedings. He wanted to get recovery of child support that he was owed. So he is a creditor seeking to pursue a debt on equal terms with people in the State of Virginia, and the State set up a process. As one step along the way to court, you go to the agency, you ask the agency to enforce. The -- the agency has unique enforcement tools. It can suspend someone's driver's license, for example. It can -- it can intercept income tax refunds, and it can go to court on your behalf. And all he's asking for is the rules of the game. He wants to know what procedures apply to that process. And at least where a -- an agency has a process that directly affects a non-stater in the pocketbook, all we are saying is that equal access to the proceedings means equal access to the information governing those proceedings. And, finally, I would just like to close by saying that -- you know, what I don't think we heard on the justification side from the State was really any justification because the State can recoup its costs. And so anything more, which was the only justification they pressed in -- in the courts below. And so they are left with the position that they can discriminate simply because they think they can. And, if you look at the Privileges and Immunities Clause, it sits right next to the Full Faith and Credit Clause, which indicates, if anything, that the framers thought that the movement of public records across State lines was important to interstate comity. They changed the Articles of Confederation version, which did not include public records; it only referred to judicial records. They added a mention of judicial records -- nonjudicial records and saw that that was important to -- to comity across State lines. But -- but their position is about the step before that. It's about whether you get the records in the first place. Thank you."
