We think that would be appropriate. But we do think that the basic point remains that this is a substantial obstacle. And I would like to address two points that arose during Petitioners' argument. First, closures, and then, capacity. With respect to closures, here's where I think the record will show you taking the ASC requirement first. The 13 ­­ there's a stipulation, JA 183, that all ­­ all clinics that weren't already closed as a result of the admitting­privilege requirement would ­­ would not be able to meet the ASC requirements; and therefore, could not ­­ would have to cease operations. Justice Kagan noted they did cease operation during the period in which the law was in State. There's evidence in the record with respect to the seven clinics that are operated by Whole Woman's Health that they ­­ that it was physically impossible to meet the ASC construction requirements because it couldn't fit on the real estate footprint that they had; they couldn't meet them. There's expert testimony in the record from Dr. Layne­Farrar, the economist, that the cost of retrofitting these clinics to meet the requirements would be between 1.6 and 2.3 million dollars, which would be prohibitive; that the cost of building a new facility would be at least 3.5 million dollars, which would be prohibitive; and that the additional operating cost of an ASC would be between 600,00 and a million dollars a year more. So I think with respect to those, there's ample evidence. With respect to the ­­ with respect to the admitting­privileges requirement, we know that 11 of the 20 clinics that closed between the date when the law was enacted and the effective date of the admitting­privileges requirement closed on the date that that requirement became effective. Seems to me the only reasonable inference you can draw with respect to those 11 is that that law caused the closure. With respect to the others, I don't think there's evidence with respect to each one, but with respect to several, there is evidence that they closed in advance of the effective date, because they were otherwise going to have to pay a licensing fee to stay open for another year, which they knew they were not. And they knew they weren't going to be able to stay open, and they didn't want to flush the money away. So I think there's ample evidence in the record with respect to causation. Now, with respect to capacity, I really think this is key, because I do think this is the locus of the substantial obstacle problem here. With respect to capacity, before this law took ­­ took effect, there were approximately 65 to 70,000 abortions a year annually. The ASC clinics that will be able to remain open ­­ the ASC facilities that will be able to remain open performed about 14,000 a year. That's what the record tells you. It's Dr. Grossman's expert testimony. It's in the JA from pages 225 to 259."

And, further, had Texas truly believed that these laws provided some important benefit for outpatient surgery, it would have made them generally applicable. All outpatient surgical providers would have to have admitting privileges or practice in an ASC, but that's not the case. Texas law expressly authorizes other surgical procedures, including those performed under general anesthesia ­­ which early abortion is not ­­ to be performed in the physician's office.
