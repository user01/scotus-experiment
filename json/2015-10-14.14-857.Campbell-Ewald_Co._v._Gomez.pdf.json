In fact, the complaint, if you look on page 21 of the Joint Appendix, touts that he has all the financial resources necessary to bring this action. Second of all, in Roper the Court relied on that interest solely for the purpose of allowing the appeal from the denial of certification when the mooting event occurred after the denial of certification. So there you had a real relation back issue. If the Court had been wrong in denying certification, then the case never would have become moot in the first place. Here, the mooting event takes place before certification. There's nothing to relate back to."

There are a number of things that you've said, well, he asked for it, but he's not entitled to it. He asked for attorneys' fees, but he's not entitled to attorneys' fees. And he asked for an injunction or declaratory relief, and he's not entitled to that. And he asked for class certification, but he's not entitled to that, and so the case is moot. And the \"so the case is moot\" seems to me to be a non sequitur. In other words, he's asked for these things, you haven't offered these things, and there's a dispute about whether he's entitled to these things. Now, you might be completely right as to that, \"He's not entitled to attorneys' fees.\" But that has to be adjudicated.

And if there's time, I'd like to address the derivative sovereign immunity argument. First, there is a distinction that this Court has established between prospective relief and retrospective relief. When you seek prospective relief, you need to show an ongoing or imminent injury. In that context, a defendant can actually halt the injury that's necessary by stopping, so long as you meet the voluntary cessation doctrine or ­­ so long as you show that it's not capable of repetition you're going to be in review. So the injury with respect to prospective relief, that is, the injury that's occurring now or in the future, can end. When we're talking about retrospective relief, damages, the injury is in the past. It's not undone. An offer of money may be compensation for that injury, but the injury continues to exist. For purposes of Article III, the question is, there has to be an injury. It has to be fairly traceable. That's established by the past injury that ­­ caused by the defendant. And the requested judicial relief would likely redress the injury. Now, the requested relief, even when there's been an offer, is: I want money. Second ­­"

We're ­­ we're down to the question, really, of: How do we get rid of this case? Because I think that even they recognize that the ­­ if the offer is for complete relief, then, the courts below held, the case has to come to an end. There's two options for this Court. One, you hold that the case should be dismissed as moot, and two ­­ if you don't agree with that, then two, you hold that the case should be disposed of by entering judgment for the plaintiff based on the terms of the ­­ of the offer of complete relief. That's the Sixth Circuit rule. You can go and look, as we did. There are plenty of judgments where the courts have implemented that rule. There's no evidence of any difficulty in applying that, and what that does is it disposes of cases in a common­sense fashion. It prevents court from ­­ courts from going ahead and expounding on the law in cases in which they have no business doing so. If I could make one point on the immunity issue: Justice Ginsburg, you're exactly right. They sued the wrong party. MindMatics did everything in this case, and we're at least entitled to immunity from vicarious liability."
