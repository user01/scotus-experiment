    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "speech": "Front pay is much more fluid. It depends on the circumstances. The first consideration is not whether the person's entitled to front pay. The first consideration is whether that plaintiff should be reinstated, and is there a compelling reason why they should not be reinstated, and there are numerous examples of circumstances where reinstatement would be inappropriate. For example, there's another employee in the place in which the plaintiff -- to which the plaintiff would be reinstated."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

Federal Express, which went up on appeal twice to the Sixth Circuit -- and it's one of the leading cases from the Sixth Circuit in which the Sixth Circuit recognizes front pay as equitable -- the plaintiff was held by the judge not to be required to go back to that employment because of the hostile environment, the painful situation she would find herself in."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Okay. But that -- I just don't see how when the front pay so-called becomes that extensive, I don't see how you distinguish it from an award of lost future earnings not attributable to loss of earning capacity, which is a recognized form of damages at law."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "speech": "The hallmark really is the discretion of the court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Ms. Caldwell, you're describing this as the typical substitute for reinstatement, but you did say that front pay covers a wide range, and at least one area that it covers is a person qualifies for the promotion or for the job, doesn't get it because of discrimination. But then there's a seniority system, so the job isn't there. Front pay is you pay the person at the job level where they are now until there's a vacancy. Or if there's a training program, she hasn't been promoted but she would need a training program, you pay her while she gets the training program at the higher rate. And front pay in those situations was conceived of as an incentive to stop the employer from foot-dragging. So you're treating this in the most questionable case where front pay is originally, in the situations I describe, it's much more easy to characterize as equitable. Is that not so? And you're giving us these cases where she's never going to be in the job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "speech": "Well, front pay applies to both instances, and normally this is one of the reasons why it should remain with the court rather than with a jury."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Ms. Caldwell, would you tell me how it works so far as the jury's concerned. I think you pointed out that from your standpoint, there's a real problem with the respondent's position as to what the jury should be instructed, but even if your position is accepted, I'm not quite sure how it works. Is the employer entitled to an instruction to the jury? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you find that there is liability and if you reach the point of punitive damages and future damages, you should not take into account any lost future earnings. Is that the way it works, if you prevail?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Just as -- for the preface, because it would seem to me that the employer would want the jury to know that they shouldn't worry about future pay and future earnings, and there should be some instruction to that effect."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "speech": "There should be an instruction to that effect, but there are certain future pecuniary amounts that the jury would be instructed on."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And what are those?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Ms. Caldwell, can I call your attention to the text of the statute again which you cited us to? Compensatory damages shall not include back pay or any other type of relief authorized. I assume that means currently authorized, not that used to be authorized. And isn't one of the problems with your case that, assuming you're relying on the equitable nature of this award, it's clear that you do not give equitable relief where legal relief is available. Equity only steps in when the law doesn't cover the problem. Now, once upon a time, this front pay may have been available under 2000e-5(g) of the Civil Rights Act as equitable relief, but once you have enacted a new provision for compensatory damages, it seems to me you do not need that equitable relief of front pay. You have legal relief."

    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, do you deny that if you have legal ability to get your future earnings, you cannot ask a court of equity to give you your future earnings without jury trial and everything else that goes with it?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, that's just contrary to the most fundamental understanding of the difference between equity and law. The law awards damages. Equity awards other kinds of relief when damages are not sufficient."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "speech": "And the difficulty here -- and perhaps I'm not expressing it clearly enough -- is that when a court reaches the issue of front pay, the court is normally joining it with some form of injunctive relief that's certainly not within the provenance of a jury."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, under the new law as written, you can get compensatory damages."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "speech": "You can get compensatory damages under the Act. If you look at (b)(2), it excludes damages that were previously available. It says, compensatory damages awarded under this section. In other words, 1981a. It does not include the prior relief, and that would include front pay, because front pay was part of the relief that had been awardable and had been recognized by eleven of the circuit courts of appeal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It used to be, because under your theory, it was equitable relief, and it was -- and the same money was not available through the law. But when you have a new statute that says you can get this compensation, I don't see any justification for giving you front pay on an equitable basis."

      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "speech": "Absolutely."

      "speech": "Historically the jury did not award back pay. They do now."
    },

      "speaker": "CALDWELL",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "speech": "I believe it should not work that way. I think in actuality the judge has the discretion to give the instruction on back pay, and if the judge gives the instruction, then there's a calculation by the jury. But that's a different animal from front pay to that extent, because there is a two-step process in front pay. First, the issue of reinstatement entirely for the court. Second, the issue of front pay which is a matter of not straight calculation."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So -- but you're saying that the court must always first deal with reinstatement before it gets to back pay or --"

      "speech": "Before it gets to front pay."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "speech": "The converse is equally difficult. If this Court decides that front pay is now awardable exclusively under 1981a, the effect will be that persons who were discriminated against but not intentionally will no longer be able to get front pay. That will certainly thwart the make-whole purposes of the Act."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Isn't it true that the original characterization of back pay as equitable, that that was done way back in '64, because there was frankly distrust in how southern juries would deal with Title VII?"

The 1991 Act provided new relief and generally capped that new relief, but the Act did not cap remedies that were already authorized such as front pay, which has traditionally been awarded when reinstatement is delayed or impractical.

It knew that that relief would be subject to a jury determination, and there were Members of Congress and the Administration that was worried that those new damages, subject to jury awards, might be excessive, and so they wanted to cap the new relief, but there was no concern about existing relief. Nothing had been expressed that there was excessive relief then, and Congress had no desire to touch existing relief at all. It wanted to leave it alone, add something new, limit what was new.

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue before the Court today involves the division of responsibilities between the judge and jury under this restructured remedies program under the '91 Act, and that is the one that exists today and did exist at the time of trial. The division follows fairly conventional system. The judge retains authority over equitable matters. The jury has its powers to assess damages. A facial reading of the statutory scheme, in fact, shows that compensatory damage and, as we get to it, one of its component parts, future pecuniary losses, are subject to decision by the jury. Now, what I would like to do just briefly is step back and see where the parties agree here and really where we shouldn't differ. I listened very closely to Petitioner this morning, and I thought there was no disagreement, and maybe there isn't, on the question of what front pay is. Historically when you boil it down, the court said that front pay is future lost earnings or wages."

      "speech": "As far as that goes, that's correct. There is a great difference, I believe, also between back pay and front pay, back pay being generally restitutionary, named by Congress specifically as an equitable remedy directed by Congress in, I believe it is, (a)(1) of the statute to exercise its discretion specifically on back pay. Nothing, of course, has ever been said about front pay anywhere in the statutory scheme. But what I was just going to get to was I think there is agreement between the parties as to what this front pay means, which is critical to this case, and then, in fact, petitioner in her opening brief, on page 14, concedes that, in effect, it is lost future earnings. The Government also acknowledges in their brief that, in fact, front pay is by calculation lost future earnings or wages. I believe in the Government's brief, it's footnote 12. I think there's general agreement among the parties as to what front pay means. Good starting point."

And the idea was to speed up getting them into the more advanced position. It came up with seniority systems, and it came up with training, that people could not immediately be put in their rightful place because they needed training or because there was a seniority system. That was what front pay came out of, was it not?"

I think the next point, though, where we do differ but we shouldn't perhaps is that future pecuniary losses, the statutory term, really, when you look at it, we don't need Webster, Bouvier, or Black. It should be inclusive of future lost earnings just by plain English. We really shouldn't disagree on that, and maybe -- I was listening carefully, but maybe we don't disagree on that. Where we do part company -- and this is critical to the case. Where we part company is over Section (b)(2), the exclusion to compensatory damages. Now, you remember that says, compensatory damages will not include back pay, interest on back pay, or remedies under 706(g), the old equity statute. Now, if we understand the petitioner's argument, at least in their reply brief, what they're saying is, if we go -- I'm sorry. Front pay is now a legal remedy. What of this language in the exclusionary clause? And the answer is really, in our judgment, quite simple. There are a number of other monetary reliefs that are available in an equitable form other than front pay. They are -- let me just give you a few examples.

Rather it was that front pay had been authorized, and that's the end of it. Now, very simply, if we're to hold to the contrary, we'd have to say that in this later statute, the court -- the Congress changed the meaning of old 706(g), which seems to me fanciful, or we would have to say that front pay never was authorized, and all the courts of appeals were wrong, and when we held that, our reasoning would also say, probably back pay isn't authorized either. Therefore, if we take that route, we are tearing the statute apart. And then they say, by the way, if you want to know what they thought, why don't you just look to the words of the sponsors who without any contradiction on the floor of the Senate, said, this amendment includes front pay, in those words. All right. Now, that I take it was their basic argument, and I would like to hear what's wrong with it."

The question is, does it fall into exceptions to that? Our argument is, no, first, it is not incident to, especially in this case, incident to another -- an equitable remedy, so it doesn't fall into the Tull exception, intertwined or incident to.
