  {
    "speaker": "STEVENSON",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 6 days before petitioner's scheduled execution in this case, an execution that he had sought and informally requested be -- be carried out as soon as possible, prison officials went to him and for the first time told him that to deal with a medical problem that both parties acknowledged exists, he would be subjected to a procedure that would be conducted by State officials, not necessarily medically trained, not necessarily licensed, where they were going to make a 2-inch incision in his arm, cut through fat and tissue and muscle, until they had a vein that they could access for the purposes of inserting a catheter."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So -- so presumably in -- well in advance he could anticipate a problem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENSON",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, and he did. He immediately began contacting the warden at Holman Prison. He was housed in another facility some 200 miles away. He immediately began contacting the warden at Holman Prison, who had just been installed, who did not know him, and informed him he had this condition, that they would need to create protocols necessary to deal with it. The State admitted that they had never dealt with someone in this condition before and began offering all kinds of things that would accomplish this execution. Let him bring in a physician that can insert a catheter. Let's get some protocols established so that we don't have any problems. And for 6 weeks essentially this effort was being made. He had been previously told that they were going to do this 24 hours in advance, that they weren't going to make this kind of 2-inch incision, and even though he hadn't been assured there would be medical people, he was relatively comfortable with that. He did not file suit. It's only 6 days before for the first time that the State announced they would have this kind of invasive procedure carried out by someone who was not necessarily medically trained. He filed a 1983 action. I think it's important for this Court's judgment here today. The district court found that that 1983 action, if it went in Mr. Nelson's favor, would not invalidate his judgment or conviction. Notwithstanding that conclusion, the district court felt compelled to apply a rule in force in the Eleventh Circuit that effectively shields death row prisoners facing an execution from doing anything that can challenge unconstitutional conditions of -- of confinement. The Eleventh Circuit rule is essentially once you are scheduled for an execution, it doesn't matter that the prison begins to do something and amount to something that -- that is unconstitutional."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, they're -- they're not saying that. They can bring actions that -- that challenge unconstitutional conditions of confinement. He's being kept in a dank and dark cell that's -- that's cruel and painful. The only thing they're saying he can't bring is -- is an action that, in effect, says I can't be executed the way the State intends to execute me, that that has to have been brought up earlier."

    "speech": "It has -- has to be under habeas rather than under 1983."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENSON",
    "speech": "Yes. And Your Honor, I -- I guess our position is -- is that this action is like the action that you describe. He is challenging medical treatment, medical procedures. He doesn't say he doesn't want to be executed. He's not trying to block his execution."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but it's unlike these other actions in this one crucial respect: its effect is to prevent the execution."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENSON",
    "speech": "No. I think the effect here was to facilitate the execution. Mr. Nelson went into court saying, let's just get an order so that my doctor can come in and carry this out. Let's just get a temporary restraining order on this 2-inch incision which makes no sense. The -- the court -- the district court judge says, can't you lawyers work this out? Mr. Nelson's counsel was ready then and there to effectuate a procedure that would carry out this execution. And the Eleventh Circuit judgment, Justice Scalia, is actually one that says once the petitioner is scheduled for an execution, it doesn't matter whether it's a conditions of confinement suit as you described, that the Federal courts somehow have no authority to grant relief or conduct review because the execution -- the scheduling of the execution somehow divests those courts of jurisdiction. That's the Eleventh Circuit rule. They didn't argue here that because his litigation, because his lawsuit is, in effect, an attempt to bar the execution, he loses. That's the distinction. What they said here is that because he is already scheduled for execution, it doesn't matter what the conditions of the confinement are, whether it invalidates the conviction and sentence. Federal courts have no authority to grant relief. And that's the rule we urge this Court to overturn."

    "speech": "Did -- did he ask for a postponement of the execution?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENSON",
    "speech": "He did, Your Honor. He did, and that was in part because the State was, at least at the point at which this lawsuit was filed in, saying that this is what they were going to do in -- in the absence of some kind of Federal intervention."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What would have been the terms of the postponement that you were asking for?"
  },

    "speaker": "STEVENSON",

    "speech": "I -- I think it could have been sufficient to say I'm going to order that his physician be admitted into the facility. I'm going to order that you accomplish this through the method proposed by petitioner's counsel. I think all of those things could have been done, but the district court here felt like he did not have the authority to actually deal with this in the 1983 context."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Was it that -- before, Mr. Stevenson, you said that nothing that the prisoner requests, once the date of execution is set, is actionable in 1983. But I thought that the Eleventh Circuit made a distinction between a proceeding that would require a stay of the execution. If he says that prior to the execution I'm in -- in a dark, dank cell, that would be actionable so long as he's not seeking to postpone the date of the execution, as I understand it."

Here, where you're not trying to do something that invalidates a conviction and sentence, it's not arguably appropriate to be thinking about this in the habeas context. 2241(c) says that to grant habeas relief, the petitioner has to allege that the conviction and sentence is illegal, is in violation of the Constitution.

What's analogous to our claim is a claim where the prison says a week before the execution that we're going to and effectively shackle you to a hitching post and not give you any food for 72 hours.

I think the second distinction is that an order -- particularly in States that have statutes dictating which chemicals can be used, in those cases it may be easier for a court to find that an order in that case does invalidate the sentence. Here we have a completely severable procedure. We have something that is not in any way required by the execution. And -- and the State is saying we want to do it this way, and there are 100 other ways that it can be done. And in fact, it's just the discretionary conduct of the State prison officials that puts us in this situation."

It could be done some time in advance. There was no objection expressed by Mr. Nelson in any of the lower courts to that procedure.

My position, Justice O'Connor, would be if I'm representing someone, I would put that in a habeas mostly because that's -- there is some historical precedent for those kinds of challenges coming in habeas. I think you are, in effect, saying that the sentence is invalid. It -- it should not be carried out."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENSON",
    "speech": "No. We tried really hard to not say that. What we say, it is unconstitutional to proceed with venous access in this manner, to conduct medical care in this manner. It violates recognized standards of medical care. And that's what we're saying you cannot do. We have no objection. Mr. Nelson doesn't object to lethal injection. He doesn't even object to venous access. What he objects to is some kind of inhumane cutting by people who are not qualified or competent to do that. And like any other condition of confinement, the fact that he is near an execution, the fact that he has been scheduled for an execution shouldn't exempt him from protection if the State at the last minute announces that this is what they intend to do. This has not historically been a big problem. There have been over 700 executions in this country involving lethal injections."

What I think he is objecting to is something that we regard as fairly barbaric, to have a correctional staff member come back with a scalpel, make a 2-inch cut in his arm, cut through fat and tissue to get to a vein with no assurances that that person knows what they're doing, violates the basic standards of medical decency. And it's not just a cruel and unusual punishment. This Court has created a line of cases under Estelle v. Gamble that talk about deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. This is a medical care case. Yes, he's in prison. Yes, he's on death row. Yes, he's forfeited some of his basic expectations, but he hasn't given them all away. He's still entitled to be treated with some regard."

    "speaker": "STEVENSON",
    "speech": "I -- I agree, Mr. Chief Justice. I think it -- it fits more in the cruel and unusual category because it seems so pointless to be doing it in this way. However, for all of this time, there -- there was no protocol. There was no response. There was no, in effect, effort by the State to deal with this problem and that's why we -- we made that allegation of deliberate indifference as well.

    "speech": "Yes, sir. Yes, yes, yes. That's correct. And so we're still dealing with this -­ the Eighth Amendment universe. But again, the district court was precluded from getting to any of this. If the State wants to come in and say, we think this is silly, we think it is not appropriate for the Constitution to create these kinds of protections for these kinds of prisoners, the district court can make a finding that says, I agree. What happened here, however, was the district court was precluded from ever even engaging in discussion about this issue because of this rule that, in effect, blocks people on death row facing execution and enforcing basic constitutional protections. And that's what we think is objectionable. There are several hundred executions that have taken place, 733, lethal injections that have taken place, where this has not been a problem. This is an -- an unusual medical problem. It's not a medical problem that usually presents itself, but it presented itself for the first time in Alabama. It's only come up a few times. But we do think there ought to be some constitutional protection."

I'd like to first discuss and to convince the Court that a challenge to a State's means of gaining venous access for purposes of accomplishing a lethal injection, a challenge that runs to the very core of the execution process, is indeed tantamount to a challenge of the imposition of the sentence itself and subject to habeas corpus restrictions. I hope also to -- to be able to address the remedies issue, which we were discussing with Mr. Stevenson at the end of -- of his argument. And third, I'd like to discuss the practical consequences of a decision in Nelson's favor in this case, which I think will be not only to unleash in Federal courts a torrent of -- of new challenges to all manner of State execution procedures, but also in the process, fundamentally to undermine Congress' intent to stem the tide of what President Clinton in his signing statement called endless death row appeals."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it wasn't raised because he brought 1983. But, I mean, as I understand the -- the application of the Alabama rule, 1983 was ruled out because this either should have been brought in habeas or if it had been brought in habeas, it would have been barred under AEDPA, and it would have been barred under AEDPA, because it was second or successive. So I think regardless of -- of how we analyze it, we've got to get to that point."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "NEWSOM",
    "speech": "And our position certainly is, Your Honor, that this would have been barred as second or successive. I think Justice Scalia really hit the nail on the head. It is -- Mr. Stevenson, in his argument, just has not done business, I think, with the textual and structural gymnastics required to -- to make this petition anything other than second or successive. His position, in essence, is that any claim that is new, in the sense that it could not have been brought before, is by definition not second or successive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, isn't that a possibility? In other words, one of the things we've got to do is -- is give effect to the -- to the AEDPA text. We can give effect to the -- I'm not saying that we should read it this way, but we could give effect to the AEDPA text if we say that regardless of whether a claim was ripe or not as a factual matter, so long as there is new evidence, whatever new means, the evidence is -- is not going to entitle him to relief unless it satisfies the -- the innocence prong at the end of the test. We could say that and at the same time say, all right, that's how we give effect to AEDPA. But if there is something more than ripeness, which makes the difference between bringing the claim and not bringing the claim, then that goes to whether we should regard it as second or successive. There is something more here because this is a claim which simply did not arise. He could not have pleaded this claim at any point prior to the conclusion of -- of his habeas, and for that reason, we should interpret second or successive as not barring this because otherwise we would have a universe of claims, assuming they are proper habeas claims, that could never be brought even though they state a constitutional claim."

And there's nothing in Heck v. Humphrey because it talks about necessarily implying the invalidity of the conviction or sentence, and he's not talking about the conviction and he's not talking about the sentence that was given in the judgment anyway.

Here, you've already said exactly what they're doing to him, if they had done it in order to get access to his vein for some other procedure while he's incarcerated, it would be a good, plain 1983 claim.

Without the venous access, there is no lethal injection. I think there is a very real difference between those two situations, and I can't, as I'm standing here, promise you that I know precisely where that line is between the outer bounds of an execution procedures claim and the outer bounds of a conditions of confinement claim, but what I can tell you is that this claim runs to the very core of the State's execution process."

Point two, and I think the more important point, is that it just strikes me as a bad way to administer the rule on a going-forward basis for a district court to have to sift through on a procedure-by-procedure basis to determine is this procedure in fact medically, scientifically necessary to accomplish the sentence, in which case Mr. Stevenson I think concedes that it's a habeas petition, but it's not."

We have certainly made the argument that a challenge to a State's means of gaining venous access, a challenge to -- to a procedure for carrying out an execution is in and of itself -- should be understood to be a challenge to the sentence itself and subject to habeas corpus restrictions. The State amici, the 30 States who have participated in this case on our behalf, have made very strongly the argument that a -- that a stay of execution in and of itself should be understood as a challenge to the sentence. The Court need not go so far in either respect with us today. All we ask the Court to hold today is that where -- where an inmate both challenges a procedure for carrying out his execution and, in essence, tries to tell the State, dictate to the State how to go about conducting that execution, and seeks a stay of that execution to give himself time to engage in that reordering of the process, that that should be understood as a challenge to the sentence."

For the 6-month time line that Mr. Newsom was talking about, yes, you can file a new successive State court petition under rule 32, but just as you have to in the Federal context, the State court petition has to allege factual innocence. In footnote 19 of our reply brief, I cite a case, Tarver v. State. It's a case where immediately before an execution, the prosecutor admitted that he had excluded African Americans from jury service in a discriminatory manner. He said here's our new evidence. The execution be -- should be stopped. The Court of Criminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court held no. New evidence claims must go to factual innocence. That's 32.1(e).

We went to the State courts of Alabama saying, look, the State supreme -- the United States Supreme Court is about to review this. We've got new evidence that electrocutions in Alabama are being conducted in an unconstitutional manner. Let us in. No. Your method of execution claim is not cognizable because the 2-year statute of limitations at that time is an absolute bar.

And I have to say that access to the Federal courts in this case has really changed the State's position. Nothing that we've been talking about here this afternoon about what they intend to do was ever presented to Mr. Nelson until he got in front of the Federal judge. In front of the Federal judge, they said for the first time, we will try to do a peripheral stick, not percutaneous invasion. It's a different procedure. And at page 109 of our joint appendix, the district court finds -- and I'm reading here -- the defendants have offered no explanation as to why they intend to use a cut­ down procedure instead of a percutaneous central line placement. They have never made that offer. They're making it here today. It's because we're in court, and of course, we can't get to court unless this Court recognizes our authority to bring a legitimate challenge that does not attempt to invalidate his conviction or sentence.

And that's all we're asking. That's all Mr. Nelson asked in the first instance. And the irony, of course, is if it had been permitted to proceed, I think we would have resolved this. He'd already be executed. And I think their conduct today strengthens that position. And that's why we would urgently ask this Court to reverse the rule that the Eleventh Circuit is now applying which bars prisoners like Mr. Nelson from getting Federal review. It's not asking a lot. And I understand the fears, but I don't agree with Mr. Newsom that this is opening up anything. People can file complaints now. They could have done it for the last 20 years. But district courts are not obligated to review those complaints. The PLRA puts restrictions on 1983 actions. The habeas corpus right permits -- creates restrictions. What this Court shouldn't do out of fear is to block prisoners like Mr. Nelson who have legitimate constitutional complaints from getting remedies that are precisely the kinds of claims that could and should be resolved in the manner that they've been discussed about -- discussed today easily. We tried to exhaust the administrative remedies, but until we got in front a Federal judge, no one would allow us to be heard. And that's simply the problem that we face in this case and why relief is required.
