      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: The Court today considers what is the proper standard of review for appellate courts when faced with a constitutional challenge to a punitive damage award as grossly excessive. In the instant case, the Ninth Circuit upheld a punitive damage award against Cooper Industries of 4.5 million, which 90 times the $50,000 compensatory award. It did so using an abuse of discretion review standard. We submit that that was error, that the court of appeals should have examined the constitutional excessiveness issue independently under a de novo review standard. This Court framed the gross excessiveness constitutional inquiry as it applies to punitive damages in BMW v. Gore. It identified there three guideposts for making what is essentially a comparative analysis, looking at the reprehensibility of the offense, the ratio, or relationship of the punitive damages to the compensatory award, in order to discern whether the punishment or any discernible relationship to the offense or was wildly disproportional, and as a third guidepost to look at other available sanctions, whether criminal or civil, that would bear on the question of how society generally punishes this sort of offense."

I mean, the question is whether the court abused its discretion in not considering this wildly disproportionate. Does that really boil down to any difference for -- between whether it is wildly disproportionate -- I just find it hard to imagine a situation in which I would be reviewing a district judge for abuse of discretion, and would find that it is -- that it is an abuse of discretion, where I wouldn't also find that it was wildly disproportionate."

As to historical facts, the Court accords deferential review, and we don't suggest there would be any difference as to that. But when you get to the legal issue of where you cross the constitutional line, and you start looking at it in a comparative analysis, which really is looking at extrinsic facts that are outside the record, that's where the legal inquiry comes in and de novo review would be required."

What we're saying is that it ought to get meaningful application, it ought to be applied so as to allow the courts to give some content to it and through cases to come to a more clear understanding of exactly how it applies in different cases. It is, I believe, clear, and I agree with the Chief Justice, that the de novo standard would allow courts of appeals, who believe that this was disproportionate punishment, it would allow them to apply a remittitur when, under the abuse of discretion standard, they would feel that they were not compelled to."

You're going to have a lot of cases where you're not talking about something that is so over the line. I happen to believe this case is one that is so over the line, and the point is that you've got a legal question, it's got a constitutional dimension, you've got a standard that is not one that is dependent upon looking at the historical facts and second-guessing them, and that, I believe, dictates that you look for de novo review and independent review by the courts of appeals."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Reynolds, let me ask you if I am understanding your argument correctly in this respect. I think you're making two different kinds of arguments for the value of the de novo review. The first argument is simply that de novo review on its own merits is the better review here. The second argument is sort of a practical one, that if all you have is abuse of discretion review of what the trial judge does when the trial judge reviews the jury verdict, you're not going to have very many appellate cases, and you're certainly not going to have many appellate cases with exhaustive discussions of the way jury verdicts ought to be examined. And I think you're saying that if you have de novo review, you're simply going to have more articulations by appellate courts of the way trial courts ought to look at jury verdicts, and if you are making the second argument, I suppose you're making -- you're saying what ought to happen in the development of the review of punitive damages is the same thing that I think happened back in the old days on the review of jury verdicts of negligence. If you go back in the law reports to the twenties and the thirties when negligence law was developing, you find exhaustive appellate discussions of whether, you know, the train was close enough to the intersection for the driver to have been negligent in going out on the track, and so on, and I think you're arguing for a sort of parallel between punitive damages development and maybe the old negligence law development, in that you're saying each one would profit greatly by having plenary treatment in appellate courts. Is that a fair --"

It seems to me that the court of appeals decides what is the limit on appropriate awards, and anything over whatever the ceiling is would be inappropriate. Is it your view that if there is a reversal or remand in the case, that the instruction should always be to enter judgment for the amount that would be the maximum constitutionally-permissible award, or would it be to send it back and say to the lower court, you got the range wrong, instead of being 1 million to 10 million, it's 500,000 to 2 million, and you can start over again and put the new award within the permissible constitutional range?

Now, when you get into the comparison of other penalties, as to that, I don't see why the district judge would be in a superior position at all. The judge would be in a superior position to decide how reprehensible this person's behavior was, and how harmful it was to this plaintiff, but then once we get the outer limits of that, the appellate judge on his own applies the constitutional standard as an element of deference, and there's a big element of no deference.

Gore laid out. And I believe that the de novo standard would require the kind of demanding or exacting review of those guideposts in a way that would be much more rigid and decipherable, if you will, and understandable, than if you had just an abuse of discretion review and, because it's a due process right, and it's bottomed on the interest of people being treated who are similarly situated in uniform -- uniformly in a similarly situated way, there is much to recommend that you go to the de novo standard that will, over time, I think, help to develop a much more articulate and coherent line of inquiry for applying the Gore standards."

Now, once the facts are there, it's purely a question of applying the legal label, and so the real question is, under what circumstances does a court of appeals defer, where all that's happened is the trial judge is applying the legal label to a set of undisputed facts. Now, until we get to the point of dispute, I'll give you all the discretion you want, but once we're in the nondisputed area, at that point, the only two I could find were the ones you mentioned.

In other words, consider a State which has codified standards for excessiveness of damages, as some States have, like Texas, for example. That -- the district judge has no discretion whether to apply those statutory criteria. He has no limited right to be wrong, in Judge Friendly's terms.

But let me just circle back for a moment, because the Rule 59 context, and motions for remittiturs, those have always been judged by an abuse of discretion standard, and that, of course, is where constitutional excessiveness challenges are ordinarily raised. There's quite a logic to the Cooter and Gell position that we ought to have a unitary standard of review in this area because the Rule 59 context, as Justice Breyer mentioned, will require the district judge to apply sometimes the very same standards as are in Gore to the judgment under State law requirements. The third -- the second and third Gore guideposts have been tossed out as being primarily legal, but that's not always true. The second guidepost involves actual harm as well as potential harm. Gore noted that whether a high ratio is permissible because of a particularly egregious act might have resulted only in a small number of damages. In other words, there are a number of difficult factual questions associated with each of these guideposts."

Now you give him discretion on discretion, then you say at this last step, where you're also applying this legal label that only applies to extreme cases, you're saying, and now there's some more discretion even in that, you don't have much of a rule left."

Particularly, there's a case called Kim, one called Kimzey, there's an Aetna Life case from the Ninth Circuit, so I don't believe -- the abuse of discretion standard is not a toothless standard. As this Court noted in U.S. v. Taylor, which was a 1980 Speedy Trial Act case which reversed the dismissal of a case under the Speedy Trial Act, this Court described abuse of discretion as permitting thorough appellate review, so we don't share the view --"

What's going to happen in the run-of-the-mill cases, where the result is actually reasonable and falls within what this Court described in Gore as the zone of reasonableness, those cases are going to occupy a tremendous amount of appellate resources without many differences in result, and the result of the whole process may be more unpublished opinions in punitive damages cases because the courts of appeals are busy reading records in cases where the abuse of discretion standard would have the same outcome. So we -- as a practical matter, Rule 59 is a familiar standard. The abuse of discretion review has grown up, not just under Gore, but under the State law excessiveness standards which courts have always applied historically, even though the last step of applying any of these standards could be described as a purely legal issue."

It's a judgment call that the jury makes, just as I described gross negligence and recklessness. I don't really see the difference. But the other two standards, the seriousness of the injury and the comparable awards in other cases, that the jury isn't so well-equipped to deal with, and you can say this is law applied to historic facts."

The third guidepost is a part of the jury charge in some places. It wasn't in this case -- well, there is an Oregon statute that instructs juries on the criminal and legislative sanctions which could be applied, but even those guideposts will be very factual. For example, the Cooper brief in this very case, the reply brief, leads off with three pages of factual argument about potential harm and reprehensibility and the legislative sanctions, so even at this level there's still factual disagreement about how to apply this."

Once we have passed the point of saying there can be that kind of review by the trial judge, what is it historically that would have a bearing on the question, whether the appellate court's review of the trial judge is either de novo or abuse of discretion? I would have thought that the force of historical precedent is behind us once we take the position that the verdicts can be reviewed at all?"

Does it -- is there -- is it conceivable that an award could be excessive as a matter of just general common law rulings of one kind or another, but yet not violate the Constitution?"

      "speech": "Well, it is in that way, although of course the Gore factors themselves are distilled from the common law. I mean, Your Honor did not mint them from new sources. You traced back to the common law roots, and footnote 24 of Gore in fact refers to their deep-rooted nature within the common law. So we think the common law precedents are still highly instructive. But going back to the line between compensatories and punitives. I mean, at common law there was not that line. The courts did not treat the two differently and, in fact, in footnote 7 of Cooper's reply brief they discuss the common law tradition of treating them similarly, indistinguishably, in fact, in the same verdicts, so we agree that Gasperini here is controlling, and we don't think it should be overruled or modified, and we don't think a meaningful distinction can be drawn between punitive damages and compensatories. I would just like to add, and this uniformity notion that we've heard about, first we believe the district courts are in a good position, but also, second, this Court in TXO essentially rejected a proposal for intrajurisdictional comparisons. The BMW factors are guideposts, but only guideposts. They are nonexclusive, and the question of gross excessiveness lends itself to an abuse of discretion standard rather than the de novo one. If there are no further questions, thank you very much."

In that case, the Court was looking at an excessiveness issue as it relates to compensatory damages, not to punitive, where it was very much tied up with a review of the historical facts, and that's why the Court said that deferential review was what was required in Gasperini. Here we have punitive damages that, as I've explained, are of a much different sort, and they're not tied up with the historical facts, so Gasperini does not, certainly, need to be overruled. The other point I make under Rule 59 --"

Here, we are talking about not facts tried to the jury, the historical facts, but the judgment made on the punishment side. I do think that there is a difference between nonconstitutional excessiveness and constitutional excessiveness. This Court in Brown and Ferris did say that where you're dealing with an issue of nonconstitutional excessiveness on the punitive damage side, that the deferential review would be the appropriate review, but unless what the Court has said in BMW v. Gore is superfluous, unless we're going to say that there's no difference between the constitutional excessiveness and nonconstitutional, then there is something here that requires a de novo review standard that is not just the deferential review that you have in the nonconstitutional context, and we would submit that the -- all the indicia that point to de novo review are in place here. And I would point the Court to the Salve Regina decision of this Court which does, indeed, explain why, when a de novo review is, is indeed required and necessary on a legal issue, especially of constitutional importance, that abuse of discretion is no answer to that review standard.
