      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two arguments that I would like to press this morning. The first is that a timely notice of appeal will never be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction solely because it lacks a signature. The second is an alternative argument, and that's that a typewritten signature would suffice to meet any such requirement. Let me start with the sixth circuit's review of this particular case. In their view, there is a jurisdictional signature requirement in light of the thirty-day rule under Appellate Rule 4, and in light of Civil Rule 11, which indeed does contain a signature requirement. The problem with the sixth circuit's reliance on Civil Rule 11 is that it not only contains a signature requirement, but it also contains a remedy for the absence of a signature. And in this particular case, everyone agrees -- the court-appointed amicus curiae included -- that Mr. Becker was never given an opportunity to correct this omission of a signature, whether at the district court or the court of appeals level."

In fact, Appellate Rule 1 arguably acknowledges that when it says all filings in a district court -- all filings in the courts of appeals that have been made through district courts have to comply with district court rules. So it does seem, as odd as it would appear, that Civil Rule 11 does apply to a notice of appeal, keeping in mind that Civil Rule 11 is pretty broad in nature. It says pleadings and quote other papers. So arguably that does include a notice of appeal."

In light of Appellate Rule 1, a court of appeals or a court of appeals clerk's office would be fully within its rights to contact in this case Mr. Becker, saying, Mr. Becker, we see you've typed your signature.

      "speech": "Mr. Sutton, could we go back to your answer to Justice Kennedy about Rule 11 -- isn't the answer on the other side that once you file the notice of appeal, authority over the case passes from the district court to the court of appeals, so at that point, up until the notice of appeal, you're in the district court. Once you file that notice, you are in the court of appeals and Rule 11 is a rule directed to district court and not the court of appeals. So the cure that Rule 11 provides, at least so the argument goes, would not be available in the court of appeals."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "And Your Honor, that is why I was relying on Appellate Rule 1 which incorporates those rules, and that would therefore give appellate courts authority to make sure that someone did correct the signature. If they wanted at that point to decide, well, if you're not going to correct it -- you're going to be unrepentant when it comes to this particular requirement, at that point we are going to dismiss your appeal, and in fact will do so on the merits."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "What the court has said and what the rules reflect is that as soon as the district court clerk receives the notice of appeal, it doesn't say anything about validity, it is immediately sent to the court of appeals. And I think -- but I think that does raise a second answer to Mr. Baker's argument -- the point Justice Ginsburg is getting at, it is true that to find a notice of appeal immediately vests jurisdiction in the court of appeals over the merits of the case, but that doesn't preclude district courts from acting on collateral matters; that's when they can act on stay motions, bond motions, attorney fee motions. This arguably could be such a collateral act. It wouldn't go to the merits of the case. It would, however, and I think there would be one problem here, and that would be interpretation. The district courts would have authority to enforce this as a jurisdictional rule, and you would have district court judges dismissing appeals of their own cases. That seems problematic, and I think kind --"

      "speaker": "SUTTON",

Well, I guess one quick question is if Mr. Baker's interpretation is correct, how in the world would you enforce it? Put yourself in the position of the poor clerk of, let's say, the sixth circuit. They get, let's say, Mr. Becker's notice of appeal but instead of a typewritten signature, it just says Becker in the caption, Becker in the body, blank -- we'll say for the sake of argument -- signature line. How would you know whether the person is represented or not? You would have no way of knowing whether the attorney -- you don't have to sign rule -- or the pro se -- you do have to sign rule, applies. Indeed, the only way to enforce it would have the clerk do what I think they should be doing in these cases, which is picking up the phone and calling and saying you need to be signing, you need to include that appellant. Of course if the question under Mr. Baker's rule was the clerk now calls and says are you represented, well, there is a good answer and a bad answer to that question. If you say you're represented, you're okay. Jurisdiction vested, you didn't have to sign, and if you say you're pro se, you're gone. So I can't imagine that's what they meant, given that particular problem. The only problem with it -- there is actually a few -- is if you turn the page to 6(a) and look at Rule"

I mean, before this, before Mr. Becker's case the sixth circuit had a general rule that they'd applied only in multiple appellant pro se cases where the absence of, quote, a signature created this jurisdictional defect, and that's, they dismissed the appellants who had not signed. And I assume what happened, but again, I am assuming, I have no idea what happened. All I know is that it took seven months for the appeal to be dismissed. So that leads me to believe this went to the section of the sixth circuits that handles those types of appeals. Someone, at least partly correctly, realized their Mattingly Rule, saw that you had the typewritten signature, and I guess in an act of, you know, precision, at least in their view, thought that didn't count, but didn't give Mr. Becker an opportunity to argue otherwise that, you know, his typewritten signature would suffice or, for that matter, to make the point you should never apply this multiple party rule on the contest of a single appellant who's put his name on the notice of appeal three times."

    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "Well, this is division that really -- that did exist in the lower courts. There was not a division on the single appellant problem -- they've all ruled our way. But in the lower courts you've got some, take the seventh circuit as an example, that said it's nonjurisdictional and they say they just simply ask someone to correct it and clarify whether all three appellants meant to appeal, even though only one of them hand-signed the notice. And others say, no, that's jurisdictional. They look at this Court's decision in Torres and say you've got to establish within the four corners of the document within thirty days a, quote, intent to appeal. I think the seventh circuit view is the better view. I mean, this is a minimalistic requirement. In fact, it all comes from a statute. The Rules aren't allowed under Rule 1 to expand or shrink the courts of appeals' jurisdictions; the only statutory requirement is 28 U.S.C. 2107, and that just says just get your intent, just file the notice of appeals within thirty days.

And the question is whether the Appellate, Civil Rules or any other rules somehow require a pen-and-ink signature. There is no definition of the verb signed or the noun signature or signer anywhere in the Rules; that's not of much help. The dictionary definition circa 1938 or even 1993 are equivocal -- they go both directions -- so that's not of much help.

I think it's a fair assumption when you see in the body of the notice of appeal all three parties listed, or for that matter in the caption as the Rule allows -- that's enough.

In the second part of your argument you're now assuming that signature just means a typewritten signature, so I assume it would follow that if you left that out, it will also be properly filed.

That's just not true. Whether it is one appellant or fifty-five appellants.

They've done so in numerous unpublished opinions. The fact that they're unpublished, I think, suggests that they don't believe that there is any difference between single or multiple appellants, and that distinction has been introduced by Petitioner's attorney at this stage, and this stage only."

When something is filed in this Court -- a cert petition and it is deficient but it is on time -- our clerk will send it back for the deficiency to be cured."

    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "speech": "Yes. The -- the difficulty with that is that Rule 4 sets a thirty-day limit on filing of proper notice of appeal, and therefore if you can correct it within the thirty days there is not a problem, but if you can't correct it within the thirty days, there is a jurisdictional issue that arises. It arises --"

We have spoken, I guess, in the Torres case that the touchstone is the clear intent to appeal, and if the document is clear as it was in this case, who the appellant is and that it was timely filed and so on, why should that be jurisdictional and not correctable later?"

    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "speech": "Well, the difficulty with taking that approach is first that Rule 11 is a district court rule; it sets form requirements and it tells the court what it can do in response to an unsigned notice of appeal. A portion of that comes to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure but simply the form requirements -- not the authority to take action -- it would be very --"

And then it goes on to say the proposed amendment would make it clear that when this is so, the motion or application is to be made in the form and manner prescribed in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In other words it says that if there is a form and manner requirement, you must meet it in the district court. I think it would be unusual for the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to say, and by the way you can borrow whatever authority the district court may have."

And the Advisory Committee, which addressed this question after Torres made it quite clear that specify the parties is a jurisdictional requirement, had in front of them language that would have gotten rid of the signature requirement, and instead modified that language to make it clear that a signature was expected from every pro se party filing a notice of appeal."

I mean the one thing that rule -- that thing does is to say that the widow or the wife and the child can come along without signing it, I mean, we know that when they made that change in Rule 3, what they wanted to do is enable people to be parties who hadn't signed, and then to say, well, now, that instituted for the first time a -- a statement in the Rules that the pro se litigant must sign is kind of a backdoor way to create a signing requirement."

I mean, take a look at Rule 1 -- it says when these rules provide for filing a document in the district court, the procedure must comply with the practice of the district court.

It is hard to read that language without coming to the conclusion that there is something about the notice of appeal, and the standards for notice of appeal, that is --that requires a signature from pro se parties, and there are good, obviously policy, reasons for wanting to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "speech": "I think though that the principal problem that the signature requirement addresses is the risk that someone is practicing law -- probably without a license -- on behalf of a party who may or may not understand what is being done in his name. The signature requirement allows the court to be sure that the party who is nominally appearing pro se in fact has had a chance to think about what he is doing, and to examine the contents of what has been filed in his name. That is the reason that in multiple appellant cases -- this rule has been applied without controversy, yet because it is obvious there that one party may be proceeding to draft pleadings that the others may not have seen. But in the context of single appellants as well, there are numerous areas of law where there is an active cottage industry of assisting pro se litigants -- not just prison cases but bankruptcy cases, immigration cases, where people who hold themselves out as grievance consultants or other forms of quasi- lawyer, have taken to filing pro se papers on behalf of parties. The signature requirement at least requires that those pro se parties have a chance to see what has been done in their names."

If an attorney says I represent these parties and they're taking the appeal and he's not telling the truth, he's subject to a wide variety of sanctions that would not apply to a non-lawyer who made that same representation and therefore, it's a -- it's a plausible distinction to -- to draw."

I -- I think it would be useful to take a look at the yellow brief pages of A-2 and A-3 because, in fact, the form that Mr. Becker got is outdated even by the sixth circuit standards. If you go to the sixth circuit website, you go to the notices and download the forms, the form you will get is the form on page A-3 of the yellow brief, not on page A-2 which is the form that Mr. Becker submitted. Indeed, if you look at the -- at the lower lefthand corner of each of those documents, you'll see that each of them is labeled 6CA3, which is the name of the -- the number of the form. Each of them in fact on the originals has a GPO designation, but the notice on page A-3 is dated January '99 as opposed to August of '79, and this is the pages -- the form on page A-3 is the form that is available to litigants, and that should be sent out, and it certainly calls for a signature, has the little s. So there may well have been a mistake here in Mr. Becker's case, but I think it would be going beyond the facts that we have in the record to assume that this is a policy on the part of the Sixth Circuit to send out a notice of appeal when it's not --"

Rule 11 says sign everything you file in the district court.

      "speech": "Well, again it's not a question of not paying attention; it's a question of whether it can be cured, whether we know that the thirty days can't be cured once that runs, but the -- the question is whether something like the signature shouldn't be curable, when everything is there, his name is -- is in the caption, his name is in the body of the notice."

If I could touch briefly on the question of whether the Rules Enabling Act prevents the application of this rule, I think it is answered by the Torres case which said, after all, that even though it was perfectly obvious in that case that all of the plaintiffs who had lost intended to seek the appeal, the fact that one of the plaintiffs' names had been left off of the document meant that there was no notice of appeal as to him, and that the requirements of the parties be specified with a jurisdictional requirement. I don't think the Rules Enabling Act said, wait a minute, you're narrowing the scope of the notice of appeal."

My first point, and I apologize for raising it at this stage, is there is a question whether this is fairly covered by the question presented, but the Court drafted a question presented that presumes there has been a failure to sign here. It did so after the petitioner had filed a petition that made reference to some of the cases that address the question whether a signed notice of appeal could be -- whether a signing constituted typing. So there is a real question whether the Court in framing this question didn't exclude this issue or --"

      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "speech": "Exactly, and therefore either you've already decided this, which I suspect is not the appropriate answer, or it's not part of the case because there was no conflict in the circuits on that question. If I could turn also to the question of a lawyer not signing -- I think Mr. Sutton made the argument that an attorney -- if you were a represented party and you did not sign, it would not be jurisdictional. If you were a non-represented party and you did not sign, it would be jurisdictional, and that there would be some doubt about that possibility raised the prospect, I think, of people trying to game the system by rushing out and hiring lawyers or having lawyers submit things that weren't signed. I think it's worth remembering this is not a difficult requirement to meet. Signing the notice of appeal is an easy thing to do; it provides useful confirmation to the court that every party who is part of the notice of appeal actually has seen and has willingly joined in it. And so the likelihood that people will game this system in order to avoid signing the notice of appeal I think is -- is highly unlikely."

      "speaker": "BAKER",

Certainly I would say that Rule 3(c) and its provisions which say that you must specify the party or parties taking the appeal -- that's what the Torres case held, that failure to specify is a jurisdictional fault, designation of the judgment appealed from, designation of the court appealed to. And as I said, most -- many courts had held that to specify the party included a signature requirement as part of determining intent to appeal."

It doesn't have to be in the form of a notice of appeal, but that information has got to be part of the notice of appeal or, in the absence of one of those elements, it's jurisdictionally --"

      "speech": "I -- I -- I would -- I would argue that in fact when the Advisory Committee -- the only substantive revision of Rule 3(c) that's been made was made in 1993 by the Advisory Committee. When they made that change, there was none of this division into sub -- separate subparagraphs of 3(C). There was a requirement to do the three things -- to specify the three things. The first was specify the parties, and what the Advisory Committee did was insert this reference to a signature by a pro se party directly after the requirement that the party taking the appeal be specified, and I think the only conclusion you can draw from that is they believed that they were providing a gloss on how to specify the party or parties taking the appeal."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "speech": "Yes. But as I said, the entire effort by the Advisory Committee was to insert -- it was to clarify what it meant to specify the party so people wouldn't make mistakes in the future. If I could make one point in closing, it's that I was struck as I was reading the cases that we've been talking about here, such as Torres, the Foman case from the '60s, Houston and Flack -- all of the cases that construe the rules of the court -- of the appellate courts -- that almost none of them have survived in terms of their holdings. Almost every one has been modified by the Advisory Committee and the rules process. Given the number of problems we've turned up in this area, I think that it's inevitable that this issue is bound for the Advisory Committee one way or the other, and yet we still cite all those cases, and we cite them not for their particular holding, but for the way they analyzed these problems. If they say, well, you know, the rules can be bent to achieve a certain aim, then that's what they stand for. If they say the rules should be read in as straightforward and lawyerly a way as one can and take the consequences, then that's what those rules -- those cases stand for. I would submit that if you take the latter course, the Sixth Circuit should be affirmed. Thank you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "A few brief points. First of all, in defense of Dale Becker, the form he used is actually the form that's now attached to the Sixth Circuit rules. It is not outdated. It is attached to their current rules. Second, the notion that prison inmates should be consulting websites to get the forms doesn't seem to me plausible. Third, when it comes to the forms that Mr. Baker has relied upon, if you look at our yellow brief, there is a great irony here to his argument that this signature rule only applies to pro se appellants. Every one of the forms refers to signatures for attorneys. If you look at the one that's attached to the Federal Rules -- that's at A-1 -- it's clear the signature requirement is not for the pro se -- it says the s and then attorney. And then you look at Mr Becker's -- Baker's -- Becker's form, it's counsel for appellant. You then look at the next one and it has attorney. Every single one of them, if there is a signature requirement at all, it's referring to attorneys. There is no indication that pro se litigants and pro se litigants alone are expected to sign these things in whatever manner. Every other point that Mr. Baker has raised -- and there are many policy problems out there -- they are all problems that show at most there is a signature requirement, not a signature jurisdictional requirement. Every single one of those issues can be cured and addressed after the thirty days. Thank you."
