    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For three reasons, the important Federal policy favoring arbitration would be seriously undermined if courts become entangled in speculative litigation over arbitration remedies. First, the enforceability of a limitation on remedies in arbitration ought to be decided in the first instance by the arbitrator, since that's not a gateway issue of arbitrability. Second, it's unlikely in this case that the arbitrator would have found that the limitations on remedies agreed by the parties would have precluded the award of RICO treble damages, and third, there is simply no reason why parties found by the district court to be sophisticated cannot mutually agree to limit remedies. Turning, then, to --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Grauer, on the second point that you made, you said it's unlikely that the arbitrators would find that treble damages are inconsistent with the -- with the contracts. Would you, supposing this case were to be before the arbitrator, would you concede that the contracts in question permit treble damages awards on a RICO claim? Would you make that contention?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "On your first point, suppose you have a contract that is very clear that there can be no triple damages under RICO, that's right in the contract, is it your position that that goes to the arbitrator and it's for the arbitrator to say that this violates public policy and I'm going to -- well, I mean, what would happen in that case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "Yes, we believe that it's for the arbitrator to decide. We believe that there's essentially a 40-year tradition of allowing arbitrators to make decisions of that nature and of allowing issues of the remedies that can arise in arbitration to be decided by the arbitrator."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "Well, the arbitrator is bound first and foremost, under both the law and under the arbitration clauses in this case, to comply with the controlling law. This Court has held several times, in Mitsubishi, in Vimar, in Gilmer, and in other cases that we should not suppose that the arbitrator will not follow the law. We should assume that the arbitrator will follow the law and, therefore, if the law requires the award of treble damages, even if the parties have agreed otherwise, the arbitrator is bound to follow that law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What's our best case, or is there one, for the proposition that if the contract says the arbitrator may not do X, and X violates public policy, that the arbitrator goes ahead and does it anyway? What's our case that says that?"

  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "I believe that that would be found in Mitsubishi, in the Vimar y Seguros case at page 541, in the McMahon case at page --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but I'm not sure in any of those cases it was clear that the contract in very explicit terms said, you cannot do this. I -- I -- I recognize that in those cases it does say if there's important public policy it can't be overturned by the arbitration."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "I think the -- one example -- there are several examples, but one that comes to mind is that in the Vimar case the COGSA prevented the arbitrator from -- the COGSA prevented any reduction in liability in a bill of lading, and -- and there was a concern that the law in Japan which had been selected to conduct the arbitration had a different set of rules that could have allowed the stevedores to be -- to have liability laid off on the stevedores, and yet the Court said, we will not indulge in the presumption that the arbitrator will not follow the appropriate law and, therefore, even though Japanese law was different, the arbitrator, we assumed, would follow the controlling law. Now, in this particular case, it's -- it's not only true that the -- that the Court has held several times that we should not assume that an arbitrator will fail to follow the controlling law, but all of the arbitration agreements, and I would cite the Court to the joint appendix, pages 84, 147, 168, and 212, in each of the arbitration agreements in this case, the arbitrator is admonished to follow the controlling law."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

Now, what's the arbitrator to do with a provision like that? Is that not the kind of thing that courts have looked at and determined whether that's a valid public policy or not?"

  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "I wouldn't agree with the Court looking at that, and here's why. I agree that what you read, Justice O'Connor, is, in fact, what's in that agreement, but if you read on in that sentence it says, and the arbitrator shall follow the controlling law. At best, there is a conflict or a tension between those terms, and this is what arbitrators do all the time. There are all these agreements that are -- that every day are presented to arbitrators that have a number of provisions that could step on each other, and -- and the arbitrator has to interpret the contract. That's what we bargained for in entering an arbitration agreement, that if there was some tension, or some confusion or dispute, that the arbitr --"

Is -- am I correct in understanding that waiver would be academic because you're not going to make the argument of waiver, you're going to make -- you're going to concede that treble damages are available if a RICO violation is found?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "Absolutely. I agree with that, Justice Ginsburg, and as a matter of fact for two reasons, not only because we've made that concession, but also because we agreed to arbitrate. That means we agreed to submit any issues to the arbitrator and therefore, even if we had not made that concession, we would believe that the arbitrator ought to be asked in the first instance to decide the validity of a waiver."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "To the extent -- yes, I think it could, and here's why. The one thing that this Court has said, no fewer than four times, and -- and has emphasized I think those four times, is that when a statutory claim is arbitrated, there -- the -- we assume that post arbitration review is sufficient to ensure the vindication of statutory interests, and the Court mentioned that not only in McMahon at page 232, in Gilmer at footnote 4, and also in Vimar and in Mitsubishi. In all four of those cases, this Court has specific -- excuse me -- this Court has specifically said that -- that, while limited, post arbitration review is sufficient to ensure that statutory interests are vindicated."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In other words, it's quite simple. I don't see what's so complicated about this. I thought what you were saying, and I thought that's what the law was, but tell me if I'm not right, please, is, interpreting the contract is a matter for the arbitrator, but once we know what the contract means, then whether that contract, as interpreted, provides sufficient remedy to be valid as an arbitration contract is for the judge."

  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, why not the second? I mean, after all, if I have a contract which says, Jones and Smith agree to arbitrate all damage claims, but no damages shall ever be awarded, no matter what, okay, that's pretty clear that the enforcement of that would invalidate that arbitration agreement because it can't be enforced. The person who should say that is the judge, because the judge says, look, you people don't have an arbitration contract. Now, why you'd leave that to the arbitrator -- I guess you could, but I think that is a gateway matter that I think you'd have to be quadruple clear about that somebody wanted that point decided by an arbitrator. Now, that's how I'm understanding it, so I'd like you to correct me if I'm wrong."

    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "I'm not sure I followed the first part of the hypothetical."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The first part's very simple. What the contract means is for the arbitrator. The parties have agreed to that. But once we know what it means, whether it is an enforceable arbitration contract or violates some anti -- some statute that says -- or some public policy and the -- which means, you two cannot arbitrate this kind of thing with this kind of agreement, that question of arbitrability is for the judge, because it is a gateway matter. If, in fact, this contract for arbitration is unlawful, as against pubic policy or whatever, then there is no arbitration contract, and that matter is a matter for the judge, unless the parties clearly indicate that they want it to be decided by an arbitrator. And I read through those cases a little while ago, and that seemed to me what they said, and so I wrote it into an opinion which I think every member of this Court but one agreed to."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "Justice Breyer, I agree with the first part, and that is this, that the gateway issue of arbitrability involves the determination of, did the parties make a valid agreement to arbitrate and, if they did, is the dispute within the scope of that agreement, but that should end, in our view, the inquiry, because if you don't end the inquiry at that point, you're -- you're opening the door to questions about remedies and legal issues and what are the elements of the cause of action and what have the parties agreed to, and let me give you an example. The parties -- I sell you 10,000 widgets for a dollar each, as is, and no -- and liquidated damages of $1 and no other liability, and we agree to that, okay. Now, the person then sues for RICO because they want to get around that. Well, the only issue ought to be, did the parties make a valid agreement to arbitrate and, if so, is the dispute in the scope of that agreement, and the fact that there may be a downstream dispute about the validity of the remedies and the validity of the waiver of the remedies should not, under any circumstances, spill over into the gateway --"

There are a lot of words in this case, and we feel that we bargained to have an arbitrator interpret them, and as I indicated to Justice Ginsburg, it was conceded some time ago that the term, extracontractual was not in -- was intended to be noneconomic damages and was not intended to be primarily remedial RICO treble damages, but --"
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "I agree, Mr. Chief Justice. I -- I believe that the importance of the Court's recent pronouncement in Howsam about gateway arbitrability as we read that case is that you determine, did the parties intend to subject themselves to the power of an arbitrator? Did they make an arbitration agreement, and is the dispute within the scope of that agreement, and if the answers to those questions are yes, the only additional issue that comes up, and the one that unfortunately became conflated in the Eleventh Circuit below, is where there is a statutory claim, there is an additional analysis that this Court has traditionally done, and that is, did Congress, by enacting that statute, intend to override or preempt the Federal Arbitration Act, and that's the issue that has come up, and unfortunately what's happened in the Eleventh and the Ninth Circuits is that they have taken that concept of simply making a determination of whether another statute is -- preempts the Federal Arbitration Act, and they've used it to create essentially a floating analysis of effective vindication that's untethered to the statutory conflict analysis."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay, how -- how clear has it got to be before there is some kind of a tether? Let's assume you had a simpler case than this one in which the arbitration agreement provided -- this is silly, but for the sake of a point, that no damages will be awarded by the arbitrator for the violation of any statutory claim, as distinct from a tort claim, common law tort claim, or a contract claim. Would you say that in that case there was, in fact, a threshold question of arbitrability because that provision went so clearly to the validity of the agreement that it should be treated as a, could be properly treated as a threshold matter for a court?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "In -- in -- in your situation, the reason I say your situation would depend is that there are many contracts where that would be a perfectly legitimate understanding. For example, I -- I'll sell you 10,000 widgets, $1 each, I haven't checked them over, they may be no darned good, but you want them for $1 each, and I don't want to be sued for this, so I want liquidated damages of $1. That type of commercial arrangement --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yeah, but in that case you're -- well, and again, maybe -- maybe this is where it gets theoretical. In -- in that case, in effect, you're -- you're waiving any statutory claim at the beginning. In -- in the case I gave, maybe it's the same point, I just said you waive damages. I -- I suppose you wouldn't waive -- on that theory you wouldn't be waiving equitable remedies if there were any, so -- so let's just take my case. You waive the damages -- you don't waive the claim. You waive the damages. You don't waive the right to equitable remedy. Is -- is that -- is the -- is the -- in effect the -- the waiver of the right to damages in the arbitration agreement sufficient to raise a serious enough question about the enforceability of the arbitration agreement to qualify that question as a gateway question?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "I believe the answer is no, with one exception. In general, anything relating to remedies should be dealt with by the arbitrator, and we should assume that -- that if there is something improper about that remedial limitation, that the arbitrator will -- will do what he or she is supposed to do, follow the law, get it right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay, but you're saying, I think you're saying, and -- and correct me if I 'm wrong, that -- that no remedial question can ever rise to the level of a -- a potential threat to the potential -- to -- to vindication of statutory rights. Whatever that phrase may mean, as we have employed it, a mere question of -- of waiver of remedies will never rise to that level and, hence, will never get to the threshold question status, is that correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "As a general premise, I believe that's correct. I think we could envision situations where a variety of factors, including that, are linked together such that the plaintiff might make a motion to revoke the arbitration agreement itself on the, on traditional contract grounds should there be a whole series of things that make a contract unconscionable or onerous, but that did not occur in this case. In fact, the court found that it was not unconscionable or onerous. It was negotiated between sophisticated parties, and so the court declined to do section 2 revocation of the contract for generally applicable contract grounds, but there could be a case where a remedial limitation, combined with other factors, could rise to that level, not -- certainly not this case. The problem --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",

  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "Right, and -- and it's very important to note an additional distinction, and that is, the -- the attack on unconscionability cannot be on the contract as a whole, because if it is, under Prima Paint that, too, should be decided by the arbitrator.

And -- and in this particular case, for example, the arbitration clause does contain a limitation on remedies, but that limitation on remedies could have been put elsewhere in the contract, and if it were somewhere else in the contract, or it might have been -- the parties might not have agreed to arbitrate. They might have agreed that we'll litigate in Florida, but the Court will not have the power to award punitive damages. Now, you would not say that the limitation on punitive damages prevents the parties from having to go to Florida, and you need to treat an arbitration clause, we think, the same, or the parties might have had the remedial limitation in this case, and no arbitration clause. Now, what would a court do? It would -- the court would evaluate the validity of the remedial limitation and make a decision. Well, an arbitrator is exactly the same.

It's exactly the opposite. You go one step further, since this case involves an issue of public policy, and in both W. R. Grace, and later in Misco and in Eastern Associated Coal Corporation, this Court said that questions of public policy are for the court, not for the arbitrator."

I mean, other defendants didn't do that here. The Well Point didn't --"

If you go back to Mitsubishi and follow every case right through Waffle House, this Court over and over and over again has quoted the portions of Mitsubishi, and footnote 19 from Mitsubishi, saying that you're only changing the forum when you're arbitrating."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "WHATLEY",
    "speech": "Well, the problem with that -- the problem with that is, doing it after the fact has some pretty severe policy implications."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In other words, what they wanted to have is an arbitration between doctors and hospitals, and the single most likely, or a very, very likely kind of dispute they call tort disputes, aren't even covered by the arbitration agreement, and it's impossible for an arbitrator to come to a different conclusion."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "WHATLEY",
    "speech": "And -- and the arbitrators almost invariably say, you know, this is -- this is what created me, the contract is my Bible, where I get my directions, and if the contract says very plainly, no extracontractual damages, even if later on it says, and follow the law, and if it says -- says that you can't vary or ignore the terms of this agreement, which this agreement says, that is a strong impediment against an arbitrator awarding appropriate relief where you've got a Federal statute that creates tort-like damages."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Every one of these contracts says the arbitrator will follow the law, the arbitrator has no power to commit errors of law. Mr. Grauer, I think, said that those provisions may be intention, but when they are, the one that controls is the one that says the arbitrator must follow the law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WHATLEY",
    "speech": "Well, that's good, and now that the issue has been specifically raised, and after the fact, after it's raised they come in and waive it. The concern we have is, what about the times when it's not specifically raised? What about the times when you go forward through arbitration and perhaps --"

It was only then, having been caught, that they say, okay --"

    "speaker": "WHATLEY",

They were never before an arbitrator, but that's when it was finally waived, after the issue was specifically presented, and the judge was not going to enforce it, and that's when Judge Moreno said no, we're not going to allow this after the fact waiver."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "After the fact -- when did he think it should have been waived in order to -- to assist the petitioner here?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "WHATLEY",
    "speech": "Well, but the problem with that is, Your Honor, it means that that provision is still there. It's still addressed."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, absolutely."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WHATLEY",
    "speech": "Well, if parties settle a case, that's a very different question, because this is a prospective provision that applies out into the future, and that's the difference. The way -- that's the whole difference about our argument about waiver that's presented to you. Of course people waive things in settlements all the time, but they don't waive things prospectively, and this Court hasn't allowed the waiver of statutory rights prospectively. That's the big difference."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The big question for arbitration is, was there a violation of RICO, and I think one of the questions from the bench suggested that the scope of remedy doesn't rise to the same level as, is there a violation of the act, and if in this case the arbitrator should find that if there is no violation of RICO on the part of care organizations, then there would never be any issue of remedy."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "WHATLEY",
    "speech": "That's true, but if -- if -- if a court or an arbitrator can't grant the remedies that Congress has authorized for a violation, including for a criminal violation, if the court can't grant that relief, then there is a serious public policy problem with putting the parties into that forum to make that decision."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And just what is that public policy problem?"
  },

Do you take the position that under this contract the arbitrator could not award simple compensatory damages?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "WHATLEY",
    "speech": "Actually, it did not. In this instance, it really simplified the situation, because here what you're dealing with, and what the focus of the claims are on, is -- is the automatic adjudication of claims the way they -- the way they adjudicate claims of doctors through computerized processes that by computerization automatically down-code a bundle. You're dealing with claims that are $5, $10, $15, that frankly can't be resolved through an arbitration process or any process on a claim by claim basis, but the judge said, you've got to go forward in arbitration on the breach of contract claims and, since those weren't practical to pursue in any forum, we made the decision, and the -- and the doctors, the individual doctors made the decision not to pursue them. Those are over. It was resolved very efficiently in the district court on whether the claims should be arbitrated or not arbitrated, and that dispute ended, and -- and so it was done very, very efficiently in this instance."

Now, if you were drafting this, and you wanted it to mean the first, rather than meaning the second, why didn't you just write the words, there won't be a tort case?"

But I mean -- I mean, they wrote it, and -- and -- and it's really our position that they wrote it to discourage doctors from being able to -- to -- to recover claims in arbitration, and to limit what doctors could recover, not only to send them to arbitration, but then also to place limits on what they could get once they got there, because they didn't limit, they didn't have a provision, like they seem to say in their briefs, we waive, each party waives punitive damages against the other, and then you would have to consider under State law, can you do that, depending on where you are. Instead, they say --"

It's not, you send it to the jury and the sky's the limit, so I don't understand your answer about it being bound up with anything -- it's -- it's an ordinary measure of compensatory damages that the judge, the arbitrator or the judge, whichever forum you're in, triples."

With -- with the development of that, then -- then we don't see there -- we see severe problems, especially as that law developed, and especially as the tax, your -- your -- based on your tax decisions, saying treble damages are punitive damages."

What I'm saying is that in instances where someone like United or Pacificare decides not only to insist on an arbitration agreement but also to place limits on what the remedies are that the arbitrator can award, and that's what they did here, in those instances, the Court should look at what those limitations are on remedies and make a public policy determination if there's a Federal statutory claim out there."

You all are all much closer to it than I am, but as I read Howsam, it draws the procedural, substantive distinction. Remedies are not procedural issues, and remedies can have a direct impact on public policy questions, and so for that limited area --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but what's involved, which is identical, is the kind of prudential consideration for courts, don't decide a difficult issue unless you have to. Now, in Vimar it just said, look, we may never have to decide this. Send it to the arbitrator and see. Now what you've suggested is to my mind a pretty tough issue."

The petitioner represented to us that you represented to this Court that if any issue is sent to arbitration you simply will give up the claim, that you will not arbitrate any issue in this case. Do you still take that position, that -- is this representation correct, that you have disclaimed any intention to arbitrate any claim sent to arbitration?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WHATLEY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, that gets back to the problem that I was addressing before. The claims here on a claim by claim basis are so small that you cannot take them to arbitration."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "WHATLEY",
    "speech": "Well, because -- and -- and -- and I know you're going to address this issue in Basil to some extent, but the issue in court, the issues have been certified in the court, so they're proceeding as a class action, which is the only way that -- that claims of this magnitude can be handled, and so that's our problem. If we could proceed in arbitration on a class-wide basis, sure we would do it, and -- and doing that in the Federal system has limits thus far, but -- but proceeding on a claim by claim basis, where the damages are $5, $10, $15, $50 for the bundling down claim --"

  {
    "speaker": "GRAUER",
    "speech": "Mr. Whatley's argument about $5 here and $10 there is flatly inconsistent with what the district judge found, and you can note at page A25 of our cert petition that the court found that these cases were negotiated by sophisticated groups of doctors, that the claims were not small, that in fact the doctors were enlarging an ongoing pattern -- that's about midway through page A25 of our cert petition, that that is an ongoing pattern of instances. Mr. Whatley's comment about the -- the conspiracy claim has been certified and is going forward is exactly an example of the problem. Conspiracy is simply a remedy that's -- that --a way of creating liability for an underlying cause of action, and the arbitration clauses in this case require the doctors to arbitrate all of their disputes with the managed care companies, and they're trying to circumvent that on a mass basis both in this appeal and by trying to say that the conspiracy claims are not part of the arbitration clause, and we don't think that's appropriate, and we think when we talk about remedies in our cert petition, that would include methods of holding someone liable for a claim, and the Court ought to take a look at that in the record of the case. But I would agree fundamentally with a point that I -- I thought I heard Justice Souter making a moment ago, and that is that if Mr. Whatley's premise that any remedial limitation becomes a gateway issue of arbitrability, we are throwing -- we are overruling Howsam after only a few weeks, because the whole point of Howsam was, you look to whether the parties made an agreement to arbitrate, and you look to whether the dispute is in the scope of the agreement. And here, at page A40 of our petition, the Court finds this is an exceptionally broad arbitration agreement. It includes any and all controversies, and the Court found that. That has never been appealed. Every -- all of the claims are within the scope of it, and it is complete speculation to suggest that that, that any of these claims are not within the scope of the arbitration agreement. The -- the -- with re -- a final point with reference to the intent of the parties. The parties would intend an arbitrator to decide remedial limitations, and the reason why the parties would intend the arbitrator to decide that is because the parties have agreed to arbitrate. They have a dispute in the scope. They would never intend to go to court at all. They would intend to go to arbitration and comply with their agreement, and the question of remedies would be the last thing that would come up in the event, on a speculative basis, that they prevail, and they ought not to be able to get away from that basic principle by labels, the label of punitive damages, the label of RICO, the label of conspiracy. Those labels are being used to take away the rights of managed care companies on a wholesale, nationwide basis to have these types of disputes resolved by arbitrators, as the parties have agreed, and instead they're trying to turn it into a nationwide class action."
