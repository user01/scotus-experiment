Warren's position is that the flowing of that single body of water through Warren's five dams is not a discharge into that same single body of water. In arguing that certification under section 401 of the Clean Water Act is, therefore, not required, we are not maintaining that the State either has, or should have, no voice on matters of water quality in connection with the relicensing of these dams. In 1986, Congress took care to ensure States a forceful, but not controlling, voice on environmental issues, including water quality issues, in all hydropower relicensing proceedings. Congress was very specific about its intent in 1986, and it intended to give States a strong voice, but not a veto. So, we feel the case -- that the States clearly have that voice. Now --"

Your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, had it for 5 years. In that situation, one could say that there may be a discharge into the river when an activity is proposed to pour that back into the river.

It's the same water, in a sense, but it's also qualitatively different in its oxygen and other characteristics. And that sounded to me like a discharge."

Similarly, you can have changes in other aspects of the water. All of those have been classified by the EPA as nonpoint source pollution.

And the Respondents have taken those general pronouncements to basically say, \"Anything that allows the States greater control or improvement over water quality is the direction in which the statute should be interpreted, to achieve that general purpose.\" However, we know that, notwithstanding the general purposes, that Congress, when it turned to approve specific words in 401, did not simply say \"anything that affects water quality.\" It divided a line. And that line, for example, means that Federal permits for grazing, or Federal permits for logging roads, do not trigger 401; and they do not trigger it, because there is no discharge from a point source. So, we know a line has been drawn by Congress in pursuit of its purpose, as compared to other goals that Congress has in mind. The question is, Where was that line drawn? We think you look to the statute to see where that was drawn, and it was \"discharge into the navigable waters.\" Otherwise, what we're left with is, we're left with trying to, sort of, almost metaphysically think of the water discharge -- the same water discharging into the same water in order to reach a conclusion that the real way you should read the statute is just as if it says, \"If one does anything at all to the water, you need to get certification.\" And we don't think it says that.

We do -- we do not see how that would leave any sense of cooperative federalism, and it would tell Congress, \"In 1986, you were just entirely wasting your time, because you had already, in '72, given them the power to control everything.\""

They're sort of the odd man out, because it's their jurisdiction that's being taken away; and yet we're talking about a Clean Water Act case where EPA is the agency defined with that Act. FERC has argued to the courts, on several occasions, that 401 needs to be limited to discharge of pollutants. FERC, at one point, the first several dam proceedings that came up, it didn't even require certifications at all. It then promulgated certification requirements that said, \"Either get a certification or otherwise comply with the law.\" And then, in the interim period, it is simply -- as we've been affected, simply said, \"Go get your certifications.\" It then tried to say, \"But we can do something about it if we don't like them.\" And the Circuit Courts, at least one, has said, \"No, you can't.\" And when 401 applies, as this Court found in Public Utility Districts versus Jefferson, it is a robust power. It is an awesome power that is given to the States under 401. And to -- giving that power greatly cabined-in FERC's authority to now extend that power automatically to any conduct that in any way \"touches on the water\" by turning \"touches on the water\" or \"moving the water\" into \"discharge into the water\" -- effectively wipes out that balance entirely. I would note, too, that we don't even -- we can answer all of this without even getting into those by going back to the statute.

My point was that in a great many of those instances, the statute is not merely using the word in isolation; it's using it in connection with a couple of other words, like \"discharge a pollutant.\" And it, therefore, number one, makes sense to construe \"discharge of a pollutant\" differently from \"discharge.\" That's the -- that's the only point."

I just want to remind the Court that section 401 came from section 21(b) of the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970. That was the old section 401. It said, \"Anytime that there's a licensed activity that's going to create a discharge from a facility into navigable waters, then the States are to enforce their water quality standards.\" Congress requires States to adopt water quality standards, according to section 303. And we have. All States have. And those water quality standards are consistent. We have designated uses, water quality criteria, and an antidegradation policy.

At times, there is water that goes over the top of the dam. That is, indeed, a discharge. It is caused by the activity. It results from the activity. It's not the free-flowing water. And I want to make that clear. I think, Justice Scalia, your question was -- that's not a discharge. That's a natural flow of water. What's happening here is, the flow is being altered. Because of the impoundment, because of the diversion, the flow is being altered. And in the case at hand here, you're actually taking a turbine, the water drops down into the turbine, turns the turbine blades or fans, it absorbs the water of its power, and then the water is released, discharged, into the tailrace channel, into the natural river."

I mean, I -- that is what a person would say, \"There is a discharge,\" because suddenly you see -- where water was naturally flowing, you see a diversion, in an impoundment, of sorts, moving the water over. But what we have here is not that case. What we have here is an impoundment. We have the water being diverted into a narrow channel, dropping down onto these turbines, being used, and then being discharged into the river. The word \"discharge,\" again, in 1970, under the 21(b), was given a broad definition. 402 and 404 came later, in 1972, as part of the Clean Water Act. In those, we're dealing with discrete conveyances of pollutants, 402. And 404 was dredge or fill discharge. And those were deemed necessary. But they're consumed in 401. In other words, if you get a 402, if you need a 40- -- a 402 application, certification, you also will need a 401. 401 deals with the effects of pollution, the effects of the activity on the environment. I thank Your Honors very much. And I just want to remind the Court that the State very much values the power -- the importance of hydropower. We value the -- our responsibility, as given to us by Congress under the Clean Water Act, to be the primary enforcer of our water quality standards.

The only reason there was no addition here was that there was -- there was an addition here, but there was no discharge, because it was the same body of water."

      "speech": "If they did it statewide, it would raise a question of whether or not that action is preempted under the Federal Power Act, not under the Clean Water Act. And that would -- that's obviously not the issue here. Maine, as you have heard, supports hydropower production. The question here is reconciling the competing roles of the hydropower company, on the one hand, and the State and Federal Governments, which, in the spirit of cooperative federalism, work together on these matters. We are very supportive of the States' approach of reviewing discharges to determine whether or not there has been the creation of pollution, and determining whether or not there is a violation of their water quality standards. This is a part of -- an important role that the State has under the Clean Water Act, that Congress gave to the State, and to which we defend. I'd like to point out that one of the things that's been talked about here is the oddity, supposed oddity, of a water discharging into itself. And that's not odd at all. One often talks about, for instance, the fresh water above the dam being discharged into the fresh waters below. That's -- there's nothing unusual about this, because we're talking about the characteristic of a water that might be shared by the water that's upstream and contained in the dam and is also a characteristic of the water below. Now, under section 401, the upstream characteristic doesn't matter, because it's -- it refers to \"any discharge,\" and it says \"into the navigable waters.\" \"Into\" is significant, because \"any discharge\" is \"out of something.\" And so, it can also be \"into something.\" And by stating \"into navigable waters\", Congress indicated what it was concerned about, which was that discharges that go into the navigable waters can cause pollution, and, therefore, ought to be reviewed by the State to make sure the water quality standards are being met. There's nothing unusual in this at all. It simply indicates that Congress was not concerned about discharges that go elsewhere; for instance, into a municipal water system or onto irrigated land. What we have here --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MINEAR",
      "speech": "The reason why, it was because Congress gave the States primary authority under the Clean Water Act to deal with pollution. Discharges from confinements, from confined water, creates pollution, even in the absence of pollutants, by the stratification, the deprivation of oxygen, and the like. And Congress recognized that where there's a discharge, there's likely to be a pollution problem, and that pollution problem will be manifested downstream. And it, therefore, makes sense for the State to be able to review and determine whether or not its water quality standards will be met."
