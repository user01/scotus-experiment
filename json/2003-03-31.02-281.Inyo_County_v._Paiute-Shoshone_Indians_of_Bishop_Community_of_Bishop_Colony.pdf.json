They seek this rule under Federal statutory law, under Federal common law, and under the Constitution. However, such a categorical rule is not supported by the text, structure, or history of the Constitution, by any Federal statute, or by any sufficient or rational public policy.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KIRBY",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, because the information that's precluded from being distributed is the names of the individuals who are being investigated. Now, I know that the allegation is made that in the letter that was sent by the district attorney and by the Department of Health and Human Services stated that this was a welfare fraud investigation. However, that letter actually did not so state. It stated that the investigation was a confidential investigation that required the payroll information being sought. The fundamental right and responsibility of government is to protect its citizens, and one of the main ways it does that, of course, is through the investigation and prosecution of crime. The Federal Government and the State government have together an integrated law enforcement regime that allows for search warrants and subpoenas to be executed and issued in connection with the investigation of these crimes or alleged crimes whether the criminal conduct occurs on the reservation or off the reservation and regardless of whether the evidence or proceeds of crime is thought to be on the reservation or off the reservation. For instance, in a Public Law 280 State, such as California, if there is a crime committed off the reservation, frankly as well as on the reservation, the Federal Government does not have jurisdiction over that crime. Thus, the Federal Government does not have the ability to issue a search warrant. If the States do not have the ability to issue a search warrant under those circumstances and there is evidence of crime or proceeds of crime on the reservation, then that property or evidence remains immune from law enforcement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is California one of the 280 States that has jurisdiction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KIRBY",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice Kennedy, California is a Public Law 280 State. Now, in a non-Public Law 280 State, the same situation presents itself because in that situation, the Federal Government has the right to -- and the -- the duty, if you will -- as a responsibility to its citizens to enforce the criminal law with regard to crimes that occur on the reservation that would be State crimes if they occurred off the reservation. And under the Major Crimes Act, as well as the General Crimes Act, the Federal Government prosecutes that crime and, of course, does the investigation prior to prosecution. In order to conduct those activities and to fulfill that mission, if you will, the Federal Government needs to have the right and does have the right to execute search warrants and to issue subpoenas. Now, as we have seen, there may be a situation where a crime is committed on the reservation in a Public Law 280 State and a crime committed in a -- the same crime in a non-Public Law 280 State, and in those situations, there must be parity with regard to the law enforcement regime. If not, what we end up with is gaps in the criminal justice system, and that wasn't the intent of the legislature in enacting Public Law 280. As the Court will recall, Public Law 280 was passed by Congress because of a perceived lawlessness on certain reservations. That lawlessness arose because Congress felt that the Federal Government -- due to the vast distances, if you will, of Federal Government law enforcement agencies, and the lack of density of those agencies -- simply wasn't able to enforce criminal laws throughout the vast acreage of reservations. And so --"

  {
    "speaker": "KIRBY",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice Scalia, there could very well be a distinction there. And the solution that we believe would address that distinction would be a solution that Justice White presented in the Brendale decision when he talked about a tribe having a unique protectable interest in certain situations. And the tribe ought to have a right to go to court -- in this case, it would be a State court -- to present that protectable interest so that a -- an interest-balancing assessment can be accomplished. In this case the interest of the tribal record may very well outweigh a minimal interest of the State if it was a simple minor misdemeanor. On the other hand, it may be that if it's a large serious felony of multiple murder and there is very direct evidence in the records of the tribal government, perhaps under those facts the court may find that the interest weighed in favor of the State's police power."

What would happen would be once the probable cause determination is made that there is evidence of a crime within the records of the casino in our hypothetical, the search warrant would be executed and the property would be seized and brought before the court. At that time the tribe, if it thought it had a protectable interest under State statute, perhaps because of certain statutory privileges, or under some special protectable interest that the tribe may feel that it has because of its unique domestic dependent sovereign status, could present that interest balance analysis to the magistrate immediately."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But what good did it do to the State -- to the tribe after the horse is out of the barn? In other words, the State -- the tribe is not being prosecuted for anything in these cases. It's a tribal member who's being prosecuted. And if you're saying, well, the -- the warrant has to be executed but after the fact the State -- the tribe, to -- to ease its wounded feelings, can have this declaration? I don't follow it. I mean, the tribe's idea is there is no right to come on our property and seize our records. If you're saying every time the county can do that and that all the tribe has is an after-the-fact determination by some magistrate that the county was wrong, it's not much of a remedy, is it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KIRBY",
    "speech": "With all respect, Justice Ginsburg, I believe it's the best remedy available.

And the county said, we can't tell you. Well, obviously that would be a situation where they might get their backs up. But suppose you just said, look, the reason is that we think there are a couple of people here who are cheating us. We think they get welfare from us and you're paying them too much. That's why we want to look at it. Maybe they would have said, sure, go look at it. But I take it you couldn't do that simple thing?"

In other words, under the law the only choice -- your major constitutional thing is you have to say the only possibility is the county that wants to prosecute somebody has to -- goes to the tribe and says, we want to prosecute somebody. We won't tell you who. We can't tell you why. Give us all your records. I mean, on that circumstance, I'd think the tribe would certainly have a point. And yet -- yet if -- if you were behaving reasonably and maybe -- maybe if Federal law prevents you from behaving reasonably, maybe they should change it. How is this supposed to work out?"

    "speaker": "KIRBY",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Breyer, looking at the situation that you've presented, which is our situation, one must remember that letters were sent by the Department of Health and Human Services to the three individuals asking for a reconciliation. Letters were sent by the district attorney to these same three individuals. Two letters were sent to the tribe asking for the information, which the tribe had honored five times in the last approximately two years, and the tribe had actually in one of those occasions asked for a search warrant, which it then honored. There was a history of working with the tribe to obtain this information. During this circumstance, the tribe took the position it was no longer going to do that. It wanted to have something more, and in fact the tribal attorney suggested that a search warrant be obtained. And as it had been in another circumstance within the preceding 12 months. So there is a clear history of trying to work with the tribe. What ended up happening in this case is what could happen in any case. The tribe, for whatever reason, depending upon whatever tribal government might have been elected at the time -- and it -- they may have been different on that day than they were during the preceding 2 years -- decided, no, we're not going to do that any longer.

Our Constitution recognizes that Indian tribes are not nation -- foreign nation states.

Now, why in the world should we accord greater protection to this lesser sovereignty that -- that consists of the Indian tribe?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Well, in the Kiowa case, Your Honor, the Court extended tribal sovereign immunity to commercial off-reservation activities of a tribe. The Court recognized that any limitation on tribal sovereign immunity that would exclude a tribe's commercial activities from the protections of sovereign immunity was a task for Congress rather than for the judiciary. And it is significant that when commercial activities of the United States Government, for example, have been -- when suit has been allowed against such entities, it's been a matter of -- of statute, not a matter of judicial decision. Indeed, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is, after all, a statutory protection."

    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "It's generally been understood, Your Honor, although not specifically addressed in a decision of this Court, that the Supremacy Clause and the Federal jurisdictional statutes provide a right of action  for injunctive and declaratory relief when a party is claiming that State action is precluded by superseding --"

Also the Court's decision in Shaw v. Delta Air Lines provides a number of -- of citations to cases that arose in this particular context. So it is a settled, although not frequently discussed basis, of coming into Federal court to challenge State action."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But surely the Federal law that the case arises under is not 1331 itself. You have to have another law, and the one exception to that is on the Federal side when the Court created the Bivens action because Congress had not enacted a statute like 1983 to cover Federal offices. But you seem to be asking us to create another such category where there's some right of action implied from what?"

  },

    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Well, generally, Your Honor, the Court has applied the interpretive presumption that the term person doesn't include a sovereign. The term person appears twice in the same sentence in section 1983, so it would be curious if it was construed differently."

    "speech": "Well, that -- that may indeed be the case, Your Honor. In the South Carolina Ports decision recently, the Court recognized that the preeminent purpose of sovereign immunity is to assure that sovereigns are treated with the dignity that their sovereign status entitles them. The execution of a State warrant is a particular threat to the dignity of a sovereign tribe, even more so perhaps than hauling it into court. It's obtained ex parte."

The second is the longstanding principle that States may not infringe the right of tribes to govern themselves or internal affairs on their reservation. And the third is that there's no act of Congress that authorizes this search warrant, though two statutes, Public Law 280 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, do provide a framework for some assumption of State jurisdiction over tribes and Indians on reservation -- the -- reservations. The county doesn't claim that either applies here to authorize this act, and they do not. I -- I want to address, if I may, Justice Scalia's question about the commercial and governmental distinction because basically the Indian Gaming Act by Congress sets up a framework for tribes to operate gaming. This is a tribal enterprise. It has to be, under the Gaming Act, owned and controlled by the tribe. It -- and the proceeds of the gaming have to be used for tribal purposes, chiefly tribal governmental purposes. And they are by the Bishop Paiute Tribe.

For any foreign country, when it owns such a corporation, all the revenue, all the profits go to the treasury of the foreign country to be used for the public benefit.

The tribe cannot do that. The tribe is constrained by Congress to use the revenues essentially for governmental purposes or for charitable donations or a couple of other purposes. But it's not -- it's like a State lottery I suppose, although even there the State legislature could decide to use the State lottery for some other purpose. The second distinction really was I think pointed out in -- in Justice Souter's question to -- I forget whether it was to Mr. Kirby or Ms. McDowell. But -- but Congress has enacted the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act which provides that a commercial enterprise of a foreign nation operating in the United States is stripped of its sovereign immunity. Congress has never done that for a tribe, and it's very important to note that while sovereign immunity in the tribal context is a common law doctrine developed by this Court, it has been adopted by Congress.

It's still coming out of the tribal treasury. But this is quite a different matter. Nothing comes out of the tribal treasury.

The tribe is subordinate to the United States and the county is subordinate to the State of California. But the tribe is not subordinate to California.

  {
    "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
    "speech": "Justice Souter, it's not good because there wasn't a history in 1871 of States impacting negatively on States' Federal rights or on the Federal rights of foreign states and there was in the case of Indian tribes. This Court had decided in 1867 two cases cited in our brief involving the Kansas Indians and the New York Indians, and the Court had decided the Cherokee cases about 30 years before where there were serious intrusions on tribes' Federal rights by States. So Congress, when it enacted section 1983, was not only presumptively aware of those, but in the 1870 committee report relied on by the Government, by the Senate Judiciary Committee, specifically makes reference to the Kansas Indian case when it's considering whether Indians are citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment and when they're not."

    "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
    "speech": "That -- that is correct, Justice Ginsburg. But, for example, in the antitrust cases, you've held that States can sue as plaintiffs. You've held that foreign nations can sue as plaintiffs. They can't be sued as defendants under antitrust statutes. And I think in the Vermont Natural Resources Agency case on the False Claim Act, you decided that while a State could not be sued as a defendant under the False Claim Act, that it wouldn't necessarily preclude it from suing as a plaintiff."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So is the injunctive relief -- I looked at the declaratory relief in the complaint and it didn't seem really directly on point. The -- the request for declaratory relief had to do with the Gaming Act, law 280, compacts, et cetera. So they didn't seem really to raise the question we now have. Then there's a section on damages, which is 1983, and then some requests for injunctive relief."

  {
    "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
    "speech": "Okay. Well, I -- I think at least the -- the count did do that and sovereign immunity was pled in the complaint. And then also, the preemptions -- Supremacy Clause issue that Ms. McDowell was mentioning in the Golden State Transit, I think, dissent by Justice Kennedy cites Gibbons v. Ogden and the Cooley case v. the Port of Philadelphia, going back into the 19th century for the proposition --"

  {
    "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
    "speech": "I guess that's correct. I think that -- yes, there wasn't Federal question jurisdiction in that part of -- of the 19th century."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So what -- the Federal question jurisdiction you're saying is Federal common law. Anything else?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
    "speech": "Well, I certainly think in footnote 27 of our brief, we cited a number of Indian cases, the Chickasaw case, the Sac and Fox case, New Mexico Apache Tribe v. Mescalero, where the Court had entertained similar claims under 1331. We're only seeking here prospective injunctive and declaratory relief against the county, and we only brought the action when they threatened the second search and seizure. We didn't do anything with the -- with the first intrusion. So -- so I would rely on -- on -- I mean, on -- on the number of cases where you have allowed tribes to bring preemption type claims against States without relying on section 1983, though -- though we do believe the compensatory damages are appropriate under section 1983 also. If there are no further questions, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."

  {
    "speaker": "KIRBY",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I would like to address very briefly the flip side, if you will, of the categorical rule being proposed by the tribe and the problems with that. And that flip side involves not the police power of the State, which we have already talked about, but the constitutional rights of a defendant who is faced with criminal prosecution in a State court when that defendant feels there is exculpatory evidence in the possession of the tribe. For instance, it may be a video surveillance of the parking lot or whatnot that shows perhaps a self-defense defense for this particular person. Under the tribe's rule --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's odd for you to be raising a tribal member as a defendant when you have potential tribal members here who might be subject to suit. You seem a strange champion for such people."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KIRBY",
    "speech": "It doesn't necessarily need to be a tribal member who might be a criminal defendant, Justice Ginsburg. It could be anyone, a non-tribal member or even a patron, who feels that there is exculpatory evidence that the tribe possesses. And under the Sixth Amendment, that person has the right to have the State issue compulsory process to obtain that exculpatory evidence. Under the tribe's rule that's being proposed, the tribe would have the ability to trump the Sixth Amendment right of the accused in that situation and not produce the exculpatory evidence. The tribe would also have the right to trump the Fourteenth Amendment rights to a fair trial of that particular person. And that's the flip side of the categorical rule that's being proposed and why we believe it's another reason it should not be adopted by this Court. With regard to the 1983 action, I would like to say that not only is the tribe not a person within the meaning of the statute and the interpretive presumption that this Court has set forth in, I believe, the Vermont Agency it was acknowledged. But also the right that the tribe is asserting, the right to self-governance, is not a Federal statutory right and it's not a constitutional right, and as such, it cannot support a 1983 action. And that is another reason why 1983 provides no relief for the tribe in this case. In -- in closing, I would like to say that this case does not implicate traditional sovereign immunity which is sovereign immunity from civil suit. And there was a question raised with regard to that, I believe by Justice Scalia, pointing out that the tribe's treasury is not at issue here. It's not at stake here. What we're dealing with is process, in this case the criminal process of the court. And that's a totally different situation. This Court has never addressed criminal process as being subject to tribal immunity. All of this Court's decisions have addressed the tribe's immunity to civil lawsuit. That is not what we have here. The doctrine of tribal immunity should not be extended in this case to include criminal process for the reasons that we have set forth. While there may not be any wholly satisfactory result, Justice Breyer, we believe that our position is the best position. Even if one has to choose between either of the two categorical approaches, simply even looking at the rights of an accused and compulsory process, that should mitigate toward the county's position here. We've also suggested a procedure, as presented by Justice White in Brendale, as being a potential resolution of this problem, maintaining the dignity of the tribe and also allowing the State to exercise its police power and protect its citizens as it investigates and prosecutes crime. If there are no further questions --"
