Shouldn't there be at least that requirement, that for the 2255 purpose you would have to show a good reason for not raising it earlier in the State courts?"

Is that essentially your theory? In other words, he knew what the risks were, and he did not take any steps to alleviate those risks by bringing a State collateral attack or by going on with his appeal or whatnot.

      "speech": "Well, no, but let's forget Federal proceedings for a moment. If we just have a State proceeding and the State is going to use that supposedly unreliable conviction as a basis for enhancement following a subsequent conviction, nothing unfair about that, I take it, on your view, because the prisoner knew that such use could be made of it, and the prisoner let the time for attacking the conviction pass. That's essentially your theory?"

      "speech": "Well, the State -- but I -- the theory of my question was, he in effect was on notice that there might be a subsequent use of the conviction for enhancement purposes. He had an opportunity to litigate. He didn't litigate. Therefore, it is not unfair, in the due process sense, for the State to use it, and I thought that was probably what underlay your suggestion that the State could use it for enhancement purposes."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "All right. Now, why can't the Fed -- why can't a Federal court use it for enhancement purposes? He was on notice that there might be a later enhancement. He did nothing about it. The same reasoning applies at the Federal level, doesn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "The -- there is a -- there is no problem with notice, and -- but that again suggests the concept of waiver, or maybe even sandbagging."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, not waiver. Not -- we're not talking about waiver. We talking about, I think, the fact that he had an opportunity to litigate it. As you so -- as you conceded a moment ago, there are statutes of limitations that govern these things in most instances. You've got to litigate within that time or it's too late, so he let, in effect, his opportunity to litigate pass. Now, if that -- and therefore it's not unfair, in a due process sense, to use it against him even if he does claim later that it was unreliable. Now, if that is a sound argument with respect to its use for enhancement purposes at the State level, why isn't it an equally good argument with respect to its use in this case at the Federal level?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "I'm sorry, perhaps I didn't understand the predicate of your question when I first answered. I believe I answered that there is a due process problem with using the unreliable conviction whether you're using it to enhance a State sentence or a Federal sentence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Then what's left of the statute of limitations that you concede can be applied? I thought you conceded that the statute of limitations on this kind of litigation could, consistently with due process, be applied at the State level. If you did not concede that, then I will withdraw my question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "Okay. It could be applied at the State level to the initial State conviction. Okay, again, if, analogous to this case, that conviction was used in a State proceeding to enhance a subsequent State sentence, then there might -- there would be a due process right to examine that conviction anew --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "With respect to, at the State level, let me ask you one more question. Let's assume that the State had a statute and the statute were made -- was explained to the defendant at the time of his State sentence, and the statute read as follows: This conviction can be used to enhance sentences following later convictions. If you wish to challenge the validity of this conviction, you must challenge it within 1 year, or it's too late. Let's assume that the State had such a statute, that was explained to the prisoner at the time of the first sentence, and he didn't litigate within 1 year. The State then wants to use it to enhance following a subsequent conviction. Is there a due process problem in the State's use of it without an opportunity to challenge?"

      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "No. There -- as long as there's a procedure, a substantive due process procedure for litigating that, it could be that, consistent with due process, there could be some limitations and in that case that might well be one of them."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, what about my limitation? You've got a year to challenge this if you want to challenge it, and if you don't challenge it within the year it's too late and it can used for enhancement purposes, and the year expires, it's going to be used for enhancement purposes, he wants to challenge it, and the State says no, it's too late, the year is over. Is that consistent with due process?"

      "speech": "I assume that your theory would apply not just to enhancement questions but also to any other disabilities attaching to the prior criminal conviction. Specifically, I believe that California, like many States, disqualifies convicted felons from voting.

      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "And one might, if one were arguing that case, argue that, and I think there -- but there are certainly different considerations there, because if the Federal court is reviewing the State court's use of its own recidivist provisions, then there are more comity and finality questions that aren't at issue here. That's what distinguishes this case, is that all we're doing in this case is looking at the Federal court examining a Federal sentence under 2255, which explicitly provides for that review. There's no intrusion in the State court judgment, and that's the position I took in the brief and that's the position I take here, that the State judgment, we're leaving that alone. Nothing that the Federal district court's going to do in granting that 2255 motion and finding this conviction too unreliable to automatically sentence this man to an additional 8 years in prison is going to affect that State court judgment."

That's clear, simple, done all the time, no problem, fair. All right. No, but there's an opinion that says no. Now, given that opinion, I think I'm stuck, unless I were to accept this argument that the -- I see you make an argument about the constitutionality, which I think is interesting, but I'm not sure about that one. Is there anything else? If I don't accept that constitutional point, if I would have been with the dissenters in Custis -- but I believe in stare decisis. I'm stuck, right?"

      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "It's both. Certainly the case depends on a construction of 2255 to remedy what is an obvious constitutional violation.

The fellow was at least indicted and he went to jail for a while, and that's enough for us. Is it your view that they could not do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "Yes. Where it can be shown that that conviction doesn't reliably indicate the man's guilt I believe -- well, it's my position that that violates the Constitution and the Due Process Clause."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Tanaka, I have a question concerning a point you made in your brief. You said that the 2255 forum is accustomed to dealing with questions of this nature, and you distinguished that from the sentencing forum in Custis, but it seems to me it's the same forum. It's the same district judge, just a different proceeding but in the same court, so I did not follow what you were getting at when you were saying that the 2255 forum is accustomed to dealing with these kinds of questions but the sentencing judge is not, when it's one and the same judge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "Well, the point was that normally a sentencing procedure is rather quick and summary, whereas a proceeding on a 2255 case, there might be an evidentiary hearing and the scheduling and so forth would be different, and also there are rules that govern 2255 cases that don't govern sentencing, and so it's more appropriately placed there. But the major point is that 2255 expressly provides for this type of procedure, whereas you know, obviously there's nothing in the sentencing statute that likely, likewise provides for it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Tanaka, you say that what you want to challenge is State court convictions that, judgments that do not reliably indicate guilt. Well, I take it you would allow a challenge on the basis that a Miranda warning wasn't given, and that there was some -- it was not harmless error, and yet a Miranda warning really has nothing to do with guilt. I mean, there are certainly different constitutional claims which can be vindicated in the proper forum but don't really bear on guilt or innocence, so are you limiting your challenges to those which clearly affect guilt, or to any constitutional claim that would be sustained if timely brought?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "No, Mr. Chief Justice. I believe that the due process analysis leads to the conclusion that you can only challenge convictions that don't reliably indicate guilt. There's not an identity between a due process violation and a constitutional violation. If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal."

The second two reasons I think are the ones that most clearly explain the rule that we're espousing here."

      "speech": "Well, there are two distinctions between that kind of a situation and the Gideon situation. The one that I think is most applicable to the majority of cases that are going to come up in this context is that a Brady violation is a very fact-intensive inquiry. It can't be resolved, as the Court noted in Custis with respect to a Gideon claim, simply by looking at the judgment or the judgment role and determining whether the defendant had counsel. It requires instead a fairly intricate analysis of whether the Government suppressed and withheld information that the defendant couldn't with due diligence have gained access to, and whether there was resulting prejudice to the defendant as a consequence, and the administrative costs of adjudicating that are far more substantial and very intrusive into the sentencing process as compared to Gideon."

    {
      "speaker": "DREEBEN",
      "speech": "Well, the second -- I think, Justice O'Connor, that is the second distinction in your hypothetical, that the hypothetical posits that this was information about a constitutional claim that could not with due diligence have been obtained, I'm assuming within any time for bringing an appropriate appeal or collateral challenge. The capital context is unique in that area, I think, and I'm going to set it aside, because questions of actual innocence in the capital context would be dealt with under the Eighth Amendment and would implicate constitutional principles that aren't broadly applicable. But as to the generality of sentencing cases, I think that the basic rule is that there is a system in place to challenge convictions that balances two fundamental interests. One is in finality, the other is in fundamental fairness. Those two interests have always been accommodated not by giving one total sway over the other, but by saying that in certain contexts there are claims that are available and they may be brought, and if they are brought in a manner that's compatible with the procedural limitations such as statute of limitations, procedural default, exhaustion, Teague v. Lane, if they surmount those hurdles, then the interests of vindicating the Constitution take precedence over the interests of finality. But if those procedural hurdles have not been met, and the defendant did not bring his claim in accordance with the procedures that are set out, then society is entitled to take that conviction as conclusively final, and any further remedy that would be available would have to come from the executive branch --"

With respect to the conviction that -- the Federal conviction that was entered, ineffective assistance of counsel claims typically are not brought in the original sentencing court that imposed the conviction because the defendant typically has the same counsel and because the facts haven't been developed, and therefore there is no procedural default typically in bringing an ineffective assistance claim directed to the Federal conviction in a section 2255 proceeding. But as to the underlying enhancement conviction, which is what we are talking about here, petitioner is saying that I suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to a 1978 robbery conviction that is now being used to enhance my 1992 Federal sentence, and I should have the right, on 2255, to litigate that 16-year- old, or 19-year-old claim, and we submit that the Court's decision in Custis says you can't do that at the Federal sentencing and you therefore cannot do that on the 2255 proceeding."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "-- but the Court in -- the majority in Custis left the question open whether there could be another means of challenge other than the challenge at the Federal sentencing proceeding as such. And number 2, textually, what the petitioner wants to do can be fitted within the terms of 2255, and the issue I guess boils -- so I think it's -- I don't think Custis is controlling, and what the issue boils down to for me is this. I will -- I accept your argument that the balance struck on the issues of finality and fairness require a point at which so far as the service of the original sentence, the '78 sentence in your example is concerned, the litigation has got to stop. But it seems to me that that balance is entirely different when you get into the subsequent proceeding in which, for example, what is at stake in the finality fairness argument is not, say, a sentence of 5 years or 10 years as under the first conviction, whatever it was, but a sentence potentially of life, and when suddenly the stakes change that radically in the Federal proceeding, then the old finality-fairness balance simply doesn't apply any more because the terms have changed, and when the terms change radically, as they have here, why isn't it possible to reassess that balance and say, okay, now, even though you couldn't litigate for State purposes, you can litigate for Federal purposes?"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But the reason may be the textual reason in Custis, going to the text of the enhancement statute itself.

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Let's assume, though -- and I realize you don't concede this, of course, but assume that Custis did leave open the possibility of this litigation. Would you go back to the, we'll say the balance argument? My point is that the balance between finality and fairness changes radically when you go from the limited jeopardy of imprisonment under the State conviction to the potentiality here of life imprisonment, and if the balance is that radically affected, why shouldn't there be, for due process purposes, an opportunity to litigate at the Federal level, even though the State proceeding is past and final for State purposes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DREEBEN",
      "speech": "Justice Souter, I think the fundamental answer to that question goes back to the interests in finality that have been struck in this Court's post-conviction jurisprudence generally. There is a recognition that there are fundamental interests in having an unconstitutional conviction overturned, but they are counterbalanced by other interests such as the fairness and reliability of the adjudication of that claim. Now, here we are talking about a claim by petitioner that when he entered his guilty plea 16 years ago and 19 years ago he wasn't adequately informed about one of the elements of the offense and therefore, he says, he didn't enter a knowing and voluntary guilty plea. Now, that's the kind of claim that can routinely be made on direct appeal or upon an immediate post-conviction attack, and it's made with the State that entered the judgment as a party, and the State can come back and say we have access to these records, they're very easy to determine, you can see that the judge went over him, the various elements, or his lawyer counseled him about the various elements of the crime and the court can reach a reliable adjudication promptly on whether that conviction is valid. A defendant who doesn't challenge his guilty plea in that fashion at the time that it's available to do so is essentially saying, I struck a deal with the Government, the deal allows me perhaps to reduce my time of imprisonment compared to what it would have been if I had gone to trial and lost, as I probably would have been, would have lost, therefore I'm going to enter a guilty plea and establish finality, and I'm not going to take an appeal, because if I appeal and win at this juncture I'll probably be back right in the position that I started in, namely, facing a trial and a potentially longer sentence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And it's perfectly fair for due process purposes or any others, on any other fairness standard, to hold the prisoner to that bargain. He knew what the terms were. The trouble is now, the terms have changed, and it's not only very difficult to litigate this later, but it's also very difficult to stay in prison for life, and when the terms have changed, the calculus that says, or that said in the first instance it's fair to hold you to your bargain, doesn't apply any more, because the terms have changed."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "All right, let's -- I understand that argument, too, and I just don't see how it is sound. The truth is, in the real world, prisoners, when they enter these guilty pleas, are not thinking of the possibility of life in prison 25 years later for a crime that hasn't been committed yet. I mean, I just don't think that that is realistic, to say that he knew or should have known that this could happen."

He has no idea what he's doing. He doesn't get correct advice, and he goes in and he pleads guilty, and he was totally confused at the State proceeding. Now, that person is going to be in jail for life because of a later crime, although if you look at what happened it would be obviously unconstitutional, his earlier conviction. Now, that's the case we're worried about, and we get rid of the other cases through strict burden of proof rules, so all we have in front of us are those cases, and the question is, why shouldn't a person like that be able to demonstrate the obvious fact that that earlier conviction was obviously unconstitutional, and you give me the answer that Custis says no, but then we could just reply, well, that was because of the language of the statute."

All I thought is that if I was present and I knew about the bank robbery, that was enough for the conviction. That is petitioner's claim right here. He's filed an affidavit, he's sworn it out under oath, and for the Government to sit back and say to the sentencing court, well, judge, he has a strong interest in this and this was 20 years ago, you shouldn't believe him, is really more than can be expected from us.

That's a distinguishable scenario from this situation, and the outcome there does not control the outcome here."

If you know you have a conviction on the books and you are not deterred from the -- by committing another crime, notwithstanding the fact that you know that your sentenced will be enhanced, the question is, is that constitutional apart from Gideon violations. My answer to that is yes, but I don't actually think that's the sentencing theory that was adopted in section 924(e)."

      "speech": "Well, the United States took the position in Custis that Gideon error belonged to a very small class of fundamental errors, and the other error that we identified in Custis was the error that you identified, Justice Kennedy, of an error that really deprives the sentencing court of the character of a court that could render a fair judgment."

      "speech": "No, because this Court in Custis didn't agree with the position of the Government and held that Gideon violations are unique. They are unique not only because they have such a pervasive impact on the fairness of the proceeding, but they are also unique in that they are fairly easy to discern from the judgment role or from a motion accompanying the judgment role, and the Court relied on the consideration of administrative ease as well as of the character of the error in defining what you could do when confronted with a recidivist enhancement and a prior conviction that is challenged on constitutional grounds, and so long as the Court adheres to that line, I think that the interest of the State in ensuring that its judgment carries usual force and effect are just as strong at the Federal sentencing proceeding as they are on 2255. The State --"

That's the question that we're revisiting after our litigation track record in the lower courts, and it's not presented in this case because petitioner did not do that, and almost undoubtedly would be out of time to do that today, and quorum nobis is not apparently available in California, and our fundamental submission is, that was the chance that he had. Whatever procedures the rendering court provides and post-conviction review provides of the underlying conviction are sufficient for constitutional purposes absent a Gideon error when the Federal sentencing court is imposing a recidivist sentence. If the Court has no further questions --"

    {
      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "I'd first like to address the question of what Custis left open. We've been talking about the sentence at issue, and it ends, if -- we recognize -- and this is at page 497 of the Custis decision. We recognize, however, that Custis, who is still in custody for purposes of State convictions, at the time of this Federal sentencing under 924(e) may attack a State sentence in Maryland or through a Federal habeas review, and then, importantly, after that the citation is just see Maleng v. Cook. Now, there are two things that suggest that what that left open was the possibility of reviewing the prior conviction as it enhanced the later sentence. First is that it says, or through a Federal habeas review, and second it says, it cites Maleng v. Cook. Now, what Maleng decided was that there was subject-matter jurisdiction in a Federal habeas case where there was an expired conviction, and the petitioner in that case had attacked an expired conviction directly and what this Court said was, no, you couldn't attack that directly, but there was subject-matter jurisdiction on habeas where that prior conviction was used to enhance a subsequent sentence. So that strongly suggests that the remedy that this Court left open in Custis is akin to what exactly is at issue here and that is, a 2255 remedy, by its very terms, allows the petitioner to attack the constitutionality of that prior State conviction, as it was used to enhance his Federal sentence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Maleng, though, was directed just to whether or not he was in custody."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "Right, whether he was in custody on the subsequent sentence, but it suggests that they would entertain attack on the prior conviction through the custody of the subsequent sentence and conviction. The other point I wanted to make is, the Solicitor General mentioned that there was a fairness- finality balance here, and that this changes where the conviction, as in this case, is so old, but that fails to recognize that the finality interests where the conviction is used in a subsequent proceeding are not the same. In fact, they're not even close to the same, where we're challenging the challenges to that State conviction directly, and that is because this Court's jurisprudence in many of those 2254 cases regarding finality posits the rationale that the State judgment is a final one, and we don't want to intrude in the State process. That is, we don't want to release this person from custody. We don't want to make the State retry this man. We don't want to intrude in the State process. In this case, again, that interest is almost nonexistent. If a Federal sentencing court granted a 2255, there is no impact on that State court judgment. So it really boils down to a question of, is there a remedy for someone who is going to face a potential life term --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "May I just question your last conclusion? Supposing he had not -- he was still in State custody on parole or something of that kind, would not then the Federal 2255 have an impact on the State's interest in finality?"

      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "I'm not sure it would --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "Well, certainly the Federal court would have no conclusive effect on any subsequent State court proceeding, and whatever persuasive value I imagine that the State court could take it for what it was worth, but I don't know that it would necessarily intrude on the State court proceeding. So basically what's at issue, then, is do we allow 2255, which by its fine language provides a remedy where the sentence is unconstitutional, do we close that door on the basis of considerations that aren't at issue in this case, or do we allow someone who's facing a life sentence to litigate the validity, and in some cases it's going to be obvious, of prior convictions that don't reliably indicate his guilt and, as the Solicitor General said, the whole purpose between the armed career criminal act is incapacitation, or --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Of course, in this case, Mr. Tanaka, it's a guilty plea, so you don't have any real question of whether there's a record to show that he did it or didn't do it, because you don't get that sort of a record with a guilty plea."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TANAKA",
      "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor, and so the issue then would be, does this record reliably reflect his guilt, reviewing the record that's presented on the guilty plea, and that would be an issue for the Federal district court to decide on remand. If it decided that indeed there's enough evidence here that we have no question that he was guilty and there's a reliable indication of that, then I suppose he's out of court, but the point is, he needs to have that opportunity."

      "speaker": "TANAKA",

It's very difficult for someone who is facing that kind of an affidavit to simply say, well, disbelieve this guy. You want to collect information showing that he should be disbelieved."
