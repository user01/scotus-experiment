The Ninth Circuit's approach affords no consideration for the role of the speaker as a citizen or an employee at the time of the speech.

And as I read this case, in the record, we have one individual, your client, who looked at an affidavit. The affidavit said that the deputy sheriffs were trying to locate where a vehicle that was chocked up came from. They saw tire tracks. The tire tracks went back to a fence at the end of a long driveway. So, I looked in the record. I couldn't find the affidavit. So, I assume that's what it says. And I wanted to know what the deputy sheriff said. What they said is that your client agreed that there were tire tracks. There were tire tracks that did not go the whole length of the driveway, but, rather, tire tracks near the house, where they got the search warrant for. And, they added, that -- the deputies -- that there was rocks broken up. All right. So, we have two sides to this argument: the deputies, who might reasonably contend that they did nothing wrong; your client, who thinks they were lying. And we also have a letter that your client wrote, where he said that these deputies are grossly inaccurate and clearly misleading. Suppose his supervisor goes to him and says, \"I think that that letter is not the right tone. Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong; maybe they're in good faith, maybe they're not. And so, if you don't change that tone, I'm going to discipline you.\" All right? Now, that's my hypothetical, which seemed to me, perhaps, very much like this case.

This case, in its essence, is about whether a public employee has a constitutional right to perform his assigned job duties in such a way that is to the dissatisfaction of the employer. In Pickering and in Connick, this Court contemplated first-amendment litigation in a public- employment context in the relatively rare circumstances in which adverse employment action was taken as a result of an employee's extracurricular activities. Under the Ninth Circuit and the respondent's approach, the exception would become the rule. It is our view that the Ninth Circuit has simply gone too far in giving a broad sweep for first-amendment protection for any public employee speech, simply because it happens to be a matter of public concern. As Judge O'Scannlain stated in his special concurring opinion, \"The time is right for this Court to steer the drifting first- amendment jurisprudence back to its proper moorings.\" Thank you."
