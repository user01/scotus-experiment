    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Affordable Care Act addresses a fundamental and enduring problem in our health care system and our economy. Insurance has become the predominant means of paying for health care in this country. Insurance has become the predominant means of paying for health care in this country. For most Americans, for more than 80 percent of Americans, the insurance system does provide effective access. Excuse me. But for more than 40 million Americans who insurance. It does not do so because it -- because the multibillion dollar subsidies that are available for the -- the employer market are not available in the individual market. It does not do so because ERISA and HIPAA regulations that preclude -- that preclude discrimination against people based on their medical history do not apply in the individual market. That is an economic problem. And it begets another economic problem."

    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "They can address it directly, Justice Scalia, and they are addressing it directly through this -- through this Act by regulating the means by which health care -- by which health care is purchased. That is the way this Act works. Under the Commerce Clause, what Congress has done is to enact reforms of the insurance market, directed at the individual insurance market, that preclude -- that preclude discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, that require guaranteed issue and community rating. And it uses -- and the minimum coverage provision is necessary to carry into execution those insurance reforms --"

    "speech": "That's not what's going on here, Justice Kennedy, and we're not seeking to defend the law on that basis. In this case, the -- what is being regulated is the method of financing health -- the purchase of health care. That itself is economic activity with substantial effects on interstate commerce. And --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "So, any self-purchasing? Anything I -- you know, if I'm in any market at all, my failure to purchase something in that market subjects me to regulation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "No. That's not our position at all, Justice Scalia. In the health care market -- the health care market is characterized by the fact that aside from the few groups that Congress chose to exempt from the minimum coverage requirement -- those who for religious reasons don't participate, those who are incarcerated, Indian tribes -- virtually everybody else is either in that market or will be in that market, and a distinguishing feature of that is that they cannot -- people cannot generally control when they enter that market or what they need when they enter that market."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, the same, it seems to me, would be true, say, for the market in emergency services: police, fire, ambulance, roadside assistance, whatever. You don't know when you're going to need it; you're not sure that you will. But the same is true for health care. You don't know if you're going to need a heart transplant or if you ever will. So, there's a market there. In some extent, we all participate in it. So, can the government require you to buy a cell phone because that would facilitate responding when you need emergency services? You can just dial 911 no matter where you are?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "No, Mr. Chief Justice. I think that's different. It's -- we -- I don't think we think of that as a market. This is a market. This is market regulation. And, in addition, you have a situation in this market not only where people enter involuntarily as to when they enter and won't be able to control what they need when they enter, but when they --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It seems to me that's the same as in my hypothetical. You don't know when you're going to need police assistance. You can't predict the extent to emergency response that you'll need, but when you do -- and the government provides it. I thought that was an important part of your argument, that when you need health care, the government will make sure you get it. Well, when you need police assistance or fire assistance or ambulance assistance, the government is going to make sure to the best extent it can that you get it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "I think the fundamental difference, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that's not an issue of market regulation. This is an issue of market regulation, and that's how Congress -- that's how Congress looked at this problem. There is a market. Insurance is provided through a market system --"

Suppose that you and I walked around downtown Washington at lunch hour and we found a couple of healthy young people and we stopped them and we said: You know what you're doing? You are financing your burial services right now because eventually you're going to die, and somebody is going to have to pay for it, and if you don't have burial insurance, or you haven't saved money for it, you're going to shift the cost to somebody else. Isn't that a very artificial way of talking about what somebody is doing?"

The -- and the reason is that the burial example is not -- the difference is here you are regulating the method by which you are paying for something else -- health care -- and the insurance requirement I think -- the key thing here is my friends on the other side acknowledge that it is within the authority of Congress under Article I under the commerce power to impose guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms, to end -- to impose a minimum coverage provision. Their argument is just that it has to occur at the point of sale, and --"

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

You can correct me if these figures are wrong, but it appears to me that the CBO has estimated that the average premium for a single insurance policy in the non-group market will be roughly $5,800 in -- in 2016. Respondents -- the economists who have supported the Respondents estimate that a young, healthy individual targeted by the mandate on average consumes about $854 in health services each year. So, the mandate is forcing these people to provide a huge subsidy to the insurance companies for other purposes that the Act wishes to serve, but isn't -- if those figures are right, isn't it the case that what this mandate is really doing is not requiring the people who are subject to it to pay for the services that they are going to consume? It is requiring them to subsidize services that will be received by somebody else."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "No, I think that -- and I do think that's what the Respondents argue. It's just not right. I think it -- it really gets to a fundamental problem with their argument."

    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "(A) it is how insurance works, but (b) the problem that they -- that they're identifying is not that problem. The guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms do not have the effect of forcing insurance companies to take on lots of additional people who they then can't afford to cover because they're -- they tend to be the sick, and that is -- in fact, the exact opposite is what happens here. The -- when you enact guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms, and you do so in the absence of a minimum coverage provision, it's not that insurance companies take on more and more people and then need a subsidy to cover it; it's that fewer and fewer people end up with insurance because the rates are not regulated. Insurance companies, when they -- when they have to offer guaranteed issue and community rating, they're entitled to make a profit. They charge rates sufficient to cover only the sick population because healthy people --"

    "speech": "Could you help -- would help me with this? Assume for the moment -- you may I understand that we must presume laws are constitutional, but, even so, when you are changing the relation of the individual to the government in this, what we can stipulate is, I think, a unique way, do you not have a heavy burden of justification to show authorization under the Constitution?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "So, two things about that, Justice Kennedy. First, we think this is regulation of people's participation in the health care market, and all it -- all this minimum coverage provision does is say that, instead of requiring insurance at the point of sale, that Congress has the authority under the commerce power and the necessary and proper power to ensure that people have insurance in advance of the point of sale because of the unique nature of this market, because this is a market in which -- in which you -- although most of the population is in the market most of the time -- 83 percent visit a physician every year; 96 percent over a 5-year period -- so, virtually everybody in society is in this market. And you've got to pay for the health care you get, the predominant way in which it's -- in which it's paid for is insurance, and -- and the Respondents agree that Congress could require that you have insurance in order to get health care or forbid health care from being provided --"

The food market, while it shares that trait that everybody's in it, it is not a market in which your participation is often unpredictable and often involuntary. It is not a market in which you often don't know before you go in what you need, and it is not a market in which, if you go in and -- and seek to obtain a product or service, you will get it even if you can't pay for it. It doesn't have --"

    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "Yes, for two reasons. First, this -- the test, as this Court has articulated it, is: Is Congress regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerce? The way in which this statute satisfies the test is on the basis of the factors that I have identified. It --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Verrilli, I thought that your main point is that, unlike food or any other market, when you made the choice not to buy insurance, even though you have every intent in the world to self-insure, to save for it, when disaster strikes, you may not have the money. And the tangible result of it is -- we were told -- there was one brief that Maryland hospital care bills 7 percent more because of these uncompensated costs, that families pay a thousand dollars more than they would if there were no uncompensated costs. I thought what was unique about this is it's not my choice whether I want to buy a product to keep me healthy, but the cost that I am foisting on other people if I don't buy the product sooner rather than later."

    "speaker": "VERRILLI",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Yes, I thought the answer to that was, since McCulloch v. Maryland, when the Court said Congress could create the Bank of the United States which did not previously exist, which job was to create commerce that did not previously exist, since that time the answer has been \"yes.\" I would have thought that your answer to, can the government, in fact, require you to buy cell phones or buy burials, that if we propose comparable situations, if we have, for example, a uniform United States system of paying for every burial such as Medicare Burial, Medicaid Burial, CHIP Burial, ERISA Burial, and emergency burial beside the side of the road, and Congress wanted to rationalize that system, wouldn't the answer be, yes, of course, they could?"

    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "Yes. The -- the rationale purely under the Commerce Clause that we're advocating here would not justify forced purchases of commodities for the purpose of stimulating demand. We -- the -- it would not justify purchases of insurance for the purposes -- in situations in which insurance doesn't serve as the method of payment for a service --"

You say, \"Health insurance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or broccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consumption and covering universal risks.\" Well, a car or broccoli aren't purchased for their own sake, either. They're purchased for the sake of transportation or, in broccoli, covering the need for food."

And tell me if I'm wrong about this, but I thought a major, major point of your argument was that the people who don't participate in this market are making it much more expensive for the people who do; that is, they will get -- a goodly number of them will get services that they can't afford at the point when they need them, and the result is that everybody else's premiums get raised. So, you're not -- it's not your free choice just to do something for yourself. What you do is going to affect others, affect them in a major way."

The first strand that I've seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to effect those powers within its rights, i.e., because it made a decision that to effect -- to effect mandatory issuance of insurance, that it could also obligate the mandatory purchase of it. The second strand I see is self-insurance affects the market; and so, the government can regulate those who self-insure. And the third argument -- and I see all of sure what the --"

It did so to deal with a very serious problem that results in 40 million people not being able to get insurance and therefore not access to the health care market. Everybody agrees in this case that those are within Congress's Article I powers. The minimum coverage provision is necessary to carry those provisions into execution, because without them, without those provisions, without minimum coverage, guaranteed issue and community rating will, as the experience in the States showed, make matters worse, not better. There will be fewer people covered; it will cost more. Now, the --"

The second part of our argument is that the means here that Congress has chosen, the minimum coverage provision, is a means that regulates the -- that regulates economic activity, namely your transaction in the health care market, with substantial effects on interstate commerce; and it is the conjunction of those two that we think provides the particularly secure foundation for this statute under the commerce power."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "General, you've talked on -- a couple of times about other alternatives that Congress might have had, other alternatives that the Respondents suggest to deal with this problem, in particular, the alternative of mandating insurance at the point at which somebody goes to a hospital or an emergency room and asks for care. Did Congress consider those alternatives? Why did it reject them? How should we think about the question of alternative ways of dealing with these problems?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "I do think, Justice Kagan, that the point of difference between my friends on the other side and the United States is about one of timing. They've agreed that Congress has Article I authority to impose an insurance requirement or other -- or other penalty at the point of sale, and they have agreed that Congress has the authority to do that to achieve the same objectives that the minimum coverage provision in the Affordable Care Act is designed to achieve. This is a situation in which we are talking about means. Congress gets substantial deference in the choice of means, and if one thinks about the difference between the means they say Congress should have chosen and the means Congress did choose, I think you can see why it was eminently more sensible for Congress to choose the means that it chose."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "I'm not sure which way it cuts, if the Congress has alternate means. Let's assume that it could use the tax power to raise revenue and to just have a national health service, single payer. How does that factor into our analysis? In one sense, it can be argued if this is what the government is doing, it ought to be honest about the power that it's using and use the correct power. On the other hand, it means that since the Court can do it any way -- Congress can do it any way, we give it a certain amount of latitude. I'm not sure which way the argument goes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "Let me try to answer that question, Justice Kennedy, and get back to the question you asked me earlier. The -- the -- I do think one striking feature of the argument here that this is a novel exercise of power is that what Congress chose to do was to rely on market mechanisms and efficiency and a method that has more choice than would the traditional Medicare or Medicaid type model. And so, it seems a little ironic to suggest that that counts against it. But beyond that, in the sense that it's novel, this provision is novel in the same way, or unprecedented in the same way, that the Sherman Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it in the Northern Securities case, or the Packers and Stockyards Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it, or the National Labor Relations Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it in Jones & Laughlin, or the dairy price supports in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal. And --"

By the way, I don't agree with you that the relevant market here is health care. You're not regulating health care. You're regulating insurance. It's the insurance market that you're addressing, and you're saying that some people who are not in it must be in it, and that's -- that's different from regulating in any manner commerce that already exists out there."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "Well, to the extent that we're looking at the comprehensive scheme, Justice Scalia, it is regulating commerce that already exists out there. And the means in which that regulation is made effective here, the minimum coverage provision, is a regulation of the way in which people participate, the method of their payment in the health care market. That is what it is. And I do think, Justice Kennedy, getting back to the question you asked before, what -- what matters here is whether Congress is choosing a tool that's reasonably adapted to the problem that Congress is confronting. And that may mean that the tool is different from a tool that Congress has chosen to use in the past. That's not something that counts against the provision in a Commerce Clause analysis."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Wait. That's -- it's both \"Necessary and Proper.\" What you just said addresses what's necessary. Yes, has to be reasonably adapted. Necessary does not mean essential, just reasonably adapted. But in addition to being necessary, it has to be proper. And we've held in two cases that something that was reasonably adapted was not proper, because it violated the sovereignty of the States, which was implicit in the constitutional structure. The argument here is that this also is -- may be necessary, but it's not proper, because it violates an equally evident principle in the Constitution, which is that the Federal Government is not supposed to be a government that has all powers, that it's supposed to be a government of limited powers. And that's what all this questioning has been about. What -- what is left? If the government can do this, what -- what else can it not do?"

And here I think it's really impossible, in view of our history, to say that Congress is invading the State sphere. This is a -- this is a market in which 50 percent of the people in this country get their health care through their employer.

Is the national government regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerce?"

In the law of torts, our tradition, our law has been that you don't have the duty to rescue someone if that person is in danger. The blind man is walking in front of a car, and you do not have a duty to stop him, absent some relation between you. And there's some severe moral criticisms of that rule, but that's generally the rule. And here the government is saying that the Federal Government has a duty to tell the individual citizen that it must act. And that is different from what we have in previous cases."

If I understand the law, the policies that you're requiring people to purchase involve -- must contain provision for maternity and newborn care, pediatric services, and substance use treatment. It seems to me that you cannot say that everybody is going to need substance use treatment -- substance use treatment or pediatric services; and yet, that is part of what you require them to purchase."
  },

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Yes, but your theory is that there is a market in which everyone participates because everybody might need a certain range of health care services.

If you took the group of people who are subject to the mandate and you calculated the amount of health care services this whole group would consume and figured out the cost of an insurance policy to cover the services that group would consume, the cost of that policy would be much, much less than the kind of policy that these people are now going to be required to purchase under the Affordable Care Act."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

But if you take their costs and you calculate that, that's a lot less than the amount that they're going to be required to pay. So that you can't just justify this on the basis of their trying to shift their costs off to other people, can you?"

    "speaker": "VERRILLI",

And in terms of the -- the subsidy rationale, I don't think -- I think it's -- it would be unusual to say that it's an illegitimate exercise of the commerce power for some people to subsidize others. Telephone rates in this country for a century were set via the exercise of the commerce power in a way in which some people paid rates that were much higher than their costs in order to subsidize --"

And the same thing with respect to the -- you know, the dairy price supports that -- that the Court upheld in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal. You can look at those as disadvantageous contracts, as forced transfers, that -- you know, I suppose it's theoretically true that you could raise your kids without milk, but the reality is you've got to go to the store and buy milk.

That's -- and that's exactly the experience that the States had that made the imposition of guaranteed issue and community rating not only be ineffectual but be highly counterproductive. Rates, for example, in New Jersey doubled or tripled, went from 180,000 people covered in this market down to 80,000 people covered in this market. In Kentucky, virtually every insurer left the market. And the reason for that is because when people have that guarantee of -- that they can get insurance, they're going to make that calculation that they won't get it until they're sick and they need it. And so, the pool of people in the insurance market gets smaller and smaller. The rates you have to charge to cover them get higher and higher. It helps fewer and fewer -- insurance covers fewer and fewer people until the system ends. This is not a situation in which you're conscripting -- you're forcing insurance companies to cover very large numbers of unhealthy people --"

The problem is that you have 40 million people who cannot get affordable insurance through the means that the rest of us get affordable insurance. Congress, after long study and careful deliberation, and viewing the experiences of the States and the way they tried to handle this problem, adopted a package of reforms. Guaranteed issue and community rating and subsidies and the minimum coverage provision are a package of reforms that solve that problem.

Congress could -- once you -- once you establish that you have a market for health care, I would suppose Congress's power under the Commerce Clause meant they had a broad scope in terms of how they regulate that market. And it would be -- it would be going back to Lochner if we were put in a position of saying, no, you can use your commerce power to regulate insurance, but you can't use your commerce power to regulate this market in other ways. I think that would be a very significant intrusion by the Court into Congress's power. So, I don't see how we can accept your -- it's good for you in this case to say, oh, it's just insurance. But once we say that there is a market and Congress can require people to participate in it, as some would say, or as you would say, that people are already participating in it, it seems to me that we can't say there are limitations on what Congress can do under its commerce power. Just like in any other area -- given significant deference that we accord to Congress in this area, all bets are off, and you could regulate that market in any rational way."

But next year, they can decide everybody's in this market; we're going to look at a different problem now, and this is how we're going to regulate it.

That's exactly right, but it doesn't seem responsive to my concern that there's no reason -- once we say this is within Congress's commerce power, there's no reason other than our own arbitrary judgment to say all they can regulate is the method of payment. They can regulate other things that affect this now-conceded interstate market in health care in which everybody participates."

    "speech": "We got two and they're -- they're different. Let me state them. First, with respect to the comprehensive scheme. When Congress is regulating -- is enacting a comprehensive scheme that it has the authority to enact, that the Necessary and Proper Clause gives it the authority to include regulation, including a regulation of this kind, if it is necessary to counteract risks attributable to the scheme itself that people engage in economic activity that would undercut the scheme. It's like -- it's very much like Wickard in that respect. Very much like Raich in that respect. With respect to the -- with respect to the -- considering the Commerce Clause alone and not embedded in the comprehensive scheme, our position is that Congress can regulate the method of payment by imposing an insurance requirement in advance of the time in which the -- the service is consumed when the class to which that requirement applies either is, or virtually most certain to be, in that market, when the timing of one's entry into that market and what you will need when you enter that market is uncertain, and when -- when you will get the care in that market, whether you can afford to pay for it or not and shift costs to other market participants. So, those -- those are our views as to -- those are the principles we're advocating for, and it's, in fact, the conjunction of the two of them here that makes this, we think, a strong case under the Commerce Clause."

    "speaker": "VERRILLI",

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

In fact, it seems to me the license tax cases point you in the opposite direction.

A tax is a revenue-raising device, and the purpose of this exaction is to get people into the health care risk pool before they need medical care. And so, it will be successful if it doesn't raise any revenue, if it gets people to buy the insurance. That's -- that's what this penalty is -- this penalty is designed to affect conduct. The conduct is buy health protection, buy health insurance before you have a need for medical care. That's what the penalty is designed to do, not to raise revenue."

On the -- December 23rd, a point of constitutional order was called, too, in fact, with respect to this law. The floor sponsor, Senator Baucus, defended it as an exercise of the taxing power. In his response to the point of order, the Senate voted 60 to 39 on that proposition. The legislative history is replete with members of Congress explaining that this law is constitutional as an exercise of the taxing power. It was attacked as a tax by its opponents. So, I don't think this is a situation where you can say that Congress was avoiding any mention of the tax power. It would be one thing if Congress explicitly disavowed an exercise of the tax power. But given that it hasn't done so, it seems to me that it's -- not only is it fair to read this as an exercise of the tax power, but this Court has got an obligation to construe it as an exercise of the tax power, if it can be upheld on that basis."

Beyond that, the limiting principle, as the Court has identified from Drexel Furniture to Kurth Ranch, is that it can't be punishment, punitive in the guise of a tax. And there are three factors the Court has identified to look at that. The first is the sanction and how disproportionate it is to the conduct; the second is whether there is scienter; and the third is whether there is an administrative apparatus out there to enforce the tax. Now, in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture, for example, the tax was 10 percent of the company's profits, even if they had only one child laborer for one day. There was a scienter requirement. And it was enforced by the Department of Labor. It wasn't just collected by the Internal Revenue Service. Here you don't have any of those things. This -- the penalty is calculated to be no more than, at most, the equivalent of what one would have paid for insurance that you've forgone. There is no scienter requirement. There's no enforcement apparatus out there. So, it's certainly --"

The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate existing commerce. It does not give Congress the far greater power to compel people to enter commerce, to create commerce essentially in the first place. Now, Congress when it passed the statute did make findings about why it thought it could regulate the commerce here, and it justified the mandate as a regulation of the economic decision to forgo the purchase of health insurance. That is a theory without any limiting principle."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, Justice, I think there's two points to make on that. One is a lot of the discussion this morning so far has proceeded on the assumption that the only thing that's at issue here is emergency room visits, and the only thing that's being imposed is catastrophic care coverage. But, as the Chief Justice indicated earlier, a lot of the insurance that's being covered is for ordinary preventive care, ordinary office visits, and those are the kind of things that one can predict. So, there's a big part of the market that's regulated here that wouldn't pose the problem that you're suggesting; but, even as to emergency room visits, it certainly would be possible to regulate at that point. You could simply say, through some sort of mandate on the insurance companies, you have to provide people that come in -- this will be a high-risk pool, and maybe you'll have to share it amongst yourself or something, but people simply have to sign up at that point, and that would be regulating at the point of sale."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "Well, Mr. Clement, now it seems as though you're just talking about a matter of timing, that Congress can regulate the transaction. And the question is when does it make best sense to regulate that transaction? And Congress surely has it within its authority to decide, rather than at the point of sale, given an insurance-based mechanism, it makes sense to regulate it earlier. It's just a matter of timing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Kagan, we don't think it's a matter of timing alone, and we think it has very significant substantive effects, because if Congress tried to regulate at the point of sale, the one group that it wouldn't capture at all are the people who don't want to purchase health insurance and also have no plans of using health care services in the near term. And Congress very much wanted to capture those people. I mean, those people are essentially the golden geese that pay for the entire lowering of the premium --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Is the government's argument this -- and maybe I won't state it accurately. It is true that the noninsured young adult is, in fact, an actuarial reality insofar as our allocation of health services, insofar as the way health insurance companies figure risk. That person who is sitting at home in his or her living room doing nothing is an actuarial reality that can and must be measured for health service purposes; is that their argument?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, I don't know, Justice Kennedy, but, if it is, I think there's at least two problems with it. One is, as Justice Alito's question suggested earlier -- I mean, somebody who is not in the insurance market is sort of irrelevant as an actuarial risk. I mean, we could look at the people not in the insurance market, and what we'd find is that they're relatively young, relatively healthy, and they would have a certain pool of actuarial risks that would actually lead to lower premiums. The people that would be captured by guaranteed rating and community issue -- guaranteed issue and community rating would presumably have a higher risk profile, and there would be higher premiums. And one of the things, one of the things, Congress sought to accomplish here was to force individuals into the insurance market to subsidize those that are already in it to lower the rates. And that's just not my speculation, that's Finding (I) at 43a of the Government's brief that -- it has the statute. And that's one of the clear findings."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Clement, doesn't that work -- that work the way Social Security does? Let me put it this way: Congress, in the '30s, saw a real problem of people needing to have old age and survivor's insurance. And, yes, they did it through a tax, but they said everybody has got to be in it because if we don't have the healthy in it, there's not going to be the money to pay for the ones who become old or disabled or widowed. So, they required everyone to contribute. There was a big fuss about that in the beginning because a lot of people said -- maybe some people still do today -- I could do much better if the government left me alone. I'd go into the private market, I'd buy an annuity, I'd make a great investment, and they're forcing me to pay for this Social Security that I don't want. But that's constitutional. So, if Congress could see this as a problem where we need to have a group that will subsidize the ones who are going to get the benefits, it seems to me you're saying the only way that could be done is if the government does it itself; it can't involve the private market, it can't involve the private insurers. If it wants to do this, Social Security is its model. The government has to do -- has to be government takeover. We can't have the insurance industry in it. Is that your position?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "No. I don't think it is, Justice Ginsburg. I think there are other options that are available. The most straightforward one would be to figure out what amount of subsidy to the insurance industry is necessary to pay for guaranteed issue and community rating. And once we calculate the amount of that subsidy, we could have a tax that's spread generally through everybody to raise the revenue to pay for that subsidy. That's the way we pay for most subsidies."

    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, I think it would depend a little bit on how it was formulated, but my concern would be -- the constitutional concern would be that it would just be a disguised impermissible direct tax. And I do think -- you know, I mean, I don't want to suggest we get to the taxing power too soon, but I do think it's worth realizing that the taxing power is limited in the ability to impose direct taxes. And the one thing I think the Framers would have clearly identified as a direct tax is a tax on not having something. I mean, the framing generation was divided over whether a tax on carriages was a direct tax or not. Hamilton thought that was a indirect tax; Madison thought it was a direct tax. I have little doubt that both of them would have agreed that a tax on not having a carriage would have clearly been a direct tax. I also think they would have thought it clearly wasn't a valid regulation of the market in carriages. And, you know, I mean, if you look at Hylton v. The United States, that's this Court's first direct tax case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Let me ask -- can I go back for a step? Because I don't want to get into a discussion of whether this is a good bill or not. Some people think it's going to save a lot of money. Some people think it won't. So, I'm focusing just on the Commerce Clause; not on the Due Process Clause, the Commerce Clause. And I look back into history, and I think if we look back into history, we see sometimes Congress can create commerce out of nothing. That's the national bank, which was created out of nothing to create other commerce out of nothing. I look back into history, and I see it seems pretty clear that if there are substantial effects on interstate commerce, Congress can act. And I look at the person who's growing marijuana in her house, or I look at the farmer who is growing wheat for home consumption. This seems to have more substantial effects. Is this commerce? Well, it seems to me more commerce than marijuana. I mean, is it, in fact, a regulation? Well, why not? If creating the bank is, why isn't this? And then you say, ah, but one thing here out of all those things is different, and that is you're making somebody do something. I say, hey, can't Congress make people drive faster than 45 -- 40 miles an hour on a road? Didn't they make that man growing his own wheat go out into the market and buy other wheat for his -- for his cows? Didn't they make Mrs. -- if she married somebody who had marijuana in her basement, wouldn't she have to go and get rid of it? Affirmative action? I mean, where does this distinction come from? It sounds like sometimes you can, and sometimes you can't. So, what is argued here is there is a large group of -- what about a person that we discover that there are -- a disease is sweeping the United States, and 40 million people are susceptible, of whom 10 million will die; can't the Federal Government say all 40 million get inoculation? So, here, we have a group of 40 million, and 57 percent of those people visit emergency care or other care, which we're paying for. And 22 percent of those pay more than $100,000 for that. And Congress says they're in the midst of this big thing. We just want to rationalize the system they're already in. So, there, you got the whole argument, and I would like you to tell me, looking back --"

    "speech": "Answer those questions in inverse order. (Laughter.) we're going to force the citizenry to put all of their money in the bank, because, if we do that, then we know the Bank of the United States will be secure. I think the Framers would have identified the difference between those two scenarios, and I don't think that the great Chief Justice would have said that forcing people to put their deposits in the Bank of the United States was necessary and proper. Now, if you look through all the cases you mentioned, I do not think you will find a case like this. And I think it's telling that you won't. I mean, the regulation of the wheat market in Wickard v. Filburn, all this effort to address the supply side and what producers could do, what Congress was trying to do was support the price of wheat. It would have been much more efficient to just make everybody in America buy 10 loaves of bread. That would have had a much more direct effect on the price of wheat in the prevailing market. But we didn't do that. We didn't say, when we had problems in the automobile industry, that we're not just going to give you incentives, not just cash for clunkers; we're going to actually have everybody over 100,000 dollars has to buy a new car --"

Filburn, because that's a particular market in which the farmer had been participating. Everybody is in this market. So, that makes it very different than the market for cars or the other hypotheticals that you came up with, and all they're regulating is how you pay for it."

    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I suppose the first thing you have to say is what market are we talking about?

The whole problem is that everybody is not in that market, and they want to make everybody get into that market."

Insurance guarantees you an up-front, locked-in payment, and you won't have to pay any more than that even if you incur much greater expenses. And in every other market that I know of for insurance, we let people basically make the decision whether they're relatively risk averse, whether they're relatively non-risk averse, and they can make the judgment based on --"

And we also know that we can't predict when. And we also know that when we do, there will be our fellow taxpayers through the Federal Government who will pay for this. If we do not buy insurance, we will pay nothing. And that happens with a large number of people in this group of 40 million, none of whom can be picked out in advance. Now, that's quite different from the car situation, and it's different in only this respect: It shows there is a national problem, and it shows there is a national problem that involves money, cost, insurance. So, if Congress could do this, should there be a disease that strikes the United States and they want every one inoculated even though 10 million will be hurt, it's hard for me to decide why that isn't interstate commerce, even more so where we know it affects everybody."

There also are situations where there are many economic effects from somebody's failure to purchase a product. And if I could -- if I could talk about the difference between the health insurance market and the health care market, I mean, ultimately I don't want you to leave here with the impression that anything turns on that. Because if the government decided tomorrow that they've come up with a great -- somebody -- some private company has come up with a great new wonder drug that would be great for everybody to take, it would have huge health benefits for everybody; and by the way, also, if everybody had to buy it, it would facilitate economies of scale, and the production would be great, and the price would be cheaper -- and force everybody in the health care market, the actual health care market, to buy the wonder drug, I'd be up here making the same argument. I'd be saying that's not a power that's within the commerce power of the Federal Government. It is something much greater. And it would have been much more controversial. That's one of the important things. In Federalist 45, Madison says the commerce power -- that's a new power, but it's not one anyone has any apprehension about. The reason they didn't have any apprehension about it is because it's a power that only operated once people were already in commerce. You see that from the text of the clause. The first kind of commerce Congress gets to regulate is commerce with foreign nations. Did anybody think the fledgling Republic had the power to compel some other nation into commerce with us? Of course not. And in the same way, I think if the Framers had understood the commerce power to include the power to compel people to engage in commerce --"

If some -- if I don't buy a car and somebody goes on welfare, I'm going to end up paying for that as well. But let me also say that there's a real disconnect then between that focus on what makes this different and the statute that Congress passed. If all we were concerned about is the cost sharing that took place because of uncompensated care in emergency rooms, presumably we'd have before us a statute that only addressed emergency care and catastrophic insurance coverage. But it covers everything, soup to nuts, and all sorts of other things. And that gets at the idea that there's two kinds of cost shifting that are going on here. One is the concern about emergency care and that somehow somebody who gets sick is going to shift costs back to other policy areas -- holders. But there's a much bigger cost shifting going on here, and that's the cost shifting that goes on when you force healthy people into an insurance market precisely because they're healthy, precisely because they're not likely to go to the emergency room, precisely because they're not likely to use the insurance they're forced to buy in the health care insurance. That creates a huge windfall. It lowers the price of premiums. And, again, this isn't just some lawyer up here telling you that's what it does and trying to second-guess the congressional economic decisions. This is Congress's findings, Findings (I) on page 43a of the appendix to the Government's brief."

First, the Solicitor General came up with a couple joined, very narrow ones. You've seen in Lopez this Court say that we cannot -- Congress cannot get into purely local affairs, particularly where they're noncommercial. And, of course, the greatest limiting principle of all, which not too many accept -- so, I'm not going to emphasize that -- is the limiting principle derived from the fact that members of Congress are elected from States and that 95 percent of the law of the United States is State law. That is a principle, though enforced by the legislature. The other two are principles, one written into Lopez and one you just heard. It seems to me all of those eliminate the broccoli possibility, and none of them eliminates the possibility that we're trying to take the 40 million people who do have the medical cost, who do affect interstate commerce, and provide a system that you may like or not like."

And then the first point, which was -- I take it to be the Solicitor General's point, is, with all due respect, simply a description of the insurance market. It's not a limiting principle, because the justification for why this is a valid regulation of commerce is in no way limited to this market. It simply says these are economic decisions; they have effect on other people; my failure to purchase in this market has a direct effect on others who are already in the market.

Once you're in the commerce power, there -- this Court is not going to police that subject maybe to the Lopez limit. And that's exactly why I think it's very important for this Court to think seriously about taking an unprecedented step of saying that the commerce power not only includes the power to regulate, prescribe the rule by which commerce is governed, the rule of Gibbons v. Ogden; but to go further and say it's not just prescribing the rule for commerce that exists, but it is the power to compel people to enter into commerce in the first place. I'd like to say two very brief things about the taxing power, if I could. There are lots of reasons why this isn't a tax. It wasn't denominated a tax. It's not structured as a tax. If it's any tax at all, though, it is a direct tax. Article I, section 9, clause 4 -- the Framers would have had no doubt that a tax on not having something is not an excise tax but a forbidden direct tax. That's one more reason why this is not proper legislation, because it -- it violates that. The second thing is I would urge you to read the license tax case, which the Solicitor General says is his best case for why you ignore the fact that a tax is denominated into something other. Because that's a case where the argument was that because the Federal Government had passed a license, not a tax, that somehow that allowed people to take actions that would have been unlawful under State law, that this was some special Federal license to do something that was forbidden by State law. This Court looked beyond the label in order to preserve federalism there. What the Solicitor General and the government ask you to do here is exactly the opposite, which is to look past labels in order to up-end our basic federalist system. And this --"

May it please the Court: I'd like to begin with the Solicitor General's main premise, which is that they can compel the purchase of health insurance in order to promote commerce in the health market because it will reduce uncompensated care. If you accept that argument, you have to fundamentally alter the text of the Constitution and give Congress plenary power. It simply doesn't matter whether or not this regulation will promote health care commerce by reducing uncompensated care. All that matters is whether the activity actually being regulated by the Act negatively affects commerce or negatively affects commerce regulation, so that it's within the commerce power. If you agree with us that this is -- exceeds commerce power, the law doesn't somehow become redeemed because it has beneficial policy effects in the health care market. In other words, Congress does not have the power to promote commerce. Commerce has -- Congress has the power to regulate commerce.

No one in Congress or the Solicitor General is arguing that going to the doctor and fully paying him creates a problem. The problem is uncompensated care, and they say the uncompensated care arises if you have some kind of catastrophe -- hit by a bus, have some prolonged illness.

So, the question is whether or not you can regulate activity because it has a statistical connection to an activity that harms commerce.

For example, he gives -- even in that farm case, the farmer was being forced to go out and buy grain to feed to his animals because he couldn't raise it at home.

There's a perfectly legitimate way they could enforce their alternative, i.e., requiring you to buy health insurance when you access health care, which is the same penalty structure that's in the Act. There is no moral dilemma between having people have insurance and denying them emergency service. Congress has made a perfectly legitimate value judgment that they want to make sure that people get emergency care.

In that world, the government has set up commerce. It's all over the United States. And in that world, of course, the decision by the 40 million not to buy the insurance affects that commerce and substantially so. So, I thought the issue here is not whether it's a violation of some basic right or something to make people buy things they don't want, but simply whether those decisions of that group of 40 million people substantially affect the interstate commerce that has been set up in part through these other programs."

That's my concern in the case."

Sure, it would be perfectly fine if they allowed -- you do actuarial risk for young people on the basis of their risk for disease, just like you judge flood insurance on the homeowner's risk of flood. One of the issues here is not only that they're compelling us to enter into the marketplace, they're not -- they're prohibiting us from buying the only economically sensible product that we would want, catastrophic insurance. Everyone agrees the only potential problem of the 30-year-old is he goes from the healthy 70 percent of the population to the unhealthy 5 percent. And yet, Congress prohibits anyone over 30 from buying any kind of catastrophic health insurance. And the reason they do that is because they need this massive subsidy. Justice Alito, it's not our numbers. CBO said that injecting my clients into the risk pool lowers premiums by 15 to 20 percent. So, Justice Kennedy, even if we were going to create exceptions for people that are outside of commerce and inside of commerce, surely we'd make Congress do a closer nexus and say, look, we're really addressing this problem; we want these 30-year-olds to get catastrophic health insurance. And not only did they -- they deprived them of that option. And I think that illustrates the dangers of giving Congress these plenary powers, because they can always leverage them. They can always come up with some public policy rationale that converts the power to regulate commerce into the power to promote commerce, which, as I was saying before, is the one that I think is plenary."

And your test, which is a test that focuses on this activity/inactivity distinction, would force one to confront that problem all the time. Now, if you look over the history of the Commerce Clause, what you see is that there were sort of unhappy periods when the Court used tests like this, direct versus indirect, commerce versus manufacturing. I think most people would say that those things didn't really work. And the question is why should this test, inactive versus active, work any better?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",

You'd have to draw distinctions between the insurance industry and the car industry and all of that, returning to the Commerce Clause jurisprudence that bedeviled the Court before the 1930s, where they were drawing all these kinds of distinctions among industries; whereas our test is really very simple. Are you buying the product, or is Congress compelling you to buy the product? I can't think of a brighter line. And, again, if Congress has the power to compel you to buy this product, then obviously they've got the power to provide you -- to compel you to buy any product, because any purchase is going to benefit commerce. And this Court is never going to second-guess Congress's policy judgments on how important it is, this product versus that product."

    "speech": "The words \"inactivity\" and \"activity\" are not in the Constitution. The words \"commerce\" and \"non-commerce\" are. And, again, it's a distinction that comes, Justice Kagan, directly from the text of the Constitution. The Framers consciously gave Congress the ability to regulate commerce, because that's not a legislation which is against all reason and justice, because everyone intuitively understands that regulating people who voluntarily enter into contracts in setting terms and conditions does not create the possibility of Congress compelling wealth transfers among the citizenry. And that is precisely why the Framers denied them the power to compel commerce and precisely why they didn't give them plenary power."

    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Congress confronted a grave problem when it enacted the Affordable Care Act: the 40 million Americans who can't get health insurance and suffered often very terrible consequences. Now, we agree, I think, everyone arguing this case agrees, that Congress could remedy that problem by imposing an insurance requirement at the point of sale. That won't work. The reason it won't work is because people will still show up at the hospital or at their physician's office seeking care without insurance, causing the cost-shifting problem. And Mr. Clement's suggestion that they can be signed up for a high risk pool at that point is utterly unrealistic. Think about how much it would cost to get the insurance when you are at the hospital or at the doctor. It would be -- it would be unfathomably high. That will never work. Congress understood that. It chose the means that will work, the means that it saw worked in the States and -- in the State of Massachusetts, and that -- and that it had every reason to think would work on a national basis. That is the kind of choice of means that McCulloch says that the Constitution leaves to the democratically accountable branches of government. There is no temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause. Everyone subject to this regulation is in or will be in the health care market. They are just being regulated in advance. That's exactly the kind of thing that ought to be left to the judgment of Congress and the democratically accountable branches of government. And I think this is actually a paradigm example of the kind of situation that Chief Justice Marshall envisioned in McCulloch itself, that the provisions of the Constitution needed to be interpreted in a manner that would allow them to be effective in addressing the great crises of human affairs that the Framers could not even envision. But if there's any doubt about that under the Commerce Clause, then I urge this Court to uphold the -- the minimum coverage provision as an exercise of the taxing power. Under New York v. United States, this is precisely a parallel situation. If the Court thinks there's any doubt about the ability of Congress to impose the requirement in 5000A(a), it can be treated as simply the predicate to which the tax incentive of 5000A(b) seeks accomplishment. And the Court, as the Court said in New York, has a solemn obligation to respect the judgments of the democratically accountable branches of government, and because this statute can be construed in a manner that allows it to be upheld in that way, I respectfully submit that it is this Court's duty to do above-entitled matter was submitted.) 7:3 91:15 65:2,3,7 bigger76:13 77:5,21 calling 51:12 2:17 102:20 confronted110:17 43:6,24 56:2 70:8 context 37:1 71:19 35:6 52:6 64:22 0:17 31:17 34:9 69:16 75:15 76:3,5 entry 45:23 everybody's 13:13 expand 21:11 1:11 72:3,4 73:9 102:4,7 105:1 83:19 evident 28:7,23 35:13 6:23 79:19 96:10 eminently 25:12 environment 16:16 exact 11:7 experience 23:14 :7 57:14 62:18 101:10 essentially 55:12 Excuse 3:18 31:1 :23 31:20 32:4,9 66:13,19,21,22,25 intervention 69:5 49:15 50:1,11 51:5 7:15 98:2,24 99:1 65:25 88:12 89:19 91:11 79:18 82:2 91:2 lots 11:4 68:18 9:12,19 100:4,17 kids 36:16 91:18 limiting 44:19 51:24 80:14 0:25 101:15 kind 19:18 30:20 law5:4 21:14 31:21 52:2,4,9 55:18 lower58:16,24 2:20,25 63:11 97:22,24 98:1,21 91:16 103:15 minute 54:21 97:1 60:10 64:25 65:8 :15 71:23 72:16 39:18 40:23,24 pernicious 101:3 :17 75:16 85:8 41:16,19 44:20 person 13:9 14:1 5:16 59:11 89:7 result 14:23 20:1 79:24 82:4 83:9,11 5:14 13:2,8,10,24 22:6 85:14 9:2 103:23 revenue 25:16 56:19 58:3 75:15 37:21 38:16,24 sells 38:20 0:23 112:12 47:13 49:3,7,13,18 76:17 100:19 39:1,7,10,13 42:2 Senate 50:15 :18 102:8 roadside 6:2 79:3 91:7,16 100:7 setting 53:19 110:3 :13 46:21 50:21 46:11 51:23 52:3 81:23,25 82:1 87:2 subjects 5:11 sun 79:23 7:16 61:25 62:4 80:15 theoretically 36:16 80:5,6 81:14,16 traditional 26:7 7:22 uniform 16:4 52:7 viewing 39:21 29:8 31:13 32:10 2:9  2:7"
