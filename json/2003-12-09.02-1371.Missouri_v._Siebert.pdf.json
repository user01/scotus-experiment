      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Miranda's core ruling is that an unwarned statement may not be used in the prosecution's case in chief to prove guilt. In this case, the prosecution did not seek to admit an unwarned statement, rather the statement that was offered was preceded by a meticulous recitation of Miranda warnings, an express waiver of rights, and was the product of non-coercive questioning. A fully warned and otherwise voluntary statement is not tainted by the existence of a prior unwarned statement even if the officer intentionally initiated questioning without warning and that is true for two reasons. First, because an officer's intent does not render the unwarned statement actually involuntary. The unwarned statement is merely presumptively compelled, and once warnings are administered, that presumption ends and the suspect has the information necessary to make a knowing and intelligent decision about waiver."

    {
      "speaker": "MITCHELL",
      "speech": "It would depend on how that happened, but under the facts of this case, yes, it would still remain true. There are essentially -- under Miranda, there are two elements that we have to look at in determining whether a statement is admissible, and that is whether you have a knowing, intelligent, voluntary waiver and whether the statement is in fact voluntary. If there is a reference back, as there was in this case to the previous statement, it could be a problem if that is part of the waiver element. And I believe that's what this Court indicated in Elstad itself. If the officer used that in a way that affected the knowing nature then of what the -- the information that was imparted and made the waiver therefore defective, it may be problematic. However, as in this case, where there's simply a reference back during the -- the questioning, after there is a waiver and a decision to go forward, that alone does not affect the voluntariness of that subsequent statement."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "The difficulty I have with the argument is the premise that you state -- is in accepting the premise that you state, and that is that a second interrogation that falls on the heels of the first -- here, I think there was a 20-minute break -- can really be separated as a matter of simple psychology. I -- I have difficulty in accepting the plausibility of a conclusion that the -- that the ostensible waiver in the second case is really a free waiver as distinct from sort of throwing up one's hands and saying it's too late to say no now. It's the -- it -- there's a basic implausibility in your case. What -- what can you offer on that point?"

      "speaker": "MITCHELL",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

In -- in Elstad, you did not have a -- let's say, a -- a systematic questioning of the -- of the sort that went on here. Here the -- the police did, indeed, engage in a kind of first-round interrogation, and the -- the intensity of their pressure to get answers in this case seems to me qualitatively different from Elstad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MITCHELL",
      "speech": "It is different, Your Honor. There clearly is a continuum. But the appropriate question is whether the first statement was involuntary or not. If in fact that questioning and that pressure had been great enough to make that first statement involuntary, then absolutely it would create the kind of taint that could carry forward even after subsequent warnings were given. I think that is the lesson of Elstad. But Elstad draws that distinction between actual coercion and presumptive coercion, and where it is merely presumptive -- it does not rise to the level of actual -- then that does not carry forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But that's -- comparatively speaking, I -- I think maybe that was -- that was relatively easy to tell in Elstad. Here, it's going to be a serious issue, and it seems to me that in order to litigate this issue as the threshold issue to determining whether the second waiver or as part of the litigation as to whether the -- the ostensible waiver really is a waiver and the second statement really is voluntary, we're right back in the morass of litigation, which is one of the principal objects of Miranda to avoid in the first place. We -- we said, look, this -- this litigation is very difficult. It's difficult to engage in this litigation and produce a -- a clear and reliable answer. It seems to me that -- that the position you take forces us right back into that litigation position that we tried to get away from in Miranda itself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MITCHELL",

      "speech": "But you want us to wade deeper. You're -- you're absolutely right. There's -- there's no -- there's no easy way. But your way would make it more difficult. Your -- your way would promote litigation, wouldn't it?"

    {
      "speaker": "MITCHELL",
      "speech": "I -- I don't know that I agree with that because I don't see this as different from where you are in Harris where you still have to do a full-blown analysis of voluntariness. It is somewhat different than the two-prong analysis that is done in every case where voluntariness is at issue because you have the warnings and then, arguably, the totality of the circumstances analysis is somewhat easier. But, nevertheless, in a situation such as Harris, where you're making on the front end a determination on voluntariness, I think it is very, very similar to what -- what we are suggesting here."

In Elstad, when -- in talking about the effect of the cat out of the bag on the individual, the Court talked about some subjective disadvantage that the individual might have, and so I suppose that type of analysis could lump that within the characteristics of the individual that the Court would look at in determining a totality of the circumstances analysis."

When there's no coercion, it should not -- there's no taint that carries forward. But if it is to be considered at all -- and perhaps it shouldn't be, but in a totality of the circumstances analysis, if there is a reference back and the Court wants to consider that as part of the totality, it seems to me the Court might look at from the perspective of whether it in some way affects the individual."

It adds nothing to the psychological force that operates on the suspect who has confessed once as a result of unwarned -- during unwarned questioning and the giving and subsequent administration of Miranda warnings is no less effective in providing the information that is necessary to make a knowing and voluntary decision --"

We're not sure. And this gets rid of the risk, so that that's a very good way of describing it. And then it seems to me in this kind of case we have two risks. One was the risk that really it was compelled -- the first statement. And second is the risk that really that first statement does lead to the second confession. And so to obviate those risks, would it make sense to say in any case where the police knowingly or reasonably should have known they're supposed to give Miranda warnings in the first case, you can use the second statement but only if the government shows that, first of all, that first one wasn't compelled? Second, it shows that the Miranda warning was given before the second.

Now let me address your question about reasonable and knowing and whether that should make a difference. The fact that the warnings were known, that -- that this was a custodial interrogation situation, the fact that the officer may have been unreasonable in thinking it was not -- neither of those adds anything to the level of compulsion that is experienced by the suspect during the initial --"

Anyone reading the Miranda decision says, oh, yes, these are the things the police are supposed to say up front. And now you're saying, no, it doesn't really mean that at all.

Yes. Okay? That statement doesn't come in. And then later on he asks it again after the right warning. That's case one. Case two. The policeman, knowing everything about Miranda, thinks to himself, ha, ha, ha, I've got a great trick here. Did you commit the crime, the fire? Yes. And then later on he asks him the question again after warnings. In terms of the psychology of the defendant answering the second time, whether that policeman was a fool or a knave seems beside the point. And so if your -- if -- if your whole argument is one of psychology, I don't get it. Now, that's -- maybe there's more to your argument than just the psychology of the -- the criminal or the defendant -- the criminal defendant the second time.

I think everybody agrees if it was coerced in the first instance, the case is over. Is that what you mean by pressured out of her, or -- or the mere -- the mere failure to give Miranda warning constitutes pressure?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTHOLOW",
      "speech": "I don't think the mere failure to administer the warning may create the pressure, but it's when the officer embarks upon the -- the specific questioning and interrogation to get -- deliberately elicit an incriminating response, then you have this type of coercive environment or coercive manner of questioning that Elstad was concerned with. And I think that's why Elstad's opinion cited Pierce and Westover for the types of questioning that would necessarily or -- or run the great risk of coercing the defendant into confessing."

Orderly interrogation or programmed interrogation?"

It was not, on the other hand, coerced in the sense that it was the product of beating him over the head with a 2 by 4. And as I understand it, you have been saying, look, any unwarned Miranda -­ unwarned statement that is given in custody shares the -- the character that Miranda said it had, inherently coercive atmosphere. But that doesn't mean the same thing as -- as coercion carried to the point of hitting him over the head.

My first assumption is it's intolerable to have policemen going around purposely -- purposely -- violating the Miranda rule. Now, assume that conclusion, though I know it's arguable. Now, if that happens, if they deliberately and purposely have not given these warnings when they knew they should, that would create a situation where they might do it a lot and we'd have a lot of coerced confessions we couldn't ever prove. Okay? So I consider that -- let's call it bad."

Now, there are three possible positions: always, never, and sometimes. So I'm exploring the sometimes. Now, I want to know if -- what kind of a rule might you think was okay on the sometimes. Now, one thing I thought of is if they can show -- not you, but the prosecutor can show that that first statement taken was not coerced and that, second, they really gave the warnings the second time, and that, third, something happened to cut that causal connection because the average person would think, of course, I've got to say what I said before, otherwise they're going to do something really terrible to me. All right? So -- so what -- now, I'm looking for passage of time, I'm looking for something else to cut the causal connection. But I'm looking really for your view on this. If the answer is sometimes, if the answer is never, but if it is sometimes, what kind of a sometimes?"

And I think the Missouri Supreme Court cited another of our State cases, State v. Wright, where this exact thing happened, questioning occurred and then a day passed, and then questioning occurred again, and that was sufficient to break the causal link. I think if officers embarking on this type of calculated, unwarned questioning then add to their warnings, when they finally give them, that what you said can't be used against you, if they would have added that, that might have helped an attenuation analysis. But I think clearly none of that occurred here. I think the -- another problem with this case and this type of tactic is that it affects the truth- seeking function of the trial, the jury, and what it's finding because the first thing the jury hears is when the tape is played and they hear immediately a waiver of rights and --"

And the only way we can bring that for the -- before the jury is to show them that she, in fact, made an unwarned statement. And that -- it precludes our ability to defend her by not being able to show under what circumstances she ultimately made that waiver. It also allows the -- the unwarned statement to come in because on that tape recording you have the officer mentioning that she made an unwarned statement, and the jury is never supposed to hear that.

They -- and I think they tape recorded her interview with them on the -- February 14th, hoping that she would make some sort of incriminating statement, and when she didn't, then they engaged in this practice to subject her to the intense custodial interrogation to try and get the -- the warning from her. But they weren't -- I mean -- excuse me -- the confession from her. But they weren't going to warn her because they were afraid she might invoke. And I think this Court in Escobedo said, you know, we shouldn't fear that a suspect is going to assert her rights if she knew about them."

And I find that in fact that your brief in opposition did make that point. Now, if -- if the question presented as set forth in the petitioner's brief is not accurate, what do you think would be accurate? Would -- do you think it presents the question at least of whether the intentional failure to give a Miranda warning is one of the factors properly considered in determining whether the second confession is voluntary or not? It at least presents that question, doesn't it?"

      "speaker": "BARTHOLOW",
      "speech": "I think it presents that question. I don't -- I don't think the Court should proceed on the assumption that the initial statement was voluntary, and that is -- that's always been our first line of defense, is that this wasn't a voluntary statement because under Elstad -- under Elstad the Court said that when a suspect is being subjected to a coercive environment or where the manner of the questioning in the case is coercive, then the standard Elstad rule doesn't apply. And -- and especially because when Justice Brennan tried to posit this two-step interrogation that it would become all the rage and specifically -- I mean, the description of Justice Brennan's two-step interrogation mirrors this -- this exactly. This Court said that's apocalyptic. We are not encouraging that. We do not want police officers or prosecutors to -- to use that tactic. And -- and unfortunately, I believe law enforcement took the invitation of Justice Brennan's dissent perhaps and didn't listen to what you said in the majority opinion. I think this tactic is bad for the police. It is bad for suspects, and it is bad for courts. It's got three strikes against it. And the test that we would ask you to apply is that when police officers deliberately withhold Miranda in order to elicit an incriminating response when they knew or should have known that Miranda was required, then the second statement will be presumed compelled unless and until the State can show that it has been attenuated from the first. And if there --"

The -- the woman would feel just as coerced whether the failure to give it was -- was intentional or non-intentional it seems to me."

The -- the FBI itself required warnings long before Miranda and it was because it made the -- the interrogators respect the person's rights, and that's why the warnings were required. If the officer intends to disrespect those rights and leave the Fifth Amendment unprotected, then I think there's a grave danger that they will use tactics that they used here, that they will refer to the unwarned statement to pressure the waiver, that they will refer to the unwarned statement to get the second statement, and that there will never be an exercise of the suspect's free will."

You had one or two questions at the suspect's house. You know, we're here to talk about a burglary. Do you know these people? Yes. Well, we think you were involved in that. Yes, I was there. Period. You know. There was a question whether there was custody or not. I don't think this Court would have found custody in the first instance. And there was a real question about whether that constituted an interrogation at all. And I think in those circumstances -- or -- or if an officer just didn't know that they hadn't been Mirandized by the first officer or something, when there's clearly a good faith error on the part of the police, then this test would not be required.

      "speaker": "MITCHELL",
      "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. On the issue of systematic interrogation that came up several times during the argument, that is relevant only if it rises to the level of making that first statement actually involuntary. And I think that's clear from the Elstad opinion itself. At one point during the Elstad opinion, specifically in footnote 2 of the majority opinion, the Court is talking about lower court decisions where the -- the lower court did not apply the attenuation-type doctrine. And referring to some of those cases as involving, quote, clearly voluntary, unwarned admissions, the Court then goes on and cites a number of cases that involve actual station house interrogations, in many cases much longer than the interrogation we have here. Specifically, I'd point the Court to the Derrico decision cited in Elstad. So just the idea that you have a traditional station house-type interrogation is not enough. The question is, does it render the first statement involuntary and therefore capable of tainting the second statement? In this case the question of voluntariness of each statement was raised in the initial motion to suppress, and even though there were not extensive findings by the trial court, they denied those motions to suppress. And that issue was not raised again in either of the appellate courts in Missouri, and the Missouri Supreme Court did not reach that issue. On the question of what the Missouri Supreme Court held, three points I think are very important. The court starts out by phrasing or -- or characterizing its decision as such. Essential to the inquiry is whether the presumption that the first statement was involuntary carries over to the second statement. The court then goes on and throughout the opinion makes the decision to, in fact, carry that presumption forward. It focuses on intent and finds intent to be an improper tactic, as this Court used that phrase in Elstad, which is the predicate then for applying a fruits-type analysis and requiring attenuation, which is exactly what the Missouri Supreme Court does. And that is why we sought cert in this case. As to this -- the -- the apocalyptic issue and Justice Brennan's discussion in Elstad, Justice Brennan talked about a number of situations, including the application of Miranda to the Fourth Amendment, including the use of statements by police officers to garner a waiver which did not happen here, and other things that are simply inapplicable. This case is not that situation. Finally, what we are asking this Court to do is to reverse the Missouri court decision that focused on intent, deterrence, and the carrying forward of the presumption to taint the subsequent statement because each of those findings are inconsistent with this Court's holding in Elstad, and instead to apply the framework of Elstad to this case and to reverse. If there are no further questions."
