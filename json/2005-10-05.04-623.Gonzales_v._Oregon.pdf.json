And I would think that the argument on the other side is that the statute has nothing to do with assisted suicide. Congress didn't think about the death penalty, and it didn't think about assisted suicide. It's rather like the tobacco case, except a fortiori. Now, what's your response to that?"

I think that, first of all, I would say that Congress did focus on suicide, if not physician-assisted suicide, and I think that's an important distinction that I'd like to come back to. But I actually think the comparison to the tobacco case is quite instructive, because there what you had is a statute in which something seemed like it might come within the plain terms of the FDCA, and yet if you took that literally, it would run smack into another statutory scheme. And here, there is no other statutory scheme. To the contrary, the most natural reading of the Controlled Substances Act, I would say -- and I'll address it in a minute -- is that this falls within the authority of the Attorney General. And if you look to any alternative congressional indication of intent on this topic, the only thing you would find is the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997, which continues a Federal policy against assisted suicide."

There is every reason to believe that State legislatures will address the urgent issues involved in this case in a fair and impartial way.\" And then the Government added that, \"There is no indication that the political processes are malfunctioning in this area.\" That was a position presented to this Court in the Glucksberg case by the Government.

It seems to me that the problem that you have, with your reference back to the Harrison Act and the 90 years of regulation, is that the 90 years of regulation was regulation for the purpose of stopping drug pushing and drug abuse, in the conventional sense. And to say that a statute -- or a statutory history taken into consideration in determining the scope of this statute, with that kind of a history, can support a view that suddenly the Attorney General of the United States is given, in effect, the sole authority to determine whether any State may or may not authorize assisted suicide, and may do so in a way that any other Attorney General can flip back and forth -- as has happened in this case, if Attorney General Reno was wrong -- seems to me a kind of argument from history that simply cuts against you, because it leads to a sort of a bizarre result.

And I will grant you that Congress, in 1970, did not have before it in its contemplation a State that would make physician-assisted suicide lawful. But that's because it would have been unthinkable at that time. And what Congress did have clearly in its contemplation is the fact that a clear manifestation of a drug's potential for abuse was the fact that it could lead to suicide and overdoses. And that's page 35 of the House report, for those that look at legislative history. And I actually think that's --"

The details of the form that you fill out for the prescription, the fact that it has to be in writing, the regulations specify whether it has to be in pen or pencil -- I mean, there's such a pervasive involvement of the Federal Government in the regulation of these controlled substances that I don't think there's any additional commerce clause extension by regulating the purpose for which the prescription is being made. That's what the DEA did in the context of Marinol, when it was first moved from schedule 1 to schedule 2, that -- we discuss that in detail on page 30 of our brief. And I think that kind of regulation, although it's not a common feature of the DEA in its administration of the Controlled Substances Act, is an important one, is a legitimate one. And I guess what I would say, with respect to Congress's intent, is, it seems to me odd to think that a Congress that was concerned about overdoses, concerned about suicides, would be indifferent or agnostic on the question of using federally controlled substances for the express purpose of inducing a lethal overdose."

Certainly, that's what the legislative history, for those of you who would be willing to look at it, of the 1984 amendments reflects. Congress was not concerned about how States were defining legitimate medical practices. Congress was concerned about the failure to enforce existing State law. And that's clearly reflected in the legislative history, some of which is set out in the State's brief, on page 36, in note 16. But if you look at those five factors, what they are addressed to is individual applicants -- that is, individual doctors -- not to broad medical purposes. And what you're seeing here in the Attorney General's claim of authority, for the first time, is rules that are not addressed to controlled substances, per se, but to medical practices, and that is something that the Congress simply never contemplated giving you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ATKINSON",
      "speech": "Well, we think there's -- there are two answers to that, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice. The first is that, in Harris versus Christensen, this Court said that a Federal agent cannot promulgate a new regulation in the guise of interpreting an old one. Now, in 1971, when that regulation to which you refer was enacted, it was absolutely clear that the U.S. Attorney General could not have de-registered an Oregon doctor who was acting in accordance with State law, because, as this Court pointed out in United States versus Moore, the registration was a matter -- was as a matter of right if the -- if the physician was in good standing with State medical authorities. So, what he's attempting to do today, in the guise of interpreting that rule, is to make it mean something entirely different than what it meant when he enacted it.

I take it you agree that if we accepted that premise, that would be sufficient for you in this case."

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think Respondents have embraced the logical consequences of their position. And what it results in is turning the Controlled Substances Act, the federal Controlled Substances Act, into an odd patchwork. It also is profoundly a-historical, because, at the time of the Harrison Act of 1914 -- which the Controlled Substances Act was intended to strengthen, not weaken, as this Court pointed out in Moore -- at that time, the States had a variety of different approaches to opium and heroin and other -- and cocaine and other substances -- opium and cocaine now of which land on schedule 2. Some of them tightly regulated them, some of them allowed them in over- the-counter tonics in large quantities. And the point of the Harrison Act was to clean that up and impose a uniform Federal regime. And they knew it would have an impact on State regulation of medicine. And even the Court, in the Linder days, recognize that that was not, per se, a constitutional problem."

They were all over the map, but there was clearly a recognition that doctors were part and parcel of the problem, that there were needs in States to more closely regulate both the doctors and the pharmacies. That was, kind of, the two problems that gave rise to this. And there's no question that the impact of the Federal program was profound on the State's practice of medicine. Nonetheless, that program was upheld, and that has been the tradition in this area."

      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "I don't think so, Justice Stevens. It's the same reason as my answer earlier, which is, I think you have to look at this regime, and read it in light of the 90 years of Federal involvement in the regulation of controlled substances and the lack of a traditional Federal role in regulating medicine qua medicine. And I think this is on the -- on the side of the line of regulating controlled substances. With respect to the commerce-clause issue, I would -- thought that one thing that came clear out of the Raich decision is that the relevant factor to consider is not the class of activities that a State decides to decriminalize, but, rather, the class of activities that Congress decides to regulate. And with respect to schedule 2 substances, I would think this case is a fortiori. We're not talking about substances that are homegrown and are never part of a commercial transaction. And even those who were in the dissent in Raich, I think, would think that this was an appropriate commerce-clause application. This case is to Raich as the regulation of commercial farming would be to Wickard against Filburn. It is a much different situation. Congress's commerce-clause power is more robust here. I wanted to remark and focus for a minute on what an odd statute Oregon has passed. The practitioner respondents point out it is a prescribing law only. And Oregon itself points out that what's allowed here is the prescription, but not the administration, of these substances. Even what Oregon does, does not purport to be medicine, as one traditionally understands it. I can think of no other medical substance where a doctor can prescribe it, but not administer it. And I think if you look at that aspect of the statute, what becomes clear is that Oregon is not regulating medicine, it's purporting to basically take a Federal regulatory regime that allows doctors the ability to get at schedule 2 substances. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
