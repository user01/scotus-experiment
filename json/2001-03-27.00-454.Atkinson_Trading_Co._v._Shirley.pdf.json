      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the question of whether an Indian tribe may tax a transaction between nonmembers on fee land within the reservation. This Court has already held that nonmembers who are involved in an auto accident on the equivalent of fee land are not subject to the jurisdiction of tribal courts absent consent. A transaction between nonmembers on fee land is similarly outside the tribe's jurisdiction because it does not involve a consensual relationship with the tribe and does not threaten tribal self-government."

If there are several, then I guess it's the fact that you who don't have a connection is not the answer because maybe everybody in your category has a lot of connections with the tribe's services that they provide."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLE",

      "speech": "Well, that's my question, I guess, because suppose that there are a hundred hotels, ninety- nine of which use the sewerage systems, the water systems, the police, the hospitals, all kinds of other services provided by the tribe. Well, that might be a basis for imposing a tax on hotels. And then I don't know that one could get out of it by the happenstance that that particular hotel doesn't use all those services, only uses a couple."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLE",
      "speech": "Well, we don't have those facts in the record at all, and I think that the law is still that the individual nonmembers' rights not to be governed by the tribe would be respected. It's not an equal protection question."

The case is representative insofar as the presence of Indians -- non-Indians on fee land within the reservation was the result of a Federal statute. As a result of other Federal statutes, there are non-Indians on fee land in other reservations around the United States. While they may live and work there, they typically have no right to participate in tribal government. They can't vote in tribal elections or serve in elected roles in tribal government --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speech": "Yes."

      "speech": "Would it be different?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLE",
      "speech": "Yes, it does make it different because in building on tribal land they create a relationship with the tribe. They are on the land that the tribe controls, and it's a different situation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLE",
      "speech": "Right. But the point that I wanted to make, Your Honor, is that because of this relationship with people who can't vote, it's a sensitive issue. And this Court has developed some general rules that deal with the relationship between the nonmembers and the tribe, and those rules brought a distinction between fee land and tribal lands as a way of setting to each group what its rights would be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "You said that if the building were on tribal land, that there would be a relationship with the tribe by virtue of that. What would that relationship consist of? What would its practical consequences be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLE",
      "speech": "There are really two relationships. As a practical matter, you would ordinarily have some kind of a lease or contractual document between the tribe and the landowner, and the very fact of being on tribal land means that the tribe would have power over the nonmember in that situation. This Court's decision in Montana, as I was saying, supplied a general clear understandable rule for nonmembers on the reservation. In Montana, this Court reasoned that members of the tribe had inherent power to govern themselves but could govern nonmembers only in exceptional circumstances. Those exceptions were grounded in the rationale of the main rule. If nonmembers enter tribal lands, as I've mentioned, they subjected themselves to the tribe's power to govern its own lands. If they entered into a consensual relationship with the tribe or its members, they subjected those relationships to the tribe's power of self-government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, would the Buster case out of the -- I think the Eighth Circuit -- figures rather largely in the briefs here. That was a tax on people who wanted to do permit fee -- for people who wanted to do business within the reservation. There was no distinction in fee land and non-fee land there, was it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLE",
      "speech": "Your Honor, the origins of that case, I think, have been a little obscure with time, but here is the background there. That case dealt with what were then called the five civilized tribes. There were a number of Attorney General opinions and judicial opinions that said that those tribes had the power to exclude non-Indian intruders from their lands and therefore had the power to impose a licensing fee upon them if they decided to do business within those lands. At the turn of the century, the last century I'm talking about that ended in the late 1800s -- as Congress began to open up those lands, it gave the settlers the right to remain on their lands and essentially not be excluded. But at the same time there was a specific statutory and presidential and treaty framework that dealt with the problem of the licensing fees. There was an Act called the Curtis Act which said that any ordnance, including this ordnance that was adopted by the tribe, would have to be approved by the President, wasn't valid until it was. And then there was a treaty that followed when they opened up the land and said there wouldn't be removal that eliminated certain licensing fees and did not eliminate others. In Morris v. Hitchcock, this Court looked at that situation, and what it said is that we can see from the surrounding laws and treaties an intent to preserve that original power to charge the license fee for these tribes. And it said that quite clearly in Morris v. Hitchcock, and that theme is then picked up in Buster, which is, yes, originally there was some inherent power here coming from the ownership dominion over the land to charge a license fee as a condition. And we can see that in this case, Congress by what it did, the President by what he did, and the treaties by what they did, intended to carry that forward and, therefore, the license fee is still valid even as to settlers who can't be removed. So that's, I think, the best explanation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLE",
      "speech": "Eighth Circuit case, Your Honor. I spoke in general terms of the Montana rule. Respondents seem to suggest that a different rule might apply to taxation. There is no basis for that distinction. The central question is still the same -- whether the tribe is governing itself or not -- and the exceptions have to be the same. Thus in Strate, this Court said that the Montana rule would apply broadly to forms of civil jurisdiction. And in Montana itself, this Court referred to taxation as one form of regulation that might be permissible where a consensual relationship was sought -- shown. A consistent rule for all forms of tribal jurisdiction, including taxation, is important from the perspective of the nonmembers who invest in homes and businesses on fee land within the reservation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLE",
      "speech": "The majority's holding was simply that in signing that lease, the tribe did not give up its power over -- dominion over its own trust land. It said at one point in the opinion that there was no tribal authority until the nonmember entered tribal lands or engaged in business with the tribe. So even that case, on its own terms, essentially excluded a situation where someone was not on tribal trust lands."

It strikes me that it's certainly possible that a taxation exception might arise under the second Montana category, and that brings me back to something that has already come up, but I just want to get clear on your position on it. Under the second exception in effect for the integrity of tribal government, I think there's probably a pretty fair argument that if the tribe is, in fact, providing services, then the tribe ought to be able to tax to pay for, in effect, a proportionate share of the costs that those services cost the tribe. I realize that there's a factual dispute in this case -- I realize from the briefs -- about the extent of the services that the tribe is providing. My question is, do you take the position that your client gets no services whatsoever, or no benefit of municipal services whatsoever from the tribe?"

      "speech": "Exactly. But that shouldn't be a basis for taxation. In the first place, we can draw a distinction between those situations in which the nonmember on fee land requests the service from the tribe -- for example, ambulance services. And the record reflects here that when ambulance service for a nonmember is requested, the tribe charges for that. And that would be a consensual relationship and a voluntary request, and that could be charged for."

There was only one fire, it was on an employee housing unit, and ultimately fire engines came - - both from the state and from a tribal source. I think that the answer is that when you have people living side by side, you have a community of tribal members and you have nonmembers as well, the nonmembers are paying state taxes, sales taxes -- they're paying property taxes, they're paying income taxes -- for the benefits of a civilized society."
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But the same thing is true, it seems to me, in many state relationships in which there is a state police force, there's a county police force, there's a local police force, and a given property tax owner is paying taxes through various taxing mechanisms for all three. So the fact that there may be another source -- and maybe even a principal source -- of police, fire, or whatnot protection available I don't think necessarily leads to the conclusion that you shouldn't have to pay, as it were, the portion of some -- for the same services by an overlapping jurisdiction."

And that also will reach the hotel at the same time. And I think that if we permit taxation of the hotel based on incidental services, we open the box to any kind of tax on all nonmembers, because all of them, or anyone who's on the reservation, benefits in the same indirect way from law enforcement, and --"

And they don't have state property taxes to pay because a lot of this is tribal lands, and in transactions among themselves, then, they don't have state taxes. They also don't have, according to this record, very much in the way of individual taxes imposed on individual tribal members. The Navajo tax director referred to that and said that they are not paying much in the way of taxes."

Coming back to that, the central problem that, Justice Souter, that you raised -- you have people living here, members and nonmembers. Each one benefits to some degree, in some incidental way, from the services provided by the state or the tribe. But the problem is that the nonmembers are not participating at all in tribal government, and the tribal members are not being taxed at all by the state. So in this circumstance, the rule of Montana makes good sense that unless there's a consensual relationship, a voluntary transaction as we've discussed, or an entry onto tribal lands, that they wouldn't be taxed. That we're not going to permit the tribe, essentially, to exercise what this Court called its right of self-government under the second exception as a means -- and do that by taxing other people who are not able to participate in tribal government."

But if it were an acceptance -- if it were an acceptance of a service, a voluntary transaction, it would be limited to that one transaction.

There you would say that the tribe needs the money a lot more from the fee land. I don't -- you know, I just don't see which way it cuts.

That doesn't account for the number of customers. The Indian customers here are primarily at the grocery store, the convenience store. They're not the overnight guests. However there is also record evidence that there have been Indians who have been overnight guests -- there was some conference down there where Indians did stay at the hotel. In the Ashcroft case that my co-counsel mentioned, petitioner litigated this issue to the Ninth Circuit, and this Court denied review. And in that case they challenged the applicability of the particular reservation business regulations that apply to three reservations that are applicable here -- the Navajo, the Zuni, and the Hopi. Those are detailed regulations that apply to all reservation businesses. A reservation business is defined as anyone who is engaging in business on these reservations with Indians, but those regulations --"

But the point is this, when Congress enacted the statute to control trade with the Indians and gave the Commissioner expressed authority to promulgate regulations thereunder. In the 1970s these tribes complained that those -- that there were not sufficiently adequate regulations promulgated thereunder, and that led to the promulgation of 25 C.F.R. Section 141. Those regulations, which are not challenged here, are key we believe to this case because they do govern the business relations of all reservation businesses."

What I want to know is, has the Secretary gone so far as to purport, as to claim, that this overall scheme does in fact include the provision of these non-Indian hotel services.

In every one of the cases that this Court's decided, Montana, Bourland, dealing with nonmembers, Brendale, this -- and Strate. This Court has repeated that if Congress is going to -- if there's going to be an expansion of the inherent powers of the tribes, it must be done by an expressed congressional delegation. And if we apply that standard to this whole problem with the Indian trader statute, it becomes relatively easy. To the extent that the traders are trading directly with Indians, then perhaps there would be some form of consensual relationship where the tribe would have some degree of power, and these statutes and regulations may deal with it. But if the United States --"

      "speech": "Well, Williams against Lee has held that it did, and it --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLE",
      "speech": "Well, right, but the United States is arguing that these statutes in this regulatory scheme gives the tribes additional powers over nonmembers on fee lands. And in order to have that, there has to be an expressed congressional delegation. We don't have that here -- mostly we've had a discussion of regulations, and I won't go into the clarity of those regulations but, at best, they are regulations -- they are not statutes. And the statutes themselves don't purport to give the tribes additional powers. They may give the Secretary some powers, but they are not an express delegation of additional powers for the tribe. So on that basis alone, there is no basis for saying that the tribe has some sort of privilege here it can grant or deny, a power given to it by the Federal Government that it can use to extract this tax on transactions between non- Indians on fee land. The other point I wanted to make was that when we look at the second exception and whether there should be some form of power that comes from the incidental impacts of these tourists on the reservation, if we look back at Strate, there this Court considered what was the standard, and it was in effect on tribal self-government. This Court looked at the possibility that accidents on the reservation might create some health risks and certainly would call on some tribal services, but that wasn't enough to find that there would be tribal jurisdiction in those circumstances. Here we have these guests that travel on the highway and end up in the hotel and, in effect, there is less of a showing of an effect on the tribe, and there is no showing of an effect on tribal self-government. This is a difficult area when we look at the possibility of a tax being imposed by one government in which a group of citizens can't participate, and we have a well-established set of rules that deals with that in Montana and the cases that have followed it. This case should be decided under that framework. Thank you."
