      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text, purpose, and history of the Confrontation Clause make it clear that the prosecution cannot introduce one person's testimonial statements through the in-court testimony of someone else. Thus, having held in Melendez-Diaz that a lab analyst's statements in a forensic lab report are testimonial, this is an easy case. The State violated the Confrontation Clause by introducing lab analyst Curtis Caylor's statements in a forensic lab report without putting him on the stand. The New Mexico Supreme Court resisted this analysis, straightforward as it is, on the ground that Mr. Bullcoming, as the defendant, had the opportunity to cross-examine a substitute or a surrogate witness, Mr. Razatos. But a surrogate witness procedure violates all four components of the right to confrontation. It quite obviously violates the defendant's right to have the witness testify in his presence, in the presence of the jury so the jury can observe it, and under oath, as happened in this case."

She says to Smith, \"it's blue.\" Smith turns a lever on a machine to B. Jason sees the B and goes into court -- you make him go into court; that's our case. And what I wonder is, is the defendant now entitled to the following instruction: Jury, because he's in court, he can say that the machine read B, but that proves nothing about the vial, nothing. All it proves is what someone said in the laboratory to another person, and those two people aren't in court. Now, that's -- you see, that's the problem, I think, of the intermediate step.

But the one thing I want to add is that the Public Defender Service brief makes clear, and the facts of this case make clear, it's going to be very rare that a defendant wants to do that. The defendant in this case wanted to stipulate to the nurse's blood draw and that it was his blood that was drawn in the hospital. It was the State that insisted on putting her on the stand.

The analyst is beginning to testify, the second answer on page 50: So what we do is we will get the sample in the mail, et cetera. The analyst is beginning to testify about standard lab procedures, and then defense attorney says, \"Your Honor, I'm going to object to what's done in the status quo.\" I take that to mean what is generally done. \"I don't object to what was done in this case.\" So the defense attorney is preventing -- is objecting to the prosecution's attempting to discharge its responsibility with respect to those first three propositions through testimony about standard procedures, and is insisting that the analyst provide the testimony that you say was a violation of the Confrontation Clause; namely, testifying as to what was done in this particular case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "speech": "Justice Alito, I think if you look earlier in the Joint Appendix, I believe it's at page 40, where the State for the first time says we're going to put Mr. Razatos on the stand instead of Mr. Caylor, there's a -- there's an objection there as well that says you can't then put the document into evidence that Mr. Caylor wrote if he's not going to be on the stand. That's the critical objection here. Now, you're right, there's nothing wrong with Mr. Razatos having taken the stand in this case, there's nothing wrong with him having described typical procedures in the lab. I think the objection you're pointing was to the one that said -- again, as far as the State law objection, saying he can't testify to something he doesn't have personal knowledge about, which is whether the procedures were followed in this case. But Mr. -- Mr. Razatos could certainly take the stand and testify to -- to general procedures. But at page 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix, he -- he simply reads the report's results. And so you have two Confrontation Clause violations, really. You have the report being introduced in the first instance, and then you have -- I believe it's at 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix. You have the prosecutor asking Mr. Razatos, what was the result? He says the result was .21. As the State itself says at page 58, note 15 of its brief, there was no independent analysis being applied there. All Mr. Razatos was doing was repeating and giving the jury the conclusions that Mr. Caylor had reached."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "speech": "Well -- well, the question that would arise there would be whether the .21 should be treated as Mr. Caylor's statement. Let me -- if I give you two hypotheticals, maybe it explains. On the one hand, I don't think anyone would claim that a time stamp on a fax machine, for example, is a human statement. It's a machine statement, and so therefore it can't be testimonial. On the other hand, if someone types out an affidavit on a word processor and hits print, you can't say, well, that's the machine talking, not the human. So the question arises in the lab context whether a .21 or anything else that comes out of the machine has enough human influence that it ought to be treated as the -- as the person's statement. Now, you don't have to resolve that in this case, and what's important to emphasize is that that hypothetical of the .21, even though the State would like it to be this case, is really miles away for the reason you said, because the State proved a lot more than .21 by Mr. Caylor's lab report, and that's why these hypotheticals I think are important."

But remember, he was not convicted simply of DUI; he was convicted in New Mexico law of aggravated DUI. And to have aggravated DUI you need to have up to a .16 blood alcohol count. So the report is the only the State could have proved over .16, even if Mr. Bullcoming admitted that he had been drinking that day. So that's why it's important in this case. That's why he wanted to challenge -- that's one reason why he wanted to challenge the report. Let me come back to the -- to the important point, I think, though, that what the State wants to be able to do -- I don't want to ascribe a bad motive, but what the State's rule would allow States to do is to insulate people from cross-examination, not just Mr. Caylor in this case, but -- but -- but please pay attention to, for example, the Dungo case that's cited in our opening brief, from California. That's a case where a coroner had been fired from his job, blacklisted by law enforcement, and prohibited from testifying in many counties because he falsified his reports, his autopsy reports, by writing them with the police report sitting right next to him."

And when you deal especially with a garden variety DUI case there is only so much time and resources at issue, and that's why the Confrontation Clause I think is especially important in a case like this, that the prosecution bring its witnesses into court.

Fensterer, and United States v. Owens, that all hold that if a witness takes the stand and doesn't remember anything, that the Confrontation Clause is still -- is still satisfied, as long as that witness is on the stand for the reason Justice Scalia explained and because the jury can observe them, et cetera.

But it is an arm's length request, and once again, the Court addressed that in your most recent case, in Michigan v. Bryant, I believe because the -- the question is whether or not there was an interrogation. One of the key questions is whether there was an interrogation. This clearly does not look like a case where there was an interrogation by the police. It was a request on a standard form that was -- that was sent.

And there, back to the difference between the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this case is, in our report, even if Mr. Caylor had been at the trial and on the stand, it would have been necessary to have the report as well. I think Justice Ginsburg raised this point, is that six months after the examination was done, to cross-examine the analyst and ask him, do you remember what the result was six months ago from this one test out of a hundred that he ran, he will not remember without looking at the report.

With regard to the State's argument about whether this document is testimonial, I would simply urge the Court to take a very close look at the lab report itself. It's at JA 62. At the top it says, Mr. Chief Justice, in response to your question, arresting officer identification, and the officer writes, check for blood alcohol concentration. That's the order to the lab. If you look at the bottom in the certification of analyst, he certifies that the following is true and correct, signs his name, and perhaps the most critical thing is at the very bottom, the actual rules of the New Mexico evidence law and criminal procedure law are referenced.
