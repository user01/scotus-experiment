      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1988, Congress enacted the spousal impoverishment protections of the Federal Medicaid Act, 42 U.S. Code section 1396r-5, to accomplish two competing purposes. First, Congress sought to protect spouses living at home from impoverishment when the other spouse is institutionalized and requires long-term nursing home care. Secondly, Congress sought to ensure that married couples seeking medicaid bear a fair share of the cost of such care. This case concerns whether States have the discretion to achieve those competing goals by taking into account at the time medicaid eligibility is determined available income which the nursing home spouse is permitted to use after eligibility to support the at-home spouse. When the nursing home spouse applies for medicaid, section 1396r-5 permits the community spouse to retain certain income and resources to meet his own monthly maintenance needs. The statute permits an increase in the standard resource allowance, however, if the at-home spouse can show at a fair hearing that the allowance will be inadequate to provide him with income at the State-protected level once the nursing home spouse qualifies for medicaid. When making this determination, Wisconsin, like more than 30 other States, first considers whether income available to the at-home spouse from the nursing home spouse will be sufficient to ensure the protected level of income once medicaid eligibility occurs. This method of determining whether to increase or to substitute the standard resource allowance is called the income-first rule."

We said, since it can mean one or the other, we'll go along with whichever one the Federal agency says it means, but here we have a Federal agency that says, we have ambiguous language, so hey, do whatever you like.

Community spouse's income can have a meaning, but there may be different methodologies, all of which are reasonable, for determining and calculating what is the community spouse's income. In addition, this Court has -- and the States have liberties in order to decide to choose among those reasonable methodologies, because under section 17 on page 8a of our, of the appendix to our brief they are to establish reasonable methodologies consistent with the Secretary's regulations. In addition --"

Reed, in which you wrote the opinion for the Court, when the statute did not clearly preclude one methodology or another, the Secretary, because the Secretary has quasi-legislative authority to set standards in this area, may adopt standards that permit variations from State to State. In Batterton v. Francis, it was under AFDC, and the question is, what was unemployment? Did it include striking workers, or did it not, and the Secretary said, States, you may determine that based on your own State law. In Lukar v. Reed, the question was whether or not a tort judgment would be considered income or resources. The Secretary threw guidance to all the States that they had the option of choosing it as income or resources because both are reasonable. This Court in Lukar v. Reed again held that decision, so in this particular area, where States have the principal responsibility of establishing standards, the Secretary may establish the boundaries, the reasonable boundaries within which those standards may be established, but unless the, and so long as the standards established by the State are not contradicted by the statute, are not contradicted by the Secretary's regulations, and are reasonable --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMKEN",

The statute simply does not speak to the issue of whether when a spouse, a community spouse is going to have a shortfall in income you make that up first by paying additional money to the person in the nursing home so that she may support the spouse at home, which is the income-first methodology, or whether first you raise the resource allowance so that she may -- so that the person at home has additional income from resources. I think I should probably go back and answer Justice O'Connor's and Justice Scalia's question about the meaning of community spouse's income in section (b)(1), because there has been a suggestion about necessarily includes only the income paid directly to the community spouse. It is in our view a subtle legal tradition that the community spouse's income, or one spouse's income may include income from another spouse that is deemed to be income of the community spouse in contemplation of law, and so in (b)(1) community spouse's income could include income from the institutionalized spouse that the institutionalized spouse can make available. That's consistent with the presumption of spousal support, and it's consistent with, for example, existing regulations such as those in --"

That is this situation which you have called reverse deeming. Second, even at the eligibility stage, particularly in section 209(b) States, it would be permissible to deem the income of the institutionalized spouse to be income of the community spouse. Now, it might not often come up, but it would come up when, for example, both were applicants, in which case that would be permissible, so the settled background principle that existed at the time Congress acted is that spouses support each other mutually, and Congress eliminated one of those presumptions on a going forward basis in (b)(1) and said, no, the community spouse's income shall not be deemed available to institutionalized spouses, but left in place the background principle that an institutionalized spouse, if they have the funds, can support the spouse --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGOPIAN",
      "speech": "Yes, Justice O'Connor. Under the resource-first rule the applicant, the community spouse of the applicant, of the institutionalized spouse, is the person who gets the money, and they get the money in the form of an expanded community spouse resource allowance that then generates income that brings the monthly -- the community spouse's actual income up to or as close to the monthly need amount that's set by the State. Under income first, the income is fictionally imputed from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse, but it doesn't actually go to the community spouse. That would not ever happen until after eligibility had actually been determined. So in the aggregate, the resource-first rule allows community spouses who would not adequately be protected by the formula community spouse resource allowance, because that does not generate income up to the monthly need amount and because they have no other income, or not enough income to bring them up to that level, it allows them to actually have resources that will generate that income and protect them even after the institutionalized spouse passes away."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Doesn't it also make possible the payments, the actual payments start earlier? I mean, the reason this was of such concern is that the institutionalized spouse would not be eligible monthly for checks, so that the immediate effect was she could pay down more rapidly what was her excess resources before she qualified. Isn't that the primary effect? It's that the payments under medicaid start earlier?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGOPIAN",

      "speaker": "HAGOPIAN",
      "speech": "Oh, now I understand your question. No, that's not true. Under income first, the institutionalized spouse does not become eligible. Only under resource first does the institutionalized spouse become eligible, and then that allows the payments post eligibility to actually occur to the community spouse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Maybe I am not making myself clear. I thought the principle of that is to the couple, of using your resource rather than the income first -- resource first, is that the institutionalized spouse, it pays down quicker, and is therefore eligible for medicaid money sooner. That's what your position achieves, is that not so?"

      "speaker": "HAGOPIAN",
      "speech": "Well, I would agree with you, Justice Kennedy, that the typical case is statistically that is the husband that goes into the nursing home first, and we don't have that case here today, but I believe I disagree with you as to the effect that this has.

      "speaker": "HAGOPIAN",
      "speech": "That's correct, so in many cases the income first rule will have a worse effect when the husband is the one that goes in first. Because his income will be higher, there will be more income that will be attributed to the community spouse in this pre-eligibility determination, and that will prevent her from having income of her own that would raise her to the minimum monthly needs allowance. If resource-first was used in that case, she would be able to retain assets that would generate actual income to her that would meet the monthly need allowance."

      "speaker": "HAGOPIAN",

But the spousal impoverishment provisions, one of the main things that they did was supersede the authority that the State and the United States have relied upon to issue the rule and to engage in this so-called reverse deeming, so -- and at the same time that they superseded that rule, they also enacted 1396a(r). Now, this rule -- what this rule did, and this rule was actually -- I want to back up. Another provision of the spousal impoverishment enactment was 1396r-5(1)(C), and this provision retained the SSI methodologies, or any existing methodologies that were not specifically overridden by the spousal impoverishment enactments. Now, the one thing that was left untouched by these spousal impoverishment provisions was the way that income was determined for eligibility purposes. Now, that brings us to 1396a(r), and that provision is the provision of the Medicaid Act mandates that the SSI methodologies apply to income and resource determinations for all the eligibility groups that were relevant in these cases, and that statute does allow States and HCFA, or CMS or the Secretary to issue rules that deviate from those SSI methodologies, but those rules, if they're going to do a rule that deviates from that methodology, the rule has to have the effect of making more people eligible for medicaid, not fewer people, and this rule, the income- first rule, fails that test. What it does is -- because under the SSI program, if the SSI methodologies were strictly applied, the income of the two spouses is separated and is never commingled, and so because under SSI this would not happen, a rule which allows it to happen in medicaid is considered to be no more restrictive and not -- I'm sorry, more restrictive than the SSI methodologies, and is not permitted by that statute."

      "speech": "But would you explain to me how you interpret the parenthetical phrase that's quoted on page 18 of the Government's brief, and the -- it says taking into account any other income attributable to the community spouse. I find that kind of a puzzling parenthetical. How do you read that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGOPIAN",
      "speech": "Well, I've two responses to that, Justice Stevens. First, within the spousal impoverishment enactment, the term, attribute, or attributable is used in two different fashions. When it's used in -- to describe resources, it has the effect of commingling the resources and pooling them. When it's used in conjunction with the term, income, it has the effect of separating the income between the two spouses. So it's my initial position that income attributable to the other -- other income attributable to the community spouse merely confirms the way it was done SSI statutes, and that is consistent with the way it is done, where income is talked about at all, in the spousal impoverishment provisions, and I think there is actually a reason for that to be in there, and that is that it would be possible in some cases for a community spouse to attempt to get an expanded resource allowance by coming into the hearing and saying, I have income, and it's in my name right now. Typical would be, maybe it's from employment, and at this date when I'm trying to establish eligibility, or my institutionalized spouse is trying to establish eligibility, I have that income, but I don't believe you should count that income to me because it's going to end next month when my job ends. So I think that is what they were talking about, trying to foreclose that type of argument at a hearing, and so I believe that the real effect of that parenthetical phrase is to confirm the separate treatment of the income. The reason it isn't in the statute and it's in the legislative history is because the SSI mandate under 1396(a)(R) accomplished that purpose precisely. Every other part of that legislative history essentially becomes 1396r-5(e)(2)(C). That phrase is missing."

You said, and I think have to say, that if the States lose on the particular issue before us here, the States as a practical matter can get to the same kind of rough dollar and sense results simply by adjusting the amount of resources, that is the baseline amount for the community spouse to retain and the amount of income which is thought to be necessary for the community spouse to live decently, so it almost seems as though it doesn't very much matter, necessarily, to the enactment of whatever policy Congress had, whether the flexibility comes in income versus resource first, or whether it comes in setting the allowances for income and assets.

A few couples would not be adequately protected by those formula allowances, and so -- because the policy of the statute was to defeat spousal impoverishment.

      "speaker": "HAGOPIAN",
      "speech": "Not necessarily. In the immediate -- the effect of denying an application based on income first would at that moment prevent someone from being eligible for medicaid, but -- and so therefore would save Federal dollars, no question about that, but you have to remember that the resources that the couple is required to spend in order to become eligible, there's no requirement that those resources be spent on the nursing home, and so it's possible that those resources could be spent for some other purpose, and then the person could immediately become eligible for medicaid, you know, within a short time after the initial application was denied. And the important thing about that point is that, if that happens, if those resources are gone, and the income that's generated from them is gone, then when you get to the post eligibility determination, the less of the institutionalized spouse's income is going to be able to be used to defray the cost to the medicaid program, because more of it is going to have to be used to increase the allowance to the institu -- or, the community spouse, so in the short run it may be -- save the Federal Government. In the long run, it does not."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGOPIAN",
      "speech": "Well, I beg to differ with Mr. Lamken's presentation of the background rule. I don't believe that there is any precedent for the reverse deeming that he's talking about in any of the background rules. The deeming that was permitted was strictly from the nonapplicant spouse to the applicant spouse, and it was for the purpose of denying that person eligibility. The one rule he talked about where there was some reverse deeming was, was also -- was a post eligibility rule. Under the old rules pre-MCCA, the nursing home spouse could allocate a small amount of money to the community spouse, usually just enough to bring that community spouse above the local welfare threshold so that they wouldn't have to support that person on welfare, but that was a post eligibility deeming, it was not an eligibility, and in the SSI program, which is what -- we believe where the methodologies occur that dictate how income is to be determined, there is no deeming from the applicant spouse back to the nonapplicant spouse."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I might ask one question. Examples help a lot for me in these cases. I couldn't understand them without them, and the amicus briefs were filled with them, which was helpful, but the example I'm carrying around in my head is that we have, say, a woman in an institution who has about $200,000 or $300,000 in assets, and maybe a small pension of $8,000 or $10,000, and her husband's at home, and he has a pension coming in, maybe of $10,000 to $12,000, and so he's lacking about $6,000 or $7,000 or $8,000 or $9,000 or $10,000 to bring himself up to the $24,000 level. Now, if you're right, what we'll do is, we'll take the $300,000 the wife has, and we give it to the husband. It generates about, I don't know, $10,000, $12,000, and eventually that $300,000 goes to the children, and if you're right, she doesn't have to spend it down, and if you're wrong, by the way, if that money goes to the husband, later on, when her pension comes in, and there's about 8 or $10,000 coming in, that money goes right to the institution to pay for the health care. She doesn't get to keep it. So that's one way. Now, the other way is that she keeps -- she spends down the $300,000. She has to spend down the $300,000, maybe that money goes to the institution, maybe it goes to fix the roof, but then when the income comes in, it goes right to the husband. So I don't know, you know, I mean, it's sort of what -- the Government seems to think that it's better off financially by making her spend the money down, but I guess that depends on whether the alternative is to pay the $300,000 to the doctors or pay it to get the roof fixed, so when I end up thinking that, I haven't a clue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And so therefore I'd say, well, if I were writing this statute, I guess I'd leave it up to the Secretary, and if the Secretary wants to leave it up to the States, that's his business, so I look at the language, and the language there seems not to solve the problem, and -- okay, what's the response?"

I wanted to expose that to you, because I want you to have a chance to say no, you're wrong, your example is wrong, your reasoning's wrong, everything's wrong, so go ahead."

      "speaker": "HAGOPIAN",
      "speech": "I think your first example was the wrong one, the one that oddly enough is bad for me, and that's because I think you're assuming that the resources that are going to be protected for the care of the spouse will be transferred on death to the children. That's possible, but if the community spouse outlives the nursing home spouse, that resource pool, because for whatever reason there isn't an independent stream of income available to that community spouse, it's going to be that resource fund that creates the income stream for that community spouse. If it's protected, and not have to be spent down to medicaid eligibility, that community spouse is much more likely to retain it, not spend it on things that he doesn't need in order to preserve that income stream so that he can take care of himself, hopefully, not in a nursing home but perhaps in some sort of noninstitutional setting that he would prefer over that. So that's my response to your question."

I don't know why the Government doesn't, as a matter of policy, make a pretty strong case, but the -- I guess the response will be, well, you know, everybody knows this. Everybody, no matter how well-educated or badly educated, or -- they all know, when they get that pension choice, that if you either take it all for yourself, or you say, when I die I want my spouse to get some, and so -- they've all made that conscious choice, and if they make it to protect the spouse, that's up to them, and they probably will. I mean, that will be the response, I think, to that argument."

      "speaker": "HAGOPIAN",
      "speech": "It would be. The problem, when you -- my understanding -- I'm not a pension expert by any means, but when you exercise an option that protects the surviving spouse, you so deflate the value of the pension that it's economically a poor decision to make."

I mean, nobody is ready for nursing home stays, and to plan for that, you know, based at the time that you make your pension election would be counter to, I think, human nature."

I mean, if you believe the Government's interpretation of that legislative history, it certainly doesn't say the Secretary has the option. It either says what you think it means, or it requires the Secretary to use the income- first method, no?"

The impact of the resource-first rule is to devote limited medical assistance funds to couples who have resources substantially above the Federal maximum set levels and that, in turn, necessarily means, since we have limited pots of income, that that deprives States of money needed to serve --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Why is that? I mean, he just said on that that -- and it certainly was in the briefs, that if you say they have to spend down the $300,000, they're not going to give it to the doctors in the institution. They'll fix the roof, they'll pay off the mortgage, they'll figure out one of 50 other things, so the State will actually end up with less money, because they won't get that $300,000 as a set-off and, moreover, they lose the income coming in later as a set-off."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLANAGAN",
      "speech": "Well, neither of us have any statistics on that. I'm sure that people do pay off their long-term financial obligations, but they also have to pay for the nursing home, and that bill doesn't go away every month, so if they're not eligible, they're going to have to be providing for that in some way, so while the statute doesn't force them to devote their resources to that, there are powerful practical reasons why people are going to do that. Another part of the impact that I'm concerned about is touched on by Mr. Hagopian, who says that States can just lower their resource standards and lower their income maintenance standards. Well, what that says is, States, you should serve fewer people. You should serve fewer elderly so that you can have the money to serve people who happen to have resources in excess, and in many cases substantially in excess of the standard resource limits. The Cleary case, which is cited in the briefs, is a good example of that kind of potential situation. That was a situation in which the nursing home spouse had something in the neighborhood of a $1/4 million of excess resources, but because of the income of the -- set-up of the spouses it would have taken that -- those resources to make up that income, even though that particular spouse, as I recall, also would have had money."
