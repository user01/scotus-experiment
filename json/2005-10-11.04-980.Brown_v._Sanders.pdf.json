      "speech": "Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Whether a capital sentencing statute is categorized as \"weighing\" or \"non-weighing\" determines how courts assess the impact of an invalid death eligibility factor on a jury's sentence selection. To decide whether a statute is \"weighing\" or \"non-weighing,\" we look to the function, if any, of an eligibility factor in the statute's sentence-selection process. In a \"weighing\" scheme, as this Court first stated in Zant, a jury is specifically instructed to weigh the statutory eligibility factors, along with any mitigation, to choose the sentence. In a \"non-weighing\" scheme, the eligibility factors have no role above the role of \"all other sentencing evidence.\" California is a \"non-weighing\" State, for two primary reasons. First, the only reference whatsoever to \"eligibility factors\" in California's statutory list of 11 open-ended sentencing factors is in its sentencing factor (a), but that reference has no significance, because, under the language of the statute and the holdings of the California Supreme Court, factor (a) means the jury is to consider, if it's relevant, the facts and circumstances of the offenses, including the facts and circumstances that underlie the eligibility factors."

I'm imagining that. And you might have thought, if factor one turns out to be invalid, the reason that that's a big mistake, because the jury would have weighed something against all that mitigating evidence that it shouldn't have. And what's something? There would be a lot of evidence on it, so it took it -- evidence into account it shouldn't have. So, I might have thought that was so. But when I read the cases, that isn't so, because I think it's -- in Clemons the evidence would have come in anyway. So, if that isn't so, what could be wrong with this problem in the \"weighing\" State? And the answer, I guess, has to be that the prosecutor or the State said, \"Jury, you look to these three things,\" with a tone of voice that really made them important. And the jury then weighed one and two and three. It didn't have anything to do with the evidence. Well, if that's the problem, California seems to have that problem, because one of the things it says to weigh is, \"Weigh circumstances of the crime.\" And that means that's not everything. That's not the history of this defendant. And so, the problem that existed in Clemons and in Stringer and in Zant that led to constitutional error seems to be there in California's case, too. Now, I probably have made five mistakes in my little recitation here, and I'd ask you to point them out."

But the California Supreme Court made clear, in its Frierson decision, that, as far as California is concerned, the process -- the mental process that the jury goes through under either statute is the same, that \"weigh,\" \"consider,\" \"balance,\" so on, none has a talismanic thing.

In Mr. Sanders' case, the jury was instructed in the language of section 190.3, and this language gave the jury a very explicit roadmap as to how it was to undertake its sentence selection in this case. Section 190.3 assigns a specific role to the aggravating factors. It tells a jury that, \"In determining the penalty, you shall consider, take into account, and be guided by the listed enumerated factors.\" The special circumstances, as the questions from the Court have noted, are specifically included. Factor (a) has two independent components, and one is the existence of any \"special circumstance\" finding. As Justice Stevens noted, this could only be considered aggravating. It is, after all, the reason that California has said that this case moved from being an ordinary murder to being one that was worthy of either death or life without parole."

That's paradoxical."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIVKIND",
      "speech": "Well, no, I think it's not, and I think it's very consistent with what we see in Mississippi. In California, factor (a) contains two independent components. One is the \"circumstances of the crime,\" and one is the \"special circumstances.\" The California Supreme Court, both before it affirmed Mr. Sanders' death sentence and after -- before, in a case, People versus Hamilton, and after, in People versus Benson -- in the context of assessing invalid special circumstances, said that it presumes the jury follows its instructions, and considers the special circumstances independently of their underlying facts."

      "speaker": "RIVKIND",
      "speech": "I don't think that distinction holds up. And I think that we see that both in Clemons and in Stringer. And this takes us to a misunderstanding of the Mississippi statute. In Mississippi, the statute has not changed since the time of Clemons, except for one provision, and that is the addition of another category of capital murder. In Mississippi, death eligibility is decided by the definition of \"capital murder\" in section 97-3-19. And the State lists, I think, now nine -- I think it was eight at the time of Clemons -- categories of capital murder. The defendant then goes to a penalty phase, and the statute sets forth aggravating circumstances in Mississippi's statute, section 99-19-101. There is a correlation between many -- at the time of Clemons, all of the categories of capital murder and the aggravating circumstances, much as there is in Louisiana. However, there are two additional aggravating factors at the sentence-selection phase, and those are the \"heinous, atrocious, and cruel\" aggravator, which, in Mississippi, is only a selection factor, and whether the defendant had a prior conviction. And so, in this sense, we -- the Mississippi statute is very comparable to California. And it goes further, because, in Mississippi -- in Clemons' case, if you look at the joint appendix, at 24, and also in Stringer's case, at joint appendix 10 -- the juries were instructed, pursuant to the Mississippi standard capital- sentencing instructions -- the very first opening paragraph tells the juries that, \"In determining penalty, you must objectively consider the detailed circumstances of the crime.\" And I think this instruction helps explain the court's footnote 5 in Clemons, which I think is very important in terms of understanding why this whole focus on circumstances of the crime is not relevant to the distinction between \"weighing\" and \"non-weighing.\""

I can understand you're saying that there is harm done when a statute says, \"The jury shall weigh the aggravating circumstances,\" which are -- have been specified and which are narrowing circumstances; there are only five named in the statute -- \"shall weigh the aggravating circumstances found to be true against the mitigating,\" and it turns out that one of those five aggravating circumstances is unconstitutional. Okay? Then you have the jury weighing something that it shouldn't have weighed, because that aggravating circumstance was bad. I don't see why any harm is done where you have a statute that lists aggravating factors, one of which is \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\" and that is later found invalid by the State supreme court. But then, in the weighing process, the jury is told, \"Don't just weigh aggravating factors, weigh all of the circumstances of the crime.\" Now, it seems to me that the same jury that erroneously found, as one of the aggravating factors, \"heinous, atrocious, and cruel,\" would also have found that \"heinousness, atrociousness, and cruelty\" to be one of the circumstances to be weighed.

Even in a \"non-weighing\" State, as Zant made clear, if and in where a harmless-error review need not be done, because the court has concluded there will be -- the aggravating circumstances have an inconsequential impact, because the jury is not required to consider them in the selection decision -- even there, if an invalid aggravating circumstance permits the introduction of evidence that would otherwise have been inadmissible, we have error.

Isn't that your point here?"

The harm to Mr. Sanders was that the jury was told that it had a process that was mandated for reaching its decision, and that process required the jury to put two special circumstances on death's side of the scale, that should not have been there, and then required the jury to reach the penalty decision by balancing."

Now, that what's confusing me throughout. As I understood this area, to go back to what Justice Scalia was saying -- no, wait, just -- I'll back up to try to get you to correct my misunderstanding -- Zant is the key, because Zant says, \"Judge, if you have a 'non-weighing' State\" -- that is, everything's relevant but the kitchen sink -- \"the fact that the prosecutor made a mistake at the eligibility stage by including something he shouldn't is beside the point.\" Is that right?"

Now, if I'm right so far, and if we want to straighten all this out, why not go back and say all three cases are wrong?

And I can imagine, in a \"weighing\" State that, because the evidence is the same, and because there were so many factors just like it, the fact that they used the wrong factor didn't really make any difference.

      "speaker": "KIRKLAND",

The first is that, as to the claim -- Ms. Rivkind's claim, that she's reiterated here, that the California Supreme Court has determined that the \"special circumstances\" label has some independent weight that it's important for the jury to consider at sentencing -- she's only cited half of the sentence in Benson and Hamilton. The other half rebuts her claim. The sentence is, \"Although we presume that the jurors followed their instructions and considered the invalid special circumstances finding, independent of thier underlying facts\" -- that's what she relies on -- they say, then, as they've said in a number of cases, \"we cannot conclude that they could reasonably have given them any independent significant weight.\" So, it's just the point we're making. It's just a label that does not carry with it any independent significant weight, because the evidence, the argument, the circumstances are all before the jury in the same way. The second point is that, while there may be some doubt as to whether Mr. Sanders was the actual killer in this case, there's no question as to his complete culpability in the crime. He was the leader. He led Cebreros there. He was the one who incited the crime in order to cover up for a prior botched robbery."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRKLAND",
      "speech": "I don't think that's an appropriate consideration here, where it wasn't raised, ever. The third point is that we wouldn't be here, except for the overlap in factor -- sentencing factor (a). That subclause, which the California Supreme Court has repeatedly held, means only that the jury is to consider all the facts and circumstances of the crime, including the facts and circumstances underlying the special circumstance, or eligibility factor. If that subclause wasn't in there, our eligibility factors in the special circumstance, and our sentencing factors, would be completely mutually exclusive and there would be no issue whatsoever."
