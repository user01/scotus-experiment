  {
    "speaker": "BULLOCK",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. In the compact, it's at the appendix of the Master's first interim report. Two areas: first, the preamble provides for an equitable division/apportionment of the water; and then the operative provision, article V(A), states that the uses existing as of January 1st, 1950, in each signatory State shall continue to be enjoyed."

    "speech": "Your Honor, the whole of article V(A) and V(B) -- I mean, no one contests that it's within the definitions at article II(H), is beneficial use. And that's a derivation or departure from the general prior appropriation law, because it's that use by which a water supply is depleted when usefully used."

And it's that depletion that -- as of 1950, so it wasn't a full consumption of water in Wyoming, and that depletion is the return flow upon which Montanans rely."

Let's assume global warming in some form or another evaporated more water, and so some crop area did some solar heating that caused a greater evaporation. Is that a breach of the compact? So two questions embedded in there. How does any State monitor that, the change in crops or change in irrigation methods? And, second, how far does it go in terms of the pre-1950s right to use their water?"

What the compact said -- says is appropriative rights to beneficial uses. And to me that suggests, which I always understood to be the way water law worked in the west, is you have a right to pull out, you know, water, and the appropriative right is you have the right to take out however much you were taking out. And the fact that less comes back, that's something different. That doesn't affect your appropriation."

They knew that. Is there any indication they knew at that time how much each individual landowner was putting back?

And I guess I'd say that my second best case is the Special Master's own footnote. It's 69/12, where he says that, you know, even though State change procedures don't typically apply to crop or -- changes in crop irrigation techniques, this does not mean there's no way to challenge increases in efficiency.

But I'm thinking in accordance with the doctrine of appropriation, what does that doctrine, that legal doctrine, say about use and return? And that's why we're -- we're -- why I was thinking it seems totally unclear. It talks about seepage, the cases, which I gather is different from return. Okay. So could they have really meant net? And what struck me is that they couldn't, which -- which you were beginning to address, point. Your point is, well, Wyoming knew how much was going into Wyoming. But that's not my point. My point is what -- what's the water law? What's the law of appropriation at that time in respect to return flows?

Each of you appear, under the terms of article V, to be entitled to get enough water to fill those uses. The next section, the one that you read earlier, lets you use things in the future for post-1950 uses, but only if the water supply's protected pre-1950 beneficial uses have received all they're entitled to. Neither of you are entitled or -- to take anything post-1950 until pre-1950 is protected. That's how I read article V.

Now, in Montana perhaps that might not include the right to recapture efficiencies, but we know, for example, that -- that a Montana water user could divert more water per acre because Montana had a more generous concept of beneficial use for irrigation per acre than Wyoming did. The compact simply carries forward all existing appropriative rights, and the drafters consciously rejected the idea that they should come up \"beneficial use.\" And I'd like to turn to that because Justice Scalia's colloquy with Mr. Michael brought that out.

    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Jay. General, you have 2 minutes left. out, this is a compact, and it's a compact between two different States, and Montana gave up things, a right of priority administration across State lines as a result of that. Justice Breyer, as an issue of fairness, we don't get all the water. We only get water supply under like conditions. We are now the downstream appropriator, so -- but one example, if half the water is flowing now that it was, as of 1950, Montana may not get anything at that point, because just by the virtue of -- some say it's \"highology,\" whoever is higher on the river gets to take first. So we -- we don't get to fulfill our rights. All we get is to ensure that, given a like supply of water, that our right shall continue to be enjoyed as it existed as of 1950."

    "speech": "How many years has there been not enough water to fill all pre-19 -- forget about whether there was post-1950 use. How many years are we talking about in which there has been not enough water in 2004 and 2006. We said: Wait a minute, we're not getting enough water here, and we believe it's the -- the pre-1950 uses that are depleting that. Will you give us water? Ultimately, why we're here is to sort this out. I guess I'd also point out that there was some discussion about an appropriative right is the right to use a quantity of water. That makes sense other than if you're in a compact, and Montana gets no water. The Solicitor General even pointed out then in his brief at a footnote -- he said, well, what we might do, then, is that Montana could bring an equitable apportionment action for the pre-1950 water. That highlights the -- I think to me, the illogic of just focusing on the rights and not looking at the uses and how much each State was consuming, because at that point I'll be right back here saying we want the same water under like conditions that we had in"
