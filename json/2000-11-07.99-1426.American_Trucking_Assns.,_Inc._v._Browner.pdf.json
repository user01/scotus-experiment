The -- I don't want to return to the delegation issue, other than to repeat and emphasize that this agency wishes to regulate every nook and cranny of this environment for air pollution reasons, and yet said to the Court of Appeals, nothing in the statute requires her to make any specific findings or to structure her decision making in any particular way. Now, with that said, I want to turn to the statute. And I want to start a little bit out of order because in my first argument, I intended, I didn't get a chance to respond to, Justice O'Connor's colloquy with General Waxman. You asked, Justice O'Connor, about Section 109(d) of the Act which requires the CASAC committee to advise the administrator on any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic and so forth effects, and Mr. Waxman said two things that I want to very much disagree with. He said that's in a different provision of the statute. Well, it's not. It's in the standard setting provision. It's in Section 109. It refers to standard setting, and entails standard setting. Secondly, the statute makes clear in the judicial review provisions, and I'm looking at pages 6-A and 7-A of my blue brief, that's the Petitioner's brief. It says that the administrator must set forth a statement summarizing --"

In other words, I'm reading about the statement that the administrator must provide, which is the next sentence, and it says it must set forth the pertinent findings, recommendations and comments and so forth, and if her proposal, and you'll notice it says Section 109(d), that's 7409(d) is all of Section 109(d), it's not excluding out the parts that General Waxman would exclude out. What it says is that she has to say where she differs with the CASAC, and where she agrees with the CASAC, and so forth. So this information that Justice O'Connor, you referred to in your question, is very much part of the standard setting process. It's very much part of what the administrator has to say when she promulgates a standard, and it's very much part of the judicial review provision. Now, if I can return to the core provisions of the statute. Requisite to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety. Now, I'm going to talk mostly about public health this morning, but that doesn't mean that there aren't other words that you should pay attention to, and other provisions in Section 108 and 109. I just would like to focus on public health because I think it's so doggone central. Now, what does it mean to protect the public health? Now, public health is not defined in the statute. We all agree on that. It has to take on its natural and ordinary meaning under this Court's decisions."

If the administrator defines public health so that it excludes all countervailing factors, what you are doing is handing over to the administrator a decision of far, far-reaching economic and political significance, and under this Court's decisions, the MCI line of cases, the Court just doesn't presume those kinds of delegations lightly, so my point would be, of course, the administrator in this provision and others has discretion, but it doesn't have discretion --"

Basically. I mean just saying basically in the ordinary case, and then, of course, you could have some unusual cases where in fact what people like to say is we are going to go back to the stone age, which was very unhealthy for people, so, that if in fact the administrator has the authority, not necessarily the requirement, to take into account the health effects of either the, you know, we've seen the skin cancer referred to a lot in the briefs, and I guess if you really destroyed the economy, that would have adverse health effects. I don't know you're -- I don't know if the other side agrees on that. But if I'm thinking that the administrator has the authority, not the requirement, in unusual cases in a technology-forcing statute to take into account the possibility that despite the technology forcing, etcetera, you could hurt the public health, because we are going back to the stone age. I mean, if that kind of reading of the statute, does that satisfy you?"

      "speech": "Well, first of all, they've not conceded the point that you're making but let me address it in terms of public health. I call the Court's attention to footnote 1 of our blue brief that I was referring to again, because public health, as I think everybody knows today, is a discipline which examines health questions in terms of protecting the public with explicit reliance on cost/benefit considerations. I mean, this is the way you achieve the most for the public, and that is by taking cost/benefit considerations into account."

I mean, they infect each other in both directions and it's so true, so is true of public health. Let me say that I didn't make up this definition of public health. Public health was defined most prominently by the head of the public health school at Yale, and his definition is the one you really see in all the dictionaries."

      "speaker": "WARREN",
      "speech": "No what I really think it was relying on was the implicit definition of public health in the Act before 1970. Let me focus in on exactly what happened again because I think it's very significant. The Senate came up with a bill that would set national standards to protect the health of persons. Now, that expression had a meaning in the previous Act. It was the trigger for abatement actions. But abatement actions, the trigger was only the beginning. You then weighed against the -- what's necessary to protect the public, to protect the health of persons. You weighed against that equitable factors, and economic factors and the like. The House, by contrast, used the term, we're going to set standards requisite to protect the public health. That term had a meaning in the statute as well. From 1955 on, Congress used the word public health. It enlisted the public health service, which engages in exactly the kind of comparisons I'm talking about to help administer the statute and public health was the goal to be achieved when you weighed the health of persons against these other factors. That's implicit also in the purpose of the statute. I see -- I use the purpose to reinforce what public health means, not in any other, in any other way, but it does very much reinforce it. It's really what Justice Breyer was saying. Is healthy people are wealthier, wealthy people are healthier. There is always going to be an interaction between these things."

We are looking at an analysis just like you see in the presidential executive order of this administration, or that which you see in the Unfunded Mandate Act. What we're talking about is a common sense weighing of competing considerations in a systematic way. That's all we're talking about. The executive order, as I'm sure you know --"

I could understand that. How to do it. What I don't really see is how you do that if the statute is technology-forcing.

I'm not saying that any answer on the costs or the benefits is precise. The agency has a lot of discretion on that, but not to try, I think is ultimately going to defeat public health. It's going to defeat the objectives of trying to achieve more good for the public, and that's what this statute's all about."

It seems to me, to put it bluntly, that you would have on your scheme as a target for attack not only the public health as it has been conceived as something discrete from cost/benefit analysis, but what kind of cost/benefit analysis this should be. Did EPA weigh the right factors. It just seems to me that you are adding something that will create another morass, many more things that can be attacked than under the lead industry's regime."

But in carrying out its responsibilities to achieve the public health, those factors are weighed on the pros and the cons, just as Ben Franklin was talking about, and we have a process which is -- which it can be subjected to executive branch review, which is going to cut out a lot of the problems, to congressional review. It facilitates what Congress had in mind. Now, let me also go forward and say that this is --"

We don't have an executive order reviewing these decisions of EPA and OSHA, and NHTSA, and so forth, because every statute has been interpreted by a Court of Appeals the way this one has. The norm is to do the kind of weighing and balancing I'm talking about. Now, that's not to say that if a regulation passes executive branch review and gets by congressional oversight, that there won't be judicial review, but the agency is going to have a lot of discretion with respect to the weight of the evidence questions, questions about which costs can be quantified, which costs can't be quantified, how to quantify them, how to quantify the benefits. All those questions are questions which would come up in the -- in any subsequent review or could come up in any subsequent review, but the Agency's discretion is going to be honored."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Warren, I must say that to the extent you win this argument that you're making now, you sort of weaken your argument on, concerning the ability of EPA to issue revised ozone standards, because frankly, what makes it eminently plausible that Congress might have itself set a fixed table that can't be changed by EPA is the scary idea that if EPA can issue revised standards, God knows what it might issue. It doesn't have to take into account anything but public health, and you know, it could go down to transient costs, and if that's what the scheme is, I can understand why Congress would say in Part II, no, look it, with ozone, it affects everything, it affects every industry. We are going to, we are going to import ourselves some cost/benefit analysis and we are going to set this table, and EPA can't change it. Now, if you tell me that when EPA changes it, EPA also has to take into account whether it's going to bring us back to the stone age, then -- then it's a little less plausible that Congress should have, should have stepped in."

      "speaker": "WARREN",

On the first part that I'm arguing, I will give it to EPA that it's constrained by lead industry and this line of cases from doing what I think is required by the statute to do, but nonetheless it hasn't fought very hard to accomplish the aims that I'm talking about. So when Congress gives it general direction, it doesn't seem to want to follow it. And then when Congress gives it very specific direction, it doesn't want to follow it either, so that's what I think -- that's the common theme here I think of an agency that wants to do what it wants to do, and not what Congress directed it to do. I think that that's, that's the common --"

That can't be. This Court's decisions at MCI, Benzene I think stands for the same proposition. There has to be some common sense brought to bear.

Never addressed that. All it's done is extended some deadlines. It's a completely different question because the question, and we're in the last mile. I want to emphasize that. This is not 1970. This is 2000. And we've been regulating these pollutants for years. We've done lots and lots of things, and this issue of whether or not it's worth the candle in terms of public health is coming sharply into focus. It's come sharp -- much more sharply into focus as a result of things like the executive orders that have, have been in place for the last 20 years. It's come more sharply into focus because of the Unfunded Mandate Act. That's where we are today. But this is something that Congress has never addressed, and can't fix. Or can't fix without rewriting the statute, which it doesn't need to do because for the reasons I've talked about, Congress had it right in the first place. It didn't pass the Senate bill to protect the health of persons. It passed the House bill, which said protect public health, and public health had meaning, just as I'm outlining it here today, and that meaning, and I talked about this definition, but the name of that book is the -- it's either the \"Cost of Sickness and the Price of Health\" or the other way around. I always get it confused. But the point is is that in this century, the leaders of the public health tradition have been looking at these things, and for good reasons. You know, you don't spend money foolishly and unwisely to achieve a pittance when you can use your money much more wisely and better to achieve more."

Now, I don't think lead industries really has worked. That's not to say, and I'm not saying, although I don't know that the existing standards have benefits that exceed the costs. I have a pretty good sense then in the first decade of the statute, there wasn't much question about that, that one of the reasons this thing didn't come sharply into focus in lead industries is because we were at the early stages and it made a lot of sense to do what was being done. But at this stage, I don't think health-health tradeoffs really are the answer because for the very reason you're suggesting, the costs are important because the resources, and even in a rich society like this one, we do have limited resources and those resources can be better used elsewhere. I mean, there is no even attempt to reconcile the ozone standard in the particulate matter and the other ambient standards in terms of providing a comparable degree of protection, even without any regard to costs. For example, taking the Benzene case as an example, where you know, you had occupational carcinogens and could you look at the risks and could you at least make some comparison, you note none of that is even attempted in this case."

If you introduce the economic factors at this stage of the analysis, what you will have done is to create a, or recognize, a new set of reasons, but it doesn't follow from that that for purposes of the delegation doctrine, it is impossible to draw a line short of zero which is not arbitrary if you don't consider the economics so that you complicate the analysis. You may complicate the analysis in what is, a perfectly desirable way, but I don't see that it either makes or breaks the constitutionality of the statute under the delegation doctrine."

      "speaker": "WAXMAN",
      "speech": "No. I don't think so at all. The first thing that Congress did after it passed the '70 act was to provide in 1977 that the standards should be reviewed and revised every five years. Now, that is a provision that is codified in Section 109(d). It's a new provision, and it's significant because what it says is that the revisions shall be made in the same manner as the original standards are set, by reference to the criteria documents and Section 109(b). Now, I think that one of the things one can glean, one of the many things one can glean from the legislative history, is that when Congress did that in 1977, it knew repeatedly without any doubt and from a commission that it itself asked to look at this question, that the EPA was setting the standards without reference to costs or other implementation factors, and yet, it required the EPA to revise the standards every five years and expressly said that they are to do so in the same manner as which the original standards are set. There was, in particular, a 1970 Congressional Research Service Report, 1975, Congressional Research Service Report that was asked to look at this question, and outlined the debate over whether to retain the effects of the pollutants as the sole criteria of standard setting, and Congress did that in 1977. But it went further, Justice Kennedy. It also directed that another commission, an independent commission, be established to look at this question, and that commission reported to Congress in 1981, and it said, \"the current statutory criteria and requirements for setting air quality standards at the levels necessary to protect public health without considering economic factors should remain unchanged.\" And when Congress revised the statute in 1990, that's exactly what it did. And both the House and the Senate reports accompanying the 1990 legislation said that primary NAAQS are \"set at a level that protects the public health with an adequate margin of safety without regard to the economic or technical feasibility of attainment. This Court itself said in the Union Electric case, construing the Clean Air Act, and I'm quoting, \"when Congress intended the administrator to be concerned about economic or technological feasibility, it has expressly so provided.\" And in the Benzene case, which my opponent has cited but which I think strongly supports us, the Court said, and I am quoting, \"when Congress has intended that an agency engage in cost/benefit analysis, it has clearly indicated such intent on the face of the statute.\" Now there, this Court determined that before OSHA could lower the level for a particular toxic material or hazard physical agent below an existing standard, it had to determine that there was a significant risk to safety. And that determination was to be made without reference to cost/benefit analysis, and if I can just say one thing with respect to the previous argument, that standard, significant risk to safety, has no more countervailing extraneous factors imported into it than the public health adequate margin of safety requisite standard that exists here. In fact, this Court went on at length to say that it doesn't require mathematical precision and there will be a range of factors and that judgment has to be rendered and that the court will simply have to review whether the decision is arbitrary or capricious."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAXMAN",
      "speech": "Well, the EPA reasonably interprets the Clean Air Act as not either requiring or permitting it to set levels that are at or below background levels, and it has never yet, I mean, you know, science inexorably creeps forward, but the EPA has never set, found a level necessary, for example, to eliminate the internal combustion engine. In fact, with respect to ozone, the first time the EPA changed the standard, it changed the standard from a .08 one-hour standard, which is much stricter than what we have here, to a .12 one-hour standard. That is, it relaxed it and of course, it was, this goes to Justice Scalia's question from a while ago, it relaxed it and of course the American Lung Association and others came running in and saying that's ridiculous. You know, how can you be relaxing the standard? Health effects could occur. And you know I commend the D.C. Circuit's opinion, in, it's called American Petroleum Institute vs. Kostill for an analysis of why there are, in fact, countervailing factors that would permit an administrator exercising judgment within the zone of reasonableness to raise the standard. Now, I want to say something about your, your earlier question about what if the costs were so astronomical to require us to deindustrialize, although deindustrialization would be quite unhealthy, and was quite unhealthy. I want to say two things. First of all, Congress has made a rational decision that with respect to what it viewed and characterized as the most serious problem facing America in 1970, which was air pollution, that it wanted to create an agency, an expert agency that would rely on science and the latest scientific knowledge to do as step one, just tell us. We recognize this is going to be hard. We recognize that some of these chemicals are \"nonthreshold,\" but tell us, based on your best judgment what level would be safe to set for the whole country. And then, establishes a program for how to achieve the levels by balancing the burdens between cars and stationary sources of pollution. But secondly, the EPA was -- the EPA has always done cost estimates at the time that it promulgates the criteria documents so that the states can use them in implementing. And retrospective -- looking retrospectively, every single one of those cost estimates has vastly overstated the actual cost/benefit analysis of what it took to meet that level."

I mean, my colleague cites Hope Natural Gas, which was not a nondelegation case, but it was apparent from the context. But I think the interesting point, Justice Kennedy, is that this Court has decided many cases in which it is clear that it was neither necessary nor important. Benzene is the best possible example of that. But it is also true in other cases. I mean, if one can go all the way back to --"

      "speech": "A cost/benefit analysis in determining in either making the statute constitutional under the nondelegation doctrine, or providing a sufficient principle for determining what is a significant safety risk. But the other case that just comes to mind is, in many ways -- the first nondelegation case of the last century, the Stranahan case, Buttfield vs. Stranahan in which Congress passed a law that told the Secretary of the Treasury for some reason to set uniform rates for the quality of tea and to prohibit the importation of any tea that did not meet those standards. Now, there's no indication in the record in the case that cost/benefit analysis went into the determination of what an appropriate standard for tea quality was, and it's frankly hard to imagine how it would have been done so. In my few remaining minutes, I would like to address my comments to the argument that somehow the words public health requires this Court, notwithstanding 20 years of D.C. Circuit precedent to the contrary, to require some form of cost/benefit analysis. And I have five points to make with respect to that in my remaining time. First of all, the legislative history, the 1970 legislative history reflects that Congress intended the plain meaning of public health to mean to protect populations, not the most sensitive person as is the case in the OSHA Benzene context. Number two, if you look at Section 108(a) of the act, which determines what criteria are, it is the effects on public health of the presence of the pollutant in the air that is being ascertained and costs does not make sense in that context. There are also, as Justice Scalia pointed out, many provisions of the Clean Air Act that require consideration of both costs and public health, and they are collected in the brief of Massachusetts and New Jersey at page 29. Well -- penultimately, the Winslow definition, the 1951 definition that ATA cites is a definition of the profession of public health, the discipline of public health. There is no showing in this record or in the legislative history that that case, that that definition was ever even cited in -- by 1970, much less brought to the attention of Congress. And there is no showing whatsoever in the legislative history that that definition was interpreted that way before 1970. I mean, it would require Section 109(b) to say that NAAQS must be set at the level requisite to protect the profession of public health with an adequate margin of safety. And in fact, there is a reference to the fact that all public health organizations agree you can only determine this with respect to costs, at page 36, footnote 27 of our principle brief on this appeal, we reference and describe the expressed views of the American Public Health Association which is the national umbrella organization for public health professionals, which specifically has endorsed the process that EPA uses for setting the NAAQS standard. In short, there is nothing in Section 108 or 109 that permits EPA to set a level inadequate to protect the public health because of the costs of compliance. If there are no further questions."

That's the only thing that ruled it out. The examples that Mr. Waxman, or General Waxman gave are all feasibility examples. He concedes that the standard itself cannot be changed after it is set, and lastly, we have acted as if this provision has made sense in the D.C. Circuit. I call the Court's attention to the American Lung Association case, which shows that this interpretation of the statute makes no sense from any perspective. That was a case where the agency refused to regulate sulfur oxides. Lastly, I would call to the Court's attention the State of Michigan state as an example where there was --"
