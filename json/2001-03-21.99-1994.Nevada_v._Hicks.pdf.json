      "speech": "I read another brief -- a 1934 opinion of the Solicitor General who said that the tribes under Acts passed by Congress had the basic sovereignty that they had for generations, unless it was taken away. And I guess for generations they could have sued people who went and bought gasoline without paying for it. I don't know if it always would have been gasoline, but I assume a basic contract action would be within their grant, wouldn't it?"

      "speaker": "HOWLE",

The state officials are protected, we know, with a certain immunity which has constitutional dimensions. And our position is that that in conjunction with the Court's instruction to examine the extent to which tribes have been divested implicitly because of their statuses as tribes results in the rule that jurisdiction over state officials has been divested."

But suppose this officer, instead of going in with a warrant, just went in, rammed down the door, beat up the plaintiff. He's still wearing his state uniform, and he's still looking for evidence of whatever animal that was -- would you say that even in such a case there would be no tribal court jurisdiction?"

The only allegation regarding scope of authority is the constitutional violation alleged, and otherwise the complaint alleges that they were acting as game wardens. The do what game wardens do, and they get warrants and search for evidence of crime that was committed off the reservation by a reservation member. And this is a core state function. It's a peace officer function. Nevada has to be able to enforce its criminal laws within its own borders."
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

That's doubtless going to be one of the issues in the case, and that whole case should belong in state court rather than tribal court? That's not an irrational position."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Does your argument depend on the fact simply that there is uncertainty under the jurisdictional standard as to how far the tribal court's jurisdiction goes, or would your argument be the same if the statute were clear beyond a peradventure of a doubt that someone who was acting in what you describe as official capacity but is being sued in his individual capacity would nonetheless be subject to jurisdiction? In other words, are you making this argument in order to construe a vague jurisdictional grant, or are you making this argument into something that would be entitled to prevail no matter how clear the statutory grant was?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWLE",
      "speech": "First of all, Your Honor, there is - - I'm sorry, I may have misapprehended. There isn't a statutory grant here, save for the civil rights law of the federal government. But our first position is that there is a categorical rule that state officials doing state business should not be subject to the tribal court's jurisdiction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "If I agree with you on that as to state officers enforcing the state's criminal laws, which is what was at issue here, do I have to agree with you with regard to all other state officers?"

      "speech": "Not that -- yes, Your Honor, I think so."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Professors at state universities? Anybody else? I mean, there's a distinctive aspect of the enforcement of the criminal law, and that is that the tribe has no authority to stop the state from enforcing its criminal laws on the reservation, and one can very plausibly argue that along with that goes no authority to determine whether persons acting in that criminal law enforcement capacity have gone beyond the scope of their authority. That's very rational. But I wouldn't have to extend that to other state officers, would I? Because in the civil field the state can't just walk in and take over the enforcement of civil laws on the reservation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWLE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWLE",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "For crimes committed off -- I perhaps put my hypothetical a little too broadly, but in fact the tribal courts do not have jurisdiction to try for crimes committed off reservation, do they? If a crime is committed off reservation, it's not within the jurisdiction of the tribal court, is it? Even if it's a crime committed by a tribal member, or a tribe --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I think it's pretty crucial to your case, and I assume that to be the case. I assume that to be the law -- that the state has the authority to enforce its state criminal laws with regard to offenses committed off the reservation even when that requires the state to go on the reservation to get the culprit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWLE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It's not up to the tribe to enforce that law. It must be up to the state to enforce it. Since only the state can enforce it, I assume the state can go on the reservation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "If that much is right, then getting the back-up of the tribal court's approval for the warrant was just a polite gesture, meaning a form that was not necessary legally. In other words, here we do have an investigation of something that occurred off the reservation. The warrant is to go on the reservation to investigate, but the crime itself was off reservation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWLE",
      "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And I think Justice Scalia asked you, would the tribal court have authority to prosecute a case that occurred off the reservation. I think you said the answer was no."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWLE",
      "speech": "I think that's correct. I am tentative on that answer --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But you're not certain about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWLE",
      "speech": "I know in this case that the tribe would not prosecute that crime. I do know that for a certainty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But then the next thing is that the crime occurs off the reservation. The warrant is to go on the reservation and conduct a search there. As you understand it, it is not necessary to get any permission of any kind from the tribe, because what the state official is enforcing is an investigation for a crime that occurred off the reservation. Is that right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWLE",
      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. I believe that the state's physical jurisdictions follows its legal jurisdiction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So you think it was not necessary to get the tribal court's permission to carry out a search warrant on a house belonging to a tribal member on the reservation?"

      "speech": "Correct, Your Honor, although I admit I --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I think that's an unusual proposition. Do you cite anything in your brief for that proposition? I thought we took it as a given that the tribal court had to authorize the search."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWLE",
      "speech": "In my reply brief on page eighteen, I've referenced some authorities that are indirectly related that establish a criminal jurisdiction for the states on reservations. It's only by reasoning and inference that I get to the conclusion that we have this authority, and if we had not sought the tribal judge's approval, perhaps we'd be here on that issue as well. I confess there's -- it's a great area of uncertainty, but it is a concurrent jurisdiction that the state and the tribe have on reservations. Reservations are still part of the state, and so the state has to be able to perform these functions in order to do its job properly with law enforcement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I certainly wouldn't think that the state's ability to enforce criminal laws off the reservation is going to be dependent upon whether a tribal court will deign to issue a search warrant or not. I mean, that would be a tremendous incursion upon the state's sovereignty that it can't enforce its criminal laws unless it gets a tribal court to let it go on and search for the offense."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWLE",
      "speech": "I'm sorry. It's on page eighteen of my reply brief, in the second paragraph. The argument also incorrectly assumes state officials are powerless to pursue state law enforcement objectives on a reservation, except with the tribe's consent. And here I've identified the fact that states do have authority over off- reservation crimes committed by tribal members, and that reservations are part of the state within which they occur."
    },

Then you would have been stuck. Even on the fanciful reading of Section 1441, you couldn't get it into federal court."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "What the Solicitor General precisely recommends is recognizing the policy of the removal statute, namely remove -- that's the policy -- that you could have what the court did in El Paso which is, quote, an injunction given by a federal court against further litigation in tribal courts that in practical effect gives the same result as a removal. Now, that's the Solicitor General's precise -- which then just like removal would eliminate any possibility of conflict between state and tribal interests. So that's what I'd like your comment on."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But it is correct, is it not, that we've never held that there must be exhaustion of anything other than the jurisdictional issues?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANAYA",
      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, that is the case. But the exhaustion doctrine is a flexible one, and it is intended to accommodate the interests that might --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But the exhaustion doctrine assumes that there is some later substantive power to exercise jurisdiction over the case, but you question whether that power ultimately exists. You don't have exhaustion if there's not going to be some further jurisdictional substantive review."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "As I understand it, the tribe's position would allow for an injunction on either or both of two grounds. One, of course, the jurisdictional issue could be reviewed again as the basis for the injunction, and if the tribe won the jurisdictional issue, then presumably the merits of the 1983 claim could also be litigated in the federal court, and if the federal court thought the tribal court was wrong on that, it would enjoin enforcement of the judgment. Is that correct? Is that the way it would work?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANAYA",
      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But you'd have to wait until the end of the line, and that seems to be at odds with the notion of qualified immunity that you get out sooner rather than later. Here your positing a case -- and I think the Ninth Circuit supported it -- that you must exhaust in the tribal court, even your qualified immunity defense, you must exhaust in the tribal court before you can come over to seek an injunctive relief in the federal court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANAYA",
      "speech": "Right. The way we contemplate it working, if such an exhaustion were to apply to a 1983 cause of action or to the tribal cause of action in this case, would be for the tribal court to immediately move forward to determine the qualified or personal immunity defenses. And at that point, the defendant could go to federal court to seek review of that prior to an adjudication of the merits of the claim in the tribal court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Even in the federal court system, as I recall it, we allow the denial of qualified immunity to be appealed immediately, because, you know, the belief is that the important interests served by it are simply defeated if you wait until the whole litigation is finished before you tell the governmental agent, well, you don't have to worry about it. Why should there be a different rule when we go that far to allow such an interlocutory appeal in the federal system? It seems very strange to require the government official to go all the way through the tribal court and await an injunction afterwards."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANAYA",
      "speech": "Well, what we're suggesting, or what the model would suggest, is that there would be the opportunity to go immediately upon a determination in the tribal court of the qualified immunity defense to the federal court, so it would be in the nature of a interlocutory review."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Then if you lost and you went back and you exhausted on the merits, there would be another opportunity to go into the federal court for a different injunction."

      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Okay. I didn't understand. You would allow it immediately as soon as the qualified immunity --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But would it not have been consistent with our cases for the district court in this case to have said I'm going to decide the qualified immunity issue right away. He didn't do that -- it would have been consistent with our cases for the district judge to have done that, would it not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANAYA",
      "speech": "Perhaps, Your Honor, but the rationale of National Farmers Union of Iowa Mutual, I think, counseled in favor of what the district court did."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "If you assume the rationale of exhaustion applies beyond jurisdictional issues."
    },
    {

      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. And I think --"
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It has not been decided."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANAYA",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but it supports them to the same extent that it would respect the sovereignty of the states. Of course, if it were a state court involved, they would respect the jurisdiction, require exhaustion on the jurisdictional issue, but nevertheless might have gone ahead on the merits, if this were a state court rather than a tribal court. You're in effect asking for a stronger rule of exhaustion in tribal courts than if it were a state court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANAYA",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, we think that the situation here is one in which we have a tribal court struggling to maintain its jurisdiction, and the deference that the exhaustion doctrine gives to tribal courts is warranted, and the interests of the state officials -- the federal interest that might exist in ensuring that their interests are protected, are sufficiently met by the exhaustion rule as long as there is some kind of review and, perhaps, an interlocutory review of the personal immunity defenses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Do tribal courts routinely hear Section 1983 federal claims?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANAYA",
      "speech": "Not routinely, Your Honor, but there is nothing -- there is no federal law that precludes them from hearing a 1983 claim. The Fallon tribal court is a court of general jurisdiction. The 1983 statute is a jurisdiction intended to provide broad remedies for violations of constitutional rights and, in the absence of an affirmative limitation on the jurisdiction of the court, the tribal court, under federal law, it seems to follow quite naturally that the Fallon tribal court as a court of general jurisdiction would have jurisdiction to hear a Section 1983 --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    {
      "speaker": "ANAYA",

      "speech": "So is it a federal question? Use federal question jurisdiction to this --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANAYA",
      "speech": "Well, that's right. This would assume that immunity defenses would be defenses under federal law, and that is the position that the United States has taken, and it's a position that the tribe accepts -- that these defenses could become federal law and hence they would be the basis for review in federal court."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, maybe they require. I mean, there are two conclusions that you could draw from the absence of any review provision in the tribal court for a 1983 action. One is that we could invent some never- before-heard-of, and never-elsewhere-used power of this Court or federal courts to issue an injunction. The other one is that the tribal court has no authority to entertain 1983 actions. That would solve the problem just as well, wouldn't it?"
    },

Congress has expressed its preference for a federal forum at a defendant's request when he has been sued on a federal cause of action. That occurs through the removal statute when the defendant is sued in state court."

That was the case in El Paso as we understand it, and that would also be the case here. The cases under 1983 could proceed in tribal court, but if the defendant elects a federal forum, he should be entitled to that at the outset of the case so that the trial of the facts --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Really making up a statute that Congress didn't pass because that's what happens -- a federal officer is sued in state court. He can remove it. Why can he remove it? Because Congress has said so. So here Congress has said nothing at all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDOWELL",
      "speech": "Well, that's correct, Your Honor. That was also the case in El Paso, but the court didn't think that Congress' silence in that instance reflected any specific intent to leave the case in tribal court if a defendant wanted it in --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But they don't have to have any intent to leave it in trial court, you need an intent to get it removed from tribal court. The extant state of affairs is what it is. What we're looking for is some reason to remove it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDOWELL",
      "speech": "Well, the reason to remove it is because the plaintiff has asserted a federal cause of action, and we would think that Congress would want a defendant sued in tribal court to have the same right as the defendants sued in state court to get a federal forum. We think that Congress' failure to provide in Section 1441 for removal from tribal court was inadvertent, it doesn't reflect a policy choice on the part of Congress that such cases should remain in tribal court. Simply the fact that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, I don't mean to cut you off -- I thought maybe you would address this. El Paso was a stronger case for your position in one respect, at least, because in El Paso, I think, as I recall it, the federal statute preempted all other causes of action so that the federal right was, in effect, was exclusive, because you don't have that feature here. So if there's an injunction in this case on the El Paso model, it in effect would leave the litigation to go forward on non-1983 claims arising, I mean, for example, tribal tort claims. So the result would sort of be a bifurcation of the litigation and sort of a mess, and you didn't have that feature in El Paso. Shouldn't that bear on the question of whether or not we want to follow the El Paso model here?"

      "speech": "Okay, but I mean this is getting Rube Goldberg. Now there's another rule and pendent jurisdictional claims are now being removed by means of a novel use of injunction. I mean, there's a character here that we're making up an awful lot as we go along on your theory."

If somebody commits a criminal offense in Nevada, yes, Nevada has the right to prosecute that offense, but if the person goes to California, perhaps even lives in California, if Nevada wants to execute a search warrant against that person's California home, the Nevada warrant isn't self-executing. There is a need to go to a California court to get approval of the search, and we would say that the same model applies in the state/tribe situation."

It's just kind of we let them park for an hour in the tribal court, and then the federal officer has the control, or the state officer has the control, can get it immediately into a federal court. Is that your position?"

    {
      "speaker": "HOWLE",
      "speech": "Thank you, You Honor. One of our major concerns in this case is the non-federal claim in tribal court, because that's problematic. The removal of the non-federal claim if there's no federal claim to which it's pendent loses really in tribal court. And even if there's review of the immunity defense, ultimately in federal court, there's no basis for federal court jurisdiction to review the judgment. And so it leaves us exactly where we started, which is at the mercy of the tribal court. That is a derogation of state sovereignty. This isn't the kind of treatment that the federal government would accept for its own officials, and the reference I would make, if I may, in the U.S. brief is footnote twenty-two on page twenty- nine where the whole theory of federal officer immunities is set out. And in the end they conclude, just as we have, that because of the status of the tribes as dependent sovereigns within the federal system, additional considerations may apply to the exercise of tribal court jurisdiction over federal officers even when sued in their personal capacities. That's exactly what we're asking for in this case as state officers. We're not asking for any more than the federal government. And perhaps the difference here is due to the fact that the U.S. views states and tribes as coordinate sovereigns. Coordinate sovereigns. And tribes and states are not coordinate sovereigns, they're different. States and tribes are fundamentally different. State immunities have a constitutional dimension, whereas tribes have been implicitly divested of their sovereignty to the extent that it's inconsistent with their status. And that's our ultimate position in the case and explains the position we take. Thank you, Your Honor."
