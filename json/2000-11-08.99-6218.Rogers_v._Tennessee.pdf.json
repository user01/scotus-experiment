It's some concept of fair warning or expectation, but at the time the crime was committed, I guess he hoped the victim would die, and I don't see that your client has been deprived of any kind of an expectation."

Subjectively, I have to admit it is very difficult to ever prove that any criminal defendant relies upon the state of the law at the time that he or she commits an act, but objectively he was entitled to rely upon the year-and-a-day rule if the victim did survive. But more importantly than that, after the fact, after he was charged, fair notice and reliance applies after the fact also, not just at the time of the act; otherwise, a defendant who is approaching trial is never going to know exactly what are the elements of the offense, or what is the punishment that I'm about to face. We don't just say you're entitled to fair warning of the punishment at the time you commit it, but you're also, based upon that time, are allowed to rely upon that as you're approaching trial."

That is, so long as you intend to kill, dispense with the requirement that the victim actually die. You could say, gee, his expectations weren't disappointed. He intended to kill. It just so happened the person didn't die. And we certainly wouldn't uphold a State supreme court judgment that, well, you know, that's a technicality, we're not going to insist that the victim have died, we're going to get you for murder anyway. I guess you could likewise say no disappointment of expectations."

Under the State's theory in this case, as long as the defendant had the same mens rea, same actus reis, the fact that the result occurred or didn't occur would be irrelevant, and under the State's theory you could eliminate the requirement that there be a result and there would be no problem with that. But the problem is that as a matter of fundamental fairness and fair warning as to punishment deals with not just at the time of the act. If we allow courts to retroactively alter the elements of an offense or to retroactively enhance punishment, what I have to do, what I have to tell my clients when we're getting ready to go to trial is, I can tell you what the law was at the time you committed your crime, and I can tell you what the law is today, as we get ready to go for trial, and you're innocent of the law as we have it today. In some cases I'm going to get to tell them that. But I can't tell you, because the courts can change after the fact. They can eliminate this element of the offense."

It's our rule, not the legislature's rule, so we want to get rid of it, but we can't. We're saying it's our fault, not the legislature's. We can't change, however, because if we apply it to this case it's going to be ex post facto, and we can't simply prospectively overrule without being an advisory opinion.

I mean, I don't know why you accept that, especially when you're dealing with a State that has a constitutional provision adopted in 1870 which reads, all laws and ordinances now in force and use in this State not inconsistent with this constitution shall continue in force and use until they shall expire, be altered, or repealed by the legislature.

It would still -- no matter what we say here, it would still be open to the Tennessee Supreme Court to say the change was already made by the legislature and that really ended the case, and all this has been kind of an academic exercise."

But I'm not contending the Tennessee Supreme Court can't change the rule. The rule is dead in Tennessee. The year-and-a-day rule has been done away with. The question is whether or not they can apply it to an offense that was committed 5 years prior to that, and it gets back to the basic principle of legality. Do we try defendants based upon the law that's in existence at the time of their conduct, or do we change it after the fact, and the problem with changing it after the fact is, what it's going to do is, it's going to undermine the presumption of innocence."

It's almost like a statute of limitations."

If the statute of limitations from -- say, supposing Tennessee had a statute of limitations for robbery, 10 years.

Now, your opponent says it's just evidentiary. What's your response to that? It's just a question of evidence."

There's nothing else available. If you don't prove this element, you don't prove your case. It's a sufficiency of the evidence rule. If you don't prove this -- and this is -- you lose. And now we say after the fact I can't prove it, we'll just eliminate it. Any element of the offense I can't prove, we have the power to retroactively eliminate."

And Bouie was concerned about fair notice to an individual about what he could and could not do at the time he acts.

But then, when you're thinking of extending it under a due process label, wouldn't you want to take into account its origin, and the compartmentalization has been criticized? I mean, you're not bound to take it over lock, stock and barrel. Why should you, given its origin as dictum and its rigidity with these categories? I mean, it's not Scripture."

    {
      "speaker": "WARD",
      "speech": "That's correct, and actually when you look at the definition in Bouie that was cited from Calder v. Bull, the discussion talks about aggravating a crime after the fact, and also making something criminal that wasn't a crime after the fact, and those are the two things that Bowie concentrated on in its statement or definition of an ex post facto law, the first two Calder categories. And then the Court said, if it's ex post facto for a legislature to do it, then due process should prevent the courts from obtaining the same result. My suggestion is that there's just as great a harm from making something criminal that wasn't criminal before as it is to aggravate a criminal offense. For instance, if you take something that's not a crime and give it a 2-day punishment. It's a far greater harm to take something that already is a crime with a 2-day punishment and then aggravate it to where it has a 20-year punishment. Justice Chase talked in Calder about those Calder categories and said they came from the same kinds of harm, and my suggestion is that ex post facto principles are fundamental concepts, fundamental concepts like fundamental fairness. It's fundamentally unfair to alter the elements of an offense after the fact, or to aggravate it. It's fundamentally unfair because it undermines the presumption of innocence."

But here, however, it's unusual, because the Tennessee Supreme Court expressly says, we're going to change a substantive rule of law, and is that any different than if it had been exercising, say, its functions to make court rules, or had said, we are now going to pass the following rule, that in murder cases the victim does not have to die within a year.

But in that day of rigorous stare decisis, what they may have meant by a judicial act was a court announcing that this rule of a year and a day was never part of Tennessee law, that our past opinions were erroneous. At most they meant that, and maybe they meant simply affirming an ambiguous rule. I mean, I think you have to read Calder in the time frame in which it was pronounced.

A statute of limitations does not render criminal actions innocent when done. It involves -- the statute of limitations doesn't regulate primary conduct at all. The statute of limitations also involves facts which are sort of wholly collateral to guilt or innocence, so I think it doesn't either aggravate the crime, it doesn't -- quite clearly it doesn't increase the punishment, and because it involves issues that are wholly collateral to guilt or innocence, it's hard to argue that it's a sufficiency-of-the-evidence rule. Rather, the remedy for a statute of limitations violation would be to dismiss the prosecution altogether, to dismiss the indictment altogether, not to enter a judgment of acquittal.

That is, in a rape prosecution, the requirement that there be a hue and cry by the victim. We held that was an element of the crime. Like the year-and-a-day rule, it has nothing to do with the intent of the criminal. It's after the event. It's after the fact. We held it was an element. Why is that an element and this not an element?"

      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "speech": "Well, I would answer in two ways. First of all, it is quite plainly not a statutory element, and it seems to me that is an issue of State law, and in fact the court here said, the lower court here said that it has never been a part of the statutory law of the State. Secondly, it is not an element because it is not one of those issues that is submitted to the jury. It's rather a jurisdictional fact."

Supposing just before 1989 there'd been a really terrible crime, he killed a child in a bad situation, but the child didn't die for over a year and a half, or over a year and a day, and the Tennessee -- that prompted the Tennessee legislature to abolish that rule, and they said in the rule, abolish it for the past case too, and they said well, they can't do that, and they say, if we can't do that because of the Ex Post Facto Clause we urge the supreme court to abolish it judicially, and remind them that they all run for reelection if they don't do it, so --"

The -- it can't initiate law reform efforts of its own. It must -- it can only act in the context of cases that the litigants bring before the court. In addition, there is stare decisis, and the concomitant imperative that courts justify departures from precedent of the sort Your Honor's hypothetical posits, with reasons, and with some neutral principles of general applicability and some consideration of the impact of the change they're about to make, not only on the litigants before them, but on all similarly situated litigants. I think all of those traditional restraints operate to justify different treatment for court decisions as opposed to decisions of legislatures, and certainly the history of the Ex Post Facto Clause indicates that the framers were acutely aware of those distinctions, and because of a well-documented history of parliamentary abuse involving legislation of this sort they thought it essential to insert a prophylactic prohibition against legislation of this sort without regard to -- they weren't going to look into the fairness of individual pieces of legislation and the circumstances under which they were passed. They erected a prophylactic bar to legislation of that sort at all."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But isn't the answer to the institutional argument that you've been making the answer that Justice Scalia has raised a couple of times elsewhere in the argument, that at the time the ex post facto rule was written the way it was, common law courts, or our very conception of courts, even in the Federal system, which was in gestation at that time, involved a system of much stricter precedent than we have today, so the likelihood of a court doing what this court has done was simply much less than it is today. We have an entirely different concept of binding precedent today, and for that reason, shouldn't the Due Process Clause take that into consideration by being starchier in -- than perhaps the founders ever thought there would be a need to be when reviewing judicial change?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I think the Due Process Clause and the Ex Post Facto Clause also are -- serve very different functions under our constitutional scheme. As I indicated, the Ex Post Facto Clause is this sort of structural restraint on the power of that branch of Government, but Due Process, litigation under the Due Process Clause is by its very nature case by case, and the concern of the Due Process Clause is individualized fair treatment, so I would suggest that it would be inconsistent with the nature of the due process guarantee to build into it some sort of prophylactic structural restraint on the judicial branch because of concerns that the judicial branch in modern times engages in too much law reform. It seems to me that due process, the Due Process Clause, with its concern about individualized fair treatment, is up to the task of protecting against aberrational cases in which a court is self-evidently engaged in some sort of arbitrary or vindictive action that -- of the sort that violates our notions of fundamental fairness and our notions about the rule of law. To close, our position is that the Due Process Clause was not violated here, and that the Due Process Clause is not violated by a court decision of this sort that retroactively alters a rule of criminal law unless that change expands the scope of conduct covered by the criminal prohibition issue and does so unforeseeably. Secondarily, our position is that the Ex Post Facto Clause simply doesn't regulate judicial action at all, and that none of its technical restrictions should be imported wholesale into the Due Process Clause. Thank you very much."
