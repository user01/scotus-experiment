    "speech": "If -- if I should modify it, please -- please let me know. The court of appeals in this case made two fundamental and separate errors, each of which should require reversal of its decision. First, all agree that the question whether Title IX precludes the use of Section 1983 to enforce the Constitution is a matter of congressional intent. Yet, the court of appeals entirely disregarded all of the ordinary indicia of congressional intent: The statutory text, the statutory background structure and evolution, the unquestioned legislative purpose. Each of these considerations points conclusively towards a single outcome: Congress did not mean Title IX to preclude the use of Section 1983 to enforce the Constitution. Second, rather than consider any of this direct and compelling evidence of what Congress actually had in mind in Title IX, the court of appeals applied what it thought to be a presumption that the availability of Title IX's implied right of action to enforce Title IX's own statutory prohibition of gender discrimination somehow should be taken to mean that Congress meant to preclude the use of Section 1983 to enforce constitutional rules against discrimination."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Counsel, there is -- there is a little bit of an air of unreality about all this, because, of course, Congress didn't provide a cause of action in Title IX to start with. And the reason they don't have all these limitations and restrictions is because they didn't put in the cause of action. We implied it from the statute, and so it seems kind of awkward to say: Well, there are no limitations, as I said, when there was no cause of action."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "Well, I -- I guess there -- there are a number of points that I -- I can make in response to that, Your Honor. First of all, I think what -- what you say is absolutely right. Congress did not expressly provide a cause of action in Title IX. And so since -- since the question in a preclusion case, the question whether or not Congress meant to preclude the use of Section 1983, is whether there is a clear indication of congressional intent to do so, that there -- as a matter of definition, that can't be present here. But -- but before --"

  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "No, I -- I don't agree with that. I -- I do think -- and -- and I -- this is not my principal point, but I do think it's quite clear that if we are talking about what is the clear intent of Congress regarding preclusion of use of Section 1983, that the Congress did not expressly create a -- a private right of action at all bears very significantly on that. I don't at all disagree that Congress intended and expected that the courts would recognize the right of action under -- under Title IX. But Congress actually in Title IX specifically I think addressed the preclusion question that we have here. There is a clear statutory test that answers the question in this case in -- in several respects. First of all, when Congress enacted Title IX, it specifically provided that -- it specifically contemplated that there would be continued, private constitutional litigation challenging -- to end discrimination. It specifically authorized the attorney general to intervene in private litigation \"whenever\" -- and I am here quoting from the text of the statute -- \"whenever suit is initiated in any court of the United States to assert rights, deprivation of equal protection, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution on account of sex.\" Congress, therefore, specifically contemplated when it enacted Title IX that there would be -- there would, in fact, be constitutional litigation challenging gender discrimination on account of sex. And Congress surely knew that that litigation would proceed under Section 1983. Respondents --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Did we rely on that provision in implying the right of action under Title IX?"

  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "The -- the Court did not. I mean there, the -- the Court looked at what it took to be the general -- the manifest congressional intent when -- when it enacted Title IX. But it did not specifically rely on -- on that legislation. The legislation, of course, goes to whether or not Section 1983 suits were available, not whether there is a Title IX implied right of action available. And, as I say, in that -- in that legislative language Congress made expressly clear that it intended -- and intended actually to facilitate by allowing the attorney general to intervene in -- continued Section 1983 litigation to enforce allegations of -- of gender discrimination."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Rothfeld, I follow your argument entirely, and then in the civil rights area there are a lot of overlapping statutes. You can sue under Title VII. It doesn't take away your right under 1981. But in this case, as we get down to what this case is about, we have a determination by a court that the school district acted reasonably in relation to these complaints. And then you say: But we have constitutional claim. A constitutional claim requires you to show deliberate, intentional conduct if it's an individual; if you are talking about an institution, some kind of not just one incident, but a custom, a pattern. What, when you get down to the merits, is different about those? In other words, is it on the wrong track to talk about precluding a statute? Instead of talking about just plain old issue preclusion, what is different about 1983? Yes, you have two claims; but if you lose under IX, you are going to lose under 1983 as well."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "Well, that -- that is right, Your Honor, to the extent that the claims are identical and that they have actually been adjudicated. The -- the First Circuit in this case resolved the Title IX claim focusing on deliberate indifference in response to the peer-on-peer sexual harassment. To the extent that there is a federal constitutional claim growing out of that conduct of the same sort and to the extent that the elements of that claim are identical, then we agree that at that point that would be precluded. But we think that there is more to this case than that one issue that has been resolved."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "The reason I ask is obviously if this case happens to be a case in which, because of the finding that there was no intentional discrimination and the school board behaved properly, that if that's the finding and therefore you have no claim under 1983 in respect to that, it becomes very theoretical to say that they went too far and said you might have no other 1983 claim because you would have some other 1983 claim, but we should dismiss this as improvidently granted and wait until somebody does this again."

This is not a theoretical possibility. There was actually discovery that was requested concerning additional complaints, concerning additional disciplinary action against other students, concerning requests for bus monitors, as to which could have been developed that there was disparate treatment as to those. The Respondents declined --"

And it could have developed in quite a different way. For example, discovery was requested on these subjects that I -- that I mentioned to Justice Breyer, which -- which could have been used to develop that, in fact, requests by boys were treated more favorably than requests by girls; complaints by boys were responded to more -- more favor --"

But I can tell you that the request was made, the Respondents declined to respond it to it for, among other reasons, the -- their assertion that it would not lead to the discovery of relevant evidence or admissible evidence. After the 1983 conclusion ruling, and because of the conclusion ruling, that was not followed up because it would have been futile to try to develop additional argumentation in that -- in that direction.

Those courts cut it short and threw the case out on conclusion grounds. And I -- I think the way in which the court of appeals decided the case actually suggests that it was of the view that there was more to the case than simply the Title IX claims that had been rejected, because one would have thought that if the court of appeals was of the view that there is nothing to the case beyond the Title IX peer-on-peer harassment claim that has been reject, it would have ended its discussion at that point. It would have said: We reject your Title IX claim; there is nothing more to your 1983 constitutional claim; that's the end of the matter. But it didn't do that. It decided the Title IX claim on the merits, rejecting it. And it then separately went on to address the Section 1983 constitutional claim and said: We are not going to address those merits at all; we are going to say that those claims are precluded as a matter of per se Title IX law, that Title IX is preclusive. And, therefore, one would think that the court of appeals had it in mind that there was more that could have been decided about the merits --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Just on that one issue on attorneys' fees."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "Well, I think that the language used is actually broader in the -- in the -- legislation. But that, as I said, is a parenthetical point. I -- I think that something that we have here which was not present in Smith at all -- and as you said, Justice Ginsburg, it is absolutely right that there was a much more elaborate, involved administrative remedial scheme in the statute considered there, there is nothing remotely like that in Title IX. But before you could even get to that point, there is this expressed evidence in the statutory text of Title IX that Congress did not mean to preclude. This is Section 1983. First there is the provision that I mentioned regarding the attorney general, which -- which expressly contemplates there will be continued Section 1983 constitutional gender discrimination after the enactment of Title IX. I think that in and of itself was positive and tells the Court all it needs to know. But beyond -- there is -- there is more. Beyond that, there is the language of the antidiscrimination provisions of Title IX, which was borrowed directly, is identical to the language of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Congress dropped the phrase \"race, color and national origin\" that appears in Title VI and substituted \"sex\" in Title IX. And, so, the Court has recognized that Congress expected and intended that Title IX would be interpreted just as -- as had been Title VI."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Have there been any decisions on Title VI and 1983?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "There -- there had been a myriad of such decisions. There had been, as we cite in our brief, as the American Bar Association cites in its amicus brief supporting us, the American Civil Liberties Union cites in its brief, there have been almost two dozen cases decided before the enactment of Title IX in which courts allowed the simultaneous assertion of statutory discrimination claims under Title VI and section 1983 discrimination claims under Title IX. There had not been a single suggestion by any decision that there might possibly be preclusion. And so, at the time that Congress used the language of Title IX, it knew that that language had been uniformly, widely construed across the country to allow the simultaneous assertion of those claims, not the preclusion of Section 1983 claims for discrimination. And so it's when Congress -- when legislative language has been the subject of judicial construction, as the Court has said many times, and Congress repeats that language in a new statute, its expectation and intention is that the judicial construction is going to be taken as well. And so that I think that is also dispositive of the question in this case, because the Congress chose language that it necessarily knew had been understood not to preclude the use of Section 1983. And I will mention as well, just to throw in the suspenders along with the belt, an additional consideration that the court of appeals ignored here was the manifest legislative purpose of section -- of Title IX, which was to expand and strengthen protections against discrimination in schools."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

    "speech": "Absolutely correct. And I think that there are --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, the point is that that would then allow 1983 actions to circumvent those limitations on the Title IX remedy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "Well, I -- I think not, for a couple of reasons, Your Honor. First, as I say, there is this direct evidence of what Congress had in mind. It specifically referred to constitutional litigation under the Fourteenth Amendment when it enacted Title IX, and, therefore, by definition it could not have been concerned about evasion in that sense. But I think that their -- \"evasion\" is not the word to use here because, on the one hand, there are statutory rights created by Title IX; on the other, there are pre-existing constitutional rights."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "And those constitutional rights have negated -- I think it might be -- it's at least arguable that it would be harder to win a 1983 case, given that, as to the individual, you have qualified immunity, and, as to the institution, you have to show a custom or practice."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "Well, the only availability for individual liability is under the Constitution, because Title IX, at least as construed by the lower courts, does not permit suits directly against the individual, only against the institution, which I think is a significant distinction between the two and supports the argument that Congress could not have intended to preclude because, as the Court has recognized repeatedly, the availability of individual liability greatly adds to the deterrence, the effect of deterring constitutional violations. And the suggestion that, when Congress enacted Title IX it would have -- meant to have the perverse effect of allowing a school, by accepting federal funds, to insulate school policymakers from any personal statutory liability, you know, for even the most blatant and obvious acts of unconstitutional sex discrimination, would turn Title IX on its head. It's inconceivable that Congress could have had that in mind when it enacted a statute that was clearly designed to expand and strength protections against sex discrimination. I'll make sort of two additional points, Your Honor. As I suggest, I think the direct evidence in the statutory text, as well as the legislative purpose, is dispositive here and the Court need not go beyond that to answer the question here. That leaves the question of how the court of appeals got the matter so far wrong. And I think that the reason that they did is, ignoring the text, they applied what they thought to be a presumption derived from this Court's decision in cases like Smith v. Robinson and the Palos Verdes case that the creation of a new statutory right and a new statutory remedy necessarily reflects a congressional intent to preclude the use of Section 1983 to enforce overlapping constitutional remedies. There has never been such a presumption. The Court has said repeatedly, I think, as was suggested earlier in the discussion, that when Congress creates new statutory rights and new statutory remedies, they are presumed to overlap with and to supplement existing statutory rights and remedies, unless the two are positively repugnant to one another, unless they are inconsistent and can't be reconciled. That certainly is not the case here. The Section 1983 constitutional claims and Title IX supplement and complement each other. The two statutes are by no means coterminous in who can be sued. The Court has certainly never presumed that the creation of any statutory right or statutory remedy bars the use of Section 1983 to enforce the Constitution, as suggested by Justice Ginsburg's question. The Court has only once in well more than a century that Section 1983 has been on the books held that availability of the constitutional remedy had been precluded. As I say, Congress promptly responded by providing that remedy. The Palos Verdes decision, which was the fulcrum of the court of appeals decision, I think suggests what's wrong with its analysis. Palos Verdes involved a new statutory right, a new statutory action to enforce that right. The statutory action was limited in significant respects, and the Court concluded, as a matter of common sense, that one could infer from that situation Congress intended that the new right with the new remedial system would be exclusive, otherwise plaintiffs could immediately go to court and render that system a dead letter. But, as Justice Scalia pointed out in his opinion for the Court, that remedy had no effect whatsoever on section 1983. It meant that Congress had placed the new remedy outside of section 1983's remedial framework, but that claims that were available prior to the existence of that new right, prior to the creation of that new right, remained available under section 1983. And that is exactly the situation that we have here. Plaintiffs are not trying to allege a new statutory right that is outside the section 1983's remedial framework; instead, they are asserting fundamental, pre-existing constitutional rights."

Robinson as well as issue preclusion, which makes it somewhat complicated. But I would suggest in this case under these circumstances, because the issue was deliberate indifference and because there was a finding both as a legal matter as well as a factual matter of deliberate indifference, that essentially the two sort of collapsed into one. With regard to Smith, I would point out that under the Smith theory constitutional claims can be precluded if the -- under the statute under review it has comprehensive, remedial schemes. And we would argue that there is a comprehensive remedial scheme, and that this Court has, in fact, sort of found that and even added to it in the development -- have found that Congress intended to add to the remedial scheme an implied right of action."

It just said there is a private right -- right of action. There is an implied private right of action. It didn't set up any administrative mechanism. It didn't set up any regime for going to -- to an agency first and then coming to the court, none of that."

Are you saying that it is impossible for anyone to imagine a circumstance in which it would be held the defendant did not violate Title IX, but in which the court held it did violate the Equal Protection Clause?

And I suggest that the First Circuit did, in fact, look at specifically that issue. And the First Circuit said in their decision that, in looking at the equal protection claim in particular, that the petitioners offer -- or in that case, they offer, the plaintiffs offer -- no theory of liability under the equal protection clause other than the defendants' supposed failure to take adequate actions to prevent and/or remediate the peer-on-peer harassment that Jacqueline experienced. And I suggest to you that that is exactly the issue that -- that that is exactly the issue. The issue is whether or not, if you look at the complaint, the claim that is being brought under Title IX and the claim that is being brought under Section 1983 in the Constitution are virtually identical, which is a second problem of the Smith test: If there is a comprehensive remedial scheme. Again, it's a remedial scheme. And, second, the question is: Are the claims virtually identical? And I would suggest to you that the First Circuit found that they were virtually identical. And I would suggest that that is what leads to preclusion. Now, that doesn't mean that there aren't other claims that could be made with regard to others. But for the institution, it -- I -- the -- it is very important. Congress established this particular scheme under Section 19 -- under Title IX, and it would be our view that Congress specifically and intentionally focused -- fixed the responsibility for sex discrimination on the institution and on the institutional recipient of Federal financial assistance. And that if you were to allow Section 1983 claims, that enforcement would not be nearly as equitable. We would point out that it's obvious, but it is important to consider that recipients of Federal financial assistance include not only municipalities that include public schools; they include State entities which under this Court's decision -- under this Court's prior decision in Wills versus Michigan are not subject to suit under Section 1983 and private entities that are not subject to 1983 at all."

So I'm not certain what to do, because Selya started his opinion by saying this isn't a case where Title IX doesn't apply; it does apply; they have the funding; but he doesn't talk about the exemptions and he doesn't really talk about the -- a difference between suing an institution and suing an individual.

And once again, that -- that issue is not before this Court.

Essentially they are -- they are saying that -- that there was -- that because no theory of liability was offered other than this, that there isn't any further claim available. With regard to sending this case back, we argue, based upon the deliberative difference standard, which I think is indisputably -- the standard falls under Title IX, and the standard under the Equal Protection Clause -- that that deliberative difference standard and -- and the fact the First Circuit found that -- that there was -- that the Barnstable School Committee acted reasonably and without deliberative difference, precludes -- there is no issue in controversy anymore."

So you should never say that Title IX precludes an action under 1983. In fact, you should say that sometimes the issues that are litigated under Title IX may result in the fact that you don't have available -- you don't get relief under 1983, but there is still a cause of action."

Well why -- I guess I've gotten -- maybe I am repeating the question. Why do we have to decide that, and we would just say there is a 1983 action, but you may not be able to pursue it, I guess is the way to put it, if your claims are precluded or the issues result in the fact that you don't recover."

The history of sex discrimination versus race discrimination are quite different in scope."

It is our -- it is our view that 19 -- that in this particular instance -- and I -- and I think I may have misspoken if the view is, is that it's the administrative schemes that get compared. I -- I believe under Smith, the issue is whether or not there is a comprehensive remedial scheme, and here you have the remedy -- both an administrative remedy as well as a private right of action, which we would argue should preclude the 1983 claims. Moreover, we would also look with regard to the fact that this is a constitutional claim to the -- to Bivens -- to the line of cases under Bivens which we cite in our brief, the fact that when Congress provides a remedy for a particular area -- in a particular area, that that remedy can preclude an independent action which even is based on the Constitution. And we would suggest that that would be -- that that is something that we would urge this Court to consider --"

That's quite different than construing a provision like 1983 which Congress has enacted."

    "speaker": "HODGE",

And as -- as this Court did in -- when it decided Rancho Palos Verdes, it remanded for consideration communities of equity, which is a Title IX case for reconsideration by, I believe it's the Eighth Circuit under the Rancho Palos Verdes decision. And while that case ultimately did not come back to this Court, but the circuit court determined that it treated -- it treated the issue differently, and we would argue that that is a part of this split, and that that is -- and that is not the appropriate resolution."

    "speech": "Exactly. There was no constitutional claim in Rancho Palos Verdes. However, this Court did cite Smith and did cite Smith in its decision and -- and favorably so. But moreover, we would argue that -- the question is really a different -- comparing a statute to statute, which is Title IX to section 1983. Congress allowed for actions in 1983, Congress allows for actions under Title IX, or whether or not you are looking at the issue of Title IX versus a constitutional claim. Now, I want to just make the point that preclusion makes sense. Congress really did put the focus in Title IX on the institution, and Congress is also seeking to have equity of enforcement. Further, as set for in the amici in support of the Respondents' position, we would point out that if section 1983 claims are not precluded, that it would require the expenditure of funds by -- by recipients of federal financial assistance on a variety of issues that are totally unnecessary including qualified immunity. And on the peer-on-peer harassment case, I think it's very important to focus on what this case is. It is a peer-on-peer, student-on-student harassment where, what you would have is, if you were going to allow additional claims under section 1983 against the institution, it would -- it would intrude and interfere with the school's processes of disciplining students. And I would also suggest that it might also interfere in the classic manner in which --"

If you have two school boards, one of -- two schools, state schools, one gets federal funds and the other does not, does this preclude -- no 1983 remedy against one, but there is a 1983 remedy against the other, that's your view, isn't it?"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",

    "speaker": "HODGE",
    "speech": "I believe under those circumstances, Justice Stevens, that what we would be talking about would be the situation where a -- under Title IX there is -- there's actually an easier path to recovery, if you will, because it does not require the specific intent required by Massachusetts v. Feeney, which we believe sets a slightly higher -- a bar and a higher level of intentionality."

    "speaker": "HODGE",
    "speech": "Your Honor, it is -- deliberate indifference is the standard. However, in order to prove a constitutional violation, you must also have the specific intent for invidious discrimination that we -- that this Court has not imposed and did not impose in Davis for violations of peer -- for peer-on-peer harassment cases. So, while the discrimination needs to be intentional under Title IX, it is not required that there be the specific intent to favor one over the other or one protected status over the other."

  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. I will try not to use my extra ten seconds. Two principal points. First on the proper disposition of this case. The First Circuit's holding, and I'm reading from 24a of the petition appendix: the comprehensiveness of Title IX's remedial scheme indicates Congress saw Title IX solely as vindicating the constitutional right to be free from gender discrimination perpetrated by educational institutions; it follows that the plaintiff's equal protection claims are precluded. That was not a holding that had to do with claim preclusion, issue preclusion, title estoppel; it's a holding that constitutional claims simply cannot go forward. So there were constitutional claims were advanced below, argued to both courts, that have not been discussed by any court at any point, and I think the proper disposition here is, the most regular course in a case of this sort to is decide the question presented, send the case back. It certainly is not the case -- it's a commonplace that the Court has threshold questions that are presented to it. There are remaining issues that have to be resolved on remand, it's certainly not the Court's usual practice to decide whether or not plaintiffs can -- can prevail on those claims on remand before deciding the threshold question on which cert was granted. I think that's the appropriate approach for the Court to take here. On the merits, very quickly. Again I think we have to -- the gold standard of evidence as to preclusion, we have expressed statutory text that deals with it. Learned colleague suggested that the Attorney General intervention provision somehow limited the cases involving claims by schools that do not accept Federal funds are somehow not subject to Title IX. That is not the language of the provision. The provision says whenever -- whenever it is claimed, it is initiated, in a court of the United States asserting deprivation of rights essentially on account of sex, the Attorney General can intervene. Clearly Congress had it in mind that there would be such claims, and this was enacted as part of -- Title IX was enacted as part of the statute that creates rights against discrimination by schools receiving Federal funds. It makes no sense to suggest that Congress --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, does that provision apply only when there is a Title IX cause of action?"

    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "No. No."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Oh well, if it doesn't, then it -- then it has validity whether or not you agree with your position."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "That's true but I think it answers the preclusion question that it suggests that Congress has it in mind that there would in fact be section 1983 constitutional litigation involving gender discrimination."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "They thought only in cases where there is no Title IX action."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "They said whenever there is a claim of unconstitutional gender discrimination. I think it's a blanket suggestion Congress made --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Oh, you don't think they mean whether there is a valid claim? Even when there is a claim that isn't allowed under the law?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
    "speech": "I am suggesting that the language says that whenever a claim of gender discrimination is advanced under the Constitution, the Attorney General can intervene. I think what we can draw from that is Congress imagined, it said there would be constitutional litigation involving gender discrimination after they enacted the law. And because that provision was added to the law as part of Title IX, Congress surely contemplated that these suits would involve gender discrimination involving schools. The other sort of clear textual indication which again, again my learned colleague has not really discussed, is the Title VI history of enforcement prior to the enactment of Title IX, which would absolutely -- that there are almost two such dozen decisions, which this Court incorporated into the canon, which suggests it is not only appropriate, it's realistic to think that when Congress was aware of at the time it enacted Title IX. Those decisions clearly indicated there was no preclusion. The language of Title VI and Title IX is identical. There can be no doubt, I think, that Congress would have had it in mind, which, if it is not appropriate in this context as well. One final, very quick point. This is an implied right of action; to suggest that Congress meant to preclude the use of the Constitution to enforce -- preclude section 1983 to enforce the Constitution while leaving it to the courts to imply the alternative remedy, to devise the contours on and the limitations on that remedy, would require -- hypothesize a remarkable leap of faith on the part of Congress. It also would require the most extravagant and speculative reading of Title IX, to understand that it's not only to include private rights of action but to preclude the assertion of express rights of action created by Congress by a language in another statute. If there are no further questions, Your Honor."
