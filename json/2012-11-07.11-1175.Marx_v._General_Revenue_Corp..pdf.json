    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Rule 54(d) provides a standard for an award of costs to a prevailing party that, by the Rule's express terms, does not apply where Federal statute provides otherwise. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act provides otherwise because it states a different rule for awarding costs than does Rule 54(d). Whereas Rule 54(d) gives district courts wide discretion toward cost-prevailing defendants, the FDCPA limits courts' discretion to cases brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment. The text of the Act provides that, on a finding that action was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court may award attorneys' fees of reasonable relation to the work expended and costs. That's a matter of grammar. The unmistakable meaning of that sentence is that an award of costs, like an award of attorney's fees, is subject to the condition that the plaintiff's suit be brought --"

And if -- if the Congress merely wanted to state in that second sentence that fees were available and didn't mean to say anything about costs to defendants, there would have been no reason for Congress to have put costs in that sentence. If --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Well, there are a number of reasons. One is symmetry because they have costs in the part about defendants. And the concern that, well, if we leave out costs for the bad-faith harassing plaintiff, then it -- it may be assumed that they get only attorney's fees and not costs. So the statute's provisions like this may be redundant, but one can see that a drafter might very well want to say, well, we said we're dealing with the defendant costs, we want to put the same thing in with a plaintiff."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ZIEVE",
    "speech": "Well, you've made a few points, and I'll try to address each of them. First, there -- there would be no reason to include costs in the second sentence, just because it was in the first sentence, because the first and second sentences are not parallel. The first sentence makes an award of costs mandatory, and, therefore, it does do some work beyond 54(d). It clearly has -- has a function in that sentence. Whereas the second sentence, the award is subject to the \"may,\" that is, that it's not mandatory that the court award them. If -- if Congress was -- Congress would have no need to be concerned that if it left costs out of the second sentence there would be some negative implication because there are several statutes that mention fees without costs. And GRC has cited no instance in which a court has read a negative implication into that. We, in our reply brief, cited a couple cases that do the opposite. If -- so, therefore, if Congress had omitted costs, left it out of the sentence, then Rule 54(d) would have continued to apply in cases where the defendants. One more example --"

An example of that is 15 U.S.C. 15c(d)(2), which is actions by state attorneys general and provides that the court may award attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant upon a finding that the action was in bad faith."

Why should we read this Act in a way that -- so -- so that a defendant under this Act who can get attorney's fees is worse off with respect to costs than defendants under the other lending legislation, the ones that have only 54(d)? Congress gave defendants something more here. Why -- why would -- why should it be that 54(d) would apply to the lender under the Truth in Lending Act, but not to the lender under -- under this Act?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ZIEVE",
    "speech": "Well, first, Your Honor, the -- Congress' purpose was not simply to -- this isn't just a defendant-friendly provision. Congress had dual purposes in enacting k(a)(3). On the one hand, Congress wanted to deter nuisance suits. But on the other hand, Congress wanted to ensure that meritorious suits by impecunious debtors were not deterred by the prospect that an award of costs would exceed the value of the damage that could be recovered in a successful suit. And the two provisions of k(a)(3) show the line Congress drew -- drew and how it balanced those two objectives. As to the other statutes, the Truth in Lending Act, the Credit Repair Organizations Act, they were enacted at different times by different Congresses. They have different sorts of provisions, some better for plaintiffs, some better for defendants. And -- but this category -- in -- in enacting this statute, Congress emphasized that the widespread and national serious problem of collection abuse that Congress said inflicts substantial suffering and anguish, and noted specifically in the Senate report this Court has cited to in the Jerman case, that consumers, the impecunious -- the people who can't even afford to pay their debts, are the primary enforcers of the statute. The FTC got about 120,000 complaints from consumers about debt collectors last year, more than any other industry. So Congress may reasonably have decided that the primary enforcers of this statute weren't going to be doing that work if they were -- if they were at risk of significant cost awards in cases that have frequently small value. There are other ways, if Congress wanted to preserve Rule 54(d), that it could have done it, that did not happen here. For instance, in 49 U.S.C. 14707(c), Congress has a similar provision about attorney's fees to prevailing -- attorney's fees to prevailing parties, and then states expressly that fee is in addition to costs allowable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Congress didn't do that here. Or Congress could have made it clear that it was not displacing Rule 54(d) as to cost awards by stating that the Court could award attorney's fees as part of the cost, therefore, distinguishing fees and costs. Congress has done that sort of thing frequently, including in a statute that provides for an award in cases of bad faith. I'm looking at 28 U.S.C. 1875, that provides the courts may award fees as part of costs if an action was frivolous or in bad faith. So -- but Congress did none of those things here. Instead, what it did was draft a sentence that links the term \"cost\" to the term \"attorney's fees\" with the conjunction \"and\" and subjects both of those objects of the sentence to the same condition, the condition that the plaintiff suit was brought in bad faith and for purpose of harassment. GRC suggests that the reading -- that the statute the Justice mentioned -- benefits plaintiffs. But what Congress wanted to do here -- I mean, would benefit plaintiff -- what Congress wanted to do was to help defendants. There's actually no legislative history about why this provision was put in there. What we have instead, for what it's worth, is a markup later where this provision is discussed in response to concerns that frivolous suits -- suits should be deterred, and this provision, which is now already in the statute, is discussed as one means of deterring frivolous suits. But the bad faith and harassment standard is the dividing line that Congress drew between nuisance suits and other suits. This case is clearly on the non-nuisance side of the line, and cases on that side of the line are not subject to an award of costs. If the Court has no further questions?"

    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Rule 54(d) expressly codifies in absolute form the well-established principle that a specific provision displaces a more general one. And I think that principle is very helpful here in answering a couple of the questions that have come up. First of all, it makes clear that no express textual conflict is necessary. This Court's never required one, and the specific governs the general cases. That's made even clearer, if you look at the pre-2007 version of the rule, which is meant to be substantively identical to the current version of the rule -- this is at page 12 of the government's brief -- I think that makes quite clear that when, as the FDCPA does, there is a specific statutory provision that addresses an award of costs incident to the judgment, that specific statutory provision prevails over the default rule that Rule 54(d) contains. Another point about the specific governS the general principle is it would apply here, even if the Court believed that Section 1692k(a)(3) covered some type of circumstances that Rule 54(d) and other things don't. And that's made quite clear by this Court's recent eight-Justice unanimous opinion in RadLAX Gateway Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank, in which the Court said -- and I quote -- \"We know of no authority for the proposition that the canon,\" -- they're talking about the specific governs, the general canon -- \"is confined to situations in which the entirety of the specific provision is a\" -- quote -- \"'subset' of the general one.\""

And then when you get to the second sentence of that, it means, and if you're in bad faith, the plaintiff, then the defendant gets attorney's fees. It doesn't really mention costs. That's the background rule.

They're the kind of suits that can be incentivized by a mere $1,000 in statutory damages.

So you have a point -- initially, such as a bona fide good-faith defense or the law being interpreted against them in an area where the law is unclear, they're going to have to pay out of pocket against the plaintiff himself, not the plaintiff's attorney, who are the people the defendant claims is -- are responsible for the abuses they allege in FDCPA cases. This is going to come out via judgment directly against the plaintiff. It's difficult to believe that Congress enacted a provision specifically because it believed the -- the debt collection industry was forcing, among other things, personal bankruptcies and wanted the kind of plaintiffs who were going to be in a position to enforce the FDCPA to have to face the risk of incurring thousands of dollars in costs if they lose a suit that they bring in good faith.

Nothing in this -- this case -- I don't mean to trivialize it, but there's only one other statute, that Electronic Fund Transfers Act, that talks about the court shall award attorney's fees and costs if there is bad faith. And there is one other statute that says, for a prevailing defendant, the court may award costs if the lawsuit is frivolous. And in those three significant ways, I think it shows why we win, and that's a statute they relied on to say it's just like our statute, on page 18 of their brief, page 29 of our brief. First, it only refers to costs. The statute is about costs. Our statute is about attorney's fees being the main event upon a finding of bad faith. Second, it mentions prevailing defendants; ours doesn't. And, third, which I think is missing from the entire 30 minutes that you heard, their argument is plaintiff -- Congress sat down and wanted to incentivize frivolous suits and nonfrivolous -- nonfrivolous suits alike. At least in the Pipeline Safety Act, Congress said, if it's frivolous, the defendant gets its costs. Here --"

What \"and costs\" does is it -- basically, the word \"and\" is being used to mean \"in addition to.\" \"And\" means \"in addition to.\" And so what Congress is saying is, when courts fee shift -- attorney's fee shift upon a finding of bad faith, courts additionally may award"

And they're -- inexplicably, somehow, by trying to make them better off, made them worse than every other creditor that they serve and immunized these plaintiffs from the universal risk of cost shifting that every other litigant has to face.

This doesn't -- the fact that this doesn't refer to prevailing defendants speaks volumes that what was not on Congress' mind, was Rule 54. What was on Congress' mind is victimized debt collectors who were sued in bad faith. Now, I understand this is a pro-plaintiff statute, but this would be extraordinary to think that they gave them attorney's fees when they -- but it's basically saying -- this is a -- this is a defendant who went to trial and won, was law-abiding, didn't do anything wrong, and Congress in that situation said, not only might -- might not the suit be -- be -- have merit or good faith, it might have even been frivolous. When under Rule 54 -- again, this is what I find so mystifying about this case. If the petitioner thought, oh, I had a really hard case in the law, or, oh, I'm really poor, she could have asked for discretionary relief. Instead, the lawyer went into court and said, I have a recent Ninth Circuit decision, and I don't have to pay costs at all."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Because -- because, again, Rule 54 is not preemption -- a field preemption. It's saying if Congress intended to displace -- the proviso, unless otherwise provided, it was recognition that other statutes might displace Rule 54. And if you look at all the statutes that we cite on pages 19 and 20, they actually do prohibit costs. And then if you look at the statutes on pages 24 and 25, where, time and time again, Congress has said, a prevailing party may recover attorney's fees and costs. Well, the \"and costs,\" in their view, I guess those statutes are inexplicable. I mean, it's clearly they're redundant, and they overlap with Rule 54. They don't displace it. And even the practice guides that we cite on page 22, which is basically Wright and Miller and Moore, say something that merely overlaps with Rule 54 doesn't displace the court's discretion. And again, I think you have to ask yourself, what was Congress doing? To me, this is -- this is a -- the attorney's fees are the main show, it goes with bad faith. Congress was not thinking about Rule 54, and I think you can be quite confident Congress was not thinking, we want plaintiff lawyers to go around saying, not only Congress, but the government wanted us to file frivolous suits."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "You might be right, but suppose Congress wasn't thinking about Rule 54. Suppose it didn't occur to the drafters what Rule 54 said or what the default provision was. They just wrote a statute about fees and costs. And then -- it doesn't really matter whether they were thinking about Rule 54 or not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Yes, if you -- right. And so there's like that Oncale case, with same-sex harassment, Congress can write a very -- can write a plain language provision, and regardless of what Congress intended, if the language covers it, that's tough, we're going to construe it. That's your law. This is not that. This -- this doesn't say anything about prevailing parties. This is talking about bad faith and attorney's fees. It doesn't say a court can't act in the absence of bad faith. It doesn't say anything about prevailing parties. It doesn't reveal any intent to displace it, especially when you compare it with all the other statutes, you look at the history -- sorry."

    "speech": "No, because it says expressly, in a case of successful action, it talks about prevailing plaintiffs. And then it says if there's -- to me, it's just -- it's natural when you just read it in light of sort of common sense in context in what Congress was doing. If a plaintiff files in bad faith, the court is empowered and emboldened -- it's like a neon light -- courts, you have authority to award attorney's fees and costs."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",

It's an extraordinary event to get attorney's fees, and it's an extraordinary event not to get costs.

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",

Now, there's one statute that might not be, the pipeline safety one. And so the question is: Do we think that Congress actually tried to displace a court's authority under that statute? And that's a statute that just says a court may award costs if a lawsuit is frivolous. This one just doesn't say that. You at least -- even if you don't think of it as magic language or an explicit statement, the fact that Congress repeatedly has used explicit language casts considerable doubt that this was done by mere implication. And then you look at the fact that it doesn't mention prevailing parties. It's talking about bad faith, it has attorney's fees, what was Congress doing, you look at the legislative history. It shows that it was -- it was trying to make them, better, off than a class of defendants, but their view inexplicably makes them worse off.

  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Yeah. The question, though, was, in the case of any successful action when, obviously, they prevailed to begin with, so the question is whether that's superfluous. But the whole provision overlaps with the Court's inherent authority. And I know it hasn't come up, but I just think it's strange that it says, for the purposes of bad faith and harassment, Congress was obviously using belt and suspenders there, so it's not surprising that Congress added \"and costs\" here. If you look at Rule 54 -- let me just say one other thing, Justice Kagan -- if you look at Rule 54, it also says, \"unless the statute provides otherwise, costs other than attorney's fees.\" So why -- they didn't have to say that because, in the next provision, it talks about attorney's fees. They just -- they wanted to make clear for whatever reason or maybe they just wrote some really excess, redundant, silly language, but they said costs, meaning anything that's not costs -- it's just that Congress sometimes uses these. And I guess this was the honey and peanut butter thing, is that a lot of fee-shifting statutes talk about both attorney's fees and costs. And so they went together and -- they also mentioned it. Obviously, it's different. I agree that there's a verb in the first sentence that's mandatory, so it trumps Rule 54. But with respect to the two objects, Congress was already thinking about attorney's fees and costs anyway, and so there's nothing wrong with them saying, in addition to the attorney's fees that you can get in bad faith, once you calculate the attorney's fees reasonable in relation to the work performed, you also get costs. And the only thing I would say is -- when we define \"and\" as in addition to, they seem to think that that was an extraordinary reading of the word \"and,\" citing something -- from something called dictionary.com, and if you just went to dictionary.com, which I had not done before, and you type in \"and,\" the first definition is \"in addition to.\" If there are no further questions --"

And, in fact, in instances in which -- which defendants have asked for fees and costs in FDCPA cases based on bad faith, they do always come at the end of the case, which also shows this is not a misconduct provision. If it were a misconduct provision, it wouldn't just be about bad faith in bringing the action.

I mean, I think, at some points, GRC and Ms. Blatt here today asked you to just ignore that \"and costs\" exists in the sentence at all, although the fact that this sentence is not replicated numerous times throughout the U.S. Code doesn't seem to me reason for ignoring it, but, rather, for giving effect to it. Congress obviously thought it was doing something when it enacted this sentence and when it added these words to the statute. It does not say, \"The court may award fees in addition to costs\" or \"as part of costs\" or \"together with costs.\" Again, grammatically, it treats the two terms, \"fees and costs,\" on a par --"
