    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Controlled Substances Act prohibits the distribution of marijuana outside federally authorized research programs because Congress, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have each determined that there is no currently accepted medical use for the drug, and it has a high potential for abuse. The statute also recognizes that new information might come to light that would justify less restrictive controls so it establishes administrative procedure for changing the classification and the restrictions for marijuana and other controlled substances. That statutory scheme leaves no room for the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative to distribute marijuana without the approval of the Attorney General under a claim of medical necessity, and it leaves no room for a court to consider such a claim as a basis for refusing to enjoin the marijuana operations of the cooperative. The Ninth Circuit's ruling in effect authorizes the operation of marijuana pharmacies outside the safeguards and restrictions of the Act and undermines the ability of the Act to protect the public from hazardous drugs. The common law defense of necessity can sometimes authorize a person to violate the law in order to avoid a more serious harm but it doesn't apply here for three reasons. First, because the legislature has already balanced the harms and come to a different conclusion. Congress anticipated there would be claims of medical uses for controlled substances and provided an administrative procedure for evaluating them allowing trial judges and juries to redetermine that balance in individual cases would undermine the procedure established by Congress. Second, because the defense has no application because the co-ops members and the co-op itself have alternatives to violating the criminal law. They have substantive alternatives, other lawful medications including a synthetic form of the active ingredient of marijuana."

You have a footnote in your brief, footnote 11, that describes some of the situations there that gives the impression that this whole case is a sham, that it's really just a front for using marijuana and I'm wondering if -- and your argument you're just making now suggests there are always alternatives. Do you think we should take the case on the assumption that there really are some people for whom this is a medical necessity or should we assume that there are no such people."

Am I wrong in thinking that there has been quite a bit of this going on in the medical profession."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "The record doesn't reflect and I don't know how much of it has been going on. I think there are two things to say in response to that though, one is that the agencies charged with evaluating the medical uses here have ongoing studies and have so far concluded that there are -- that the particular use that you're describing is best served -- there's now an extract of marijuana that's been on the market -- been available and been put on the lower schedule than schedule one for 15 or 16 years which is this Marinol and efforts are being made to find other methods of administering the pure substance and determining whether it has the effect that's described."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Ms. Underwood, these judgments made by the federal agencies, the FDA and the DEA, I think they take into account the overall public interest, I mean, they -- I'm not sure that they have come to the conclusion that marijuana would never ever, ever be helpful to someone who's in extreme pain. I think what they've probably done is made the judgment that the chances of its being that helpful and not being replaceable by something else are so slim that in view of the abuses to which general permission for its use would lead it's best that it be proscribed, is that an inaccurate determination on my part? Could you really say that there has been a determination by the federal government that marijuana is never medically useful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Well the determination that's been made is that the medical utility of it has not been established which is a slightly different way of putting it but there is a separate determination the FDA makes determinations as it does with substances that aren't on the controlled substances list, that is there are new drugs that are proposed all the time which might possibly be useful and aren't authorized for use until after tests satisfy the FDA that the drug is safe and effective for use and marijuana has not passed that screen. There is an additional screen for controlled substances that is in addition to considering and the scheduling decision takes into account not just medical utility but also the potential for abuse, but the FDA's role in it, the Health and Human Services role in it is just to assess or it has a role in simply assessing the medical evidence and has concluded that to date there is insufficient reason to think that it is a safe and effective drug although there are continuing research projects going on to try and pursue the anecdotal information that it is sometimes helpful or that components of marijuana are sometimes helpful."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Ms. Underwood, it would help me, General Underwood, if you would tell me why the word preemption doesn't appear in the government's brief because I took the simple-minded approach looking at this, Congress says this is a schedule one drug and California says you can have it if you've got a note from a doctor that says you have a migraine headache. Why isn't the federal law that says this is the schedule one drug preemptive, it must have been with some thought that you didn't use that word."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Well the California law doesn't actually purport to authorize the distribution of marijuana with a doctor's note, it provides a defense to California law. Now it is true that an effort is being made here to invoke the judgment behind that law as in support of the claim of medical necessity, but California didn't purport to create a defense to federal law as it couldn't have if it had tried it would have been presumably preemptive -- preempted. But it's perfectly possible to comply with both California law and federal law. There isn't that kind of conflict here."

And I should say that the decision of the federal agencies not to accept the kind of anecdotal evidence that you're suggesting is a decision that the federal -- the Food and Drug Administration has made again not just in the controlled substance area but it has concluded that the anecdotal reports of individuals are a basis for research, a reason to conduct research and not a basis for authorizing the use of a drug or changing its scheduling."

If he said that would he be abusing his discretion."

      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "There's a reason why civil injunctive enforcement is authorized and why it's appropriate. I don't think it's for the court to second-guess the prosecutor but there is a reason. The civil injunctive remedy in this statute was patterned on a similar provision in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and the purpose of that was to provide a way to resolve legal disputes without the harshness of a criminal prosecution. This is just that kind of dispute, open and ongoing violations of the law designed to test its statute with the California state law in the background, once -- there's no reason to think that once a court resolves the question that -- holds, for instance, that there is no medical necessity defense or holds that in any event whatever medical necessity defense there might be doesn't authorize the operations of marijuana pharmacies as in this case, that the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative won't comply with the law."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

If the trial court in fact were to conclude that that is the reason and that's why the injunctive remedy was being invoked, would that be a good reason for the court to say it is not certainly a necessary and maybe not an appropriate use of equity to give the government an alternative to six month or less sentences for criminal contempt in order, in effect, to make a criminal statute enforceable which in the normal criminal course is not.

Let me come to your perception that it would be unthinkable that it could be up to the U.S. attorney whether to bring a criminal action or not, but a federal judge could not decide that he won't issue an injunction using the same sort of discretion, why is that so unthinkable?

In those cases the person was either in compliance by the time it got to court or else the court said, look, I won't issue an injunction, Romero-Barcelo, but you have to go get a permit.

      "speech": "Because in one way it said, the violations had been cured as promptly as they'd been called the attention that Hecht's had put in a new staff to try to do things. I mean, it's quite different from your case where you say we're going to just go ahead and do this."

      "speech": "But there wasn't any failure to rule on what the law is in both of those cases. The judge adjudicated the case and said you did wrong, but I'm not going to slap you with an injunction because in the Bowles case it was inadvertent and I have ever reason to believe you won't do it again. I didn't get from any of the cases you cite authority that a judge would have to say, I'm just not going to participate in the adjudication of this case."
    },
    {

      "speaker": "UELMEN",
      "speech": "Well, it's not a blanket defense, Your Honor, in is the sense that every Respondent who wishes to take advantage of it is going to have to show that they are suffering from a serious medical condition, that they face imminent harm of death or blindness, that cannabis will alleviate their condition and that they have no reasonable alternative, that everybody alternative available has been tried and found ineffective for them so --"

      "speaker": "UELMEN",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

He's not required to conclude you have a serious condition and you may die or go blind if you don't have this medicine, all he's got to say is, this will help you, here's a prescription, go get it and take it.

Now you would extend this also to the person who provides it to any persons who was in such needs."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It's one thing to say that a state law requiring a prescription for a bunch of drugs can be violated in an emergency. It's another thing to say that a schedule one law which says there's no useful medical purpose for this drug shall be violated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UELMEN",
      "speech": "Well the government's position actually is that there is no necessity defense for any drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and I think it's very important that the court realize that the reason we're here is because the government shut down the only program that could accommodate these patients. For many years they provided Cannabis and still do for eight patients who come within this medical necessity criteria, and they closed that program down in 1992 and they say in their brief we can do it because we're the Federal Government. You can't do it because you're a private citizen. Well, we're saying if you won't do it, we can do it because the only justification you have to do it is the same necessity defense that we're asserting and the way the necessity defense works is if a patient comes in and says I have to have this to live and the court says well, the government has a program. They'll give it to you. Therefore you have a reasonable alternative. You don't have a necessity defense and that's exactly what happened in United States versus Burton the sixth circuit case. A patient with glaucoma comes into court, asserts a necessity defense. The court says you have a reasonable alternative and that patient then goes to the government and they put him on the compassionate IND program and provide him with cannabis. Well, now the government decides we're not going to operate that program anymore and we say if you're not going to do it then we can because the only justification you had to do it was this medical necessity concept. There is no authorization within the Controlled Substances Act for the government to give Cannabis as medicine to patients and when this program was examined by Congress, and I especially invite the Court to carefully look at the hearings held by Congress on the therapeutic uses of marijuana in schedule one drugs. The way this program was explained to Congress in 1980 was we are providing Cannabis for medical use by these patients and the reason we're doing it is because of compassion and because of the therapeutics. That was the explanation given by Congress."

      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "A medical necessity defense is foreclosed here not only by the fact that Congress contemplated and rejected it and not only by the fact that alternatives are available but also because any necessity defense is a response to unusual and unforeseen circumstances. It couldn't possibly, the common law necessity defense couldn't possibly authorize an ongoing enterprise designed to stand ready and provide supplies to people who might show up with their own individual claims of medical necessity. There's no constitutional problem with the statutory procedure for deciding when and if medical uses for a drug exist where with -- and the court held in Weinberger against Hynson that it's perfectly appropriate for the FDA to reject anecdotal evidence and insist on controlled studies. There's also no problem with protecting sick people from charlatans or unsafe and ineffective drugs as this Court held in Rutherford in dealing with Laetrile the claim that there was a right to use Laetrile. Respondents in this case have never presented their claims, the claims they're making here, to the FDA. They've never sought review of the classification of marijuana in schedule one, they've never sought access to, at least so far as the record reflects, to the clinical trials that are ongoing right now to deal with synthetic manufacture of components of marijuana, and on the remedy for contempt at the petition appendix at 25 A and again at 37 A it's perfectly clear that the government was not seeking fines or incarceration, that the judge wasn't contemplating fines or incarceration but just evicting and padlocking, closing down this business."
