Our point is that, in three separate respects, the national tradition of the United States and our Constitution does not contemplate that a sovereign would adjudicate cases in this fashion. And I want to briefly identify the three, if I could. First, the Constitution contemplates the availability of a neutral forum for suits against noncitizens, and by analogy, noncitizens as you say, Justice Ginsburg, have always been able to remove a case from State to Federal court. The United States at the time of incorporation could not have accepted that non­Indians would not be able to remove to a neutral forum. Second, the Constitution contemplates that this Court will be the one Supreme Court, and State court rulings on questions of Federal law have, of course, always been reviewable in this Court."

My ­­ what ­­ and, Justice Breyer, I'm not losing sight of your question ­­ what the ­­ what Oliphant and other precedents of this Court say is that the Tribes have the sovereign authority that is consistent with the overriding sovereignty of the United States. And the point I was trying to make is that our legal tradition understands that there will be certain basic protections. And remember, two of the things I'm identifying in the Constitution are not specific to the States: The supremacy of the Constitution ­­ but the Constitution does not apply in tribal courts ­­ and also the supremacy of this Court as the one Supreme Court, which is not available. Now, Justice Scalia, those are features of our national legal tradition, and those features existed at the time of incorporation of the Tribes into the United States. And my point is that Congress could not have believed that, if State courts couldn't do these things, that the tribal courts would be superior. Now, Justice Breyer, you said, well, what's wrong? Two things. I want to say that there are some things wrong even in the context of a tribe like this one. For example, we have a Federal claim against the due process ­­ a due process claim against the putative damage award in ­­ that's asked for in this case, and that would be entirely unreviewable in this case. Now, you contemplate the prospect that we would collaterally attack the judgment. A few things about that. The first is, if that's going to be serious, if we are really going to have a serious regime of collateral attacks where you would just assess whether or not the tribal court ruling is consistent with due process. That is hardly treating the tribal courts as sovereigns. Imagine a Federal district court ruling could be overturned by a circuit court in Mississippi. We wouldn't say that that was an actual sovereign ruling. And the second is that that review system is extremely rare. The Respondents identify a single case, one Ninth Circuit case in which a tribal ruling was overturned. What the Federal courts have done is afford enormous respect and only overturned rulings of tribal courts or foreign courts that are way out of bounds. My point is that the rule that's contemplated by the Constitution is not one of being way out of bounds, it is simply that we have a right to due process; that this Court will be the Supreme Court, that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. And when that is not true in the courts that we are talking about, even the best­managed, most modern courts, when those rules simply don't apply, that is not consistent ­­"

Because when you talk about the regulatory matters discussed in the first Montana exception like taxation and licensing, those are things that Congress has left to the Tribes. But the Indian Civil Rights Act, like Public Law 280, like the Courts of Indian Offenses, like the Indian deprivation system shows that the United States has actually been deeply involved in the tribal judiciary. It has not treated tribal adjudication of civil claims as something that belongs to the Tribes. It's quite different. The United States obviously did not regard the Tribes' judiciary as something that is purely a part of their government, because time and again, it has micromanaged them. And, Justice Breyer, I do want to point out another example of that, and that is the Violence Against Women Act. There, we see the right way of doing this, and that Congress has developed systems that say if this tribal judiciary is a good one which affords due process, then it has jurisdiction over cases.

We disagree, but we understand the argument. My point is that in these circumstances, what the Tribes do is, as a condition of operating on the Reservation, they call for not just what you describe, which is the application of tribal law, but a consent to the forum.

I'm thinking instead, Justice Ginsburg, of take the follow­on to what Montana describes, that is, a licensing regulation or a taxation regulation. We believe that if the Tribe went into tribal court to enforce those measures, that would be a sovereign action and it would be susceptible of the Montana exception.

So yes, I understand that they are dicta, but it is dicta of the most persuasive sort. It is the unbroken rule of this Court, frankly, that in all of these cases, this Court has said there is presumptively jurisdiction. And indeed, the exhaustion cases would make no sense otherwise because twice this Court said, in tort cases, in Iowa Mutual and National Farmers Union, this Court said you've got to go to tribal court and exhaust your remedies. And Justice Scalia, if the rule in those cases was, hey, tribal courts don't have jurisdiction, they would have done what you did in your opinion in Hicks, because at page 369 you said, quote, \"Since it's clear tribal courts lack jurisdiction over State officials, adherence to the tribal exhaustion requirement would serve no purpose.\""

    {
      "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
      "speech": "Thank you. I have three points, and they all happen to relate to questions by Justice Scalia. The first deals with the question of whether tribal tort law, the last point by my friend, is a form of regulation. And we have cases like Regal, we have the preemption context in which the Court has said something like that. But the big difference is that that is about the substance of the tort law, not the forum where it occurs. Imagine a case like Regal. We would say that the application of State tort law was a form of regulation. But if that was heard in a Federal district court, on removal, on ­­ in diversity jurisdiction, or on a Federal question, it would still be State regulation. So my point here is: The most that can establish is that the substantive tort law's regulation, not the forum. We do not agree that that's so, but it would be the only thing that they could get from that argument. What would remain is the difference of adjudication from the substance of the tort law. The second point, as Justice Scalia, I will line up my friend's committee reports against the text of the Constitution. We do not have an answer to the fact that our constitutional tradition has three points in it that are inconsistent with this form of adjudication. And two of them are not specific to the States. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land in the United States. This Court is the Supreme Court of the United States. That's not true just with respect to the States, that is a bedrock ­­ those are bedrock principles. Neither of them are true here. We also think that our tradition is that you have access to a neutral court. I understand; I accept that Congress implemented that in a removal statute that does not apply here. But my point is that Congress could not have understood that it was a necessary incident of sovereignty when the States were subject to removal jurisdiction at the time the tribes came into the United States. It is historically implausible to believe that in all three of these respects, when the tribes came into the United States, they were in a superior position to the States. And we know that from one other example, and that is also at the time ­­ so these are the judiciary acts of 1789 and '90, Congress made the judgments of State courts enforceable by full faith and credit, but not tribal courts. And it cannot be, then, that it thought the tribal courts were better than the State courts. And it does relate, Mr. Chief Justice, to your point that the Court has never held, despite dictum, that a nonmember is subject to adjudication in a tribal court. Because if you haven't done it till now, it is, I think, respectfully implausible to believe that Congress thought it was true in 1880, at a time when the tribes had much less developed legal systems. My final point is ­­ relates to administrability. And you have been offered two alternatives. The other side says we have a test about nexus and foreseeability. I have a standard that says, write it down in a contract. My rule is infinitely more administrable because the other side imagines that people will constantly be running to State and Federal court saying this nexus wasn't strong enough; I didn't know when I mailed this to the Tribe, or this form of tribal tort law is not quite foreseeable enough for me to know what the rule is. That is a bad system. You have said, time and again, that jurisdictional rules need to be known ahead of time, and they need to be clear. And I don't understand the answer to our point that it is disrespectful of the sovereignty that is asserted here. If the Tribal Supreme Court can constantly be overruled by a circuit court in Mississippi, are we seriously treating it as an independent sovereign? That ­­"
