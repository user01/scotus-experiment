    "speech": "Mr.  Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court: Just one week ago, this Court vacated the Florida Supreme Court's November 21 revision of Florida's election code, which had changed statutory deadlines, severely limited the discretion of the State's chief election officer, changed the meaning of words such as shall and may into shall not and may not, and authorized extensive standardless and unequal manual ballot recounts in selected Florida counties. Just four days later, without a single reference to this Court's December 4 ruling, the Florida Supreme Court issued a new, wholesale post-election revision of Florida's election law.  That decision not only changed Florida election law yet again, it also explicitly of federal law."

Legislatures, of course can use the executive branch in the states, and it may use in its discretion the judicial branch. Secretary of State as the executive branch is also given considerably  -- considerable other responsibilities, when but -- and to a certain extent, especially in connection with the contest phase of the election, certain authority was explicitly vested in the Circuit Court of the State of Florida, which is the trial court."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, this is serious business because it indicates how unmoored, untethered the legislature is from the constitution of its own state, and it makes every state law issue a federal question.  Can you use this theory and say that it creates some sort of presumption of validity that allows us to see whether this court or the executive has gone too far?  Is that what you're arguing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "No, I would say this with respect -- it would have been a perfectly logical, and if you read the statutes, a perfectly logical, especially in the context of a presidential election, to stop this process at the circuit court, and not provide layers of appeal because given the time deadline, especially in the context of this election, the way it's played out, there is not time for an appellate court. sufficient rather than to raise an appropriate federal question, rather than to say there's no judicial review here in Florida."

  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "I think that I don't disagree with that except to the extent that I think that the argument we presented and amplified on in our briefs is a good argument, it's a solid argument.  It is consistent with the way the code is set up, and it's particularly consistent with the timetable that's available in a presidential election.  However  --."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it's pretty close.  You can say it could be interpreted that way by the Florida Supreme Court, I suppose.  You think it must be?  Or is your point that even in close calls we have to revisit the Florida Supreme Court's opinion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "No, I think that it is particularly argument, you rely on Leser v. Garnett and Hawke v. Smith, and is it critical to your Article II argument that we read the word legislature as narrowly, I mean the power granted the legislature as similar to that granted in Article V of the Constitution, as those cases dealt with?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr.  Olson, with respect to the role of judicial review, you rely very much on the McPherson of the McPherson decision and its recitation of the legislative history or the history of legislation and acts by state legislatures to comply with it make it quite clear that the power is vested in the legislature itself."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But there was a decision by the court reviewing, which we affirmed.  Under your jurisdiction theory as I see it, there was no role for the Michigan Supreme Court to play because Article II, section 1 gives the authority exclusively to the legislature, and the legislature has not provided for judicial review especially for that measure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "I think the context of that case is different, and that it's entirely possible for the Court to have come to the conclusion it did in that case and we believe that case is compelling for the principle that we are arguing in this case, that there is no, the entire McPherson itself, it refers to what is done by the legislative power under state constitutions as they exist. This is not the most clearly written opinion, and yet three times, they refer to the legislative power as constrained by the state's constitution."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "And I think that that's important. I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg.  It's not the most clearly written opinion.  But I think that in the context of that case, the relationship of the legislature to the Constitution in that case and the way that power was exercised, that ought to be reconciled with what we are urging the Court today, that a wholesale revision and abandonment of the legislative authority can't be turned over, especially sub silentio, by a legislature simply because there is a constitution. There is a constitution in every state.  There issues in the case as to whether it was a major revision? Your opponents disagree, and I know you rely very heavily on the dissenting opinion in the Florida Supreme Court, but which opinion do we normally look to for issues of state law?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, I think that the dissenting opinion and the two dissenting opinions are very informative.  We are relying on what the court did.  If one looks at, for example, the recount provisions, before this revision under Florida law, manual recount under the protest provisions were discretionary, completely discretionary, conducted by canvassing boards during the protest phase of the election, post-election period, pursuant to legislatively defined procedures as to who could be present, for seven days after the election with respect to all ballots in a county, that was mandatory and hoc judicially established procedures rather than the procedures that are articulated quite carefully in the statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, on ad hoc judicially created procedures, the point of subsection 8 of 168.  I mean, once we get into the contest phase, subsection 8 gives at least to the circuit court, leaving aside the question of appellate jurisdiction, about as broad a grant to fashion orders as I can imagine going into a statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, to read that, to read that provision and it's written quite broadly, but to read that, one has to read that in the context of the entire statutory framework.  If one reads it the way the Florida Supreme Court did, the entire process is tilted on its head.  Where there used to be the decision that was in the election officials, it now becomes in the court.  All of once you get into the contest phase from the protest phase."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "But that's only if you untether 168 entirely from the statute and the steam by which the protest phase takes place over a period of seven to 10 days in the context of this election, and the contest phase occurs over the next four weeks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It may well be and I'll grant you for the sake of argument that there would be a sound interpretive theory that in effect would coordinate these two statutes, 166 and 168, in a way that the Florida Supreme Court has not done.  But that's a question of Florida Supreme Court statutory construction and unless you can convince us, it seems to me, that in construing 168, which is what we are concerned with now, and its coordination or lack of coordination with 166, the Florida the most recent case.  But I don't quite see where you cross the line into saying that this has simply become a nonjudicial act.  It may or may not be good statutory construction, but I don't see it as a nonjudicial act."

    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "It is, it is, we submit an utter revision of the timetables, the allocation."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "That's correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And what your argument boils down to, I think, is that they have insufficiently considered 168, I'm sorry, that they have insufficiently considered 166 in construing 168, and you may be right, but you have no textual hook in 168 to say untethered timetables imply in effect a nonjudicial act."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "We are not just saying timetables. set by a safe harbor statute for the guidance of Congress and it's a deadline that has nothing to do with any text in 168."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, I believe that the Supreme Court of Florida certainly thought that it was construing, it certainly said so this time, that it was construing the applicability of Section 5 and it was expressing the hope that what it was doing was not risking or jeopardizing the conclusive effect -- ."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And it took that into consideration in fashioning its orders under subsection 8."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "And we submit that it incorrectly interpreted and construed federal law in doing that because what they have inevitably done is provide a process whereby it is virtually impossible, if not completely impossible, and I think it is completely"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Because we argued, and I believe that there is a very firm basis for saying that that process already had violated Article II of the Constitution.  It was also already throwing in jeopardy compliance with Section 5 of Title 3 because the laws had been changed in a number of different respects and we have recited them.  The timetables are important."

In the Fourth District Court of Appeal, that candidate lost by three votes, and he went during the protest phase to the canvassing board and asked for a manual recount to be done and they exercised their discretion and said no.  And in that case, there is a discussion.  He raised the argument that there were ballots in there that had hanging chads that is created by going and picking through different statutes. For instance, the clear intent standard comes from a statute that deals with a damaged ballot where you have to create, to put through the machine, a substitute ballot, and there are very clear directions as to what to do to preserve the integrity of the ballot.  And the Beckstrom case, which you will no doubt hear much about as the argument proceeds, dealt with that kind of situation. There was a manual recount there; the court did not pass on the propriety of it.  The issue was if the election officials took ballots and marked over the ballots instead of creating a separate substitute ballot, they took that ballot and marked it over so it could go through an optical scanner, which the court found to be gross negligence whether they would discount the votes.

They require that you find voter intent with respect to a damaged ballot.  They also vested in the canvassing board, and the canvassing board is composed of a certain, a defined group of officials, a county judge, the election thought that although you don't take into account improperly marked ballots for purposes of determining whether there will be a manual recount, I had thought that when there is a manual recount for some other reason, and you come across ballots of this sort that you can count them, that for that purpose you can decide oh, look at, there is a hanging chad.  The machine didn't count it. It's clear what the intent of the voter are.  We'll count it.  Is that not correct?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "I think, Your Honor, and obviously this Court and the Florida Supreme Court is the best interpreter of that opinion, but I think a reasonable interpretation of that opinion is to say that what the Florida Supreme Court meant by cognizant is that it was taking into account the desire to get the election over in time so that everyone would have the advantage of the safe harbor.  I think that goes throughout the opinion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, the language used in 3 USC section 5 is garden variety language so far as the courts are concerned.  We can determine whether or not there is a new law or an old law.  That's completely susceptible of judicial interpretation, is it not? Supreme Court did I think in its opinion is to say that in terms of looking at how to remedy the situation, it needed to be cognizant of the fact that there was this federal deadline out there that was going to affect Florida's electors if that deadline was not met."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "Yes, but what I would say is that whether or not there is a new law, that is whether there's a change in the enactment in the language of the statute or the constitution, is something that has to be decided in the initial instance by the Florida Supreme Court interpreting Florida law."
  },

  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",

    "speech": "You mean by shortening it?"

  {

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",

The Florida Supreme Court said that you had to look as to whether there was substantial compliance.  In that case three days was found to be substantial compliance.  That was a situation in which there was telephone notice, which was not adequate for certification.  That was then followed up  --."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But if we assume the legislature would run contrary to the new law prohibition in the court does it, it isn't.  Both would have to require  -- you have to pre-clear judicial rulings and see whether they make new laws, don't you?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "What I'm saying, Your Honor, is that if the supreme court had rewritten the law the way you hypothesized the legislature rewrote the law, it might very well be a difference.  What I'm saying is that the Florida Supreme Court did not rewrite the law in the way that you hypothesized.  What the Florida Supreme Court was confronted with was a statute, and that statute said that -- and it was the later passed statute, we get back into the may and the shall. The may statute was the later passed statute, and so what the Florida Supreme Court said is we have to look at what is the criteria by which you decide whether you may ignore and will ignore these returns, and what the quite a bit different from extending the period generally and for all submissions for, you know  -- but if I could -- I'm not sure that you and Justice Kennedy are disagreeing on very much.  It seems to me you acknowledge that if the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of this law were not a reasonable interpretation, just not one that would pass normal judicial muster, then it would be just like the legislature writing a new law, but your contention here is that this is a reasonable interpretation of Florida law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Right. mean that a court has to, in interpreting a legislative act, give special deference to the legislature's choices insofar as a presidential election is concerned?  I would think that is a tenable view anyway, and especially in light also of the concerns about section 5."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "I think, Your Honor, that if the Florida Supreme Court in interpreting the Florida law, I think the Court needs to take into account the fact that the legislature does have this plenary power.  I think when the Florida Supreme Court does that, if it does so within the normal ambit of judicial interpretation, that is a subject for Florida's Supreme Court to take."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You are responding as though there were no special burden to show some deference to legislative choices.  In this one context, not when courts review laws generally for general elections, but in the Supreme Court to this Court's remand in the case a week ago.  It just seemed to kind of bypass it and assume that all those changes and deadlines were just fine and they would go ahead and adhere to them, and I found that troublesome."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "Your Honor, if I could, one of the things that was argued from the beginning by Governor Bush's counsel and accepted by the Florida Supreme Court was that the protest statute and the contest statute were very separate procedures.  There was a time limit in the protest contest prior to certification, but there is no time limit in the contest statute process, which is what we are in now, and I think that the Florida Supreme Court was focusing on this contest period, which is what is really before, was before them and is before you, and in the contest -- Palm Beach, there was a trial.  There was a contest trial. It is the appeal from that trial that is before this Court.  And the petitioners don't really refer to what's in the trial record but in that trial record, there was undisputed evidence that the votes that were counted there were valid legal votes.  Now, whether those votes were counted as part of the certification process or not  --."

That's what every contest proceeding is.  And what the Florida Supreme Court was saying after this trial is yes, you proved that this certification is missing 250 votes."

The standard is whether or not the intent of the voter is reflected by the ballot.  That is the uniform standard throughout the State of Florida."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's very general.  It runs throughout the law.  Even a dog knows the difference in being stumbled over and being kicked.  We know it, yes. In this case -- in this case what we are concerned with is an intent that focuses on this little piece of paper called a ballot, and you would say that from the standpoint of equal protection clause, could each county give their own interpretation to what intent means, so long as they are in good faith and with some reasonable basis finding intent? whether it is in the criminal law, an administrative practice, whether it is in local government, whenever somebody is coming to government  --."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But here you have something objective.  You are not just reading a person's mind.  You are looking at a piece of paper, and the supreme courts in the states of South Dakota and the other cases have told us that you will count this hanging by two corners or one corner, this is susceptible of a uniform standard, and yet you say it can vary from table to table within the same county."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "With respect, it is susceptible of a more specific standard, and some states, like Texas, have given a statutory definition, although even in Texas, there is a catch-all that says anything else that clearly specifies the intent of the voter.  So even, even where seem to have a situation here in which there is a subcategory of ballots in which we are assuming for the sake of argument since we know no better that there is no genuinely subjective indication beyond what can be viewed as either a dimple or a hanging chad, and there is a general rule being applied in a given county that an objective intent or an intent on an objective standard will be inferred, and that objective rule varies, we are told, from county to county.  Why shouldn't there be one objective rule for all counties and if there isn't, why isn't it an equal protection violation?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but in jury to jury cases, we assume that there is not an overall objective standard that answers all questions definitively.  We are assuming that there is detail that cannot be captured by an objective rule. The assumption of this question, and I think, I think it's behind what's bothering Justice Kennedy, Justice Breyer, me and others, is, we're assuming there's a category in which there just is no other  -- there is no subjective appeal.  All we have are certain physical characteristics.  Those physical characteristics we are told are being treated differently from county to county. In that case, where there is no subjective counter indication, isn't it a denial of equal protection to allow that variation?"

If, if we respond to this issue and we believe that the issue is at least sufficiently raised to require a response, we've got to make the assumption, I think at this stage, that there may be such variation, and I think we would have a responsibility to tell the Florida courts what to do about it. On that assumption, what would you tell them to do about it?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, all right.  That causes me some problems that pertain not just to the equal protection aspect of this, but to the rationality of the supreme court's opinion, because the supreme court opinion on the one hand said, as you've just repeated, that there was to be de novo review by the circuit judge in Leon County. But on the other hand, it said that he had to accept the counts that had come out of Palm Beach and Broward rational."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",

I think it was Palm Beach and Miami-Dade, because Broward was not part of the trial because Broward had been certified, and with respect to Miami-Dade and Palm Beach, I do not believe that there is evidence in the record that that was a different standard.  I don't  -- and there's no finding at the trial court that that was a different standard. Indeed, what the trial court found was that both Miami-Dade and Palm Beach properly exercised their counting responsibilities, so I don't think  --."

First, that we had to prove before he looked at the ballots that there was a probability that the election result would be changed, and second, that we had to prove abuse of discretion."

The Palm Beach chairman of the canvassing board actually was a witness, Judge Burton.  He came and testified, and he testified that they used a hundreds of ballots that they could discern the clear intent of the voter from that were not machine read. Now, in doing so, they were applying Florida law, and like the law of many states, it has a general standard, not a specific standard."

On the other hand, if you found a ballot that was indented all the way through, you counted that as the intent of the voter."

    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, because in Florida law, since 1917, Darby against State, the Florida Supreme Court has held that where a voter's intent can be discerned, even if they don't do what they're told, that's supposed to be counted, and the thing I wanted to say about the Beckstrom case is that was a case that used optical ballots.  Voters were told, fill it in with a number two pencil.  Several thousand didn't.  They used everything else, but not a number two pencil.  And so the machine wouldn't read it.  It was voter error. discrepancy between Palm Beach and Broward County?  I'm reading from footnote 16 of the Florida Supreme Court's opinion.  On November 9, 2000, a manual recount was requested on behalf of Vice President Gore in four counties  -- miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Volusia. Broward County and Volusia County timely completed a manual recount.  It is undisputed that the results of the manual recounts in Volusia County and Broward County were included in the statewide certifications."

Now, I would point out that we asked to have the Miami-Dade ballots reviewed.  We also asked to have the 3,300 Palm Beach ballots reviewed, but the supreme court said no to us on that.  They said yes, you can have the 9,000 Miami-Dade ballots reviewed.  They also said, which we didn't ask for, they said as a matter of remedy, we want to review the undervotes all around the state."

    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "Well first, nobody asked for a contest of the overvotes, and the contest statute begins with a party saying that there is either a rejection of the contest, but now all of a sudden we are talking about statewide, not all of which were contested, but we are not talking about the overvotes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "Two parts to the answer.  The reason that I said what I did to Justice Scalia was that I think that if this Court were to rule that there was something wrong with the statewide recounts, that they were being done by canvassing boards as opposed to directly by the court, or because the court was not supervising the particular expression of voter intent, what the court would have done is simply cut back on a remedy that we didn't ask for. The second part is that when you are dealing with overvotes, remember, this is a machine issue.  When you are dealing with overvotes, the machine has already registered two votes.  Now, there may be another vote voter would be clear.  Now I don't know if there are such votes, but they say there might be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "There is nothing in the record that suggests that there are such votes.  If anybody had contested the overvotes, it would have been a relatively simple process to test that because you could simply test it as to whether the double vote was a write-in vote or was another candidate."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I gathered from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida that the Vice President did not ask for as broad a recount as the Supreme Court granted, but that it thought that to do just what he wanted would be unfair and therefore out of fairness, they granted the wider recount, am I correct in that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "I think that's right.  I think that's the way I would interpret it, Mr.  Chief Justice. canvassing boards, have them certify the results?  Why go through all that when the whole thing begins again with a contest?  There is no, no  -- once a contest filed, the certification is meaningless.  What advantage is there to win the protest?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",
    "speech": "It's not meaningless.  It becomes the baseline, and in every contest that has ever taken place, including this one, that has been the baseline that has determined 99-plus percent of the votes, and what is contested are simply those ballots that during the protest phase have been identified as disputed ballots, so that the, the protest phase solves 99 percent of the election or more.  What is left over are those ballots that one side or the other has contested, and that's what the contest deals with."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "My concern is that the contest period without it being a new law, a new scheme, a new system for recounting at this late date.  I'm very troubled by that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOIES",

It's absolutely clear under Florida law that that's what the contest is about, so at the contest stage, the only question is can you complete the contest of the contested ballots in the time available? Everything that's in the record is, that we could have and indeed we still may be able to, if that count can go forward."

The Boardman case, the language that you're referring to is at page 268 of the Southern Reporter report of that case, and what is clear from that page and that discussion is it's dealing with the issue of whether or not because the canvassing board threw away the envelopes from the absentee ballots so they could not be checked, whether that invalidated the absentee ballots, and the court says no, it doesn't, because it's important to count all these votes, and because we assume that what they were doing was proper.  That does not, I respectfully general standard."

First, I think that the answer that they did it differently, different people interpreting the general standard differently, would not raise a problem even in the absence of judicial review of that. Second, even if that would have raised a constitutional problem, I think the judicial review that provides the standardization would solve that problem. The third thing that I was saying is that any differences as to how this standard is interpreted have a lot less significance in terms of what votes are counted or not counted than simply the differences in machines that exist throughout the counties of Florida. There are five times as many undervotes in punch card ballot counties than in optical ballot counties. Now, for whatever that reason is, whether it's voter error"

The Florida Democratic Party on November 20 was asking the  -- november 20th of this year, was asking the Florida Supreme Court to establish uniform standards with respect to the looking at and evaluating these ballots, a recognition that there were no uniform standards and that there ought to be. Last Tuesday in the 11th Circuit, unless I variety of ballots.  There is the butterfly ballot that we've heard about and other kinds of postcard ballots. How can you have one standard when there are so many varieties of ballots?"

  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "You're certainly going to have to look at a ballot that you mark in one way different than these punch card ballots.  Our point is, with respect to the punch card ballots, is that there are different standards for evaluating those ballots from county to county and it is a documented history in this case that there have been different standards between November 7th standard, indentations on the ballot.  There was a reason why that was done.  It was because they weren't producing enough additional votes so that there's pressure on to change the standards.  And that will happen in a situation which is where the process is ultimately subjective, completely up to the discretion of the official, and there's no requirement of any uniformity. Now, we now have something that's worse than that.  We have standards that are different throughout 64 different counties.  We've got only undercounts being considered where an indentation on a ballot will now be counted as a vote, but other ballots that may have indentations aren't going to be counted at all.  The overvotes are in a different category, and in this very remedy the ballots in Miami-Dade are being treated differently.  Some of them have been all examined and the"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But the Florida Supreme Court told us that it hasn't been changed and just looking at one of the cases that you cite frequently, the O'Brien against Skinner case, this court said, well, maybe we would have decided the New York law differently but the highest court of the state has concluded otherwise.  It is not our function to construe a state statute contrary to the construction given it by the highest court of the state."
