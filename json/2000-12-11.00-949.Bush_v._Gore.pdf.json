Just four days later, without a single reference to this Court's December 4 ruling, the Florida Supreme Court issued a new, wholesale post-election revision of Florida's election law. That decision not only changed Florida election law yet again, it also explicitly referred to, relied upon, and expanded its November 21 judgment that this Court had made into a nullity."

In fact, it vested considerable authority in the Secretary of State, designating the Secretary of State as the chief elections official, and as we point out, the very first provision in the election code requires the Secretary of State to assure uniformity and consistency in the application and enforcement of the election law. The Secretary of State as the executive branch is also given considerably -- considerable other responsibilities, when but -- and to a certain extent, especially in connection with the contest phase of the election, certain authority was explicitly vested in the Circuit Court of the State of Florida, which is the trial court."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "No, I would say this with respect -- it would have been a perfectly logical, and if you read the statutes, a perfectly logical, especially in the context of a presidential election, to stop this process at the circuit court, and not provide layers of appeal because given the time deadline, especially in the context of this election, the way it's played out, there is not time for an appellate court."

And I would have thought that that would be sufficient rather than to raise an appropriate federal question, rather than to say there's no judicial review here in Florida."

      "speech": "No, I think that it is particularly in this case where there's been two wholesale revisions, major restructuring of the Florida Election Code, we don't even get close to that question at all. It would be unfortunate to assume that the legislature devolved this authority on its judiciary sub silentio. There is no specific reference to it. But in this case, as we have pointed out, especially the decision of last Friday, there was a major overhaul in almost every conceivable way."

The point I think that's most important and most --."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Olson, with respect to the role of judicial review, you rely very much on the McPherson case, and two things strike me about that case. One is, if you're right on your jurisdiction theory, then should not this Court have vacated instead of affirmed the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court in that case because the Michigan legislature didn't confer upon the Michigan Supreme Court in that case any special authority of judicial review?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "That's entirely possible that that might be the case, Justice Ginsburg, but the entire text of the McPherson decision and its recitation of the legislative history or the history of legislation and acts by state legislatures to comply with it make it quite clear that the power is vested in the legislature itself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But there was a decision by the court reviewing, which we affirmed. Under your jurisdiction theory as I see it, there was no role for the Michigan Supreme Court to play because Article II, section 1 gives the authority exclusively to the legislature, and the legislature has not provided for judicial review especially for that measure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "I think the context of that case is different, and that it's entirely possible for the Court to have come to the conclusion it did in that case and we believe that case is compelling for the principle that we are arguing in this case, that there is no, the entire structure of what Florida did, its election code, in its effort to comply not only with Article II, but with Section 5 of Title 3, is such that it did not intend in any way to divest itself of the power to determine how the appointment of electors would be determined in a federal presidential election and most importantly, the resolution of cases and controversies, and disputes, with respect to the appointments --."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Three times, at least as I counted in McPherson itself, it refers to what is done by the legislative power under state constitutions as they exist. This is not the most clearly written opinion, and yet three times, they refer to the legislative power as constrained by the state's constitution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "And I think that that's important. I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg. It's not the most clearly written opinion. But I think that in the context of that case, the relationship of the legislature to the Constitution in that case and the way that power was exercised, that ought to be reconciled with what we are urging the Court today, that a wholesale revision and abandonment of the legislative authority can't be turned over, especially sub silentio, by a legislature simply because there is a constitution. There is a constitution in every state. There is a judiciary in every state. The judiciary performs certain functions in every state, and to go that length, one would assume that the judiciary in every state under that argument could overturn, rewrite, revise, and change the election law in presidential elections notwithstanding Article II, at will. Now, this was a major, major revision that took place on Friday."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Olson, isn't that one of the issues in the case as to whether it was a major revision? Your opponents disagree, and I know you rely very heavily on the dissenting opinion in the Florida Supreme Court, but which opinion do we normally look to for issues of state law?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "Well, I think that the dissenting opinion and the two dissenting opinions are very informative. We are relying on what the court did. If one looks at, for example, the recount provisions, before this revision under Florida law, manual recount under the protest provisions were discretionary, completely discretionary, conducted by canvassing boards during the protest phase of the election, post-election period, pursuant to legislatively defined procedures as to who could be present, for seven days after the election with respect to all ballots in a county, that was mandatory and only available, as we heard last week, for tabulation error up until this election. After the decision of December 8th in this context, those remand provisions, I mean those recount, manual recount provisions became mandatory instead of discretionary pursuant to judicial rather than executive supervsion during the contest phase rather than the protest phase, even though it's not even mentioned in the statute with respect to the contest phase, pursuant to ad hoc judicially established procedures rather than the procedures that are articulated quite carefully in the statute."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, on ad hoc judicially created procedures, the point of subsection 8 of 168. I mean, once we get into the contest phase, subsection 8 gives at least to the circuit court, leaving aside the question of appellate jurisdiction, about as broad a grant to fashion orders as I can imagine going into a statute."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "Well, to read that, to read that provision and it's written quite broadly, but to read that, one has to read that in the context of the entire statutory framework. If one reads it the way the Florida Supreme Court did, the entire process is tilted on its head. Where there used to be the decision that was in the election officials, it now becomes in the court. All of the limitations on the remand process that existed during the protest phase, where the standards should be lower because it's earlier in the process are thrown out the window. The time tables are thrown out the window. The process that exists are there and one has to -- ."

    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "But that's only if you untether 168 entirely from the statute and the steam by which the protest phase takes place over a period of seven to 10 days in the context of this election, and the contest phase occurs over the next four weeks."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

But that's a question of Florida Supreme Court statutory construction and unless you can convince us, it seems to me, that in construing 168, which is what we are concerned with now, and its coordination or lack of coordination with 166, the Florida Supreme Court has simply passed the bounds of legitimate statutory construction, then I don't see how we can find an Article II violation here."

    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "We are not just saying timetables. We are saying that it has wrenched it completely out of the election code which the legislature very carefully crafted to fit together and work in an interrelated fashion. It isn't just the timetable. The fact that there are timetables which are very important in a presidential election, we are today smack up against a very important deadline, and we are in the process where -- ."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And it took that into consideration in fashioning its orders under subsection 8."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "And we submit that it incorrectly interpreted and construed federal law in doing that because what they have inevitably done is provide a process whereby it is virtually impossible, if not completely impossible, and I think it is completely impossible, to have these issues resolved and the controversies resolved in time for that federal statutory deadline. Furthermore, it is quite clear, we submit, that the process has changed."

The voter is told in the polling place and then when they walk into the booth that what you are supposed to do with respect to the punch cards is put the ballot in, punch your selections, take the ballot out, and make sure there are no hanging pieces of paper attached to it. The whole issue of what constitutes a legal vote which the Democrats make much ado about presumes that it's a legal vote no matter what you do with the card. And presumably, you could take the card out of the polling place and not stick it in the box and they would consider that to be a legal vote.

      "speech": "Your Honor, if they are not properly, if the ballot is not properly executed, it's not a legal vote. The only case in Florida that even touches upon this in terms of a machine ballot is the Hogan case from the Fourth District Court of Appeal. In the Fourth District Court of Appeal, that candidate lost by three votes, and he went during the protest phase to the canvassing board and asked for a manual recount to be done and they exercised their discretion and said no. And in that case, there is a discussion. He raised the argument that there were ballots in there that had hanging chads and this that and the other thing. They would hear none of it and when it went up on appeal, it was affirmed. So the fact of the matter is that the only case that we have that deals with this handles it in that fashion, and I would respectfully suggest that a ballot that is not properly punched is not a legal ballot. And I think also, sir, if you go through an analysis of the Vice President's arguments in supporting what the Supreme Court does, there is sort of an omelet that is created by going and picking through different statutes. For instance, the clear intent standard comes from a statute that deals with a damaged ballot where you have to create, to put through the machine, a substitute ballot, and there are very clear directions as to what to do to preserve the integrity of the ballot. And the Beckstrom case, which you will no doubt hear much about as the argument proceeds, dealt with that kind of situation. There was a manual recount there; the court did not pass on the propriety of it. The issue was if the election officials took ballots and marked over the ballots instead of creating a separate substitute ballot, they took that ballot and marked it over so it could go through an optical scanner, which the court found to be gross negligence whether they would discount the votes. That was the issue that was present there. So I think if you look through Florida law it is relatively clear that there was no basis whatsoever to be able to find -- ."

The Florida Supreme Court said that you had to look as to whether there was substantial compliance. In that case three days was found to be substantial compliance. That was a situation in which there was telephone notice, which was not adequate for certification. That was then followed up --."

What I'm saying is that the Florida Supreme Court did not rewrite the law in the way that you hypothesized. What the Florida Supreme Court was confronted with was a statute, and that statute said that -- and it was the later passed statute, we get back into the may and the shall. The may statute was the later passed statute, and so what the Florida Supreme Court said is we have to look at what is the criteria by which you decide whether you may ignore and will ignore these returns, and what the Florida Supreme Court said, we're going to interpret that exactly the way we've interpreted it for 25 years, and 12 years before the Florida Supreme Court made this decision, it had made the State against Chappell decision in which it had approached it from exactly the same policy grounds."

I think that's quite a bit different from extending the period generally and for all submissions for, you know -- but if I could -- I'm not sure that you and Justice Kennedy are disagreeing on very much. It seems to me you acknowledge that if the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of this law were not a reasonable interpretation, just not one that would pass normal judicial muster, then it would be just like the legislature writing a new law, but your contention here is that this is a reasonable interpretation of Florida law."

What you had there was undisputed evidence, it was found as a matter of fact, and the Supreme Court reviewing that trial said you've had these votes identified by Miami-Dade, 168 net votes, by Palm Beach, 215 net votes, and those votes need to be included.

We are assuming that there is detail that cannot be captured by an objective rule. The assumption of this question, and I think, I think it's behind what's bothering Justice Kennedy, Justice Breyer, me and others, is, we're assuming there's a category in which there just is no other -- there is no subjective appeal. All we have are certain physical characteristics. Those physical characteristics we are told are being treated differently from county to county. In that case, where there is no subjective counter indication, isn't it a denial of equal protection to allow that variation?"

Maybe if you had specific objective criteria in one county that says we're going to count indented ballots and another county that said we're only going to count the ballot if it is punched through.

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

That causes me some problems that pertain not just to the equal protection aspect of this, but to the rationality of the supreme court's opinion, because the supreme court opinion on the one hand said, as you've just repeated, that there was to be de novo review by the circuit judge in Leon County. But on the other hand, it said that he had to accept the counts that had come out of Palm Beach and Broward counties. It was clear that Broward and Palm Beach counties had applied different criteria to dimpled ballots. One of them was counting all dimpled ballots, the other one plainly was not. How can you at one and the same time say it's a de novo standard as to what is the intent of the voter, and on the other hand say, you have to accept, give some deference to, quite differing standards by two different counties? That's just not rational."

Voters were told, fill it in with a number two pencil. Several thousand didn't. They used everything else, but not a number two pencil. And so the machine wouldn't read it. It was voter error. The Supreme Court in 1998, well before this election, said you've got to count those votes. And in fact, they counted those votes even though the way the canvassing board dealt with them was to go back and mark them over with a big black marker, which made it impossible to check whether the canvassing board had really just marked over the ballot or had put a new mark on the ballot."

On November 9, 2000, a manual recount was requested on behalf of Vice President Gore in four counties -- miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Volusia. Broward County and Volusia County timely completed a manual recount.

Once have you contested ballots, then going back to State against Williams, Nuccio against Williams in 1929, cited in our papers, then it becomes a judicial question, and what the court holds is you then look at that as a judicial matter and that is why you have going on in Leon County the review of the Miami-Dade ballots under the court's supervision. Now, I would point out that we asked to have the Miami-Dade ballots reviewed. We also asked to have the 3,300 Palm Beach ballots reviewed, but the supreme court said no to us on that.

Why is it that you say on the one hand to Justice Scalia, oh, well, these weren't part of the contest, but now all of a sudden we are talking about statewide, not all of which were contested, but we are not talking about the overvotes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOIES",
      "speech": "Two parts to the answer. The reason that I said what I did to Justice Scalia was that I think that if this Court were to rule that there was something wrong with the statewide recounts, that they were being done by canvassing boards as opposed to directly by the court, or because the court was not supervising the particular expression of voter intent, what the court would have done is simply cut back on a remedy that we didn't ask for. The second part is that when you are dealing with overvotes, remember, this is a machine issue. When you are dealing with overvotes, the machine has already registered two votes. Now, there may be another vote there, a dimpled vote or an indented vote that the machine did not register. But once you get two votes, that ballot doesn't get counted for the presidency."

What -- there is a very, as you point out, there is scant statutory provision concerning, concerning the contest. There is quite detailed statutory provision concerning the protest period. And it tells everybody how to act and time limits and all of that. Why would anyone bother to go through the protest period, have these ballots counted by the canvassing boards, have them certify the results? Why go through all that when the whole thing begins again with a contest? There is no, no -- once a contest filed, the certification is meaningless. What advantage is there to win the protest?"

It becomes the baseline, and in every contest that has ever taken place, including this one, that has been the baseline that has determined 99-plus percent of the votes, and what is contested are simply those ballots that during the protest phase have been identified as disputed ballots, so that the, the protest phase solves 99 percent of the election or more.

I'm very troubled by that."

It's absolutely clear under Florida law that that's what the contest is about, so at the contest stage, the only question is can you complete the contest of the contested ballots in the time available?

The Boardman case, the language that you're referring to is at page 268 of the Southern Reporter report of that case, and what is clear from that page and that discussion is it's dealing with the issue of whether or not because the canvassing board threw away the envelopes from the absentee ballots so they could not be checked, whether that invalidated the absentee ballots, and the court says no, it doesn't, because it's important to count all these votes, and because we assume that what they were doing was proper. That does not, I respectfully suggest, at all deal with the question of deference to the voter intent determination which the court has repeatedly said is a matter for judicial determination. The other thing that I would say with respect to intent is I know the Court is concerned about whether the standard is too general or not. Some states have made specific criteria their law. Other states, not just Florida -- 10 or 11 of them, including Massachusetts, in the Dellahunt case that we cited, has stuck with this very general standard."

First, I think that the answer that they did it differently, different people interpreting the general standard differently, would not raise a problem even in the absence of judicial review of that. Second, even if that would have raised a constitutional problem, I think the judicial review that provides the standardization would solve that problem. The third thing that I was saying is that any differences as to how this standard is interpreted have a lot less significance in terms of what votes are counted or not counted than simply the differences in machines that exist throughout the counties of Florida. There are five times as many undervotes in punch card ballot counties than in optical ballot counties. Now, for whatever that reason is, whether it's voter error or machine problems, that statistic, you know, makes clear that there is some difference in how votes are being treated county by county. That difference is much greater than the difference in how many votes are recovered in Palm Beach or Broward or Volusia or Miami-Dade, so that the differences of interpretation of the standard, the general standard are resulting in far fewer differences among counties than simply the differences in the machines that they have."

The Florida Democratic Party on November 20 was asking the -- november 20th of this year, was asking the Florida Supreme Court to establish uniform standards with respect to the looking at and evaluating these ballots, a recognition that there were no uniform standards and that there ought to be. Last Tuesday in the 11th Circuit, unless I misheard him, the attorney for the Attorney General of Florida said that the standards for evaluating these ballots are evolving. There is no question, based upon this record, that there are different standards from county to county."

There are machines, there's the optical scanning, and then there are a whole variety of ballots. There is the butterfly ballot that we've heard about and other kinds of postcard ballots. How can you have one standard when there are so many varieties of ballots?"

      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "You're certainly going to have to look at a ballot that you mark in one way different than these punch card ballots. Our point is, with respect to the punch card ballots, is that there are different standards for evaluating those ballots from county to county and it is a documented history in this case that there have been different standards between November 7th and the present with respect to how those punch card ballots are evaluated. Palm Springs is the best example. They started with a clear rule which had been articulated and explained to the voters, by the way, as of 1990. Then they got into the process of evaluating these ballots and changed the standard from moment to moment during the first day and again, they evolved from the standard that the chad had to be punched through to the so-called dimpled ballot standard, indentations on the ballot. There was a reason why that was done. It was because they weren't producing enough additional votes so that there's pressure on to change the standards. And that will happen in a situation which is where the process is ultimately subjective, completely up to the discretion of the official, and there's no requirement of any uniformity. Now, we now have something that's worse than that. We have standards that are different throughout 64 different counties. We've got only undercounts being considered where an indentation on a ballot will now be counted as a vote, but other ballots that may have indentations aren't going to be counted at all. The overvotes are in a different category, and in this very remedy the ballots in Miami-Dade are being treated differently. Some of them have been all examined and the balance of the process, the remaining 80 percent will be looked at only in connection with the undercounts."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",

It is not our function to construe a state statute contrary to the construction given it by the highest court of the state."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",

The final point I would like to make is with respect to section 5. It is quite clear that the court in both the earlier decision and the decision last Friday was aware and concerned about compliance with section 5. It construed section 5 in a way that allowed it by labeling what it was doing as interpretation to change in dramatic respects the Florida election law, and we submit because it did, so misconstrued the applicability not only with respect to finality but the other part of section 5 requires a determination of controversies pursuant to a set of laws that are in place at the time of the elections."
