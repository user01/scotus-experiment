The standard that was applied here required that you show that you're being prevented from registering to vote, from raising money, from campaigning, from showing up at the polls. Those kinds of constitutional violations don't make sense as an element of a partisan gerrymandering claim, because they're not about gerrymandering, and of course, they never occur.

The people are supposed to decide. The second reason is that 50/50 you don't have these problems of distortions, which, as an empirical matter, happen in a winner-take-all, single-member district system. When you get to 60/40, the party that has 60 percent of the vote ordinarily would expect to get more than 60 percent of the districts.

Now, you're saying that if it were true by this map that they're getting that vote, 55 percent, meant that nonetheless, they had to get fewer than half the Congressmen, then it's bad.

And in - in Bandemer, the facts as they were presented, there was no such expert analysis. Instead, they relied on the results of one election in which one of the bodies actually came out the right way and one of them came out slightly the wrong way. They had not supplied the Court with the same kind of evidence that we would propose to supply, and - and did not meet, at least as an evidentiary matter, the standard that we propose here. It might be that, in fact, if somebody looked at that Indiana map, it might have met that, but nobody studied it in that way. They were simply saying, look, it's really ugly, they've got these unfair, multi-member districts in certain cities, and, in fact, the way the vote came out in the House, the Democrats got more than half the votes and got only 43 percent of the seats.

Therefore, if, over a period of time, we have a districting system where the minority - the majority who get the - the majority of votes end up with a minority of seats in a serious way, that undercuts the democracy that the Constitution foresees. And with computers, that might happen. Now, suppose I start with that assumption, and I'm looking for a standard. So suppose I combine Justice Stevens' standard with the requirement to keep judges out of it, that this has really to have happened. It's not the Harvard faculty. It really happened. And in fact, after really happening once, then we also have the experts who tell us it has to happen in the future.

The party that had a majority of the popular vote got a minority of the congressional seats. The same thing happened again in a - in another - in a subsequent election, but it was exactly the reverse. You know, the Democrats and Republicans flipped. So it - it can, in fact, happen, Your Honor. But if you allow the experts to control over the voters, then you'll never know the truth of what would really happen. And let me give you an example in Bandemer itself. The aftermath of - of the Bandemer case in Indiana is instructive, because two years after this Court handed down its decision in Bandemer, the Democrats, who would have had the Court believe that they were consigned to an eternity of Republican tyranny, actually won 50 percent of the state House seats in Indiana. And only two years after that, in 1990, they won control, and control has flipped back and forth ever since in Indiana. So, I believe that Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in Bandemer was - was quite on point. The system is self-correcting. Now, the appellants test in using 10 years, instead of a base race as their own academic source recommends, actually gives a lot of weight to the past preferences of voters, dead voters, voters who have moved. Naturally, this is a political choice, because any party that perceives this influence as waning over time will ask you to adopt a test that gives weight to past choices. They also use high profile offices in choosing their races instead of low-profile statewide races, non- charismatic races as their - as their academic source recommends. And, of course, we have such non-charismatic races in Pennsylvania. We call them statewide appellate judicial races. Nothing could be more non-charismatic."

They also, as - as - as I mentioned, in their test assumed dispersion of Democrats uniformly, when, in fact, Democrats, as we all know, are compacted, self-compacted, into urban areas. So, the - the test is very tilted. A curious thing that they do in their test is turn real races into hypothetical races by normalizing them so as to remove the popularity factor from those races. Well, that's curious, since politics is all about trying to achieve that popular edge. What they did not do, and this is another political choice in constructing the test, is to a use a very - a - a race that was practically 50/50 in Pennsylvania in 2000, a race, by the way, that's cited in their complaint. It's - it's the Al Gore race for President. Mr. Gore won 50.6 percent of the popular vote in Pennsylvania. Now, the statistics show that he also would have won a majority of the congressional districts under the plan that's before this Court if he had been packaged as a congressional candidate.

And let me just address the - the question of whether it makes sense to wait and see how the elections come out and see whether there is, in fact, this anti­ majoritarian effect from the line-drawing. One of the real practical problems with that is that the lines themselves in a - in an extreme gerrymander like this, can - can effect the statewide aggregate vote totals themselves. You saw that right here where, in - with the history of votes very evenly divided in a - in a balanced map through the '90s, a court-drawn map. Suddenly with this gerrymander you had five Republicans running unopposed, you had a number of the Democratic incumbents defeated in the primaries because they squared off -"

First of all, if they pair the incumbents, they're just not there to run anymore, and there's a substantial distortion caused by the map. There was some discussion by Mr. Krill of judicial races as the - the test of - of partisan balance in the map because the - the supposition was that judges, when they run, don't have any great personal magnetism, I guess. But he didn't mention the - the race that was cited in our reply brief, which - this was 2003 - where Mr. Bayer ran as a Democrat, got 52 percent of the votes statewide, and carried six out of the 19 districts. That is an indication of the basic fundamental packing and cracking that's in the map, and is in fact a form of severe discrimination, making some voters' votes count much more forcefully than others. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
