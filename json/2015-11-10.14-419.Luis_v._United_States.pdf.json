Now a bank robber goes in, he has a pile of money, he puts it into a separate bank account, he uses that bank account to pay his rent, to pay other expenses, and he uses the money that would have gone for the rent and other expenses to pay a lawyer. Why should the two cases be treated any differently for Sixth Amendment purposes?"

And so while the statute could constitutionally allow, provided that there is adequate hearings, et cetera, the restraint of even a defendant's owned assets, lawfully owned assets, that principle can't extend to assets ­­ the subset of assets she needs to use counsel of choice."

And with regard to the travels to Mecca, those travels, while significant under the First Amendment, don't bear on the ultimate outcome of the criminal case. And so because the need for assets that we are requesting limited to that amount needed to retain counsel of choice, limited to the amount needed to mount a legal defense to the very charge that threatens her property rights and her liberty upon conviction, there needs to be an accommodation so that she can use enough assets, controlled by the Court, of course ­­"

So while the Court has accommodated the indigent by providing them with appointed counsel, that is not a license for the government to render people who are not indigent, indigent. It's not a license to impoverish them by virtue of the accusation alone. That would simply write out the Sixth Amendment from the Constitution. In every single case where there is a victim who claims injury, every single one, the government has by definition probable cause because the indictment is based on probable cause. And it's not subject to challenge under the Kaley opinion. And so if we are going to say that merely being accused in this country because a grand jury has found probable cause is now sufficient to lock down all of your assets, assets you have owned for decades, perhaps, because at some future time maybe a jury will convict and maybe a judge will enter a judgment, and then maybe the court will then have to enforce that judgment, really is to write out the Sixth Amendment. And there are ways ­­ if the point of a criminal case is to inflict punishment on a defendant, there are ways other than financial means to do so. Of course, incarceration is the number one form of punishment. And while the needs of the victims are certainly important, what we're asking here is to accommodate both. We're not asking that all the funds be released, only so much as are necessary so that the accused can be represented by private counsel."

Now let's try it with the facts here. If a defendant has some money, which maybe he will have to pay in a fine, what we'll do is we'll take all his money away before he's been convicted beyond a reasonable doubt. Okay. That's the difference in the propositions. And I'm saying it's pretty hard for me to think in a country which says that before he's convicted, you have to release him on bail except in unusual circumstances, that nonetheless, you can take all his money away so he can't hire a lawyer.

So I have a suggestion that I want you to focus on. The suggestion is ­­ let's read this statute in light of what you've said, that there is an interest on your side and there is a constitutional amendment on the other side. Why can't we read this statute to say they accommodate those interests in this way? If they're going to run away from ­­ with the property, then the court has the authority to enjoin the alienation or disposition of property, say tainted, then you can ask for a restraining order to prohibit the prohibition, not just of the tainted property but also of property of equivalent value. If I read that without knowing the background, I would say a lot of cases come up where you get TROs, where they're not precise because you don't know exactly what property you're talking about. So what do you think about reading this statute to avoid the constitutional question to say the TRO means TRO? And a TRO means where there's some property out there and it may be tainted, mixed up with the untainted, you can get a TRO on the whole thing. You have to have a speedy hearing. He has to be represented. And your purpose of that is to separate the two kinds of assets. That seems to me to work for the purpose, and it also avoids the constitutional question."

Monsanto basically said that if the government has shown adequately that it will be able to forfeit the money at the conclusion of the case, the Sixth Amendment doesn't override the government's interests. After all, Justice Breyer, this is basically a zero­sum game. Either there will be money available at the end of the case for the victims or the money will have been spent on lawyers.

Then the question is, can the government do anything to prevent dissipation of the assets before it obtains the judgment?

Section (a) describes the things the government can seek under the statute; Subsection (B) describes the procedure that's used. Subsection (A) first allows the government to get an injunction against fraud in (A)(1). In (A)(2) it allows it to restrain assets as the ultimate object of the suit, not as a temporary interim measure. Temporary interim measures are described in Subsection (B) where it specifically allows the Court to impose various restraints until the Court has concluded the proceeding. So it addresses temporary relief in (B). Subsection (A)(2) describes the things that the government can seek as the ultimate object of the case. Injunction against the person who has the funds, or a restraining order against any person to restrain the funds that are derived from illegal activity, or funds of equivalent value. And just to make one final point on that, the reason that makes sense in a banking context and in a healthcare context is dollars are fungible, as Justice Alito said earlier. They will flow into an account; they will flow out into other accounts. It's difficult to trace them. So Congress obviated the need to do that by saying you can restrain the defendant, but we're not going to rely only on restraining the defendant. You can also restrain the banks where the funds are. And you can restrain them not only in the amounts that represent the tainted funds, but represent the monetary equivalent of them. So in a sense ­­"

I also think that the amicus argument is not a tenable one because it simply reads \"or equivalent value\" out of the statute and without any reference to the context of the statute, which is to try to make the government be able to be made whole at the conclusion of a case if, in fact, it obtains a judgment given the very difficult process of segregating out money in banking and financial­type crimes."

In our cert petition, since we were constrained in the Eleventh Circuit by the interpretation that had been given back in 1999, we focused on the constitutional issue in order to suggest to the Court that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance should be triggered because there's a Sixth Amendment problem. The Eleventh Circuit has concluded that the statute is ambiguous."

      "speaker": "SREBNICK",
      "speech": "That is correct. We argued that the Constitution would be violated, and because this Court, in its discretion and indeed in the Rumsfeld vs. FAIR case, looks at a statute even if the interpretation is offered at the merit stage by an amicus, the Court has considered those competing interpretations in order to avoid the constitutional issue. Justice Scalia, in response to your question about property, it sure sounded to anyone who heard the argument and read the opinions in Monsanto and Caplin & Drysdale that it was much about property. The government, by invoking the taint theory, which does date back to the founding of our nation, taints a particular subject, and that is the tainted asset. That's why it's called the taint theory. It's counterintuitive to suggest that untainted assets should be treated as tainted assets. And because, as I used the word earlier, there must be a coexistence between the taint theory and the right to counsel of choice, Monsanto drew the line, Caplin & Drysdale drew the line and said if the government can establish that the asset is tainted, it can be frozen. Nothing about Monsanto, nothing about Caplin & Drysdale, suggested that assets over which the government has no present property interest, no relation­backed theory, no taint theory to speak of, can then take Aunt Sally's money or a client's pension funds needed to ­­ for representation to use those assets to retain counsel. Nothing in this Court's precedent in those cases suggests that. And naturally, as a member of the defense bar, we would welcome a revisiting of Monsanto and Caplin & Drysdale because the parade of horribles is here today. The government says quite candidly there is no line. If the fine is $1 million, the defendant has to pony up, ante up $1 million up front in order to exercise his right to counsel. The right to counsel of choice will have a price tag. And it is whatever the government says the maximum fine is. Whatever the maximum restitution is, that will be the price that the defendant must pay in advance. It's an advance fee that the defendant must pay according to the government in order to be able to exercise his Sixth Amendment rights. We ask the Court to reject such an interpretation."
