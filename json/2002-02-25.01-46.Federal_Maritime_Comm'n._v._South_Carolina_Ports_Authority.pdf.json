    "speech": "We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 01-46, the Federal Maritime Commission v. the South Carolina State Ports Authority. Mr. Hughey."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The adjudication of a Shipping Act complaint by the Federal Maritime Commission is an administrative regulatory process through which the agency makes findings of fact and applies its interpretation of the Shipping Act to those findings of fact. This is an exercise of executive power."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, why isn't that adjudication, if it applies the law to findings of fact?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, it is adjudication, but what we're suggesting is that it's not judicial. It is an executive branch adjudication that permits the agency to determine what position it would like to take with respect to potential violations of the Shipping Act."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But doesn't it involve a decision as to whether this particular respondent before the commission has violated some provision of the act?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Yes, and in that sense, Your Honor, it is an exercise of ad hoc regulation. It's regulation on a specific and discrete set of facts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you could say the same thing about a court, that it's not making an -- making an ad hoc regulation on these particular facts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "However, Your Honor, in the case of a court and a decision issued by a court, such an order would be self-executing, whereas a Federal Maritime Commission regulatory determination is not self-executing. Rather, in the event that it's not voluntary compliance with whatever order the agency reaches at the end of an adjudication, the Attorney General or a private complainant must go into a Federal district court and seek to have that Federal district court compel compliance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Suppose Congress --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, presumably a State would feel -- would hesitate not to appear because it might ultimately be enforced against the State by the Attorney General, isn't that right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Yes, I think that is correct, Justice O'Connor, that a State might --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, if the State is compelled to participate, does that alter our analysis of it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "No, I don't think so, because the extent to which the State feels compelled by a potential action by the Attorney General of the United States is compulsion that arises from an action of the Federal Government itself in the name of the United States."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What if a -- is a private plaintiff entitled to take a decision, or order, whatever you want to call it, of the commission, and seek to have it enforced by a court?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, under the Shipping Act a private plaintiff is permitted to go into a Federal district court --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And would the Eleventh Amendment defense raised by the State there prevail?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "I think that that case would present a much more significant Eleventh Amendment issue. The Shipping Act provides that the district court hearing and, of course, an action brought by a private complainant must have jurisdiction of the parties. I would suggest that to the extent there's any Eleventh Amendment interest that requires vindication under the Shipping Act, that vindication can be explored in the Federal district court proceeding."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Do you concede that at least as to reparation, where as I understand it the Government can go into the district court to seek reparations, only the private party, at least as to seeking dollars from the State agency, that the Eleventh Amendment would preclude that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Well, in its order in this case, Justice Ginsburg, the commissioner finds that it would like to see its reparation orders deemed to be enforceable by a Federal district court, so I can't concede that they wouldn't be, but what I can say is that determination is not within the agency's jurisdiction. That would be a determination for the Federal district court to make in the event that the State instrumentality raised an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense to the attempted enforcement action by the private complainant."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Hughey, why do you assume that if this is not judicial action, sovereign immunity doesn't apply? I mean, I guess whatever sovereign immunity the States retained upon the formation of the Federal Constitution was the sovereign immunity that existed in international law at the time. Can foreign sovereigns be summoned before executive or legislative tribunals in this country?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "I don't know whether foreign sovereigns can be summoned before the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but the State sovereign immunity is just what -- the sovereign immunity that they had at international law. That's what -- the Eleventh Amendment is just a reflection of the fact that they retained that sort of sovereign immunity, and I don't think it makes any difference that, you know, if the King of England summons George Washington, President of the United States, to appear before a parliamentary commission or some royal tribunal instead of an English court. I think George Washington would say, you know, go fly a kite. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Well, I think that one can turn to the text of the Eleventh Amendment itself for some guidance on this issue, Justice Scalia."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, you can't, because the Eleventh Amendment is just -- we have held that it represents just a reflection of the fact that the States retained that sovereign immunity that they had before the formation of the Federal Republic, and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "It's a reflection, Your Honor, of the immunity from coercive judicial process. I think that's why the Eleventh Amendment begins that the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to any --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's the conclusion, but what Justice Scalia's asking, and I think we're interested in, is whether there's any precedent that you could cite, any historical source that says that an administrative tribunal can summon a sovereign before it and render a judgment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Well, if I may suggest a different side to that is that there is no precedent to suggest that it can't. It's been held by this Court in California v. United States that State-run courts are subject to commission regulation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but if it's the dog that didn't bark theory, it seems to me that cuts against you. If this has never been done, that's probably because it can't be done. At least we can make that inference."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "No, I think it has been done since the Shipping Act was first passed, and it simply --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm not talking about the Shipping Act. I'm talking about other authority. If you're saying that the Shipping Act is the precedent-breaking ground, it seems to me that you're then on somewhat a slender foundation for your argument here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "This Court held in California v. United States that the Shipping Act as a regulatory statute applies to all State-run courts. What the commission is suggesting, Justice Kennedy, is that that applies equally with respect to agency adjudications."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But California v. United States, the United States was a party, so there was no Eleventh Amendment question there."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "No, the question I think was whether the entire statute, which at that time included a regulatory procedure that could be initiated by private complainants, whether the entire statute, which was a coherent regulatory scheme, applied to State-run ports, and that's what the Court held. The Court specifically referred to the scheme for regulating waterfront terminals, not the specific provision within that scheme that permits the United States itself to initiate an investigation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But the case itself, United States v. California, raised no Eleventh Amendment problem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "No, that's correct. That's correct, it didn't raise an Eleventh Amendment problem, but the issue was whether the regulatory scheme as a whole could be applied to State instrumentalities, and this adjudicatory proceeding under the Shipping Act is part of that regulatory program. With respect --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is there any -- I mean, it's sort of an interesting question, but I wonder if there are laws or rules which say that the Congress says that any ship, including ships belonging to foreign States that enter New York Harbor, will abide by the rules of the New York Harbor Authority, and if they don't, you can -- there's some argument about whether the pilot comes on or something, that ship, including a military ship of a foreign nation, or any other, has to adjudicate the controversy in front of the New York Authority or other -- I don't know how that works, but maybe you do. I imagine they are subject to our rules when they come here, and bring their ships into the harbor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Yes, I would think so, and the commission does have some jurisdiction over foreign- operated and -- foreign operated vessels that are owned by sovereigns. The commission regulates sally-to-port controlled carriers which are vessels that are owned by Governments. If a complaint were to be filed against such an entity, I see no reason why the commission would not attempt to assert its regulatory adjudicatory jurisdiction over such a complaint, but I know of no such specific case under the statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How do you get around the, sort of the principle of dignity which has been emphasized in every case, I think, since Seminole, and it's been given a prominent place in the reasoning of the court majority in those cases, that it's the dignity of the States, and so on, which must be preserved. If under the rule of sovereign immunity which overarches the Eleventh Amendment there were indefeasible dignity interests in the adjudication, say, in Seminole and all of them, doesn't it follow, a fortiori, that there are dignitary interests that would be offended by hauling the State in front of an Article I, a purely administrative tribunal?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "I think I would have two responses to that, Justice Souter. First is that I understand the dignitary interest to be co-extensive with the sovereign immunity interest, and second --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that leaves the question in a -- unanswered, I guess. The --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Justice Souter says the sovereign immunity interest is co-extensive with the dignitary interest. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let's assume the co-existence. What's the answer to the question?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Well, I think the answer would be, then, that sovereign immunity doesn't apply, that a State's dignity is not offended."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I certainly agree with you. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Because dignity seems to have been taken, in fact, as one of the interests to be served by sovereign immunity. Why doesn't the doctrine of sovereign immunity, why doesn't it apply if applied in those other cases?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Well, I think that the dignity of the State is less offended by this type of regulatory adjudication, given the fact that the agency has no coercive power to compel anything from the State."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I -- it seems to me intuitively just the opposite. I mean, these are tribunals that -- if we're going to talk about dignity, these are tribunals that do not have the dignity of the judicial forums that were at stake in the preceding cases, and I would have supposed that the offense to the sovereignty of the State was even greater to pull the State before these lesser tribunals."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Well, I think the offense to the dignity interest of the State occurs when a State is forced to do something which is the result of a coercive act. Under the Shipping Act --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Everything was fine in Seminole and all of them, until we got to the point of judgment? I mean, is that the way you're trying to cut the argument?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "No. I think in cases like Alden and Seminole Tribe it was the threat of judgment that hung over the United States that was the problem, because in those cases, if the court entered an order against a State it was automatically self-enforcing them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, they could have made them appear and just said, you know, we understand that -- just as you're saying, we understand that an order can't issue against you, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't show up. We haven't said that in sovereign immunity. We've said the State does not have to appear. It is hauling the State before the tribunal that is the offense, not just the judgment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Well, I think with respect to your hypothetical this Court has found the power of coercion or contempt is the judicial power necessary to the exercise of all others, so I don't think that a court could just tell a State, well, appear and we're not going to be able to issue an order against you. I think the fact that coercion can result from the judicial proceeding is the point of the judicial proceeding and is what differentiates it from this type of regulatory adjudication."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but the court can't say it, but the Eleventh Amendment says it. I mean, and whereupon the court can say, look, you know, by reason of your sovereign immunity, we understand if you show up we can't issue any contempt judgment, we can't issue a merits judgment against you, but that doesn't mean you don't have to show up. But it does mean you don't have to show up, doesn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Well, yes, the State can move to dismiss any suit that's filed against it in a court, but I still think that it's the threat of coercive judgment against the State that is the reason that the State can --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "There is no threat of coercive judgment. The Eleventh Amendment makes it very clear that you can't issue the coercive judgment, but the State still doesn't have to show up."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "I don't think that analysis should apply to this statute, Justice Scalia, because under the Shipping Act the agency can -- cannot compel an appearance by the State. If the State just doesn't show up under the Shipping Act, the only way to do anything about that is to go into a Federal district court and seek a court order, and if the agency determines to do that, it then has to ask the Attorney General to do so. Under the statute, the Attorney General may, rather than shall, enforce any order the commission issued. That is therefore, by definition, an exercise of the executive discretion that this Court found acceptable in Alden v. Maine."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Does the commission have contempt powers?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "No. No, it does not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, if it issues its process to a State and the -- like the entity in the present case, and the entity simply fails to show up, what can it do?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "If the entity failed to show up, Mr. Chief Justice, the commission could issue an order telling it to show up, but again, that would have to be enforced by a Federal district court, and if --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "At the behest of the Attorney General, or --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Yes. Yes. The commission would have to ask the Attorney General to enforce it. Under the statute the Attorney General doesn't have to, but if he determined to do so, he could then go into a district court and try to enforce the order."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And what would be the Eleventh Amendment situation there, when the commission went into district court to try to enforce its order to require appearing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Oh, I would suggest that there would be no Eleventh Amendment problem there, because the enforcement action would be in the name of and by the United States."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It would be by the United States?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "Yes. It would be in the name of and by the United States. In this case, it would be, for example, United States v. South Carolina State Ports Authority."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How many agencies have a pattern like this, where they determine the rules by rule-making, this kind of adjudication, and a commission-initiated proceeding?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "I know that the Surface Transportation Board, which used to be the NSA Commerce Commission, has this authority, and I think that the Federal Communication Commission does, but I'm not entirely certain of that. I would suggest, if I may, that to uphold the State's claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity in this case will have an adverse effect on the regulatory scheme that the Congress has created in the Shipping Act by undermining the notion of national uniformity in maritime commercial regulations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, Congress could certainly handle that by making it very clear by legislation that if the State runs one of these operations, the State waives its sovereign immunity. Couldn't Congress make that clear?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "I'm not sure if that kind of waiver is still acceptable after this Court's opinions of recent years. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUGHEY",
    "speech": "I would suggest that it's probably not, but we think that, under the statute as it's written now, there's no need for something like that, because it's merely a regulatory action that the commission is attempting to utilize to find facts to determine what constitutes a Shipping Act violation, and again, there's no use of coercive power. In order for there to be coercion, the commission has to go into a Federal district court. If I could reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Very well, Mr. Hughey. Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: States enjoy no sovereign immunity from Federal executive branch action, even when it takes the form of adjudication. It is well-established that States have no immunity from a suit brought by the Federal Government. That's true not because of some preexisting notion of sovereign immunity, but because that consent to suits by the United States Federal Government is implicit in the plan of the convention. Now, proceedings before the Federal Maritime Commission are a necessary predicate for the United States Government to bring a Federal suit to enforce the Shipping Act. Given that the States enjoy no immunity from such a suit, they should not be allowed to reach back into the administrative process and assert an immunity from the preliminary proceedings before the agency."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But I'm not -- I don't understand the argument. Sovereign immunity is based on parties, and we have said that when the United States is a party, there's no sovereign immunity, and not, incidentally, because that was inconsistent with some earlier notion of sovereign immunity, because the Constitution changed it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "No --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But here we have a private party. That's all -- isn't that all the difference in the world?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "But we have a private party that's not initiating a lawsuit, but is initiating executive action. Private parties are free to complain to the Federal Government and say a State government is violating Federal law. In fact, the Petition Clause rightly protects the individual petitioner's right to petition the Federal Government and complain about that violation. Now, I don't think it violates the Constitution for the United States Federal Government to say, we take citizen complaints seriously, and we're going to investigate each and every one of them, and I wouldn't think that it would violate the Eleventh Amendment for the Attorney General to give the party who's the subject of the complaint, even if it's the State, an opportunity to come before --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "-- the executive branch and explain why there wasn't a violation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But the commission isn't just like kind of an ombudsman here. I mean, it's got very definite procedures that greatly resemble adjudication."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, they do resemble adjudication, and that's part of the process to formalize and regularize this process of getting complaints from citizens and response from others, but I don't think the formalization and regularization of that process turns it into a judicial act. It remains an act --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, isn't it the case that if the State defaults and says, you have no jurisdiction over me, and the commission therefore comes to a conclusion -- we'll leave the word adjudication out of it. It comes to a conclusion. That conclusion itself is enforceable as such, at the behest of the National Government, in a district court, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, first I want to clarify something. If there's a case where the State doesn't appear, and the private party is asserting a view of the Shipping Act that's contrary to the view of the Federal Maritime Commission, then there will be no order."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let's assume it's not contrary. Let's assume the Maritime Commission says, you, private party, are right, and we hold that the State has committed the following violations, and I presume should be enjoined from further commission, whatever order it might come up with. Once the commission has come to such a conclusion, isn't that conclusion, as such, enforceable at the behest of the United States in the district court?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "It is -- it would be enforceable through a judicial procedure under the Shipping Act."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So -- if that is so, there's something much more involved here than merely an agency of the National Government taking a complaint seriously and investigating it, and the difference is that in the -- under the act, its conclusion on the investigation becomes an enforceable order at the behest of the National Government in a district court, and isn't that the difference?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "But I don't think it's a critical difference, because the reason that that becomes enforceable, subject to whatever defenses there are, the reason that becomes enforceable is not because it's the midway point in some litigation. It's enforceable because it reflects the executive branch's definitive interpretation of the Shipping Act. The cease-and-desist order --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, the Federal Government could have an interpretation of the Shipping Act and go into it -- assuming there is otherwise a statutory jurisdiction here, the National Government could have a view of the shipping Act and go into the district court and say, this is our considered view, and the other party would have an opportunity to oppose it. We'd have a lawsuit. As things stand now, when the United States goes in with what you call its considered view, that is the end of the issue on the merits, as I understand it. The only thing the district court is there for is to enforce it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, there are some challenges that can be brought to that, and I guess the problem with this --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Could they have a trial de novo on the merits?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "No, they can't, under the current system."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Could they collaterally attack and say, look, it doesn't mean anything to us, because we can't be hauled in front of the commission by a private party. Can it -- is such a plea recognized?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "I don't think it currently is, but if that's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, I don't think it is, either, and that's why your argument that this is nothing but a way for the National Government to take a considered view of a complaint and come to a conclusion seems to me beside the point."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, it -- but the point, I think -- first of all, if the problem is the level of review that's given at the end of the process, then that's what should be adjusted, not throwing out the entire proceeding ab initio as the Fourth Circuit did. But more to the point, I think the reason there's deference is because it reflects the executive branch's view, and it's the same in that order whether it's the product of a privately initiated complaint and adjudication, or whether it's an agency-initiated complaint. In both cases there's going to be practical pressure for the State-regulated entity to participate in the proceeding, but neither should they get an immunity. The practical pressure is not the same as the compulsive process that the judiciary has. Nobody's summoned before the commission because a summons is necessarily enforced through the contempt power of the court. This is --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, Mr. Clement, when I began to read your brief and I sensed that the sky was falling, and so I was turning my pages to see all of the horrible things that were going to happen to the Federal scheme if the court of appeals judgment stood, and I didn't see much there. There's the Vending Stand Act in one of the circuit courts, but do Federal agencies call Governors before them all the time and say, well now, Governor, you're not enforcing the Federal laws? I don't see that as part of our constitutional tradition. I don't see that we would create a great revolution in traditional practice by pulling the Ninth Circuit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "What there is a tradition of is the executive branch having the flexibility to determine how it is going to enforce Federal law. There aren't many of these cases precisely because there just aren't that many State-run entities that are regulated, but the executive branch has the flexibility to regulate them through rule-making, through agency-initiated adjudications, or through private adjudications. In each one of those, there are practical pressures to participate. In each one of those, the rule- making can be initiated by a private complaint. There's a specific provision in the commission's regulation to allow rule-makings to be kicked off by a private complaint, but that doesn't turn it into something other than the executive branch's determination of what the law is and how it should be enforced, and this Court has generally deferred to the executive branch's need to determine how best to take care that the laws are faithfully executed."

    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "I mean, but one thing that's certainly clear about the labor board is that that's a perfect example of an administrative agency that decides to proceed by adjudication."

  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, another example is the Railway Labor Act, because the Railway Labor Act is -- defines its jurisdiction coextensively with the Interstate Commerce Commission. There are State-run railroads under the Railway Labor Act. Typically those kind of employment disputes are initiated by a private party. This court in California v. Taylor said that the Railway Labor Act can apply to a State-run railroad. Interestingly, in footnote 16 of that opinion, the Court reserved the question of whether the Eleventh Amendment provided protection for the suit in court, but it didn't say anything about Eleventh Amendment protection before the board itself, and I think the relevant history here is almost exactly the opposite of the case in Alden. In Alden, this case had a long history of State sovereign immunity, and very few and only recent efforts by the Federal Government to abrogate that immunity. Here, by contrast, there's a 115-year tradition of State entities being subject to regulatory commissions, and very few and only recent efforts to invoke any kind of Eleventh Amendment immunity before them. I also think that the text of the Eleventh Amendment has a special relevance here that it lacked in Alden. In Alden, the determination that State courts not exercise the, quote, judicial power of the United States, only began the analysis of whether or not the States enjoyed their sovereign immunity free from congressional disturbance. Here, the recognition that the commission exercise -- does not exercise the judicial power of the United States necessarily means it exercises the executive power of the United States, and this Court has traditionally held that the executive branch may initiate process against the States without an Eleventh Amendment bar. The fact that this proceeding --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it's not -- you keep speaking about an Eleventh Amendment bar. The bar is sovereign immunity. We're not concerned about the textual limitations about the Eleventh Amendment. We're concerned with sovereign immunity."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "But in this particular context, I think the text is relevant, because this is not a free- floating, pre-existing notion of sovereign immunity. What we're saying is that the Eleventh Amendment waiver in the plan of the Constitution that allows the United States Government to sue a State also allows it to take the preliminary steps in the administrative process."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Dean, we'll hear from you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DEAN",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the question of whether sovereign immunity protects a State from a private suit brought before a Federal administrative tribunal. We have heard today arguments and suggestions that this proceeding is not a suit within the meaning of the doctrine and principle of sovereign immunity. In 1868, this Court addressed this question. It held in Nichols v. United States that a proceeding before an Article I administrative tribunal, a so-called legislative court, just like the Federal Maritime Commission, was a suit for sovereign immunity purposes. The case was appealed from an appeals court. The Court confirmed that legislative court status of the claims court twice, in Ex parte Bakelite in 1929, and then in Williams v. United States in 1933, and later in 1934 the court again, in United States v. Sherwood, unanimously confirmed both conclusions, that States -- that claims court was an Article I legislative court, and its jurisdiction was dependent upon a waiver of sovereign immunity. There were no dissenting justices in any single one of those decisions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Dean, but that was an Article I court that just adjudicates. Here we're being told that the Maritime Commission is in the business of making rules for the governance of people in the trade, and it makes the rules three ways. One through rule-making, another's through commission proceeding, and a third through private complaints, and why couldn't the private complainant be regarded as a kind of delegate to the commission? I take it if the commission itself decided to investigate, you would have no question about sovereign immunity, is that true?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DEAN",
    "speech": "We've made that clear throughout this proceeding, Justice."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right. So why can't the commission say, one of the ways that we investigate is, we listen to what private people tell us, so that in effect we're taking that private complaint and we're making it our own by processing it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DEAN",
    "speech": "That's exactly -- that is exactly what does not happen in this case, Your Honor. A private complainant files a complaint before the Federal Maritime Commission, we receive the notice, we either respond or we're in default. It is quite clear -- and I submit with all due respect that Mr. Clement is absolutely wrong on this. It is quite clear that the agency can find both findings of fact and findings of law against a nonresponding party. That's been established administrative procedure law for sometime and, in fact, the private party controls the disposition of this proceeding. The executive arm of the Federal Maritime Commission, its Bureau of Enforcement, does not even have a right to intervene in the proceeding. It has to petition like any other private party to get involved in the proceeding. They did not do that in this case."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But could a private party say to the commission, commission, here's a serious complaint, something wrong has been done, I don't have the resources to prosecute it, would you please investigate it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DEAN",
    "speech": "Oh, absolutely. That's the way the commission traditionally does business. That is an entirely separate proceeding. That is the proceeding to which we would not object. If a private party came into the commission and said, we have this grievance against the South Carolina State Port Authority and we'd like you to look into it, and the Bureau of Enforcement came to us and said, we think you're doing something wrong, we would obviously talk to them, and if we couldn't reach some kind of accommodation with respect to that matter, then we would -- and they brought a complaint against us, they would be entitled to do that if -- provided the complaint was brought in their names and formed by the United States. And I might add that, in a reparations proceeding -- this is not a sanctionless exercise. In a reparations proceeding, if the agency issues an order against us, a judgment against us, and we fail to comply with that judgment, we incur statutory liabilities, automatic, of up to $25,000 a day. Now, they can be compromised by the agency for a period of 5 years after each violation, if it so chooses, but any time somebody says to me, for example, that if you don't do XYZ you're going to incur an automatic statutory liability of $25,000 a day, I consider that a sanction, and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, is that statutory liability, is that enforceable by the commission without court order, or did it have to go to court to do it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DEAN",
    "speech": "Ultimately, if push comes to shove and there's a confrontation, they have to go to court, but Mr. Chief Justice, I think anybody faced with a statutory liability of the United States imposed by Federal law considers that a sanction, and we do not have the opportunity to protect our interests, to say, no, no, no, this wasn't a violation, this is what we did, when the agency, the only standard for the enforcement of the agency's order in court is whether or not it was duly and regularly issued. So the position of the United States that this is not a -- that this is a proceeding that is essentially equivalent to a petition by a private party for executive action is absolutely incorrect, and they don't even believe that position themselves."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Could I go back to your opening statement? Why is it an exercise of the judicial power of the United States? I mean, we have an ordinary administrative agency. What's the theory of it? I mean, I grant you, I'm sure you're right, that there's some case that said once the court of claims, which is a court in exercising -- though set up under those Article I exercises the judicial power of the United States, so my Constitution says it has nothing to do with whether it's a lawsuit, not a lawsuit, I don't care.

When the ALJ dismissed the complaint in this case, he invited the commission, if the commission deemed the case had merit, satisfying the test in Alden, he invited the commission to initiate a proceeding through its own Enforcement Bureau. The commission did not do so. Instead, they reversed the ALJ's order, which is in turn reversed by the Fourth Circuit. The parties in this, the Federal parties in this case do not challenge the holdings of this case in Nichols, Hans, Sherwood, Alden, or Seminole, so in effect what they're asking this Court to decide is the following three propositions, and all of the following three propositions: that lesser tribunals established under Article I have powers that both State and Federal courts lack, even though they constitutionally may adjudicate only subject to the supervision of the latter; 2) that Congress, merely by assigning a private cause of action to administrative tribunal, acquires and exercises power it does not otherwise have to abrogate State sovereign immunity, thereby bypassing this Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence, and 3) that States lack the reciprocal right to assert sovereign immunity in Federal fora where the immunity of the United States clearly applies."

There was no inquiry. There was no special analysis that the court did to determine whether or not the intervention in that kind of purely executive branch matter was warranted. There was no discussion of that. The court assumed that the doctrine of sovereign immunity as it applied to the Federal Government applied to it, and I might add that --"

In other words, whether we were willing to have our -- to have allegations, whether they be frivolous or serious, against us go unanswered in an administrative tribunal that concededly regulates us in Washington and have as the United States maintains this become a precedent that would affect their dealing with us in the future without defending ourselves, and that's simply not a realistic option for the State of South Carolina.

It operates two airports in the Washington area, so I don't think it's inconceivable that it might do so at some point, but it is clearly -- it is clearly no waiver of sovereign immunity, even if -- even going back to the law where it said the Congress could waive the sovereign immunity of the United States, of the States, I'm sorry, there is no evidence of any intent whatsoever in the Shipping Act to do that. The fact that the Federal Maritime Commission may bring its own actions against the United States -- against the States as it did in the California case proves the opposite proposition, that the Congress, that was the proper way to proceed, and I think that is the proper way to proceed. The -- I'd like to go back to -- this complaint is a verified private complaint. It is -- calls for reparations in the broadest form of reparations, including consequential damages, interest and attorney's fees, the commission has no discretion in the handling of this complaint, it's required by law to adjudicate it, and the agency's findings become final subject only to judicial review.

    "speech": "If I could keep going with your inquiry, Justice Breyer, I think we are suggesting that there is a line in this case, and that line is Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. We're not suggesting that State instrumentalities would never have sovereign immunity in administrative proceedings. Rather, we're suggesting that they might in proceedings in which contempt power can be exercised, and this is not one such proceeding. This agency doesn't have coercive authority over the entities that it regulates. It has to rely on a Federal district court for that. To make another point, I think Mr. Dean emphasized that the Shipping Act allows the agency to fine instrumentalities that don't comply with its order. However, I should point out that in this case the commission has never indicated that it has the authority to fine a State instrumentality for not complying with a reparation order. That was something that ended up in the Fourth Circuit's opinion. We've never said we could do it, and the United States in its reply brief to this Court has specifically expressed the view that the FMC could not fine a State-run court for not complying with the agency- issued reparation order. And finally, with respect to the issue of whether and when the agency's Bureau of Enforcement can intervene in an agency proceeding, I should point out that whether or not the Bureau of Enforcement intervenes in the adjudication does not get to the point of whether it is an agency action, because the agency always retains the ability to review, sua sponte, any administrative law judge order that comes out."
