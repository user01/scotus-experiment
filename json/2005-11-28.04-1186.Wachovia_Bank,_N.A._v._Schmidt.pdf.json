But -- but I'd like to make a preliminary comment before I turn to the substantive points here, which is that nobody has ever suggested, not the Fourth Circuit and not the respondent, any reason why Congress would want the result reached by the Fourth Circuit, in -- in 1887 or in 1948 or any other relevant time, to uniquely restrict the access of national banks to Federal diversity jurisdiction. Indeed, the suggestion is incongruous that Congress would want to do that. National banks are, after all, federally created and federally regulated instrumentalities."

      "speech": "Yes, they -- they might have -- they might have done that. And I -- I acknowledge that this consideration is not controlling, standing by itself, on the case. That is, if the statute plainly and unambiguously called for such an implausible outcome, then we might have a debate about whether an absurd outcome that the plain language calls for is one that should be enforced. But this is a background consideration that I don't think the Court can put aside or deem irrelevant to the outcome of this case. So the key holding of the Fourth Circuit was that the word located has an unambiguous meaning, and it's -- that it's the one adopted by the Fourth Circuit majority and not by the Fourth Circuit dissent, the Fifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Comptroller of the Currency, or anybody else. The battle of the dictionary definition seems to me plainly inconclusive. The biggest problem with the definitions is that they are cast in terms of the location of tangible physical things, a table, a lake, a piece of land; whereas we're dealing here with an incorporeal abstraction, a corporation, the location of which is not necessarily tied to any particular physical presence. Both we and the Government have given Ford Motor Company as an example in the brief. If you ask somebody where is Ford Motor Company located, I venture to say that most people would say Michigan. But when you stop and think about it, it's possible that it could be also located every place where it has manufacturing facilities or sales outlets. The only dictionary definition that I've seen that is specific to the location of an incorporeal entity, and specifically a bank, is the one that's cited in the Chase -- JPMorgan Chase amicus brief, which was taken from the 1951 edition of Black's Law Dictionary, roughly contemporaneous with the enactment of current section 1348, which states that a bank is, quote, located, close quote, in the place specified in its organization certificate. The term also appears many places in the National Bank Act, sometimes meaning a specific headquarters location and sometimes meaning any place where there are physical facilities. And the Court -- this Court itself has given located -- the word located various meanings. In the Bougas case, which is much discussed in the briefs, the Court said that the term has no enduring rigidity, and the Court did not base its decision on the inherent or natural or ordinary meaning of the word located. In Federal Power Commission v. Texaco, which is 377 U.S. 33, the Court interpreted the words in the venue statute for appeals from Federal Power Commission decisions which said the appeal could be taken to the place where the company seeking review was located. Texaco said, well, we have substantial facilities in the Tenth Circuit. This matter that is the subject of this arose in the Tenth Circuit. And the Court looked at the statute and it said, no, located means where -- your place of incorporation. Now --"

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Well, I -- I think we need to go there, at least -- it seems strange to me that you have two different words and if, indeed, established means the same thing that you're telling us located means, I'm not going to agree with you. I mean, they're -- they're two different words --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREY",
      "speech": "Well, established could, I suppose, mean the place of the original charter location, and located could mean the place where -- where the main office is today. They could mean different things. Remember that at every -- at every enactment of this statute, there was no difference between established and located. The terms had no different application because a national bank had only one location, which was the place where it was established. So as a practical matter, there was total parity with State banks because up until 1958 a corporation was a citizen only of the -- its place of incorporation, and there was total parity with national banks because they were -- they were confined to their original State. They could not branch outside their State until 1994. So we are interpreting statutes that were passed for the purpose of achieving parity and at a time when they succeeded in achieving parity. And -- and the Chief Justice's question and -- and your question suggest that today, with the changes in the map of interstate banking, you might have some small lack of total overlap between State banks or other corporations, on the one hand, and national banks. But that is not a reason to say that national banks are citizens of every place where they have any physical presence. And one of the problems with the Fourth Circuit's reading is that it injects substantial ambiguity into the question of where a bank is located. It's -- the Fourth Circuit said branches, but what about where it has an office that's not a branch? What about where it stores -- where it has warehouses that store its records? What about where it has employees?"

I -- I don't think that makes sense. We're -- we're trying to interpret a statute that Congress passed in 1948. At that time, there was complete parity. The fact that in 1958 Congress perceived a problem which is not a problem with national banks, where there was a divergence, a serious divergence, between the place of incorporation and the principal place of business that Congress said we've got to deal with this problem. And so they amended section 1332 in 1958 to deal with that particular problem. That is not a problem that affects national banks. So there's been no occasion.

      "speaker": "FREY",
      "speech": "Well, let me -- let's -- let's go back and -- because Justice O'Connor started me off, and I -- I don't want to fail to get to her question. The first statute was the 1882 statute. The 1882 statute unambiguously stated that the jurisdiction shall be the same as and not other than the jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not organized under any law of the United States. So the -- the purpose of Congress was to -- to give national banks access to diversity jurisdiction on the same basis as State banks. And that -- in the Leather Manufacturers Bank case, that was recognized by the Court. Then in 1887, Congress went to a different wording totally. It injected the word location. And I -- I should point out that the 1882 statute was in the Bank Act and the 1887 statute was in the Judiciary Act. So it was -- it's not clear what they thought they were doing with the 1882 statute when they adopted the 1887 statute. But it is clear what this Court said they were doing in the Petri case. This Court said no reason is perceived why it should be held that Congress intended that national banks should not resort to Federal tribunals as other corporations and individual citizens might. It then said further on, on page 651 of 142 U.S., the clause was intended to have and must receive the same effect and operation as that of the proviso to the fourth section of the act of July 12, 1882. And finally, they close by saying, no limitation in the regard of access to Federal diversity jurisdiction was intended. Then we have the 1911 codification, and in -- and after 1911, we have several Supreme Court cases, including the Mitchell case, which again says that the codification worked no change. It says, the Court held that as to suits with -- within the specified exceptions, national banks were, by the acts of 1882 and 1887, put on the same basis in respect of jurisdiction as if they had not been organized under an act of Congress. And then in 1948, you have the reenactment or the codification of the current judicial code, not intended to work any change in the meaning of the statute."

The paragraph that contained established and the paragraph that contained located were enacted in separate years. They concerned separate subjects, and they were always treated as separate provisions until the recodification of the judicial code in 1911. And that recodification stated in its explicit text that the provisions were -- were to continue to carry the substantive meaning that they had beforehand and that the arrangement of the provisions were purely -- was purely for convenience. And so I don't think it's fair to say that because established and located happen to appear in the same provision of section 1348 that they necessarily should be given different meanings."

For example, it determines where the bank is located with respect to what interest rates it might charge under 12 U.S.C. 85, and that's an issue that this Court confronted a few terms ago in the Smiley case and also in the Marquette case. But there are other provisions that refer to the -- the location of a national banking association, and in all of those we think, as a starting point, the location would be the main office, and in some situations, it would also encompass branch locations. For purposes of this provision, we don't think that the location would encompass branch locations. And one reason, in particular, is because the subject that section 1348 deals with is the State citizenship of a national banking association. And the concept of citizenship has always been thought to require a distinctive association with a State and, in particular, has been thought to require something more than mere physical presence in a State. That's always been the rule with respect to national persons, and of particular significance, it's always been a rule with respect -- it's always been the rule with respect to corporations. And Congress defined national banking associations as, quote, a body corporate, close quote, in 12 U.S.C. 24."

But we think the better reading is that the specific governs the general, and therefore, that section 1348, which specifically deals with the question of national bank citizenship, would govern over the 1332(c) which more generally deals with the question of corporate citizenship."

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Chief Justice, I want to follow up on a point you -- you were on about this thing about an association. Before I do that, I want -- I want to say so I'll be sure I don't forget it. Wachovia, according to -- I think we've got it in our papers that we filed in opposition to the petition -- has 179 branches in South Carolina. But it -- but it is important, as -- as you pointed out, Mr. Chief Justice, that a national bank is not a corporation, but it is a association formed under Federal law. So there's no State to which this Court can look or anybody can look to determine what their citizenship is. In fact, in the Langdeau case, they said it was a quasi-public institution, national in character. So it's not a -- it's not a State corporation. It's got no ties to a State corporation. So if it's going to have citizenship for diversity purposes, Congress has got to say how we going to figure that out. And that's what they did in 1448. This Court, in a series of cases back in the mid-'80's, was faced with the -- with the issue of how do you determine the citizenship of a corporation, and it went back and forth but finally came down with a doctrine that said a corporation will be deemed a citizen of the State in which it is incorporated. And then in 1958, Congress enacted 1332 and added the additional clause of principal place of business. Now, given that it is a national association and it's not a State corporation, it was necessary for Congress to legislate and enact a statute so we could determine how it would have diversity. And that's what they did in 28-1448. And going to the question Justice Scalia asked, do we have to go back and look at all of this statutory history -- and you can believe I've been looking at it a lot more than I'd like to have lately. It kind of ruined my holiday."

When Congress enacts a statute that says you are deemed to be a citizen of a State -- let me be sure I read it right here -- deemed to be a citizen of the State in which you're respectively located, I don't know how Congress can speak much clearer."

If -- if we assume that that is not the only possible reading of that statute, why in the world would Congress have wanted to impose the -- the system that follows from -- from your result in which the -- the national banks are -- are excluded from diversity jurisdiction to a degree that the State banks clearly are not?"

No question about it. But if -- if we assume that it's not an absolute necessity, we -- we try to avoid freakish results, and this seems like a freakish result. And I take it your answer is it may be a freakish result. We're not claiming that Congress intended it. But that still leaves us, I think, with the problem of a -- a reading which is not absolutely necessary that does produce a freakish result. And if that's the case, why shouldn't you lose?"

      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "No. The question is why would Congress -- let's assume we have a choice between two readings.

What earthly reason would there be for Congress wanting to do that?"

      "speaker": "GILREATH",
      "speech": "I can't -- I can't give you a reason for that. I -- I would suggest that they -- they don't want to give greater access one way or the other, but they've got to write a statute. And when they wrote the statute, nobody had in mind what the branch banking system was going to be today. And so now what this Court is faced with is they are looking at a statute that, when you read it literally, says that they ought to be deemed to be a citizen of South Carolina if they have a branch in South Carolina."

If you ask somebody where Ford Motor is located, they're likely to respond by saying, well, what do you mean? Do you mean their headquarters? Do you mean the -- the plant down the street? Do you mean the dealership? It does suggest that located doesn't have the clear meaning that you rely on."

If you're going out to buy a Ford car, then you obviously would want to know where it's located other than in Michigan. You'd want to know where the nearest Ford dealership is. Located, obviously, can have several meanings, but that's one of the points, I think, that Judge Luttig made in his opinion, is you've got to look at it in the context in which it is said in the statute. And looking at the statute, in the context in which the word located is there, it says where -- in -- in the States where it's located. Now, there are other places in the statute, which I'm sure they will argue or have argued in their brief, that -- that say, you know, it's located, when they're talking about a bank -- a branch bank where you can do insurance or whatever, that it can -- it can sell insurance in any branch where -- where it's located, and that means another meaning to locate.

Just as you wouldn't think if -- if you're asking, you know, where does the Ford Motor Company manage its -- its operations from, you wouldn't think from multiple States. So here when you're talking about citizenship, why doesn't this argument of context cut precisely against you? We're talking about citizenship. People aren't citizens of -- of 50 States.

The -- according to the brief by, I think, the ABA or one of the amicus, they've got something like 3,600 branches. Now, they come into South Carolina, they're taking -- if I bank with them, they're taking my money and the -- and the money of other millions of South Carolinians and -- who -- who are entrusting their money to them, as opposed to entrust it to a State court, and if I'm banking with them, I've got to go sue them in -- in Federal court.

All of those statutes have been repealed. The parity argument is gone. If -- if Congress had wanted parity, then where is parity in section 1448? It's not there.

If we presume that normally a citizen is a citizen of only one place -- there are multiple -- there are other situations where you have a dual citizen -- and that you would normally assume they're only a citizen in one place, then Congress, in order to solve the problem of corporate headquarters in the private commercial world, corporate headquarters, a main piece of business, went out of its way to say corporations shall be deemed to be a citizen of two places -- they made a special statute when they could be a citizen of two places, which overcomes the presumption that it's a citizen of only one place. But there's nothing to overcome the presumption that in 1348 they're assuming each citizen has only one place of citizenship because that statute just used the word respectively. It talks about many banks but in -- respectively citizens of -- of different States. But I think that's fully consistent with the notion, sort of the basic background notion, that one person has one -- one citizenship; one corporation has only one place of citizenship."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GILREATH",
      "speech": "I -- I can't argue with you, but I -- I still come back, you know, to the statute. I -- I think -- I think the real problem here is that you've got a statute that was enacted in 1948 that really, if you go back and look, it goes back to 1911. And obviously, in 1911, nobody knew the proliferation of branch banking that was going to take place. Nobody knew the proliferation of branch banking that was going to take place in -- in 1948 when it was enacted. And I think the real decision that this Court has got to make is whether you -- you read the statute and apply it or either whether you're going to leave it to Congress to -- to make that change. I'm not -- and -- and you may -- you may apply it the way I'm arguing, and I hope you do. And it may be -- and -- and if you do, then the national banking associations, with all the clout they've got, can go over here across the street to Congress and they can get it changed. And you can bet they probably will be trying. But I think the real question is -- is are you going to read the statute for what it says or are you going to, you know, give it the reading they want by going back in all this history and twisting and turning to get to the point they want to get to. They even -- I think this is one point I want to make is if you look at their brief, right at the last page of their brief -- and I think this highlights the -- the problem that you've got is they say you don't need to go so far as to determine two places. They just want you to determine one place. And I think that highlights the fact of how far they're trying to stretch the rubber band on this word to -- to get the -- get the meaning that they want. They -- they say that ought to be left for another day. And so I come back that the -- the ordinary meaning of the word located should -- should put it in each State. The -- I -- I think this -- I come back and I think the statute is unambiguous. And that leads me to the -- the Bougas case, which was talked about a little bit. It's not very often that you have a statute where this Court has already ruled, as it did in Bougas some 28 years ago, a -- a virtually identical statute dealing with the banking laws. They -- they try to say, well, the in pari materia doctrine ought not to apply, but I mean, you've got a statute there that's a -- a banking statute, admittedly dealing with venue, where this Court found the same meaning that we would like for it to find here. The courts -- and -- and their argument about established and located completely goes away because the Court said whatever the reason behind the distinction in those two words, it does exist and we recognize it. And -- and even if you say, well, in pari materia doesn't apply -- and that's what they argue. Judge Luttig said, well, it -- it's -- still there's some authority that similar statutes should apply. And here, we have a decision that's construing an almost identical statute. It reaches the conclusion that -- that we would like. In summary, kind of the way I look at it it's kind of like in 1948 the Congress tailored a citizenship suit of clothes for national banks, and -- and that suit of clothes, a pattern of which was laid out even back into the -- the 19th century, still fits the bill today. It's old. It's a 57-year-old suit of clothes, and -- but it still -- it can still work. It may not work the way the banks want it to work, but it will work. And if the banks want to get a new suit of clothes for jurisdiction, then they need to go over across the street here to Congress and let it make that enactment. If you have no further questions, that concludes my argument."

For instance, Sun Trust is a bank that's comparable in scope to Wachovia. It has operations in many States. It has many branches, I assume, in South Carolina. And yet, it is a citizen only of its home State, its State of incorporation, or principal place of business. If there were a problem of abuse of relocation, which I think the Court was a little bit worried about, Congress would deal with it the way they dealt with the abuses of corporate -- stated place of incorporation by passing 1332(c).

I think Langdeau says it means the same thing there. Let me just, in the brief time I have left, on in pari materia, which is at the heart of Justice Scalia's question about the Bougas case. Let me just cite two cases to the Court that I think are instructive on this, United States against Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, and Fort Stewart Schools, 495 U.S. 641, both refusing to apply the in pari materia doctrine where you had quite comparable statutes.
