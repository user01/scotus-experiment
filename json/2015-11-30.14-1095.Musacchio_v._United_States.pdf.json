We've invited that in a footnote in our brief. You declined the invitation, which is entirely your prerogative, but that is an issue that will have to be briefed. I agree with you, it is not the clearest of statutes, but suffice it to say, the way this issue has been brought to this Court, it has been assumed by the Fifth Circuit, assumed by the government, and I believe assumed by the Ninth Circuit that they are discrete and independent elements that would be separately and distinctly proven."

I would also point out that the ­­ the clarity of Congress's language goes to, are you limiting the court, as opposed to merely requiring bringing the claim within a certain period of time, but without specifying the consequence of failure.

I believe the easiest way to reach the ­­ to deal with this case is on the Wood and Day line of cases, where you have already held that a limitations period cannot be forfeited, only waived, and that's in the habeas context, admittedly. The ­­ the sides are flipped. But where the government in the habeas context inadvertently fails to raise a limitations period, it is still allowed to bring that up on appeal. The court, on appeal, is allowed to raise that sua sponte. I think this case is stronger, once again, on every score than Day. And, consequently, if Day is good law, this case is almost a fortiori the same result. And one need not give it any further analysis than that, that if the government has to affirmatively waive a limitations objection to a habeas petition, then Petitioner, who has so much more at stake, should have to affirmatively waive a limitations objection to indictment.

The court of appeals said that ­­ that if, you know, the ­­ the only error here was the erroneous jury instruction, and if that jury instruction had any effect in this case, it worked only to the benefit of the defendant. I mean, Petitioner here really got a trial that was ­­ that was biased in his favor, which is very unusual for ­­ for ­­ for a defendant. And what he's trying to do is ­­ is piggyback off of a trial that was biased in his favor and nonetheless, you know, sort of piggyback on that error and get ­­ get a ­­ an appeal that's ­­ that's in his favor."

And in the habeas context, that rule doesn't apply. If you look at the Court's analysis in one of the habeas cases, which was drawn on by the other, the Day v. McDonough case, the Court emphasized that its holding was valid there because, in part, there was no rule to the contrary. Here you have a rule to the contrary. I think the second point that could be made on those ­­ on that ­­ on this front is that the habeas context is special. And I think the Court's decisions in both Day and in Wood v.

      "speech": "As I recall, Your Honor, I think ­­ I think there's a ­­ there's a couple of reasons. The strongest is that the difference in the habeas context is that the record can be developed. When you're looking at a case on Rule 52(b), this Court has always treated review under 52(b) as being limited to the existing record, whereas in habeas case, the record can be developed. And that's very important in two fundamental ways. First, it's important to know why the defense was not raised by the defendant at the appropriate time. The ­­ the defendant is going to have ­­ and including in this case, could have a very strategic reason for not raising the defense during the trial. And I can get into that in ­­ in ­­ in this particular case if the Court is interested. In the second ­­ so that's one reason why it's important to have a record. And the second reason is the government has to have the ability to ­­ to introduce evidence if it wants to rebut or establish compliance with the statute­of­limitations defense. That's what this Court said in Cook. In Cook the whole point of the case was that it's unfair to ­­ to allow for a ­­ a ­­ a indictment to be dismissed on a demurrer because that would deprive the government of its right to reply and give evidence to establish compliance with the statute of limitations once the defense is raised. So on ­­ on direct review, the record would be frozen and you wouldn't be able to look out outside the record, whereas on habeas you would be able to look outside the record. And in addition, I think the ­­ it's very important to ­­ to sort of look at the theoretical basis for the ­­ the error and ­­ and ­­ and recognize that it doesn't satisfy Rule 52(b) in the way that that rule has ­­ has traditionally been thought about. First of all, Rule 52(b) is generally about things that the trial judge is supposed to notice on his own. And what this Court has said about statute of limitations, including in the Day case, is that the trial court doesn't have an obligation to serve as the ­­ the co­counsel or the paralegal for ­­ for the defendant. It doesn't have an obligation to go searching through the record and finding potential defenses for the defendant. Rather, that's something that the defendant himself has an obligation to do."

      "speech": "On the issue of whether or not the jury instructions are binding, several points: First of all, the confusion persists to this day. Just as Justice Alito is pointing out that it's very difficult to see the difference between unauthorized and exceeding authorized access, that too would have infected the jury. We could not prove it sufficiently to show prejudice, but they cannot prove it sufficiently to show harmlessness or inevitability of a conviction had you not so instructed them. Second of all, I believe that Jackson v. Virginia talks from a jury­centric perspective. The issue is not the statute. The issue is whether a rational jury could have done what they did. And that only works if you look at the instructions. It does not work if you look at some hypothetical statute that they didn't think they were applying. They thought they were doing something different. Third, their objection that we ­­ we acknowledged that this was only about unauthorized access is curious because he cites the appellate stuff where there was new counsel, yet his own side's briefs at the trial level recognized that trial counsel was confused. Yes, after that confusion was resolved post­verdict, we argued. Okay. The government abandoned it. That's fine. We absolutely argued that. But at trial the harm was already done. They confused themselves, they confused the jury, and apparently confused the judge. Third, it seems to me that the phrase \"unauthorized access\" is not actually even in the statute, which just goes to my point that there would be confusion as to access without authorization and access exceeding authorization. Both could have theoretically been part of the rubric of unauthorized access. Neither would be authorized there. The ­­ moving onto the ­­ well, I guess the last thing I'd say is every court to consider the question, if this had been in the original indictment where it also said \"and\" and in the jury instructions, every court to consider this issue, including the Fifth Circuit below, including the First Circuit, would have held the government to it. I don't think the government denies that. They just say if it's in the indictment alone they can do either/or. But if it's in the indictment and in the instructions, they concede that the so­called law of the case is binding. The easy way for this Court to ­­"

      "speech": "Law of the case is a terrible name. We unfortunately didn't come up with it. The government ­­ we both agree that it's not an accurate descriptor. It's just the phrase that's been used in all the cases. At the end of the day, the issue is are the instructions binding at the sufficiency stage whatever court you're in? That's really the issue. The law­of­the­case cases don't really apply because they're misnamed. Turning to the statute of limitations, what I'd say is this: There is error when something is contrary to law whether or not it was the judge's obligation to raise that. The Apprendi ­­ the post­Apprendi cases are the best examples of this. The judge is applying pre­Apprendi law. It did not make a mistake. We're not expected to anticipate Apprendi. Yet on appeal those cases were considered erroneous because this Court adopted Apprendi. Again, it is not about whether you made an objection or whether the Court should have thought of it themselves. It is about the merits of the result, and in this instance, we claim the statute of limitations was violated. That is the error regardless of who needed to raise it. Talking about raising the issue: Again, calling the statute of limitations the affirmative defense is a little misleading. It is not an affirmative defense. One has to plead it. One ­­ but the government has to actually prove that they satisfy it. It is a hybrid kind of creature, and Cook and those cases deal with pleading because they wanted the government to have the opportunity to respond. We do not disagree. The government should have the opportunity to respond, and in the First Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit, if there is some need for evidentiary submissions, they just remand it. Get it done more quickly with the court that actually heard the case, which makes a lot more sense than waiting till habeas."
