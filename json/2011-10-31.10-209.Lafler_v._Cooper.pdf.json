      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three points that I would like to press this morning regarding deficient plea advice. First, this Court has consistently limited the effective assistance right to ensuring the reliability of the proceedings where a defendant is adjudicated guilty and sentenced. Mere outcome is not the Strickland prejudice standard. Second, when asserting an ineffective assistance claim, the defendant - -"

The second point that I wanted to press this morning was that when asserting an ineffective assistance claim, a defendant must show deprivation of a substantive or procedural right, and this Court has already held that a defendant has no right to a plea bargain. Third, every possible remedy for deficient plea advice creates intractable problems demonstrating the right - -"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "Justice Sotomayor, the -- the not guilty plea is an assertion of the defendant's constitutional rights. It's invoking the right to trial that the Sixth Amendment contemplates. And so this situation is really more like Fretwell. It's not a decision that you have, for example, whether to have a jury or not to have a jury, or whether to have this attorney appointed for your counsel or not, because in each of those cases you have an underlying substantive or procedural constitutional right; and you have no right to a plea. And so this fork in the road is really an illusory one, because you have no right to choose the other side of the fork."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
      "speech": "Suppose this were a death -- a death case, and roughly the same facts, failure - - failure to communicate. And that leaves me just one other question based on your opening remarks. We can think about adjudication as having a constitutional violation, injury, and remedy. Are you saying that there was a violation in the abstract here but no injury, or was there a violation and an injury but just no remedy?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "Yes, I'm saying that there's no violation, because in order to prove a Sixth Amendment violation, you have to demonstrate unreliability of the adjudicatory process. I'm also saying that there's no reasonable remedy, and I'll talk about that in a minute. With respect to the death penalty in particular, I would refer this Court right back to the Fretwell decision, because there, too, defendant and his counsel had an opportunity to raise a Collins objection that would have changed the sentence to avoid the death penalty in that case. Collins obviously was overruled before habeas process, and this Court held that the defendant could not use the vehicle of an ineffective assistance claim to regain that lost opportunity because he had no constitutional right in it. And so, really the remedy -- I'm sorry. The severity of the sentence doesn't enter the analysis once you've established that there has been no violation."

    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. We have conceded for purposes of argument that there was ineffective assistance. But Strickland is a two-part test, and even after you get past the deficiency prong, there's still the question of whether this casts some doubt on the reliability of the proceedings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
      "speech": "Well, I thought that the second part of the test asked about harm. And here the person is sitting in prison for three times as long as he would have been sitting in prison had he had effective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining stage. So, why doesn't that just meet the requirements of Strickland, both deficiency and prejudice?"

      "speech": "Sounds like a good argument."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "Well, the reason why it's wrong is because this Court has been very careful to define what that harm is. Specifically, the word was \"outcome\" in Cronic and Strickland. If you - -"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",

      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "Yes, but the Court went on to define \"outcome\" to mean reliability of the adjudicatory process. In fact, specifically, the language was whether absent the deficiency, the defendant -- I'm sorry. Absent the deficiency, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt. And what we have here is a situation where everyone acknowledges - -"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
      "speech": "Well, take the sentencing cases. The sentencing cases, the determination of guilt is over, and the question is, is this person sitting in jail for 1 day longer because his counsel was ineffective? And if he is, we would find prejudice there. So, why isn't the same thing true here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "Well, I don't believe it's quite that simple. If there was some legal error, you know, an error to which he had a constitutional right, then certainly what you said is exactly true. But if you're talking about more or less days because of, for example, a judge thinking that the -- the difference between crack and cocaine sentences was not appropriate or other things that are really up to the discretion of the trial court judge, Strickland says absolutely those things are not Sixth Amendment violations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
      "speech": "Well, I guess I don't understand that answer, because that answer seems to suggest that the -- that the assistance being provided was not ineffective. But here, as Justice Ginsburg notes, you've conceded that the assistance is ineffective. That assistance has led to a much, much, much longer sentence. You know, as opposed to some of the sentencing cases suggest that 24 hours is enough, this is 10 years or something. And, you know, that should be the end of the game, no?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "Well, let's try another sentencing hypothetical, where it's clear that there was deficient performance. Say that there's a local trial court judge and everyone knows that he has a certain predilection that if you like the local sports team, he's going to give you a break. If the attorney comes in and he does not press the argument that this convicted defendant likes the local sports team, he gets a higher sentence, that's still not a Sixth Amendment violation. Really, once you shift to sentencing, the question is, were you legally entitled to the result? And simply because he failed to appeal to the right discretionary tendencies of the trial court doesn't really make a difference. Here we're talking, obviously, about the guilt phase, and it's much easier here because it says clearly in Strickland and Cronic and Kimmelman and many, many other cases that that outcome difference, the harm difference, has to be reliability of the process itself. It's a process - -"

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "You acknowledge, though, that it's ineffective assistance of counsel if you're - - well, no, I guess you haven't acknowledged. Let me ask you: Have you provided ineffective assistance of counsel if you are a lousy bargainer? You're just no good at the -- you know, at -- I don't know -- the game of bargaining. And so, you do a bad job in bargaining down the sentence, I mean a notoriously bad job. Is that ineffective assistance of counsel?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "Under the Court's first prong of Strickland, you would have to look at whatever the standards of professional practice were, and depending how lousy the bargainer was, it could or could not be deficient. But the important thing is if it didn't have any effect on the subsequent trial and sentencing, then it would not be a Sixth Amendment violation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Well, I don't even agree with the first part. I don't think our legal process is -- is a bargaining game. Shouldn't be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "Well, we could agree with that. Bargaining is not what this is about, and that's why this Court has held in Weatherford and other cases that there is no right to the plea bargain itself. And that's really the second - -"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
      "speech": "You can -- you can agree with that when 95 percent of the criminal cases are disposed of by way of bargaining?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "Because in the 95 percent of cases that are disposed of that way, this Court has already held in Padilla and Hill that there is a constitutional right to have effective counsel when you're accepting that plea. And the difference is when you're accepting a plea, you're being convicted. That is the conviction. And this Court frequently establishes different tests when you're waiving a right, for example the right to go to trial, versus invoking a right, going to trial."

But what I would submit respectfully is that the plea stage isn't any different than a preliminary hearing or a line-up or a suppression hearing, where if there was some deficient attorney conduct, this Court would still then look to see whether it had an adverse impact on the adjudication of guilt."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "No, the difference -- that's not the difference at all. It seems to me the difference is when you plead guilty you deprive yourself of the 24-karat test of fairness, which is trial by jury before nine people who have to find you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. When you plead guilty, you give up that. When you don't plead guilty, you get what is the best thing in our legal system. You can't do any better than that."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "That's exactly right. And let's talk about the two remedies that are most frequently bandied about in the circuit courts. The first is to order a new trial. And to us, it makes no sense to order a second trial after you've already had a first error-free trial. In addition, you think about these habeas cases; if you're issuing a habeas writ and vacating a sentence 8 or 9 years after the fact, like you are here, essentially you're releasing the defendant, because witnesses will die, they'll move away, memories will be sparse. And so, that's the natural effect of that. And in Cooper's brief, he doesn't even advocate for a second trial; he asks for specific performance. The problem with that is there you're infringing on the prosecutor's discretion, which is sacred, to say what his plea offer is going to be. And circumstances have changed once a trial has taken place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Well, \"sacred\" is a little strong, don't you think? I mean, it is a -- to some extent, unfair to the prosecutor because he knows already he's got a guilty verdict in his pocket, and he has to go back. But why is it so terribly difficult to tell the defendant he has a right to accept that offer if he wants, but then go through the normal process, which is it has to be approved by a judge and all that stuff? I don't see what's terribly difficult about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "We contend it violates the separation of powers. But you bring up an important point because circumstances have changed in two respects. The first is that you learn more information. So, here, for example, the prosecutor learned that not only did Mr. Cooper shoot Kali Mundy, but he did it while she was screaming and running away from him. That's a changed circumstance. He might not give the same plea. Even more so in Frye, where they learned that he was picked for another criminal violation after the plea was given, and the prosecutor testified that he would have taken the plea back when he knew that. But the bigger changed circumstance is the trial itself, because the prosecutor has now gone through the risk of having an acquittal. He has also put, for example, the 8-year-old sexual abuse defendant on the stand, something he tried to avoid with the plea offer. And it truly is an egg that cannot be unscrambled. And unless there are further questions, I will reserve of the balance of my time."

And to collaterally attack his convictions or his sentence based on allegedly ineffective assistance of counsel, he has to show that the ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced him. As this Court's Strickland cases have used that term, that means he has to show that a reviewing court should lack confidence in the proceeding that produced the convictions or the sentence."

And so, there's nothing that I could find in the cases. Nothing in the Sixth Amendment itself. In 95 percent of the cases, they do plead guilty. And what's the problem about ordering the prosecution to simply repeat the offer he gave before? Well, I mean, I don't really see if there - - and prejudice? What if a person's been executed? If he had gotten the -- if he had gotten the plea offer, he would have pled guilty for 50 years in jail, okay? That's my imaginary case. I can think of one where there's prejudice. He's dead.

It is crystal clear that if he'd heard it, he would have accepted it. Okay? I'm trying to separate out difficulties of this case, which strikes me as difficult because of the facts, from the principle.

So, where the amendment doesn't speak of it, where the misbehavior of the lawyer is crystal clear, where it's 48 years more in prison, what is it that bars what seems to me obvious that an inadequate assistance of counsel, remedial through a specific decree saying reinstitute the offer, led to enormous unfairness and prejudice?"

So, it's not an outcome -- it's not a narrow comparison of outcomes. What you look at is how the sentence was produced. Is this defendant entitled, had this -- to a lesser sentence?

If he can show that and he can show that a better lawyer with a better strategy would produce a different result, then the Sixth Amendment entitles that person to a new proceeding. The Sixth Amendment never entitles the person to have a court order a particular sentence. And you can't use the prosecutor's offer made at a different time as the benchmark and say, well, the prosecutor was okay with it at this other time; therefore, the prosecution must be forced to live with it now. And that's because a plea offer rests on a number of considerations: the need to obtain the defendant's cooperation in other cases; the desire to spare the witnesses and the victim the burdens of trial; and, frankly, to avoid the risk of an acquittal. And the prosecution in this case and in cases like this one, where there has been a reliable conviction and reliable sentencing, the prosecution has already incurred all of those burdens. So, to look at the 51-month minimum offer that was made 8 years ago and have that be the benchmark simply is not something that this Court has ever done in its Strickland cases.

So, there is -- and this claim was raised specifically on Sixth Amendment grounds from the very beginning of the appeal until it reached this Court.

A favorable plea bargain is offered, caps the guy's possible sentence at, let's say, 3 years. The defense attorney says: We've got a great shot at an acquittal. Let's go to trial. I'm going to rip the prosecution's witnesses apart. The trial turns out to be a disaster. Convicted on all counts, 25 years.

He knows he's going to have that prosecutor in court the next day and really beat him. He thinks he's going to soften him up. So, he doesn't communicate it to the client, and the prosecutor later says withdrawn. We're going to have inquiries post hoc on all of these negotiations and discussions.

He shot her, you know, below the waist. Maybe that is not such a bad strategy."

      "speech": "Thank you. I'd like to start at the one point where I think all of us, including counsel on both sides, agree, and that's that a second trial after an error-free first trial doesn't make sense. And that right there says a lot about Mr. Cooper's case, because a Strickland remedy is typically a new trial. And it's exceedingly strange that they're now saying that I don't want a new trial. That demonstrates that what they are claiming is not a Strickland violation. I would like to address, Justice Breyer, your suggestion that maybe you could have specific performance of the plea; and if it's rejected, then the trial result could simply be re-imposed. And the question is: Well, what's the problem with that? And I can tick off at least five. First, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, it takes away the prosecutor's ability to withdraw the plea, which he or she undeniably would have had the right. Second, as Justice Alito said, it ignores that there's information that could be learned in the interim. Mr. Cooper shot three or four other people. Third, it ignores the fact that an error-free trial has taken place. The prosecutor has taken the risk of putting that 8-year-old sexual abuse victim on the stand, and you cannot take that risk away. Fourth, as I already mentioned, we've got the separation of powers issue and prosecutorial discretion. Fifth, we're going to have intractable problems. Say the offer was plead to A, we'll dismiss B. He rejects it based on deficient advice. You go to trial. He is convicted on A and acquitted on B. And now we're going to try to enforce the plea on A? I mean, that's almost a double jeopardy problem. So, there's intractable problems. The second point I want to make is about the death situation. And that's one we take very seriously. And, Justice Alito, it may be that in a death penalty situation, there could be a due process right or some other constitutional right that may mitigate in favor of requiring something to be put on the record. But what's clear is that, under this Court's existing precedent, that is not a Strickland violation because the amount of the sentence, whether it's death or 50 years, has nothing to do with the reliability of the adjudicatory proceeding and the sentence. Finally, the last point that I want to make is something else on which we can all agree. Mr. Cooper is guilty of shooting Kali Mundy. He also got exactly the sentence that the people prescribed for the crime that committed. There is very little unfair about holding him to that sentence. As Justice Kennedy said, it's the position of Mr. Cooper that it is unfair to have a fair trial. And from our perspective, that is really the beginning and the end of this inquiry. And unless you have any further questions - -"

      "speech": "I have one, but it's more appropriate, I think, for the Government of the United States. Under the Federal rules, Rule 11, there has to be a colloquy before a plea is entered. Do you think the Federal rules and perhaps State rules should be amended so that judges, trial judges, before imposing a sentence inquire: Have there been plea offers; have they all been communicated to the defendant? Is that good practice?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSCH",
      "speech": "It could be good practice, but it wouldn't have solved the problem here, because even if they had put the fact of the plea on the record, the problem was the alleged deficient advice that the lawyer gave to the client in private.
