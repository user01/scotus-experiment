Maryland's action did not intrude on Federal authority, primarily for two reasons. The first reason is that Maryland's new resource did not distort the wholesale capacity auction. FERC revised its auction bidding rules to require the Maryland resource to bid on the basis of its cost, backing out any State contract revenue. The developer bid in accordance with the rules and cleared the auction. FERC says that means that the resource is economic, needed, competitive, and does not suppress prices, any State revenue notwithstanding. The second reason is ­­"

So it undertook to have those resources built pursuant to the contract mechanism before you."

FERC revised the rules in 2011 to be clear that the resource had to bid on the basis of its costs without regard to the State revenue. So there was no way for it to suppress prices. If the costs had been too high for the resource, it would never have cleared. It wouldn't have been in the market at all. It was only in the market because it was able to clear on the basis of its cost, which showed it was efficient. And FERC made that finding. FERC found it needed, competitive, and not suppressive of prices notwithstanding the subsidy."

      "speech": "It was done through long­term contracts, Your Honor, but the question of getting involved with FERC's turf is as follows: FERC has ­­ has set up the capacity auction in PJM, and when under that auction, PJM procures three years in advance for a one­year period all the capacity the region needs, and then it allocates the cost of that capacity among all the utilities. But it tells the utilities that you have a way to hedge against those costs. If you have long­term resources, resources that you bought or procured through contract, you can bid them in, and if they clear, they will offset the cost. Maryland's concern was this: It wanted and needed the resource, but it was concerned that the resource clear so that it hedge against the cost and customers not pay twice for the same resource. So in order to do that, it entered into the contract for differences. And the way it did that was it did a competitive procurement and found a developer who was willing to undertake the risk of nonclearance. And that was the issue. The contract for differences assigns and allocates that risk to the developer, not the State, and that enabled the resource to go forward in a way that would not result in any possibility of a double charge. The contract developer ­­ the developer receives the contract price. The utilities paid the contract price and no more than that, received the market price. That is exactly the way this would have worked if we had simply done it as a bilateral, with one key difference. The difference is that the risk of nonclearance is with the developer, not the ­­"

In 2011, when FERC became aware of the Maryland and New Jersey programs, it revised the rules. But it didn't prohibit those resources; it didn't preclude them.

The concern is that when you build that resource and put it in the market, it creates a glut, and prices will crater. And the concern was because of that, no one will ever build such a resource. So the auction allows you to lock those prices in for three years, but that's simply in that particular circumstance. What FERC said when asked to make it longer was that's not the purpose of the auction. The auction is not intended to ensure revenue certainty. It's intended to provide information, information that the market can use in making contracting decisions. And that is exactly what happened here. Maryland looked at the ­­ at the auction results, came up with a program to have a resource built outside the auction, which would then bid into the auction, but it had to do it in accordance with FERC rules. FERC is the gatekeeper of the auction. Maryland couldn't insert itself into the auction in a way that FERC didn't allow, even if it wanted to."

We were talking ­­ in answering your first question, I was answering the conceptual question of what it is FERC regulates. FERC regulates the seller side of ­­ of every transaction. In the auction context, things get a little more complicated, as you just discussed in the ­­ in the EPSA case. This case, however, was a procurement to build a power plant. CPV bid to build this power plant. It looked at the costs it would take to build a power plant in this locale, how much turbines cost, how much it would cost to run the plant and to bid into the market and make it available to the market. Of course, it then divided the price over the 20 years. You have 240 monthly payments. That's exactly what we bid. We understood that for Maryland to pay for us to build a power plant and to keep all the profits from our sales in ­­ in the markets, both the energy sales and capacity sales, both were involved ­­ that would be unfair. They didn't want the ratepayers to both finance our power plant construction, which is what Maryland was after, and keep all the revenues. So the contract reads ­­ and this is on page 17 of the reply brief ­­ the contract reads: \"We turn over all the revenues for 20 years, and we build the power plant.\" They pay us to build the power plant. We turn over the revenues. It is correct enough that the net of that is the difference between the revenues and the price. But the purchase here was to build the power plant. Now, how did it impact the auction? How does it impact the auction? The auction was always set up by FERC on the understanding that States have the inherent power, and I mean the reserve power under the Federal Power Act itself to direct these kinds of long­term contracts, to direct capacity purchases outside because they control the purchasing decisions of their local utilities every single day. They review them and they control them. And they understood that States would be using long­term contracts to support new generation. So FERC didn't, just as an act of grace, allow constant sales of capacity outside the auction. They constructed the auction against the existing authority of the States to do exactly what was done here."

And that was the point Mr. Strauss was making. The minimum­offer price rule, which has two formats, is acceptable to FERC because FERC says if you comply with that rule, it does not artificially suppress prices. That was FERC's judgment, whether it was a 70 percent or 80 percent situation of how you bid. FERC has determined that is competitive, economic ­­ these are quotes ­­ does not ­­ does not artificially suppress prices because FERC wants those bids in. You're a competitive resource.

      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Well, they sure didn't start that way. And let me start here. I mean, they had, as I think Justice Alito alluded to, a completely different incentive in bidding their costs into PJM than would a private generator with new capacity. A private generator with new capacity is going to build its actual ­­ bid in its actual costs because they don't want to clear at the expense of having an unprofitable generator. It's a completely different dynamic for somebody like CPV, because the bidding clear requirement for them is just an obstacle to get to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, which is all these guaranteed payments for 20 years. So they have every incentive to understate their cost. That incentive was realized here. They talked about bidding in their costs. When they first bid in their costs, they bid in their costs at less than $14 a megawatt­day. Okay? Now, when PJM took a look at that, they ended up upping the figure sevenfold to about $96. So that's a great measure of their incentive to distort their costs for FERC. Now, what they will say is, ah, but Mr. Clement, the $96 bid cleared, and that's all that matters. Well, with all due respect, that's wrong. FERC says it's wrong. A bid like this can still have a price effect ­­ suppressive effect. And you can see that in a couple of ways. I want to say one thing, though, is FERC is here on our side in part because they are on its record as saying this MOPR ­­ the minimum­offer price rule. The MOPR is not some sort of cure­all that is designed to ward off any price­suppressive bid. It is a default rule. It is a coarse screen to deal with the most egregious cost­reducing bids. It also depends on an estimate of cost. And here's why it doesn't really work for a bid like this. One of the most important costs is your cost of capital. Well, what was CPV's cost of capital without this program? They told you. They told Maryland, without the 20­year guarantee, we can't get any financing for this project. We can't do it. At the bench trial, they told the district court, our ability to bid this project depends entirely on the ­­"

And anybody who's been to the pump lately knows that we can all have a lot of variance as to what we think are going to be future fuel costs, but if I could return to the capital cost and just finish this point, it's even worse that it's misstated, because ultimately, because they are getting a 20­year guarantee and no one else is, everybody else is calculating their cost of a new generation financing based on the three­year price signal that the ­­ that the ­­ that the capacity market is settling, it destroys the ability to do an apples­to­apples comparison.

And if you look at footnote 48, it's ­­ it goes beyond that because, based on particular findings, based on the testimony of the chairman of the Maryland PSC, the district court said that actually because there was back and forth between Maryland and CPV, this was Maryland setting the rate."

FERC has done that effectively ex ante with respect to the PJM markets by its regulations of PJM. FERC has said that the auction clearing rate for sales to PJM is just and reasonable. Now, the authority of FERC extends not just to what the nominal rate is in the auction but to what the supplier receives in connection with that sale. So if a State, through State action, says, it's all very well CPV that you've sold that to PJM and PJM has given you a hundred, this is your lucky day, we're going to give you another 50, that is clearly preempted because a State is having the supplier receive something in connection with a wholesale sale to PJM that is different from the rate that FERC has determined is reasonable."

The people whom it will choose to give it and will allow to bid are those who are the new people who have the lowest cost. All of those people in a rising market will have higher costs than the existing people. So if in fact FERC looks to the existing people and says, which can bid? And says, you have to use your real costs. And if they really implement that, what you just said is going to have no effect on the market, because they will be in the market whether they are given a subsidy or whether they are not given a subsidy. And indeed, it won't affect the price because the price is affected only by the marginal units, who, by definition, have higher costs than anything that FERC will look to to see what these people's costs are. Therefore, it is without impact, and they add to that. We would like to make this argument to FERC where they have to focus on it and not just say in general to the SG, this is how we think, because by the time we're finished, we'll be able to modify present rules so that they will see that they are not hurt at all in the actual world by our costs.

For them now to come in, not having raised any objection to the Supremacy Clause cause of action ­­ and by the way, there was a Commerce Clause cause of action there as well, which is maybe why the parties overlooked it, and I do think that's not jurisdictional, so I think we're past that. So for them to come in now and say, oh, this has to go to FERC, I'm sorry; it's a bit rich. And I understood why they were making the MOPR argument at the early stages of this litigation before FERC filed the brief. But I am a little mystified why, at this late stage of the game, after FERC has filed three briefs saying that the MOPR is not sufficient to eliminate price­suppressive bids, that they're still saying we win because FERC's on our side. I mean, that is a bit mystifying. And I think FERC is absolutely right on this for the reasons that we've already talked about. I mean, you can't really even apply the MOPR in an apples­to­apples way if you have this kind of 20­year guarantee, because the cost of capitals are completely out of whack. And of course, they do have the problem that their own testimony is they wouldn't be on the market at all if they didn't have this 20­year guarantee. So in the first capacity auction that we had to deal with, the price was suppressed. In every energy auction since then, the price was suppressed. And that's why I think FERC ­­ you know, they never tried to design the MOPR as this perfect thing. You talked about the 90 percent and the 70 percent? Way back in one of those proceedings, my client said, FERC, why isn't it a hundred percent? If you think about the economics of this, it should be a hundred percent. And FERC's response was, eh, close counts, this isn't perfect, we don't pretend it's perfect so we think 90 perfect is a rough compromise. Fair enough. Probably not arbitrary and capricious, but it doesn't mean that this is something that the MOPR is some perfect solution. I also don't think there's anything terribly anomalous about the procedural posture of this case. I think it's exact procedural posture you had in front of you in the Schneidewind case. That was a district court action, declaratory judgment for preemption. What I think makes this a preemption case, and what completely distinguishes voluntary bilateral contracts, is State action. It's the State action forcing the LSCs to make these payments, and essentially conditioning CPV's participation on the PJM market on the bid­and­clear requirement. That's State action that's preempted. In the typical voluntary bilateral contract, you don't have State action. The parties make their agreement. They eventually submit it to FERC, or if it's a market­based rate, somebody can object. And the only time you really get State action at that point is at the very end of the process when the State's doing retail rate regulation, and that's the point where Mississippi Power & Light and Nantahala come in and say if at that late stage when there's finally State action that the State has to take FERC's wholesale rate determinations as a given; they can't second guess them at late stage. But here you got the State action right up front, and the State action is preempted."

But I also agree with the second part of his answer, which is that if there was some kind of a bid­and­clear requirement in the auction attached to it; for example, if the State paid to build the power plant and turned it over to CPV, but then they said, okay, we want to get some money back for this power plant that we built, so you're going to bid the capacity of this plant into the auction.

The State has control over generation. And it can do things within that sphere that have indirect effects on ­­ on FERC's field.

The MOPR isn't a complete solution because, as we've described in our brief, if somebody bids in at the minimum­offer price rule but its costs are actually higher, it is necessarily going to knock somebody out of the auction that would have cleared otherwise, and the price of the auction will go down. But ­­ and I ­­ I think, as Mr. Clement correctly pointed out, the MOPR is not a ­­ a perfect solution to this. In ­­ in this particular case, I think the incentives of what ­­ what were ­­ was happening under the State program is demonstrated by the fact that CPV tried to bid in so low even when it tried to cost­justify their bids. And the market monitor in PJM, when trying to actually reconstruct CPV's costs, came to different numbers on what those costs would be. So it's not a perfect way to try to screen out offers that are not actually based on cost or that should not be coming in. And ­­ and, additionally, just the fact that FERC had to expand the MOPR to cover this program I think shows that there's been an intrusion onto FERC's field. FERC has tried to correct what's happening in these programs through extending the minimum­price offer rule to these bids, but I think that ­­ that just shows that's what's happening here is that the State programs are changing the incentives of the ­­ the people in the field."

      "speech": "I don't think that's right. I think the conflict is still with the ­­ the market mechanism that FERC has set up in order to determine wholesale capacity rates in the auction. When you have a program that has this bid­and­clear requirement, it alters those incentives. Even if there's not an actual price­suppressive effect, the ­­ the ­­ the possibility for a conflict or the imminent possibility of a conflict still calls for field preemption. The ­­ the Court of appeals cited Schneidewind and Northern Natural Gas on page 21a of the ­­ of the Petition Appendix showing that ­­ that's still field preemption.

States ­­ or the parties in this context will sometimes enter into a hedge agreement where they agree on a price. Like a hundred dollars, if the auction clearing price is below that, say it's 80, then the person that the generator has contracted with, like Merrill Lynch or something, owes the generator $20 regardless of what ­­ what else happens. That transaction will always take place. The generator then has to make a separate decision of whether it wants to bid into the auction. If it's ­­ if the auction price is 80 and its costs are 90, it's not going to. If its costs are 70, it will bid in. That sort of a contract for differences is not preempted here.

FERC has no issue with competitive procurements, and that can be found in the Joint Appendix. At page 909, there is a regulation in which FERC essentially says so. That's all that happened here. The question of whether we targeted the auction: We did not regulate the auction. We could not regulate the auction. We could not regulate CPV, either. They're a wholesale generator. They make their own choices, and they made their own agreement here to enter into this contract. We couldn't regulate the outcome of the auction because FERC regulates the outcome of the auction. They control every aspect of it. And in this case, what FERC found was a rule change was needed to address this very contract. The change was made. The resource bid in accordance with the rule change and cleared. FERC said its rule change would reconcile the tensions between State policy and auction integrity. FERC said that this resource was economic, needed, competitive, and did not suppress prices. There was no undue price suppression or no artificial price suppression from this resource. FERC said that and ­­ and said it more than once. Even with the State subsidy. And the reason is very clear: Because the bid was a cost­based bid without regard to the contract revenue. And keep in mind, there's been a lot of talk about a subsidy here. Maryland concluded that, over the life of this contract, this was going to be a better deal for ratepayers than for the generator. And that is in the generation order. The only other point I would make, Your Honor, is that the rule that should be articulated here is one that allows each of the parties to fulfill their responsibilities under the statute. Sellers get to set rates as an initial matter. FERC gets to review those rates, and States get to direct the procurement decisions of their retail utilities. Been a lot of talk here about what the retail utilities were forced to do. The subject is State regulation. State courts have affirmed what Maryland did here with respect to its retail utilities. There should be no question about that. States can take actions where necessary to develop new power plants. And as we move forward into an era of a new generation portfolio in this country, the last thing the Court should be considering is trying to limit State options. It's very important to keep them open, especially in a case here, where FERC has reviewed this precise contract. If you look on page 6 of our reply brief, there is a quote from the FERC rehearing order in November of 2011 in which FERC describes an acceptable arrangement and describes this arrangement: one in which local utilities contract with a generator and the generator bids the unit into the market. That is exactly what happened under this contract. FERC speaks approvingly of it. Thank you, Your Honor."
