    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "The particular mixed question of consolidation, which is the third prong of the definition here, yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, in the example that I gave you of common scheme or plan there might be mixed questions of fact or law, and would there be de novo review there?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "There may well be mixed questions, and I think the common scheme or plan is the application here that next to consolidation most calls or most invites de novo review.  If we look at the question of an intervening arrest, which is the initial screening device in the definition under the application note, I think that okay. Now you want to know -- this is somebody writing an application note in the guideline, and logically speaking nobody's disputing the brute facts.  They're disputing whether sentencing was joined, those words, sentencing was joined, do or do not apply to this undisputed factual situation in the world, so if you're going to go on a, all legal questions are for the court, and the court of appeals, all factual questions are for the trial judge, and this is a legal question, in that rubric I guess you win. But I would have thought that there were millions of legal questions of this kind that are really for the trial judge, because what they call for is the expertise of the trial judge, and they are so minor that if you start getting court of appeals into all that thing, application on the guideline themselves refers simply to -- well, the application note refers simply to consolidation. It is a question of what type of guideline are we applying here, and clearly if we confine ourselves today to the realm of Federal sentencing, United States sentencing guidelines, I would submit clearly that some guidelines never rise above fact in their application. Others I think are altogether discretionary in their application.  Many of the Chapter 5 guidelines would fall into that category. Still others, including the consolidation question here, I think are the sort of mixed question --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I suppose you could have a case where the trial judge says, if there are two different attorneys for the State appearing, asking -- at a single sentencing proceeding, that there are two different attorneys for two different offenses and there are two different sentences, that, as a matter of law, is not a consolidated sentencing. I suppose a judge could say that, and if he said that, then I think that you have a fairly strong case that this would be a statement of such generality, that is reviewable de novo."

    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "I don't know that it would, because it really turns, I think, on the guideline one is applying, and if anything is true of the scheme that the Sentencing Reform Act established, it is that an exercise of discretion, if that's what Your Honor is describing, must be explained so that it can be assessed for reasonableness. It is also, I think, true here that facts must be found, whether that's the whole of the inquiry or whether that's simply the predicate, then, to applying the legal standard to classify the facts."

They are not consolidated."

He was left to try to apply the guideline and the -- I guess he called it the applicable application notes, and then made comment appeals could say, this is too complicated, unless there's a formal consolidation we won't apply the guideline that way, because that isn't even settled, is it, that this notion of functional qualification doesn't come out of the guideline, doesn't come out of any application note.  It's something that some courts made up."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And if there is to be any kind of uniformity infused in this process, why should it come from the court of appeals rather than the Sentencing Commission?  I mean, you could see common scheme.  You could see crimes that happened simultaneously. But this notion of consolidation, a judge could consolidate just because the guy happened to have committed a number of crimes totally unrelated.  It doesn't have the coherence that the other two categories Commission cannot tell this Court the standard of review. I think also, if we're talking, then, about the substantive rule of --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but your argument -- I mean, if this is the point of Justice Ginsburg's question, your argument is that the only way to get uniformity is to have de novo court of appeals review, and the point made in response to that is no, you could achieve substantial uniformity by having more detailed prescription by the Sentencing Commission of what constitutes consolidation and then having the usual deferential review."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So long as the details are significant enough, you know, complete enough, you'll get reversed even on deferential review if you fail to follow them.  Why isn't that a more sensible way of achieving the question that Congress did not mean that the commission would oust the Federal courts of appellate jurisdiction, quite the contrary.  This was part of the Sentencing Reform Act -- it included 3742 -- and giving the appellate courts a much more active role in reviewing sentences than ever they had before in this --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's true,  but they don't have -- I mean, they left to the courts to work out what would be a sensible relationship among trial court, appellate court, and Sentencing Commission, and therefore I would think what Justice Ginsburg said was highly relevant."

    "speaker": "STRANG",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "Again, the Sentencing Commission could act.  It is also clear -- and this is in the legislative history that we cited.  It's clear that where it is highly complex and factually related, that one should rely upon the Sentencing Commission to provide the necessary uniformity, and that would be a strong argument in favor of deferential review here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "Well, I don't know that it would. My problem is that you are then leaving the Sentencing Commission to look at the largely unreported work of district judges in 94 districts, rather than looking at the largely reported work of appellate judges in 12 circuits, as I understand it, so I'm not so sure, Your Honor, that de novo review still isn't the better way to interact with the commission. That said, again I want to make clear that the commission has the role that Justice Ginsburg posits, and that it is not every guideline or application of guideline that I suggest is appropriate for de novo review under"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "Oh, no, the guidelines generally, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry.  The guidelines in general, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I thought you were saying that uniformity is important with respect to this particular guideline.  You're saying uniformity is important with respect to every single aspect of the guidelines?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "Yes, and I'm sorry, the confusion I created.  I am saying in a sense both.  Uniformity always here is important in Federal sentencing, but when we're talking about a guideline that has a complex statutory standard, as this one, and is not a matter of purely individualized application such as acceptance of responsibility, or a decision whether to depart upward or downward for some unconsidered fact, then I think uniformity of the rule, clarity of the rule, the meaning demeanor.  The manner in which he interacts with counsel. You know, a variety of issues that may appear only off the record and therefore concern conduct immediately before the district court. I think to follow on my answer to Your Honor's earlier question, a clear rule of decision I think is important here for consolidation, because the potential disparity in otherwise like-placed persons is so great, as the facts of this case demonstrate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "One clear rule for appellate courts that recognizes the expertise that district judges have might say, I reject this notion of functional consolidation.  Either it's consolidated or it's not, and so if it's consolidated, formally consolidated, that's one thing.  If it's not formally consolidated, forget it. That would hardly benefit people in your client's"

  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "I don't know, never having been in that position.  The number of cases raising this issue is not overwhelming.  It's -- I think it's sufficient to allow some development of the law, but it's certainly not overwhelming, and what the rule of decision would be, I have an opinion about what it ought to be.  How it would play out I'm not sure with any confidence I can suggest to Your Honor, and I'm of course here focused on the standard of review.  I'm not sure that's a satisfactory answer."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speech": "Yes.  They can arise, the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So if we rule your way, and we say there should be de novo review here, in effect as a matter of law, then I would suppose the courts of appeals are going to be faced with a tremendous number of challenges having nothing to do with the Career Offender Act."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "I think not.  I mean, the narrow question here is consolidation as the path to relatedness, and at least --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but I don't see how we could -- well, maybe I should ask this question.  Is there a basis upon which we could say that the consolidation question should be reviewed de novo, but other questions of relatedness need not be?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "The Court conceivably could do that. more than a factual or pure factual issue.  Did crimes occur on the same occasion?  Ordinarily it seems to me that's a fact-bound, entirely fact-bound inquiry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Right, but that does not exhaust the universe of questions about relatedness."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "That's correct, it does not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And so I come back to my question to you, could we classify consolidation as in effect an issue that should be reviewed as if it were a legal issue and hence de novo, and at the same time on some principle basis say that generally the question of relatedness is not to be treated as if it were a legal issue and subject to de novo?  Can we split the baby that way?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "I think the Court could.  Whether prudentially it ought is another question, but I think it could because at least as I read this Court's prior"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And it would seem to me to be difficult, as a matter of principle, to say that the consolidation issue gets de novo, whereas relatedness generally does not, and I want to know if there is a principle basis for making that distinction, what that basis is."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "I think it's whether the mixed -- the mixture tips factual or tips legal is the best principle I can identify."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You're saying the statute has different tests for relatedness, some of -- many of which are mixed questions, and some of those are proper for de novo review, and others not."

    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "This particular guideline yes, and then the guidelines generally."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It just sort of strikes me it's sort of a strange issue for us to be wrestling with."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "Well, and of course under Stinson, although this is not a statute it's binding law, so it doesn't merit less time or consideration in that sense, I think, but again I have to acknowledge because of Mistretta we have the Sentencing Commission out there, and when we get to the question of the rule of decision, having first settled the standard of review, yes, the Sentencing Commission can weigh into that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Isn't there something to be said, too, for discouraging rather than encouraging a great number of appeals of sentencing factors to the court of appeals?"
  },

    "speech": "But I think de novo review does that, and it's the point I wanted to make in response to"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "Well, it --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You know, I sometimes think we take a case here to decide a question and the opinion we write deciding it creates three new questions for lawyers to argue about, so I don't think certainty is very certain in anyway, but just as a practical matter it seems to me it's better to have these things resolved finally by the district courts in some cases than simply appealed to the court of appeals."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "Well, in the end, Your Honor, where that would take us is back to the persuasion that the district courts are best able to provide uniformity in sentencing and that, indeed, at page 12 of the United States brief, is an assertion it makes, and that's simply at war, I suggest, with the basic congressional findings and purposes of the Sentencing Reform Act, that it was years, but when we get down to the finer points there may be more to be said for discretion, assuming it's consistent with the guidelines."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",

    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals properly applied a deferential standard of review to the district court's"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Suppose, as in Justice Ginsburg's example, a district court said there is no consolidation, in my view, unless there's a formal order of consolidation.  That's it.  That seems to me a general proposition, a general and very broad interpretation of the text, which is susceptible of de novo review and which ought not to vary from one court to another."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Justice Kennedy, I think I agree with you.  That is, if the district court said, I interpret the guideline to mean that in no case may I conclude that two prior cases were consolidated unless there were a formal order of consolidation, and then that's the rule of law, and then I apply the rule of law to the facts of this case. Now, the court of appeals would be authorized to review that rule of law in a plenary fashion. is doing is saying, I read what the court -- I read the standard that has been enunciated by the court of appeals, and that is, there may be such a thing as functional consolidation, and now I'm going to determine whether the disparate facts of this case answer to that description, and I see there are 15 salient facts in this case and eight of them tip in one direction but seven in another, and on balance I conclude that it's not functionally consolidated, that is --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "He didn't do that here.  He was a very careful judge.  He did say, I'm left to conclude the only inference of consolidation is the fact that the sentences were imposed in two different cases.  That's almost a negative formulation of the hypothetical rule I gave you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Well, he said a lot -- actually, what he was doing was answering to the other description that I was discussing which he was saying, here's how I think the facts of this case ought to be classified according to a legal standard, and that is the application of the guidelines to the facts, which Congress --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, do you think this was a mixed question of fact and law here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "I think it's best viewed that way, Your Honor, a mixed question of fact and law.  That is, consolidation is -- can be understood as a legal concept and functional consolidation.  It's similar to the common -- I think more clearly a mixed question of fact than law is the common scheme or plan idea. If anything, this perhaps seems a little more factual.  I think the common scheme or plan notion of relatedness is one that comes up very frequently, and that deference that ought to be given to the trial judge in this very case. I'm not saying that other consolidation cases there wouldn't be some factors, say if the judge, the Federal sentencing judge said, well now, these State judges I'm sure must have balanced the two sentences and that makes them related."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Justice Kennedy, I think what the district court was doing in this case was saying, when I'm asked to consider whether something is functionally consolidated, I'm really considering did the previous State court system treat the two cases as though they were one?  Now, there's no order specifically saying that they did, so I have to look at the record of what happened in those two cases and see how the court system treated this case. steam ahead on this case. So I think the evaluation, the district court's determination that the totality of the facts have a certain character is what we view as the application of the guideline to the facts, and that is what is entitled to deference. Now, on the institutional consideration point, I don't think there's any reason to think that that task would be done better if repeated by three appellate judges, or at least that that task isn't -- doesn't -- that that function isn't worth the cost to the justice system as a whole. After all, although it's true that the judge did not make credibility determinations in a classic sense, he was required to draw inferences from a historical record to sort of fill in the gaps, try to figure out why the review them with some deference that would be fine.  But the people who ought to work it out are the Sentencing Commission, I mean, which they can do, basically."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In other words, the way the Sentencing Commission would work it out is, it would tolerate differences among the circuits in that respect, unless it really began to show up in different sentences being given to different people, at which point all they'd have to do is write a new application note."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Not quite the same, because those usually are very fact-related to the facts of the crime, while this, in fact, is a matter of judicial administration, which we could say judges throughout the system are somewhat more familiar with."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's unlikely you'll get an odd factual situation with something like consolidation, isn't it?  I mean, this is a sort of weird case in that normally it's fairly clear whether the cases were consolidated or plan.  Courts can permissibly reach different conclusions about a set of facts on that case. The point I'm trying to make is that, you know, if a district court on review of a court of appeals, say it were de novo, were to say well, this case is plainly functionally consolidated, or this case is functionally consolidated because this defendant's two prior offenses in Wisconsin State court were consolidated, I don't think that helps the district court decide any later case say well, this defendant's Alabama offenses were -- were functionally consolidated."

Has the Government taken a position in dealing with these -- this consolidation notion of whether it should be a consolidation order or, we're not going to this.  We accept the concept for this case that there is -- that there is such a thing as functional consolidation, and the more important question to us is how that concept, as with many -- as with the application of many concepts in the sentencing guidelines, how that concept is applied and how that application should be reviewed.  It's a more important issue to us in terms of the overall administration of the guidelines system, and --"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "May I ask this question, Mr. Wolfson: if you do not require a formal order of consolidation, as I understand your position, how could this have been more consolidated?  One judge, one proceeding, two sentences imposed at the same time to run concurrently.  What other possibly could make it consolidated for purposes of sentencing except a formal order? other case."

I mean, I have difficulty understanding it because they were concurrent, imposed at the same time by the same judge.  I this case. It was really a happenstance that they were sentenced on the same day and it might well have been that they were not.  After all, Judge Geske said, I'm not going to wait for the entry of the plea in the other case, I'm going to go ahead with sentencing in my case, and that, I think, is a strong factor that points in the opposite direction. Now, of course, to go back to the standard of appellate review point, I think there isn't any particular reason to think that the court of appeals de novo review would necessarily arrive at a better result, or a more -- as a systemic matter more accurate result of these determinations, because the facts are so disparate.

I would ordinarily expect that if the State court entered a formal order of consolidation under its criminal rules that would be enough, absent some extraordinarily unusual facts, but even so, I mean, surely -- I mean, as the district court, as the district judge pointed out in this case, you know, he did look at the record in the State court."

    "speech": "Well, that is generally not enough for a court to view cases as related, or even as part of a common scheme or plan, I mean, you know, and the district court was quite clear on that point and the court of appeals agreed, and the petitioner didn't argue otherwise, so I mean, it's a more narrow concept than that when one same occasion, consolidation, are applied -- are reviewed under a deferential standard of review.  That's not to say that there are never any legal questions that may be involved in that, and those, as we discussed earlier, would be reviewed de novo. An example I can think of in this case is, the guideline says that offenses are not deemed to be related if they were separated by an intervening arrest, and so there you might have to, you know, consider whether something was a continuing crime, and the same would be the case -- I'm sorry, I meant with the common, with the same occasion subprong you might have to consider whether the offenses were -- one of the offenses was a continuing crime and that's a legal question."

    "speech": "If we don't want to do that, if we want to follow up on this idea, could we do this?  Could We are considering, in the circumstance where a court of appeals has decided that the words consolidated for sentencing include something called functional consolidation, then can the court of appeals decide that that concept which is a subset of consolidation, namely functional consolidation, maybe should be reviewed de novo or not. We don't have to get into whether the thing of the document, you know, consolidation means when there's an order.  That's not before us.  We're considering the concept called functional consolidation."

    "speech": "I'm rather tempted by that, so --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "I think the rule that we are proposing does lend itself to a more general applicability, Justice Breyer. district court have its way when it applies a form of words to a fact situation, but there will be many others where it seems to be just the right thing to do, and therefore a narrow holding might be preferable.  That's my thought.  I'd like your view on that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Well, the statute does say due deference, and so it doesn't exclude the possibility that there will be situations where de novo review is appropriate, as when the district court engages in a legal interpretation of a guideline, or where it seems clear that that's what it was doing in that particular case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that's true -- I mean, under deferential review, or you know, abuse of discretion, if the district court comes to a legal conclusion that's wrong it can be reversed on appeal, can it not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "That's correct, but I am thinking between a pristine legal standard and a determination of the raw historical facts, I think that as a general matter where it falls in that category a deferential standard of review will be appropriate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's hard to -- the reason I find it hard to do it that way is in the statute books you can find questions where all you're doing is applying the legal label to a fact situation, the most important thing in the world, the least important thing, whether a newsboy is an employee, whether a foreman is an employee. The same description applies to what the judges do.  The consequences are enormously different.  You see, I mean, that's a classical example, but that's what I'm afraid of right here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Well, one has to look at the, sort of the system as a whole and the institutional that -- when the district court concluded that it was or was not a permissible -- an appropriate basis for departure, I should say, on the facts of the case was to be reviewed deferentially. Now, that's not to say that the Court couldn't conclude that the answer it reached was wrong.  I mean, the Court reached such a conclusion in Koon, as a matter of fact."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But under your view the trial courts will not have any guidance from the appellate system even as to what factors ought to be considered in whether there was consolidation."
  },

    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "I don't think that's right, Justice Kennedy.  That is, I think -- I mean, deference is not no review. That is, I think a court can't -- if the"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Well, I mean, this case is -- I can't think in this case, or a case like this, of any facts, say, that would have been so out of bounds for a district court to consider that it -- you know, that it would have been completely erroneous to have considered that fact, but looking at the system more generally and not just consolidated but relatedness and applications of the guidelines, I don't think that one should arrive at the conclusion that due deference means no review at all, just as is the case in departure decisions under, departure decisions under the guidelines. The courts of appeals can give the district court guidance about what is inappropriate, an inappropriate basis for departing in that situation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Isn't it -- maybe you could comment on this.  It would seem to me, of course, you're right recall, between doubling a sentence or not, and I would suppose that in the absence of some clear rule it would be more difficult to review the consolidation decision under the guidelines than it would under the old law have been to review the sentence itself, as, say, between 10 and 20 years, which is a very strange result. Am I seeing things in a -- in the wrong way here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Well, I think that -- I may not be quite understanding, but I think that one has to assume that the courts of appeals announce interpretations of the guidelines and that the district courts then apply those interpretations in a faithful manner to the facts of cases.  Now --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but can you give me an example -- give me an example, keyed to this case,"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but we're taking this case in the context that there is something called functional consolidation, and I -- I'm assuming that that really could cover, as you in your argument a moment ago pointed out, a tremendous variety of facts. You said, you know, even if you come down with a rule it would be difficult to review on a de novo basis because of the extraordinary variety of facts, so we're starting with the assumption that you've got functional consolidation, number 2, that functional consolidation covers a tremendous amount of district territory. If you make those assumptions, what kind of a rule on abuse of discretion review could a court announce that would be of any critical help?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Well, of course, if the district court had refined that rule further and had announced fluid that, you know, in the ordinary course the district court's determination is going to be controlling.  I mean, it's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I thought your response to this was going to be that you don't have to have the court of appeals doing the job, that it should be done by the commission."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Well, that's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That the commission can promulgate more detailed specifications as to what constitutes consolidation if, indeed, more detail is needed, or desired."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Well, I think that's right, the Sentencing Commission is there precisely to continue the process of making the sentencing guidelines more uniform by reviewing the experience of the district court. would like to say is, I think as the commission and as the courts refine the legal concepts farther and farther down, and as the legal concepts themselves become narrower, I think it's going to be the case that the district court's determination whether any case where the facts of the case fall within those legal concepts is more likely to be upheld. That is, if all we had was two cases, or if two cases are related --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay, but I think what your argument in fact means is, if the Sentencing Commission decides to get into this with more detailed rules, then the discretion is going to be limited, but if the Sentencing Commission doesn't, then we are left with what seems to me this rather ironic situation of less reviewable discretion --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Yes, but my point is, it's harder to find, I think, an abuse of discretion inherently as the legal rule that you're applying to a set of facts becomes narrower and narrower."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You're --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "I mean, as both the Sentencing Commission and the court of appeals, I think that's sort of inevitable. Now, the court of -- if all that were available in this case were the bare guideline that said related, and there were no application notes, then as -- the court of appeals would have then undertaken the task of refining that concept of related, which is at a more general level, and then would have applied it. Thank you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Wolfson. matters, but I think we cannot rely here too much on the Sentencing Commission or cede the ground properly in Federal courts. For one, the Sentencing Commission never can fix disparity in a given case, or cure a lack of uniformity in the cases as they come.  It can act only to try to reduce or prevent that in the future."

    "speech": "I'm sorry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I thought that its rules can be retrospective, that it can, indeed, require resentencing in light of its new rules."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRANG",
    "speech": "It can.  It can do that.  I wouldn't expect it to do that in a situation like this. In its -- its powers really are not so different in its review look the same in terms of the mechanical tasks that judges must undertake.  It's only the conclusory act, as I understand it, that differs. That is, the briefs must be read, the relevant portions of the record must be examined, and in the end the difference then is will reasonable, if inconsistent, conclusions be allowed to stand -- well, yes, that's deferential review -- or does a court of appeals simply look for the right answer, de novo. De novo review continues to have its place and it has its place here, just as much, I think, as de novo review admittedly on a case-by-case basis helps us understand reasonable suspicion, or helps us understand probable cause, or helps understand what in custody means for Miranda purposes."
