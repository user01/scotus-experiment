For example, whether the parent targeted advertising at the forum, whether the parent designed a product specifically for use in that forum. And, of course, this Court has said, repeatedly, that questions of specific jurisdiction are highly fact dependent.

And let me say this: I think that, with regard to Your Honor's points about issues being waived or forfeited below, the only issue that even arguably ­­ even arguably was forfeited below was the discrete question as to whether Mercedes Benz itself is subject to general jurisdiction in California. The question that Justice Kagan and others were inquiring about, namely, that even were one to accept the attribution theory and evaluate Daimler as a joint enterprise, would that render the combined enterprise at home in California, we plainly did not waive or forfeit that question. In fact, we expressly addressed it in our opening brief, and we have been fighting in this case, from day one, to argue that, even if you were to attribute the contacts, there is no basis for jurisdiction over Daimler. That question is squarely presented for this Court's review. I also think that ­­ as Justice Ginsburg and others have noted, there has been some confusion in the lower courts over the distinction between specific jurisdiction and general jurisdiction. This Court saw it in Goodyear, for example, and I think that, were this Court to resolve this case on the ground that Justice Kagan suggested ­­ or Justice Alito suggested, namely, that a corporation cannot be at home outside of the areas where it maintains its principal place of business or is incorporated, that it can't be subject to general jurisdiction anywhere else. That would be a clean rule. It would be a workable rule. I think it's fully consistent with what the Court said in Goodyear, and it would provide clarity and guidance to the lower courts and eliminate the circuit split that currently exists over agency jurisdiction. A couple other quick points, Justice Scalia, I regret to report that neither the parties nor the courts below reproduced the text of the California statute. The Solicitor General, however, to his credit, did on page 4 of his brief. It simply says that, \"California may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of California or the United States.\" And the Ninth Circuit panel, on page 19A of the Petitioner's appendix, said that, therefore, the question is this case ­­ in this case is simply whether the exercise of jurisdiction would exceed the permissible bounds of due process. The last point I want to make ­­ and we've been discussing legal issues ­­ is just to remind the Court of the facts of this case. This is a case involving Argentine plaintiffs, suing a German corporation, based on events that allegedly occurred in Argentina more than 30 years ago. This case has no connection to the United States, and it has no business in a California courtroom. The Ninth Circuit's contrary conclusion is indefensible, and for that reason, we ask that the judgment be reversed."
