I think what's important to realize here is that what Congress did when it enacted the FTCA was essentially create a new remedy and offer a bargain to ­­ to tort victims, and it said, look, we're going to create a brand new remedy directly against the United States for money damages. It's a great deal for you, but if you accept the deal, if you accept the bargain, and you choose to bring an FTCA case, and then you choose to litigate that case all the way to judgment, you can't turn around and seek relief under a totally separate claim involving the same facts.

The Bivens claim is exclusively against the employee. There's no Bivens liability on the part of the government. So if you follow the ordinary rules of claim preclusion, there would be no preclusion here, because there was no possibility of bringing the Bivens claim against the government, and claim preclusion would apply only to claims that could have been brought. So you couldn't have brought the Bivens claim against the government. It would have to be a separate claim."

      "speaker": "MARTINEZ",

Now, with respect to what Congress did in the Westfall Act, there's no question that Congress wanted to preserve the option for the plaintiff to bring a Bivens claim, and there's nothing in our theory of this case that precludes ­­ that would have precluded the plaintiff from bringing that Bivens claim at the outset. But it's very interesting, and I think it's very telling what Congress did in the Westfall Act, as ­­ as you adverted to. In Section 2679(b)(2) of the Westfall Act, Congress specifically said that the exclusivity provision that it had enacted in 2679(b)(1) would not apply to Bivens claims. And so it expressly carved out an exception for such claims. But when it did that, it did not carve out a similar exception for Bivens claims to the judgment bar, which is the separate provision in section 2676 that's at issue in this case. And so Congress created an exception to essentially say to plaintiffs, you can still bring your Bivens claim at the outset, but it didn't disrupt the original bargain at the heart of the FTCA, which is that once you bring an FTCA claim, once you litigate that claim all the way to judgment, you can't try to take a second bite of the apple by having a separate claim pending at the same time."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARTINEZ",
      "speech": "So I think, first of all, I think our primary position is that judgment does mean judgment in the sense that it's defined.

Now, that said, we do acknowledge in our reply brief that a couple of those definitions, including the ones that we ­­ we reproduced, we weren't trying to cherry pick definitions. We just reproduced ­­ I think there were six of them from Black's Law Dictionary from 1933 that we reproduced. And I think three of those definitions seem to say that a judgment has to resolve issues of the parties' rights or issues of liabilities. So it's possible ­­ again, we don't think this is the best reading, but it's possible, if you only applied one of those three definitions, that maybe certain kinds of dismissals that are based on curable procedural defects that really don't get to the liability issue in the case at all, it's possible that ­­ that those might not count as judgments.

So we're trying to figure out whether the adjudication of a particular FTCA case would qualify as a judgment, and I think there's no question that when an FTCA case is adjudicated and is conclusively resolved in favor of the government on the basis of one of the 2680 exceptions, it's true that that's jurisdictional, but it's also a substantive adjudication of the claim."

It could then take an appeal to the court of claims, at which point the court of claims would be confronted if the government appealed the 2680 determination with exactly the kind of 2680 issue that Respondent says the court of claims wasn't supposed to be considering. Moreover, when ­­ when Congress recodified the FTCA's appellate review provisions in 1948, just two years later, it sent the provision allowing appeals going to the court of claims to 28 U.S.C. 1504, which is a different provision.

That's the fair bargain. But where the United States has not waived derivative liability, the judgment bar is not a gotcha provision that prevents a plaintiff who sued the wrong defendant from thereafter suing the correct defendant, the primarily liable employee. Those claims are outside of the bargain. And the \"shall not apply\" directive of Section 2680 makes this perfectly clear. As some of the Justices recognized during counsel's presentation, that language says that the other provisions of the Act shall not apply. This unambiguously includes the judgment bar.

Now, if that last thing he read doesn't apply because it was discretionary function and fell within 2680, they then could see the Post Office on the basis that the Post Office has independent authority to sue or be sued. And it's hard to believe, he says, that Congress somehow, when they passed these words, \"does not apply\", suddenly wanted to revive all kinds of suits against, for example, the Post Office, which otherwise would have been barred by that last provision that he read."

Meyer, just because a suable agency can be sued on a claim doesn't mean that the claim exists against the suable agency. And three of the exceptions under 2680 are suable agencies themselves. So if you read 2679 as applying to the exceptions, their reading of the statute, you create a situation where, say, the Panama Canal Company is sued ­­ well, 2679 on their reading bars that suit against the Panama Canal Company and makes the FTCA exclusive, but then 2680 under the FTCA bars the claim against the ­­ arising out of the activities of the Panama Canal Company."

So if you move away from the \"shall not apply\" language, which we think is the most straightforward way of resolving this case, and to the language of the judgment bar itself, we have two arguments under the judgment bar. One is that the judgment bar is only triggered by an action under Section 1346(b). And, again, the \"shall not apply\" language says 1346(b) shall not apply to the excepted claims.

Even a judgment of voluntary dismissal, as I understand their view, that \"judgment\" means any judgment would trigger the judgment bar, under that reading. So to return to Justice Kennedy's question, on judgment in particular, we think it incorporates principles of res judicata. And the Court has looked to principles of res judicata to inform the word \"judgment\" in other contexts. In the relitigation exception to the Anti­Injunction Act, the Federal courts are empowered to enjoin State court proceedings to protect or effectuate judgments of the Federal courts, and this Court has viewed that as ­­ viewed judgment errors incorporating principles of res judicata, and only judgments with res judicata effect can be enjoined under that relitigation provision.

A claim ­­ a claim under the FTCA can be brought vicariously against the government as employer. It's agreed to subject itself to respondeat superior liability on the claim. Where these claims are accepted, you know, the ­­ you know, ordinarily the judgment bar would then say if you have a judgment, the claim can't be brought against the employee. 2680 says it shall not apply to these sorts of claims. So when you have an intentional tort claim for which the government has not accepted respondeat superior liability, the bar on bringing that claim against the employee does not apply. So it's ­­ it's not the context of where you need to read a definition in order to sensibly apply the words of the provision. It's ­­ it's actually an operative provision that operates on a claim. And it's, in this context, purporting to operate on a claim that's been excluded by the \"shall not apply\" language."

      "speech": "I think it's an alternative argument for the same ground for affirmance. The question presented was whether a 2680 dismissal triggers the judgment bar. This case is about the interaction of two provisions, and it would be very artificial for the Court to ignore the text of one of those provisions and focus solely on the text of the other provision. Substantively, I think the term \"judgment\" is an ambiguous term whereas the term \"shall not apply\" is not an ambiguous term. \"Judgment\" can mean different things in different contexts. It can mean different things within the different provisions of the Act. And some of the provisions of the Act, it seems to me, mean a ward against the government. They talk about the fee as a percent of the judgment. They talk about how the judgment is to be paid. That's 2672. So \"judgment\" is an inherently ambiguous word, and the Court would need to grapple with that ambiguity if it tries to resolve the case that way. And again, I think the issue was raised in our bio. It's logically intertwined with the question, so I think the Court really, in order to answer the second part of the question intelligently, the Court needs to address the first part of the question as well. If Your Honors have no further questions."

First, with respect to the Postal Service, it's true that the Postal Reorganization Act says that the FTCA applies to torts that involve the Postal Service. But Respondent's whole argument is that the FTCA's protections of sue­and­be­sued agencies doesn't protect sue­and­be­sued agencies from claims that involve the exceptions within 2680. And so by his own argument, the ­­ the postal ­­ the postal service, because ­­ because if it's faced with a claim involving the negligent transmission of mail, the Postal Service would not be able to take advantage of 2679(a)'s protections. I think the Court might want to look to the First Circuit's decision in the Davric case, where it addressed this issue. It rejected Respondent's \"shall not apply\" argument, and it said that it would lead to results that Congress could not have conceivably intended, and we agree with that. The second point I'd like to make is just about the ­­ the purpose of the FTCA. We think that Congress very clearly wanted to give victims a choice between suing the government and suing the responsible employee directly, but it didn't want to force the government to litigate over the same facts twice. That purpose is squarely implicated. It's not superfluous. The judgment bar is not superfluous under modern rules because, even today, if the ­­ if the government has to defend indirectly against a Bivens action and also has to defend against an FTCA action, the same concerns about alleviating the burdens and disruptions appear today as ­­ just as they would have in 1946."
