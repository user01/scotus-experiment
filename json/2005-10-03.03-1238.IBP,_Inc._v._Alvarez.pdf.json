And unless the Court has a different order, I'd propose to start with the walking time. Section 4(a)(1)'s language, which comes from the Portal-to-Portal Act, which was enacted in 1947, by its plain terms clearly covers the walking that's involved in these two cases. The statute, which is reproduced at the appendix of the petition, at 88(a), says that there is no mandatory compensation for, quote, \"walking to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform.\" It's difficult for me to imagine language that could more directly cover what we're dealing with in this particular case, because the Plaintiffs here are -- for IBP -- are employed to slaughter and to process beef. The employees at Barber Foods are employed to process chicken. And thus, the actual place where they perform those services are obviously on the lines where the processing takes place."

The Portal-to-Portal Act is not a statute that remotely provides protections for the employees. This is a statute that was designed to protect employers from billions of dollars of liability. And so, when you're talking about, \"Under what circumstances can you ignore the flat prohibition on requiring walking time to be regarded as a mandatory subject of compensation?\" then it seems to me the distinction you're proposing doesn't work.

And so, the court's really coming up with what is a third category of cases, which deals with integral and indispensable activities to a primary activity. They didn't have to analyze it as a primary activity.

And that's in place. And now Congress has stepped in and said, \"Well, wait a second. When we did it -- when that got interpreted that broadly, we're talking about $6 billion in liability.\" So, it's very important, given that we're talking about fairly minimal activities on the -- on the -- that are involved here, triggering potentially massive liabilities.

The court, in Steiner, clearly had in mind the workplace, where you're producing batteries. There's a lot of language in that opinion that says, \"This is where you really do the work. That's your battery, and here's where you're going to get -- engage in activities that we think you need to be compensated.\" But the court never remotely suggested that you were entitled to the walking time between those two. And, if you go back to 790.7(g), that language specifically told every employer that simply because you have to pay for certain kinds of activities at the outset, because they're integral and indispensable, as decided by a court, that doesn't necessarily mean you have to pay for all the walking time.

Second, the walk won't be integral and indispensable. The test for whether or not something is integral and indispensable is whether it's work that's required and closely related to the productive activities.

The dog cases are, of course, also entirely different from this one. You have -- you have arrived at the place of the performance of your principal activity. Steiner said that occurred, quote/unquote, \"on or off the production floor.\" And so, you're at the plant, and your workday has started. Justice Scalia, you made the point, and I simply want to reinforce it, that the reference in -- to \"principal activities\" in 4(a)(2) is the same as the reference to \"principal activities\" in 4(a)(1), but it's also the reference to principal activities in the concluding clause of section 4. If I could just take the Court to that. The statute is obviously reproduced in a variety of places, but it's also at page 3 of our brief. And so, after 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(2), there's this concluding clause, and the text frames the workday. And it says that the Portal Act, 4(a)(1) and (2), will apply to activities which occur -- I'm quoting now -- \"which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities.\" And it simply follows, as a matter of the plain text, that when Steiner held that those activities, \"such principal activities,\" include the donning and the doffing, that everything that happens between those two events is not encompassed by the Portal Act."

In the Tum case, by contrast, the employees show up at a cage, they wait for things, they walk, they pick up something else, they wait, they pick up something else. And so, there's a body of time that I refer to as the donning and doffing process. All of that would clearly be compensable, even in your hypothetical. Your hypothetical would address the final piece of time, and that is, you get your last piece of clothing on, and you have to go to the floor, and the employer could say, \"Take a 15 minute break,\" in there. I suppose that's hypothetically possible. I think the reason it doesn't happen in these cases and in the other cases I've studied is that the employer has an incentive, when they're forced to compensate, to do things efficiently. What happens is, the employer will say, \"All right, your shift is going to start at 6:30 in the morning; therefore, you can clock in and start donning at 6:23.\" That's a 7-minute window, and that forces the employees to do everything efficiently. They don't insert artificial breaks."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

But -- and that is -- that is possible, under the petitioner's scheme, because it is left to private negotiation; whereas, what you say is that they must pay for that. They must pay for that walk from the donning and doffing. They cannot negotiate out of it, because if it's in the Fair Labor Standards Act, it is mandatory. So I -- don't talk to us about efficiency.

It's worth noting that Congress drew a line about whether -- in terms of whether there was a collective bargaining agreement involved, because under section 203(o) of the statute, in workplaces covered by a collective bargaining agreement, you can negotiate out of at least clothes changing. But I think within the framework of the statute that we do have, I am actually quite correct, and that is, right now, today, the employers have no incentive to adopt an efficient scheme for arranging donning and doffing. They can put things in different buildings if they like. The employees here are required to spend 10 or 20 minutes waiting for different clothing at different times, depending on how long the lines are. It is a workable scheme that Congress designed that said, \"We're going to have a workday.\" And the employer is in charge of deciding when the workday begins or ends, but, during that workday, they're going to have to pay.

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Portal Act excludes walking time from compensation only when it occurs outside the workday, before an employee commences, or after he ceases, his principal activities. And Steiner held that the term \"principal activities\" includes activities that are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities. It follows that when donning and doffing are integral and indispensable parts of the principal activities of the employees, then walking that occurs after donning, and before doffing, occurs within the workday, and it is not excluded from compensation by the Portal Act. Now, the employers in these cases have argued that the term \"principal activities\" does not encompass activities that are integral and indispensable parts thereof, and that Steiner did not so hold. But, at the very outset of its opinion, the Court, in Steiner, posed the question presented as whether changing clothes and showering are compensable as part of the employee's principal activities, and had answered that question several pages later by stating that it agreed with the conclusion of the court of appeals in that case that the term \"principal activities\" includes activities that are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities, and that the activities in question in that case fit within that description. Now, that was the only textual basis on which the Court could have reached the conclusion that it did, because, if the only principal activities in that case had occurred on the production floor, then the changing of clothes at the beginning of the day, and the showering at the end of the day, necessarily would have been preliminary to and postliminary to said principal activities, and thereby expressly excluded from compensation."

    {
      "speaker": "GORNSTEIN",
      "speech": "Justice Scalia, we are not asking for an extension of what you would regard as an erroneous holding. All we're saying is that you read the term \"principal activities\" as the Court interpreted it in Steiner. Once you do that, and you plug it into the statute, the plain language of the statute takes over, because it says that walking is only excluded when it comes before the employee commences, or after he ceases, the principal activities. Once you plug \"integral and indispensable\" into that sentence, as Steiner requires, then you are -- the plain language of the statute tells you that that time is not -- is compensable when it occurs after donning and before doffing."

      "speaker": "GORNSTEIN",

Everywhere else it appears, including in (a)(2) and in the concluding sentence, it says \"said principal activities.\" So, the statute itself tells you that the term \"principal activities\" has to mean the same thing everywhere it appears. And since you have already interpreted that term, in Steiner, to include \"integral and indispensable activities,\" that terminology has to appear everywhere in the statute."

It seems that there's a separate -­ second question, which is, How do we tell if the space in time between two different principal activities, and they're two very different types of activities, is a break or part of the continuous workday?"

And that question would be governed by the Court's prior decisions on what constitutes hours worked, together with the Department of Labor's regulations that address what constitute hours worked. And -- within the workday -- and what the Department of Labor has said is, generally, everything within the workday is compensable, except for a meal period and except for a time period where there is a break that is so substantial that the employees can effectively use that time for their own purposes. And so, it says things like 5- to 20-minute breaks are not periods where the employee is not working, but they are resting for the further work. That is common in the industry. And so, that would be an issue that would arise when you had a break that was much longer than that, probably at least a half hour, where you can actually effectively use that time for your own purposes and are not required, essentially, to stay around on the employer's premises and to wait or rest to begin your work anew.

I didn't actually have an opportunity to spend much time talking about them. But I think the answer that the Solicitor General's Office has offered with respect to the waiting time simply illustrates the expandable nature of the workday. Their position -­ Justice Ginsburg -- or, no Justice O'Connor specifically asked that question, \"You're not saying that waiting time prior to engaging in a primary activity, in fact, starts the workday.\" And the answer is, absolutely, it does, because they find that everything that is integral and indispensable triggers the start of the workday. So, to put it into fairly graphic terms. If you have to show up in order to put on a coat in order to go onto the floor in order to do your services, then the waiting time for that coat counts. If, however, you also have to put in earplugs in order to get to the place where you have to get the coat, not only do putting in the earplugs count, under that theory, but, if you have to wait, you have that, and that extends the workday, and all of the walking in between there. So, if you're asking, \"Is this going to become a significant liability?\" the answer is clearly yes. For very significant compensable acts -- and, indeed, in this context, some of those compensable acts were found by the jury to be utterly diminimus -- you're going to end up with significant waiting time, and you're going to end up with significant walking time."

And the expectation is that if you're waiting to get your check, and if you're waiting to check in, the recognition is that those -­ those are completely fortuitous, just as it is here.

And they clearly suggest that the answer is yes. Our suggestion is, that's inconsistent with the way waiting time is handled under the regulations; and, therefore, the answer clearly should be no. And, at a minimum, the Court ought to affirm that part of the Tum decision. With respect to the holding of Steiner -- I mean, it's important to put in mind, Steiner -- one of the things -- two things that Steiner focused on -- it focused on section 3.0, and it recognized that there are going to be situations where you're going to be able to bargain away clothes changing. And so, now you're in a situation where, for some -- for -- in some circumstances, because you've bargained away compensation for clothes changing, walking that takes place before or after that will never be compensable; in other situations, it will be compensable. That's an absurd outcome in a situation where Congress clearly had one thing in mind that it absolutely wanted to accomplish, and that was to ensure that walking, riding, traveling to the place where you actually perform the services for which you've been hired, has been -- has -- is excluded from being mandatorily compensated -- Steiner doesn't deal with 4(a)(1); the language is as plain as it can be -- are not -- you know, unless specifically excluded by section 4(a)(1).
