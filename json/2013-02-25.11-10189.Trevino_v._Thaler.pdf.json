This case well illustrates the consequences of that choice. The transcript in this case was not ready -- available for 7 months. That's 4 1/2 months after the trial lost -- trial court lost jurisdiction on any new trial motion.

And the concept -- and the reason for it -- the rationale, was to expedite these type of claims, especially in death penalty claims, under Section 11.071. But the -- and the purpose is that there is two counsels that are appointed. One counsel is appointed to handle the record-based claims, and that's done on direct appeal. The other counsel is appointed in all cases -- there's no question -- on habeas. And that attorney -- that counsel is appointed with the understanding that he's going to have the time to do the extra-record-based claims.

Let's assume, as she did in her hypothetical, that a State says -- doesn't have any case law like Texas does, that says, we prefer you to go that way, for non-record-based claims. Is the difference between that hypothetical State that says, you can do either, and the Texas situation, is that Texas, in your mind, puts up procedural impediments to using the direct appeal mechanism and so that, if the other State hasn't done that, has made the development of evidence, has provided a full opportunity for you to develop a record before the direct appeal is over with, that State wouldn't be subject to Martinez, and Texas is subject to it only because it has the procedural impediments?"

Other States require that it go to direct appeal, and each -- and those States made -- have made a choice. And Texas has made a choice by developing this scheme.

The record in this case wasn't even available for 7 months after the date of the trial. So, even with a new attorney that's appointed -- first of all, that new attorney is a stranger to the case. He doesn't know anything about the case. He's not in a position to talk to the client. The client is not the best person to understand the Rules of Appellate Procedure. So he's got to wait on that -- on that trial record, first of all, to see what's there. And then --"

    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "speech": "Not necessarily. But the -- in the capital arena in Texas, we have the dual-track system, where you get an attorney appointed automatically in a habeas setting, where, in a non-death penalty setting, there is a possibility of getting an attorney in the interest of justice, but it's not always guaranteed. And, in that case, the appeal is done in a successive way, not in this dual-track way. And in -- in the death penalty arena, it manifests -- it makes it even more manifestly obvious that there is a systematic channeling by the State referring these type of claims into habeas, while the State attorney, the district appeals attorney, focuses on the record-based claim, and the habeas attorney is dealing with all of the case, not just the trial, but the -- the appeal, to make sure that there was no ineffectiveness on his part, that -- and also to do the investigation on the extra-record-based claims, which takes a substantial amount of time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
      "speech": "Counsel, you -- you started to answer this question, but it is something raised by many of the amici opposing your position, which is that, by adopting your position, we're essentially having to examine the 49-plus -- because we have territories that have collateral and direct review as well -- plus systems to see which apply -- to which Martinez applies and which -- to which Martinez doesn't apply. And so the question is: How do we write this to sort of give enough guidance, so that we're not examining each of the 49 -- or 49 systems -- or maybe 48, after we've decided Martinez?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "speech": "Okay. I would suggest the rule to be that Martinez applies when a State channels ineffective assistance of counsel claims to State habeas and makes it impracticable in the vast majority of cases to raise the claim on direct appeal. And, in answer to your question about all of the States, many of the States do make it -- do make habeas available in the direct appeal arena. So it's --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
      "speech": "So the reason why -- the reason why there was a movement to channel ineffective assistance of counsel claims to collateral review is that it is often -- maybe in the great majority of cases -- impracticable to adjudicate them on direct appeal. So, under your standard, it seems to me that covers every State."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "speech": "Well, it wouldn't, Justice Alito, for this reason: Many States have a mechanism, unlike the Texas scheme, which permits the expansion of the record. Some States, like Utah, who authored the amicus brief, has a Rule 21.3, which permits the claimant to go back and expand the record. We don't have the -- that ability in Texas."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

So you've got that 30-day window when you file that motion for new trial that you have to do all of those things, and that's not enough time."

That 75-day window, in order to expand the record, is part of this whole system, that it's understood that habeas claim is the -- the IAC claim is channeled into habeas."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

Now, as I understand the procedure in those cases, it is the following: On direct appeal, the attorney can make a motion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and, if some threshold is met, the appellate court can remand the case to the trial court for a hearing on ineffective assistance.

You're no longer available to -- you know, be taken off the list to get appointments on these type of claims. And -- and it's also against the Bar rules to -- to have that adverse interest against your client."

But as far as Texas is concerned -- you know, we are in a situation that we find ourselves in -- in a Martinez situation, where there was no ability to -- to raise -- the system that we have prevents you from raising this claim. And, as far as the other States are concerned, some of the States have a more liberal opportunity to -- to expand the record, but that's not the system that we have in Texas. And this --"

      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "speech": "Well, it -- it takes a while. I'm not going to say a long while, but releases are required. Sometimes, there's opposition to releasing those records. But the biggest part of -- of this whole problem is getting the record, is also, in our situation, to have Mr. Trevino evaluated regarding his -- there was never a psychological or sociological study done in his case, and to have a psychological eval done, that doesn't happen in 30 days. And one -- you've got to get the records, and, in some of these situations, one record leads to another record, finding one witness leads to another witness. And, by the time you start developing all these other avenues and when you put all that together, then you're in a position to present that to an expert, in order to make that sort of evaluation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "speech": "That's correct because the 30 days is -- is a limit; it's a bar. That's all he has. And, in addition, the -- the direct appeal attorney has his own responsibilities. There's a division of labor that's here, that the direct appeal attorney is supposed to review the entire record, to look for all of whatever errors that might be there. And while -- and that's why, in Texas, where you have this dual-track system in order to expedite the appeal, there is a new attorney that's appointed to do the habeas work."

Can you tell me how anything that's said in the Texas Bar briefs helps your case?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",

They recognize the fact that extra record investigation is the responsibility of the habeas counsel. I would like to reserve the balance of my time."

Those procedures offered Petitioner two bites at the apple. The first bite came in a constitutionally protected direct appeal proceeding. And any deficiency in that proceeding would have been the source of cause under existing cause and prejudice standards to excuse a subsequent default. Allowing the Petitioner to assert cause on the basis of a second bite at the apple -- that is, a State habeas proceeding -- would create an unwarranted and unworkable extension of Martinez."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

State, states that the lack of a clear record, usually, will prevent the appellant from meeting the first part of the Strickland test as the reasonableness of counsel's choices and motivations during trial can be proven deficient only through facts that don't normally appear in the appellate record. So the only question presented by those instructions that are quoted over and over again in the Petitioner's briefs is whether and to what extent newly-appointed counsel -- as Justice Alito was pointing out, Texas provides newly-appointed counsel on direct appeal in capital cases -- can supplement the appellate record with an explanation from the trial -- trial counsel. And where the new counsel gets an explanation of the strategies of the trial counsel, the record is then complete --"

It's just that what -- what the Court is saying -- the very next sentence following the ones that are quoted in the Petitioner's brief, says, \"The reason that one should not raise an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal is because, in cases where there is no explanation from the trial counsel, it will be impossible to adjudicate the first prong of the Strickland test.\" It doesn't say that, as a general rule, you should just never do it.

The showing in both States is roughly the same; it's a facially plausible claim of ineffectiveness."

I'm -- I'm very interested in the State Bar brief. It's a little hard for me to parse. It did say there is a conflict of interest in -- between the habeas counsel and the -- and the counsel on direct. And it also -- it also indicates that the habeas counsel has to file the application in the convicting court not later than 180 days after -- or not later than 45 days after the State's original brief, which seems to help the Petitioner here because the original brief in -- in the direct appeal proceeding is deemed important for the habeas counsel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLDHAM",
      "speech": "Justice Kennedy, I don't think there is anything in the State Bar brief that helps either side in this sense because the State Bar agrees that there were no relevant guidelines of any kind at the time of any of the proceedings in this case. The only guideline that any Bar association had promulgated at the time of the direct appeal proceeding or State habeas proceeding in this case was the 1989 American Bar Association guideline, 11.9.2, which specifically told the direct appeal lawyer in this case to raise every colorable claim he could, regardless of any State procedures to the contrary. And, if he had raised a substantial Wiggins claim or if he had even tried his best to raise a Wiggins claim that could be -- could be amplified and further developed on State habeas, we wouldn't be standing here today because it would have been properly exhausted and adjudicated on the merits in State court. So I don't think that the Bar association really has anything one way to say or the other, which is maybe why it filed on behalf of neither party. But to return to Justice Breyer's question, I don't think that what -- what we're talking about is to come up with anything new. I think what we're talking about in this outside-of-Martinez world is actually very old. We are just talking about the Carrier rule, the normal rule that applies to cause and prejudice for all defaults in States across the country. And I think that the best way to understand it is to imagine, in the very hypothetical that you offered, where there is just one person who could get through, that person would have a constitutional claim in the State of -- I'm sorry, the other 900 or however many there were, those people would have constitutional claims in the State of Texas for the deprivation of a meaningful opportunity to press their claims on direct appeal. And as from the Federal -- and that would serve as cause, if the State courts denied it, that would serve as cause to overcome a default in Federal court and to get an adjudication of that claim."

And if it's true that, although Texas has a technical possibility of doing that outside of collateral review, but, in fact, that the lawyers are told not to use that route, that the lawyers don't use that route, that, if they do use that route, the likelihood is that they will be thrown out for using that route, the question is why that -- the formal availability of a mechanism that nobody uses and that everybody is told not to use should matter with respect to the application of an equitable rule like Martinez?"

      "speaker": "OLDHAM",
      "speech": "Justice Kagan, there is no work for an equitable rule in Martinez to do if you can get there another way.

But -- but claims against appellate ineffectiveness for failure to raise a claim on direct appeal are -- are raised and adjudicated on the merits all the time in Texas courts. And there are specific ones that say that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel to fail to develop the record using the procedures which the State has allowed through the new trial window."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "Well, the -- the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in addition to saying, as a general rule, bring it up on -- on collateral review, said -- and there's a reason. The reason why is the undeveloped record on direct appeal would be insufficient to establish claims that must be supported by extra-record evidence. So that seems to be an expectation that extra-record evidence will be developed on collateral review, not direct appeal."

      "speaker": "OLDHAM",

That's all that -- and, to the extent that the appellate lawyer fails to do that, that can constitute cause under the ordinary rules of cause and prejudice without creating another Martinez exception, which we would submit is going to be highly, highly unworkable, given that the court is going to have to determine when is a little bit enough and when is not enough sufficient for Martinez."

Now, is that correct."

The abatement issue, as Justice Alito just said, is only available -- as referred in our brief on page 6, is only available when there is a denial of the constitutional right to an attorney. And those situations is when there's a delay in appointing the direct appeal attorney after the trial. So, during the 30-day window to file the motion for new trial, that time limitation is -- is -- that clock is running, and, if there's no attorney appointed, the constitutional violation is considered a critical stage of the trial. And since there's -- if there's no attorney appointed during those 30 days, that is the only time, as Justice Kennedy is correct in saying, that that is the time that the abatement procedure is permitted. That is the only time."

It's page 20 -- 20 of our reply brief, that the position in Sprouse is that there would be no constitutional defect if appellate counsel didn't have time or the record to raise the ineffective assistance claim, and that's because the habeas proceeding is available to direct -- to develop the claim and is the proper place to do so. And that's the State's brief. It's on page 20 of our reply brief. The other thing that I wanted to -- to bring to the Court's attention is that the Respondent cites a couple of cases that are aberrant -- they're aberrations, and they really don't -- shouldn't -- since this Court has -- has brought out a sensible rule in Martinez and this Court has said this Court's rule sensibly speak to the ordinary case, not -- not the aberrational. And that's exactly what we have here. The last thing that I wanted to say is -- is that the direct appeal, if -- if -- there's a choice here that the State has systemically developed a system that has caused -- that has directed attorneys on appeal that the habeas attorney does the extra-record claims, the Wiggins-type claims, and that the -- the claims that are raised on the record go to the direct appeal attorney. That is the system that the State has developed. Those are the rules that govern this system that have been promulgated by the court of criminal appeals and the Supreme Court, and that's the system -- the scheme that we are under. And because --"

The Texas scheme, because of that abuse of the writ, proceeds -- causes procedural default, and that puts us in this quandary, where a person like Mr. Trevino is unable to get relief because he has an ineffective trial lawyer. And, now, he is -- that ineffective trial lawyer -- his ineffectiveness is being insulated by the ineffectiveness of his -- of his habeas lawyer. And that's not what should happen. It's -- it's just not equitable, it's not fair. And Mr. Trevino, someone in his situation, should have a right to complain about the ineffectiveness of his trial lawyer."
