That amendment must be given meaning. Our interpretation is the only one that does so. Consistent with the common­law understanding that Congress codified, \"actual fraud\" is a term of art that includes a recipient's knowing participation in a deliberate fraudulent transfer. By contrast, the Fifth Circuit's holding that actual fraud invariably requires a misrepresentation makes Congress's amendment superfluous because it equates actual fraud with the preexisting terms, \"false pretenses\" and \"false representation.\" Respondent's interpretation is even worse. It merely restates a preexisting scienter requirement. And in any event, Congress could not plausibly have added \"or actual fraud\" to the discharge bar in order to modify the previous terms to mean intentional false pretenses or an intentional false representation."

This Court has, in the past, refused to infer ­­ to interpret congressional amendments simply to restate existing rules when there is a plausible ­­ indeed, settled, in light of the common­law ­­ understanding, like the one that we offer that gives the amendment an additional function. The other problem with Respondent's interpretation, of course, is grammatical. \"Or\" is a disjunctive term that expands on what comes before; it's not a term that limits what comes before.

      "speaker": "DVORETZKY",
      "speech": "Nobody seems to know why. We don't dispute, of course, that typically, most commonly frauds will involve misrepresentations, and so those frauds were still covered. And of course, as a result of Congress's drafting, there are other discharge bars that apply to narrower types of ­­ narrow and different types of fraud. And so Congress didn't completely forget about fraud in 1903. It did, however, take it out of this particular discharge bar, over the concern expressed by at least one ­­ one legislator. In the interim period, between 1903 and 1978, courts did note that the discharge bar in effect at that time covered only false pretenses and false representations, and that there was in fact a gap. And then in 1978, as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the Bankruptcy Code, Congress closed that gap. And so we submit that this Court should interpret the ­­ the discharge bar in a way that gives full effect to Congress's amendment. Our interpretation is consistent with the plain common­law meaning of the words \"actual fraud.\" It does not require grammatical distortions, and it accords with the purpose of the discharge bar, which is, again, to provide relief only for honest debtors and not to allow the Bankruptcy Code to be used as an engine for fraud in the way that occurred in this case."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DVORETZKY",
      "speech": "Sure. Let me address the fraudulent conveyance provisions first. The fraudulent conveyance provisions are targeted at the transferor, not the transferee. And so our reading of 523 complements those provisions rather than conflicts with them. 727 provides that there is no discharge at all if a debtor transfers assets to ­­ to hinder creditors within a year of the bankruptcy filing. 548 allows the trustee to pursue claims for transfers within two years, but nothing about our reading of 523 is inconsistent with that. It simply provides that, in addition to those things, creditors may pursue fraud claims where there is a fraudulent transfer against the ­­ the transferee. And if the transferee ends up in a double bankruptcy situation, so to speak, then at that point, 523 complements the other provisions. With respect to the other discharge bars that address fraud, there is inevitably some overlap among these discharge bars. Partly that's a result of Congress's drafting. Congress chose to use the word \"fraud\" in multiple places, and so you're going to have overlap as a result of that. Partly it is a result of a belt­and­suspenders approach to effectuate the policy of ensuring, again, that fraudulent debtors don't get away with their fraud. Our reading, however, does not lead to any more overlap than Respondent's reading does. Either way, there is going to be overlap between the false pretenses and false representations type of fraud, which Respondent thinks (a)(2)(A) is limited to. And fiduciary fraud, for example, under (a)(4), if that fiduciary fraud takes the form of a false pretense or a false representation."

      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court of Appeals erred in holding that Section 523(a)(2)(A) always requires proof of an intentional misrepresentation in order to prove actual fraud. There are three main reasons why Petitioner and the government are right about our interpretation of Section 523(a)(2)(A). The first is that this Court has said many times that when Congress uses a term that has an established common­law meaning, courts should give it that meaning when it's used in a statute. For centuries, the term \"actual fraud\" has been used at common law to refer to schemes that are in ­­ that ­­ that where property is transferred with the ­­ with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. There is no reason to give that text any different meaning than in Section 523(a)(2)(a). The second is that our view is the only thing that ­­ the only interpretation that gives any meaning to the 1978 amendment. And the third is that our view is consistent with Congress's overarching purpose and the Bankruptcy Code, that ­­ that dishonors creditors ­­ excuse me ­­ dishonors debtors, not be permitted to use the Code to get rid of their debts. Now, Respondent offers a competing textual interpretation of the term ­­ of the phrase \"or actual fraud.\" I think Petitioner has explained well why that interpretation doesn't make any sense as an ­­ as a grammatical matter. It also wouldn't give any effect to the 1978 amendment. Petitioner also relies on the ­­ on the word \"obtained,\" which Justice Breyer was referring to as well. Excuse me. Respondent does ­­ Respondent suggests that our interpretation doesn't give any meaning to the word \"obtained,\" if obtained doesn't mean that a false representation was directed at a creditor. But under our view, the word \"obtained\" actually does two things: The first thing it does is the work that this Court described it as doing in Cohen v. de la Cruz, which is it requires a causal connection between the fraudulent act and the debtor's acquisition of ­­ or possession of the property or money. But the second thing it does, in the fraudulent transfer context, specifically, is it sort of screens out the innocent recipient of a fraudulent transfer. And so if Congress had instead used the phrase \"obtained as a result of actual fraud,\" then argue ­­ arguably, that could have brought in an innocent recipient of a fraudulent transfer, because as a result, I would suggest that you focus on the transaction that caused the transfer of property. But \"obtained by\" really focuses on the action of the recipient. And so it really just gets at the recipient's mental state and ­­ and fraudulent activity."

And what I said, after reading all ­­ \"fraudulent conveyance law permits creditors to recover money that a debtor has disposed of in a manner similar,\" and then I described three paradigm cases. All right. So what they're thinking of is a transferor has creditors.

Now, looking at this statute, it seems to me that the person whose debt is going to survive bankruptcy is not the transferor, because normally, fraudulent conveyance law permitted his bankruptcy judge to claw back the money. But that's not what you're talking about. You're talking about the transferee, and you're saying here, the transferee's participation in the transferor's effort to defraud his creditor is something that also survives.

And just in general, one last thing on redundancy, I think Congress is trying to be comprehensive in preventing dishonest debtors from discharging their debts in bankruptcy. And so Congress used broad words like \"fraud,\" and instead of sitting down and thinking ­­ trying to think up every different fraudulent scheme that people might come up with, Congress just wanted to be comprehensive and say \"fraud,\" and it uses the same word \"fraud\" in multiple places.

That conclusion follows from the text of the statute for at least three reasons: First, because the statute expressly says that the debt has to be for something obtained by the debtor's conduct; second, because the statute explicitly and repeatedly talks about forms of conduct where the debtor obtains something by inducing detrimental reliance; and third, because the statute makes clear on its face that it's the creditor whose detrimental reliance has to be induced. Because Section 523(a)(2) applies only when the debtor induces the creditor to part with something, it does not apply to a debt for receiving money through a fraudulent conveyance. That may be a form of fraud. It may well be a form of actual fraud, but it's not a form of fraud that gives rise to a debt that is subject to exception from discharge under 523(a)(2)."

But I think that part of it is that you can't just look at the term \"actual fraud\" in isolation, just as the other side agrees that you can't look at the term \"false representation\" in isolation. Because they assume that false representation means fraudulent misrepresentation. That's not what the statute says, and that's not what false representation means at common law. At common law, false representation includes negligent misrepresentation and innocent misrepresentation. If you look at the Restatement in 1976, it expressly says that. So does Prosser. So they're agreeing that you can't just take these terms and pluck them out of the statute and say, oh, what did it mean at common law? That's the end of the analysis. The question is, what did these terms mean in this statute?

But the one thing I wouldn't do, I think, is to say actual fraud. Because actual fraud is not synonymous with ­­ with intent. Actual fraud refers to ­­ to conduct that's done with a certain kind of intent. And that conduct, as you just said, includes more than false representation and false pretenses.

And in that case the Court ­­ it was a very similar situation where you had a statute that was on the books, you had decisions from this Court interpreting that statute, and then Congress added to the statute language that was mirroring the language of this Court's cases. And in that circumstance, the Court said, you know what, we have to look at that language in light of the fact that they took it from our cases. And here, if you look at the ­­ the cases that they took this language from, they are cases that use actual fraud to distinguish intentional fraud from constructive fraud. They are not cases that use actual fraud to say, oh, here's what kind of fraud counts under this statute, fraudulent conveyance. In fact, the only cases that happen to involve fraudulent conveyance and the term \"actual fraud\" are cases where the Court held that the debt did not fall within the scope of the exception to discharge."

The reason the Court concluded that the only kind of fraud that counted was intentional fraud was because the next item in the list was embezzlement.

I think another phrase that I came across was highways, bridges, and public sidewalks. You know, \"public sidewalks\" is what tells you that bridges doesn't include the one in my backyard. So the third term can be a term that informs the meaning. Now, here I'm ­­ I don't think you have to conclude that that's the only thing \"actual fraud\" achieves in this statute in order to accept our reading of the statute. \"Actual fraud\" in this statute ­­ you know, the concept of misrepresentation doesn't have to be completely synonymous with the concept of false representation. What you can essentially view \"actual fraud\" as doing is putting a thumb on the scale of the broadest conception of misrepresentation possible, even if that's broader than the common law tort of false misrepresentation. So one thing that some courts have said when looking at this statute is that it's not clear that false representation reached future looking, you know, statements about whether I intend to perform in the future. And some courts have said, well, you know, we don't need to resolve that debate anymore because now that the statute says \"actual fraud,\" that's good enough to tell us that the kinds of misrepresentations that come within the scope of this statute include any kind of misrepresentation that induces the creditor to part with something, even if it might not technically have qualified as false representation at common law. So I think that there's plenty of ways for this term to do work without having it kind of put this sore thumb into the statute of fraudulent conveyance, which is just nothing like the rest of the terms in this statute. It's nothing like false statements, false representations, false financial statements. All of those types of conduct that this statute has always covered involve inducing the creditor to part with something. And that's what differentiates (a)(2) from the 18 other exceptions in the statute. This is not the intentional fraud provision. There's plenty of other provisions in the statute that cover forms of intentional fraud, some of them by directly using the word \"fraud,\" others like (a)(6) by covering intentional injuries to property interests. So it's not as if you need to put this remedy into (a)(2) in order to ensure that if you really do have intentional fraud in the receipt of a fraudulent conveyance, there will be a means of having a debt that's nondischargeable. So I don't know why you kind of strain to get it in here where it seems like such a poor fit. And the other thing that I think is worth keeping note of is that Congress has legislated, quite specifically, on fraudulent conveyance for 150 years. And there are two things that you can note repeatedly when Congress does so. First of all, it uses particular language of ­­ of fraudulent convenance. It talks about a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer, or a transfer made with intent to injure, hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. But the other thing is that the remedies Congress has created for fraudulent conveyance are not creditor­specific. They are instead consistent with the basic principle of equitable distribution. Under 727(a)(2), you have a complete bar to discharge which benefits everybody because no debtor gets a discharge. Under 548(a)(1) and the other provisions that allow the trustee to void transactions, the money comes back to the estate and then gets distributed equitably to all creditors. Here, instead, you have a creditor who's basically jumping the line and saying we should get all of this money, even though within the context of the Chrysalis bankruptcy, the trustee did not see fit to try to void these transactions, and there was no attempt by the trustee to void transactions in this bankruptcy, either. So you end up with a remedy that is really nothing like the ones that Congress has offered when it is actually legislating clearly on the topic of fraudulent transfers ­­"

And I would note here, every single one of this Court's cases that involved (a)(2) has always had a debtor who is using fraud to induce the creditor to part with something. That's the way this statute had been understood up until the Seventh Circuit's decision came along and ­­ and had this new idea that you could get at fraudulent conveyance through this statute. Before that, it was pretty commonly understood that what (a)(2) was about, that differentiated it from other provisions, was that it was about fraudulent inducement. And that's the ultimate problem here. They may have a debt. They may have a debt that even involves actual fraud, but they don't have a debt for anything with which Petitioner was ever fraudulently induced to part resulting in my client obtaining anything by the kind of fraud that counts under 5 ­­ Section 523(a)(2).

      "speech": "Thank you. A veterinarian's office with a sign saying that the veterinarian treats dogs, cats or domesticated animals treats more than just dogs and cats. Surely that office will also treat guinea pigs and hamsters. And so the \"domesticated animals\" phrase does have something in common with dogs and cats, just as \"fraudulent transfers\" has something in common with false pretenses and false representations. These are all schemes to cheat creditors. But by adding \"or actual fraud,\" Congress was expanding upon the pre­existing terms, expanding upon dogs and cats to cover something additional. Respondent does not have any theory for what Congress was doing through this language to expand upon the previous terms. With respect to false representation, courts had unanimously interpreted false representations to refer to the tort of deceit. In his brief, Respondent equates false representations with the tort of deceit. Even if false representations might have been understood as something else, adding \"or actual fraud\" would not narrow false representations to exclude unintentional ­­ unintentional representations. It would at best simply show that you could also have a discharge bar for an intentional misrepresentation. With respect to Neal, Neal has to be understood in light of what was at issue at ­­ in that case. The ­­ the fundamental premise of Neal was that some forms of fraudulent transfers are fraud under the predecessor of Section 523(a)(2)(A). And so the only reason that the Court drew a line there between \"intentional\" and \"unintentional\" participation was on the premise that if the participation had been intentional, that would have been nondischargeable fraud. With respect to the statutory text here, nothing about the statute talks about inducing a creditor to part with anything. It simply talks about obtaining money by fraud. And for the reasons that I explained earlier, a transferee commits fraud and, therefore, incurs a new debt for which he is liable if he knowingly participates in a fraudulent transfer. Ms. Murphy made the point that there ­­ suggested that there's something anomalus about allowing creditors to pursue a fraudulent transfer remedy for the benefit of an individual creditor. There's nothing anomalus about that. State fraudulent transfer laws exist outside of bankruptcy, and so before the bankruptcy stay takes effect, it is essentially a free­for­all where creditors can pursue their rights under State fraudulent transfer laws."

(a)(6) has to be given a narrower construction in order to differentiate it from the other bars. Moreover, (a)(6) doesn't apply in Chapter 13.
