      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are four points I would like to make this morning. First, the plain language of Exemption 2 dictates an extremely narrow category of materials, those related solely to internal personnel policies and rules. Second, even if you look beyond the plain language and look to the legislative history, the legislative history is focused, and the additional legislative history from the House is focused, only on law enforcement or investigatory materials, items that were covered through the 1986 amendments to FOIA, making any additional judicial High 2 unnecessary. The third point: Because of FOIA's purpose, if you find that the language, the plain language, is not clear or if you find that the legislative history isn't sufficient, then the focus must be on an interpretation that supports disclosure, not secrecy. And finally, Congress, in enacting FOIA, conducted the balancing. In reserve for it, itself, the authority to add to or expand FOIA through Exemption 3. It did not leave agency discretion available for the agencies to decide what documents they can provide or not. Moving into our first argument, the plain language. At issue is a very short sentence related solely to internal personnel rules and procedures -­ rules and practices. Congress chose to use the words \"related solely\" on purpose. That's an extremely narrow view. Now, we understand if you look at the words in isolation, perhaps you could see that there is some conflict between them. \"Related\" could be broad; \"solely\" is extremely narrow. But when read together, as they should be in this statute, \"related solely\" is an extremely narrow class of documents."

      "speech": "I ask -- I ask the question because the world has changed in a lot of ways since 1981, and one is that there is now, I think, much greater concern about the disclosure of information that has perhaps profound security implications. That was not as much of a concern in -- in 1981. If you think about, for example, suppose there's a Federal building with a hallway that is accessible only to somebody who has a code key. Would that be -- is that -- does that have to be disclosed under FOIA? Or architectural plans for a Federal building that would disclose the size of the bomb that would be necessary to bring the building down or bring part of the building down; is there any FOIA exemption that covers things like that?"

      "speaker": "MANN",

For example, if it's FBI instructions on guarding a facility or guarding individuals, perhaps that would be law enforcement. And if it's protecting individuals within that building, under 7(F). Or it could be something addressed specifically through Exemption 3. And coming to your original -- the original part of your question, that times have changed, we recognize that; and Congress recognized certainly that times could and would change when it adopted it, and that's why we believe Congress kept for itself Exemption 3."

Exemption 2 on its plain -- now Exemption 2 under its plain language is for use related solely to internal personnel matters. That's an isolated exemption. We don't need to go back to it to look abroad and start looking for other exceptions. We have Exemption 7(E) now to handle that. So there's a clear, sharp dividing line.

Can the public seek information that places the community at a severe security risk? Is it possible for us to say that that kind of information, given our line of reasoning in Rose, could not be legitimate public information?"

    {
      "speaker": "MANN",
      "speech": "But it does not have to be using the Exemption 2, as it's stated, for -- for the internal personnel policies. There are other reasons and ways that some materials that might create a security risk can be protected. Congress has -- there's over 150 -- I believe the number currently is 153 statutes that they've enacted under section 3, using section 3. That includes as recently as last -- last year, when the Department of Defense v. ACLU case came before you. Congress stepped -- that was dealing with the Abu Ghraib photos. Congress stepped in and passed an amendment to the Securities Act to exempt those documents specifically from release, in order to protect. And that was using the proper authority. It didn't require an agency to go back and rely on an \"Expand 2,\" Exemption 2. And that's the danger of the expansion we're looking at, is it allows Exemption 2 to be used for an open-ended -- any time an agency feels it may be appropriate that it might not want to release something, it can rely on Exemption 2. That was never the intent. Congress tried from the beginning to preserve for itself that discretion and that authority and to remove the discretion. As we point out -- as we've set out for you in our briefs, if you look at the legislative history, many of the agencies and Department of Justice that came before Congress asked for that discretion, and Congress did not give it to them. They reserved, and, instead, we have Exemption 3. So what we're saying is that you do not need to -- there may be reasons that you want to take high security information and have it isolated from the public's review, but it's not through using an exemption that was really designed for minor internal matters."

For example, in this case if there was a need for Congress to adopt a specific protection for these maps, it could. The problem that we have here in this case, again, is these maps at this base have been given out. And, again, it's a map. It's a map showing the range, the size of an explosion, and its effect on the surrounding community. That map has been given out from this base to some people, and some of those people they gave it to actually gave it to the newspaper. It's been not given out to others, including my client. Other bases nearby, our Bangor Trident Submarine Base, gave out the map upon request. If this map that we're looking at is that secure, then perhaps it should be that secure and protected across the board. But that's not what we have. We have -- instead, we have an individual within an agency making a decision to withhold a certain document from some people and not others, and when they give it out to the others, they have no control over what those people do with that map.

But the judges on that en banc court thought that they were interpreting the statute going through all of the steps that you outlined. Language is rarely so plain that there's no room for a different interpretation.

They didn't say that it needed to reach all the way out to cover anything as broad as a category of what the Navy's proceeding with here. They looked at manuals of procedure, the disclosure of which would enable the regulated community to circumvent those agency regulations. Again, you addressed that as arguably dicta, but that's the statement you had made in Rose, that it was by the regulated to circumvent regulations. The documents we have, for example, in this case are not. The regulated entity under the Operating-5 manual is the Navy. It's how the Navy stores and moves its munition around.

And, again, that's the -- that's the prevailing question here, is we're talking about public waters, private land around the base, and whether or not that land stays secure. That's the great significant public interest here, is we have a city within a mile and a half of this base and of this very visible loading dock that can be seen from everywhere.

One of the problems that Congress was concerned with is that the old exemption, exemption in section 3, had been construed to apply to internal management, including things such as phone books, agency phone books for personnel. That would no longer be encompassed. Things like budgets that the agency produces, that arguably would -- internal management, that that would not be under the internal personnel rules and practices of the agency. And I think it's important to remember that when Congress drafted this statute, it initially started with internal personnel -- or, excuse me, internal employment rules and practices and changed that to personnel. In the report that effectuated that change, the explanation and the only explanation was that that change was similar -- made the exemption similar but more tightly drawn than the APA's management exemption, which at the time existed in another part of the statute; it was a cross-reference. When Congress then continued to revise the statute, the House made very clear in the hearings, in the House Report, and on the floor that its intent was to cover these types of -- manuals and instructions to agency personnel when doing so would risk the functions that are at issue here. And when Congress in 1986 amended FOIA by adding -- or amending Exemption 7(E), it ratified the existing rule. And it did so because -- it ratified it and it had to -- it extended it in two important ways. Crooker left open the question or at least made it vague as to whether prosecution guidelines would be protected by Exemption 2. The reason that was unclear is because the D.C. Circuit had previously concluded in Jordan that Exemption 2 did not apply. Crooker rejected all of Jordan's rationale, but then someone enigmatically said, but we would reach the same result. Justice Ginsburg's concurrence explained in Crooker that this muddied the waters, and when Congress revisited FOIA and Exemption 7(E), it specifically provided an exemption for law enforcement investigations and prosecutions.

In that context, Congress lowered the bar. It provided more protection for those law enforcement records than Crooker did. This is part of what Congress was doing in Exemption 7 more generally, and this Court's decision in Reporters Committee discusses this. Before '86, Exemption 7 applied where disclosure would cause much of these harms, these enumerated harms. Congress changed \"would\" through most of the sub-provisions of Exemption 7 to \"could reasonably be expected to,\" and they did so also in Exemption 7(E) where -- with respect to the guidelines provision. When guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions could reasonably be expected to circumvent the law, that's what the exemption covers. In doing so, it's providing -- Congress decided to extend Crooker. It extended the protections by lowering the bar in '86, and it also, as we have discussed, did so to specifically address the D.C. Circuit's decision in Jordan, or at least what might have been left of that after Crooker. We see that as simply building on the back of Crooker, and it did so specifically in the -- the law enforcement context, but it did so with the premise that Crooker had properly understood Exemption 2.

So long as it fits within the rubric of internal personnel rules and practices of an agency -- that is, it is providing guidance, it is providing rules and practice for the agency's personnel to follow in conducting the agency's function -- it could well be deemed to fall within Exemption 2.

Exemption 2 addresses a special problem. It addresses the problem of releasing documents where the very release would frustrate the function of having those documents in the agency -- for the agency. And so there's no other exemption that does that. And requiring Congress -- remember, this has been the way this has worked for almost 30 years.

When this case came to me, my client told me that he could not get these maps that he had gotten previously because the Navy was classifying them as personnel documents. What is my reaction as a lawyer? What? What are you talking about? I can read the language of this statute. It's talking about a narrow exception, which is exactly what Congress set up. Nine narrow exceptions. The one open-ended one is the one that Congress kept for itself, Exemption 3. If the Navy doesn't believe that these documents can be or should be classified, but the Navy doesn't want to release these documents for some reason, then the Navy's recourse is to go to Congress as other agencies have done and seek a special protection for these documents. But it's not to distort the words \"personnel practices and rules\" to expand to every document that is used by personnel. And that's precisely what the Navy is asking for, on page 51 of their brief, and we responded to it in our reply. They're looking for an exemption that covers a wide range of information concerning internal rules and practices where disclosure would risk circumvention and where other FOIA exemptions are unavailable. They're asking you to create for them what they -- what Congress wouldn't give them in 1964 or '66, broad discretion. And it doesn't belong. It certainly doesn't belong under the very narrow Exemption 2. If there are no other questions, I'm complete."
