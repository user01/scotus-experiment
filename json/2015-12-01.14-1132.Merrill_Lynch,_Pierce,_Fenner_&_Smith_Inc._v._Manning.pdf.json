      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In language that differs distinctly from the \"arising under\" language of Section 1331, Exchange Act Section 27 confers on the Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty created by the Exchange Act and its regulations. That language establishes a straightforward test. The Federal court has exclusive jurisdiction if the suit is brought to enforce Exchange Act duties even if the suit is also brought to enforce State law duties. In particular, the words \"brought to enforce\" focus on what the plaintiff itself wants the court to decide, not on what the court would necessarily have to decide, as 1331 has been read to require. By applying the 1331 test, the Third Circuit not only ignored Section 27's distinct language but also its distinct policies, which strongly disfavor State court adjudication of Exchange Act duties and thus are exactly the opposite of the policies favoring State court adjudication that underlie the Jackson Pollock canvas this Court has painted over Section 1331. Respondents, however, begin not with the necessity rule derived from 1331 but with a much more aggressive position that Section 27 only creates jurisdiction over causes of action created by the Exchange Act itself and thus categorically bars jurisdiction over State­based causes of action like those asserted here."

There was no private right of action under 10(b); there was a market manipulation of a 9(a), short­swing profits; and a third one that I don't recall. So if we look at the context, we have a history of States regulating securities. We have a parallel provision in the Exchange Act, Section 28, that this Court in Matsushita acknowledged, expressly endorsed the fact that States were going to continue to regulate. So I think the Congress that passed the '34 Act was thinking the following: They were thinking we have a very narrow window of claims that are created by this Act. And for those, a 9(a) straightforward market manipulation claim, for ­­ for ­­ for wash sales. We don't want State courts adjudicating those, because those are very technical.

That's an analogue to a 10b­5 action. And so if we look at paragraph 30 of our complaint ­­ this is on pages 53­A to ­­ to 54­A ­­ we make clear that the relevant provision of New Jersey law is substantially similar to the Federal securities law. We're referring to 10(b). When ­­ when the Uniform Securities Act was promulgated in 1956, Section 101, which New Jersey adopted, mirrors 10(b). If you're going to bring a claim under Federal law, you're not suing under Reg SHO. Manipulative short­selling existed well before Reg SHO. It's a standard. You're basically saying someone is taking a short position. They're injecting inaccurate information into the market because they have taken a position that's larger than normal supply and ­­ and demand would ­­ would bear, given the size of the public float. They've chosen to do that because they think it's going to drive prices down and they're going to make more money. You don't need to prove all of that to get a violation of Reg SHO. Reg SHO was enacted by the SEC because this was a problem. What Reg SHO does is it allows the SEC to take enforcement action and to fine people that engage in conduct that is likely to constitute market manipulation. The point of it is not to punish market manipulation. The point is to try and stop people from doing it in the first place. To put it ­­ to put it differently ­­"

Let me assume the best case for them, that we've relied on Federal duties and try and put it through those ­­ the ­­ the ­­ the legal question that you've asked. I think one way to resolve this is to take the simple approach, which is what I advocated first, and to say, look, if it's just enforcing a State law cause of action, even if it incorporates Federal law, that's all 27 does, and you're done. I understand the premise of your question is let's say you've rejected that, and we're thinking, you know what, maybe some State­law claims fall within the sweep of Section 27; how do we think about this? Here's what I would say. I would say that whether this is an arising under statute or not, it has to incorporate what I'll call a Federal necessity requirement, because that's a longstanding rule that's part and parcel of the well­pleaded complaint rule. And if you look at Pan American, for example. Let's say I accept what my friend Mr. Hacker says that it's dicta, they weren't saying it's an arising under statute, they applied ­­ this Court applied the well­pleaded complaint rule without looking at the text of the statute at all. It's a sensible thing to say that when Federal jurisdiction over State­law claims is predicated on the Federal character, there being a Federal issue, that we use the well­pleaded complaint rule. It's also similarly sensible that the well­pleaded complaint rule would have an adjunct which is Federal necessity, and that's precisely what the Court said in Christianson. And I'll quote the Court: \"The well­pleaded complaint rule focuses on claims, not theories, and just because an element that's essential to a particular theory might be governed by Federal patent law does not mean the entire monopolization claim arises under patent law.\" Now, to the second half of your question, which is, well, how does that ­­ how do they map together? Well, then the question becomes how did we allegedly use this Federally? Do we use it in our RICO claim as one of several predicate acts? That's all that's ever been alleged until today. I was surprised to hear a suggestion that ­­ well, I shouldn't say until today; until the briefing in this Court. In the lower court, the suggestion was that we relied on a Federal duty because it was somehow being snuck in as a ­­ an additional predicate of our RICO claim. I resist that cause ­­ that claim.

The ­­ 1331 still exists. 1331 is powerful, and we can call it Jackson Pollock all we want, but it's been adopted, it exists, and it's applied by courts. So I think that there is a very small distinction between incorporating it here or not. There is a distinction, exclusivity versus ­­ versus nonexclusivity, I understand that; but my point is the simplest way of out this morass, I think, is to say we want a simple, administratable rule and we only look to 27 to confer jurisdiction over Exchange Act­created claims, and we have, as a backdrop, 1331. Now, if you resist that, Justice Breyer, and you don't like that and you say, okay, well, what's the second­best option? There ­­ there's ­­ there's two, and I don't really need to advocate one as opposed to the other because we win under both, but I'll throw them out there. One is to say we don't have to call this an arising under statute. We don't have to reach the difficult question of, well, was ­­ was that what Pan American was holding; did they ­­ did Congress intend to incorporate 1331 wholesale in all of its elements? There ­­ there's a simple way out, which is to say the notion of Federal necessity ­­ this is the one question that you were saying ­­ does not inhere in the words \"arising under.\" It inheres in the well­pleaded complaint rule, which is a backdrop presumption which should apply to any type of congressional grant of ­­ of Federal jurisdiction over State law claims unless Congress says otherwise. So I think that's the second­best option. You say, okay, it's not only a creation test. Section 27 can reach some State law­created claims, but they must be necessary. And there's a long jurisprudence of this Court. It's in the arising under context of what it means to be necessary. And then you don't have the difficulty of trying to look to whether it's substantial, doing a Federalism balance. You would essentially assume if it's something that trigger ­­ is triggered by an exclusive jurisdiction provision of the Exchange Act, it must be substantial; it must fit the Federalism balance."

Certainly I can defend that proposition, and we did in our ­­ in our briefing. There ­­ there is a solid basis to do that. The Court interpreted materially identical language that way in Pan American, as we pointed out in our brief Section 22 of the Securities Act, which uses materially identical language. Then in the removal bar equates that language with arising under. I could defend that proposition. I just don't think it's the most natural reading of the language. If you're asking me honestly, like what do I think Congress intended? I ­­ I believe that they intended \"brought to enforce\" duties or liabilities created under ­­ under the Act to mean the three narrow categories of Federally created causes of action in 1934. I think that's what the statute meant. I don't think Congress has done anything since then to change that. If you look to SLUSA in 1998 where there was this serious concern on the part of Congress of what was happening in terms of State law­created causes of action, the initial bill that was proposed would have preempted all State law­created causes of action. It didn't go very far. Instead, Congress said, no, we're going to restrict this to covered class actions. So if ­­ if you're ­­ if we're trying to find what I think is the most intellectually honest reading of the language, and consistent with the history, I actually don't think it's adopting arising under, but I certainly could defend it as a reasonable interpretation of the language in the context."

One of the things that ­­ that animated the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act was the concern that lawyers were driving litigation and not clients. And that's why, for example, one of the things that went into the PSLRA was a requirement of who the most appropriate plaintiff is. That doesn't happen when you have cases like this, when you have the CEO of a company who holds 2.1 million shares who's bringing a claim. And so not only was it not the point of Congress in 1933 and 1934 to invade the province of State courts, if we look at the entire history of purposes and ­­ and Congress trying to say, well, we have some concerns about what State courts are doing, there has never been an express concern about State courts enforcing State law in individual actions like this one. For the Court to hold otherwise would be unprecedented because you would be stripping State courts of the type of jurisdiction that they've had since the time of the Exchange Act. 10(b) of the Exchange Act itself was predicated on common law deceit and fraud and a whole history of what was occurring in State courts. And I just don't think there's any way to read Section 27 that's workable from the Court's jurisdictional precedents, but it's also sensible in terms of what the dual system of securities regulation is trying to do.

In some instances they want to be there because the law is more robust. There's no scienter requirement. You can bring a Holder claim.

These naked short selling cases, they're new. You know, the Overstock case that's happened, we would prefer a State forum for our State law­created claims to convince a State court that this is actionable and, you know, it should warrant punitive damages.

And if you engage in certain conduct, you ­­ you short a stock, you haven't borrowed it, you have no reason to believe you've borrowed it, the SEC can fine you under statutes where there's no prior right of action. That doesn't make out a market manipulation came ­­ claim, Justice Ginsburg. To prove market manipulation, you have to go a step further.

So the point I was trying to make is if there were an analogue to our State law claim, it's not Reg SHO, it's 10b­5. And ­­ and the idea that you can't bring a parallel 10b­5 action in State court and have the State court adjudicate it, that's never been the law. But they're ­­ they're essentially trying to do an end run around that analysis by suggesting that somehow Reg SHO is what we are trying to enforce. Reg SHO is not relevant for that purpose. Reg SHO doesn't help us. Even under Federal law we wouldn't have a private right of action. Section 9(d) of the Exchange Act, there's no private right of action for that. Section 10a­1 of the Exchange Act. These are the ones that deal with naked short selling. No private right of action. Has to be 10(b)."

That's what created what they call counterfeit shares. That, in and of itself, forgetting intent, is also what diluted the shares and caused their problems. That's clear from paragraph 33.
