It doesn't sound coercive to me, I have to tell you. condition.

And you say, across the board this is coercive because no State, even at 10 percent, can give it up. What -- what's the percentage of big gift that the Federal Government can give? And -- because what you're saying to me is, for a bankrupt State, there's no gift the Federal Government could give them ever, because it can only give them money without conditions --"

One of them is the fact that this statute is tied to the decidedly nonvoluntary individual mandate. And that makes this unique, but it makes it significant, I think. I'll continue. I thought you had a question. I'm sorry. The second factor, of course, is the fact that Congress here made a distinct and conscious decision to tie the State's willingness to accept these new funds, not just to the new funds, but to their entire participation in the statute, even though the coverage for these newly eligible individuals is segregated from the rest of the program. And this is section 2001(a)(3). It's at page 23A of the appendix to the blue brief."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "No, Justice Ginsburg, this is distinct in two different directions. One is, in some of the prior expansions of the program, but not all, Congress has made covering newly eligible individuals totally voluntary. If the States want to cover the newly eligible individuals, they'll get additional money; but if they don't, they don't risk any of their existing participation programs. The 1972 program was a paradigm of that. It created this 209(b) option for States to participate. This Court talked about it in the Gray Panthers case. There were other expansions that have taken place, such as the 1984 expansions, where they didn't give States that option. But here's the second dimension in which this is distinct, which is here, Congress has created a separate part of the program for the newly eligible mandatory individuals. That's what they called them. And those individuals are treated separately from the rest of the program going forward forever. They are going to be reimbursed at a different rate from everybody who was covered under the preexisting program. Now, in light of that separation by Congress itself of the newly eligible individuals from the rest of the program, it's very hard to understand Congress's decision to say, look, if you don't want to cover these newly eligible individuals, you don't just not get the new money, you don't get any of the money under the --"

I also should think -- I could not find one case where the Secretary ever did go further, but I also would think that the Secretary could not go further where going further would be an unreasonable thing to do -- since government action is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, since it's governed by the general principle, it must always be reasonable. So I want to know where this idea came from that should State X say I don't want the new money, that the Secretary would or could cut off the old money?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "And Justice Breyer, here's where it comes from, which is from the very beginning of this litigation, we've pointed out that what's coercive is not the absolute guarantee that the Secretary could cut off every penny, but the fact that she could."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "All right. Now, let me relieve you of that concern, and tell me how I -- whether I have -- that a basic principle of administrative law -- indeed, all law -- is that the government must act reasonably. And should a Secretary cut off more money than the Secretary could show was justified by being causally related to the State's refusal to take the new money, you would march into court with your clients and say, Judge, the Secretary here is acting unreasonably. And I believe there is implicit in this statute, as there is explicit in the ADA, that any such cutoff decision must be reasonable. Now, does that relieve you of your fear?"

Second is, I've been -- we've been making in this litigation since the very beginning this basic point, the government has had opportunities at every level of this system, and I suppose they'll have an opportunity today to say: Fear not, States.

We can lodge it with the Court if they'd -- if you'd like. But it's a letter that's in the record in this litigation, and it's a letter from the Secretary to Arizona, when Arizona floated the idea that it would like to withdraw from the CHIP program, which is a relatively small part of the whole program. And what Arizona was told by the Secretary is that if you withdraw from the CHIP program, you risk losing $7.8 billion, the entirety of your Medicaid participation.

End of my argument. End of my question. Respond as you wish. (Laughter.)"

It's not consistent with how -- what we want to accomplish. We're just going to do away with the system and start a new health care plan of some sort. And, States, you can take the new plan, you can leave them. We're going to give out 20 percent less, maybe 20 percent more, depending on what Congress chooses. Can Congress do that?

    "speech": "Well, Justice Sotomayor, before -- I mean, I'll try to answer that question, too. But the first part of the question was, you know, what if the Congress just tried to scrap this and start over again with a new program? Here's why this is fundamentally different and why it's fundamentally more coercive, because Congress is not saying we want to scrap this program. They don't have a single complaint, really, with the way that States are providing services to the visually impaired and the disabled under pre-existing Medicaid. And that's why it's particularly questionable why they're saying that if you don't take our new money, subject to the new conditions, we're going to take all of the money you've previously gotten that you've been dependent on for 45 years, and you're using right now to serve the visually impaired and the disabled --"

  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, that's right, but that shouldn't be a terrible concern, because if Congress wants to do what it did in 1972 and pass a statute that makes the expansion voluntary, every State that thinks that this is a great deal can sign up. What's telling here, though, is 26 States who think that this is a bad deal for them actually are also saying that they have no choice but to take this because they can't afford to have their entire participation in this 45-year-old program wiped out, and they have to go back to square one and figure out how they're going to deal with the visually impaired in their State, the disabled in their State -- of course --"

Most colleges and universities are heavily dependent on the government to fund their research programs and other things, and that's been going on for a long time. And then Title IX passes, and a government official comes around and say -- says to these colleges, if you want money for your physics labs and all the other things you get it for, then you have to create an athletic program for girls. And the recipient says I am being coerced, there's no way in the world I can give up all the funds to run all these labs that we have. I can't give it up, so I'm being coerced to accept this program that I don't want. Why doesn't your theory -- if your theory is any good, why doesn't it work anytime something -- someone receives something that's too good to give up?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Ginsburg, there's two reasons that might be different. One is, this whole line of coercion only applies -- is only relevant, really, when Congress tries to do something through the spending power it couldn't do directly. So if Congress tried to impose Title IX directly, I guess the question for this Court would be whether or not Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed Congress to do that. I imagine you might think that it did, and I imagine some of your colleagues might take issue with that, but that's -- that's the nature of the question. So, one way around that would be, if Congress can do it directly, you don't even have to ask whether there's something special about the spending power. That's how this Court resolved, for example, the FAIR case about funding to -- to colleges."

It's a separate question. But once we take the premise, which I don't think there's a disagreement here, that Congress could not simply, as a matter of direct legislation under the commerce power or something, say, States, you must expand your Medicaid programs. If we take that as a given, then I think we have to ask the question of whether or not it's coercive. Now, you -- in -- in your second question, you asked, well, you know, I mean, where's the case that says that we've crossed that line? And this is that case, I would respectfully say --"

You know, I'm -- I'm not saying that absolutely that's guaranteed that's not coercive, but here's reasons why they're different. The one major difference is the size of the program. I mean, the expansion of Medicaid since 1984 is really breathtaking. Medicaid, circa 1984, the Federal spending to the States was a shade over $21 billion. Right now, it's $250 billion, and that's before the expansion under this statute."

    "speech": "Not necessarily, Justice Kagan. And, again, it's because we're not here with a one trick pony. And this -- one of the factors -- we point you to three factors that make this statute uniquely coercive. One of them is the sheer size of this program. And, you know, if you want a -- if you want a gauge on the size of this program, the best place to look is the government's own number. Footnote 6, page 10 of their brief."

It'll go up to something a little bit over 3 percent of GDP. And now go look at the comparable numbers, which I did look at, with the expansion that we're talking about before. The expansion from 0 to 18 or even from 0 to 6. And while you can argue those numbers, it's pretty hard to argue that they aren't roughly comparable as a percentage of the prior program or as a percentage of GDP. If I'm right on those numbers or even roughly right -- I don't guarantee them -- then would you have to say, well, indeed, Medicaid has been unconstitutional since 1964. And if not, why not?"

    "speaker": "CLEMENT",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Yes, exactly. Well, one is the sheer size. Two is the fact that this statute uniquely is tied to an individual mandate which is decidedly nonvoluntary. And three is the fact that they've leveraged the prior participation in the program, notwithstanding that they've broken this out as a separately segregated fund going forward, which is not to prove --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "So, on the third -- on the third, suppose you have the current program and Congress wakes up tomorrow and says we think that there's too much fraud and abuse in the program, and we're going to put some new conditions on how the States use this money so we can prevent fraud and abuse, and we're going to tie it to everything that's been there initially. Unconstitutional?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "No, I think that is constitutional because I think that's something that Congress could do directly. It wouldn't have to limit that to the spending program. And I think 18 U.S.C. 666 is -- is a statute -- you know, it may -- it's in the criminal code. It may be tied to spending, but I think that's -- that's a provision that I don't think its constitutionality's called into question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "I guess I don't get the idea. I mean, Congress can legislate fraud and abuse restrictions in Medicaid, and Congress can legislate coverage expansions in Medicaid."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Kagan, I think there's a difference, but if I'm wrong about that and the consequence is that Congress has to break Medicaid down into remotely manageable pieces as opposed to $3.3 trillion over 10 years before the expansion, I don't think that would be the end of the world. But I really would ask you to focus on specifically what's going on here, which is they take these newly eligible people -- and that's a massive change in the way the program works. These are people who are healthy, childless adults who are not covered in many States. They say, okay, we're going to make you cover those. We're going to have a separate program for how you get reimbursed for that. You get reimbursed differently from all the previously eligible individuals. But if you don't take our money, we're going to take away your participation in the program for the visually impaired and the disabled. If I may reserve the balance of my time."

    "speech": "I guess my greatest fear, Mr. Clement, with your argument is the following: The bigger the problem, the more resources it needs. We're going to tie the hands of the Federal Government in choosing how to structure a cooperative relationship with the States. We're going to say to the Federal Government, the bigger the problem, the less your powers are, because once you give that much money, you can't structure the program the way you want. It's our money, Federal Government. We're going to have to run the program ourself to protect all our interests. I don't see where to draw that line."

And so, to the extent they don't want to do that, it's because they feel accountable to their citizenry. And so, if they want to do it their way, they have to spend the money to do it their way, if they don't want to do it the Federal way. So, I -- I just don't understand the logic of saying, States, you can't -- you don't -- you're not entitled to our money, but once you start taking it, the more you take, the more power you have."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Sotomayor, a couple of points. One is, I actually think that sort of misdescribes what happened with Medicaid. I mean, States were, as you suggest, providing for the poor and the visually impaired and the disabled even before Medicaid came along. Then all of a sudden, States -- the Federal Government said, look, we'd like to help you with that, and we're going to give you money voluntarily. And then over time, they give more money with more conditions. And now they decide they're going to totally expand the program, and they say that you have to give up even your prior program, where we -- first came in and offered you cooperation, we're now going to say you have to give that up if you don't take our new conditions. Secondarily, I do think that our principle is not that when you get past a certain level, it automatically becomes coercive per se. But I do think when you get a program and you're basically telling States that, look, we're going to take away $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years, that at that point, it's okay to insist that Congress be a little more careful that it not be so aggressively coercive as it was in this statute. And I would simply say that -- we're not here to tell you that this is going to be an area where it's going to be very easy to draw the line. We're just telling you that it's exceptionally important to draw that line, and this is a case where it ought to be easy to establish a beachhead, say that coercion matters, say there's three factors of this particular statute that make it as obviously coercive as any piece of legislation that you've ever seen, and then you will have effectively instructed Congress that there are limits, and you will have laid down some administrable rules."

Your life? Again, it's just money. It's an easy choice. No coercion, right? I mean -- right? Now, whereas, if -- if the choice were your life or your wife's, that's a lot harder.

It's coming from the taxpayers. So, that's part of it. The fact that they're being asked to give up their continuing participation in a program that they've been participating in for 45 years as a condition to accept the new program, we think that's the second thing that's critical --"

The consequence ought to be, if you really can't police this line, then you should go back and reconsider your cases that say that Congress can spend money on things that it can't do directly.

And what makes this so pernicious is that the Federal Government knows that the citizenry is not going to take lightly the idea that there are huge, new Federal bureaucracies popping up across the country. And so, they get the benefit of administering this program through State officials, but then it makes it very confusing for the citizen who doesn't like this.

It means there's flexibility built into the program subject to certain rules that the Federal Government has about how it wishes its money to be used. It's like giving a gift certificate. If I give you a gift certificate for one store, you can't use it for other stores. But still, you can use it for all kinds of different things."

    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "But -- I absolutely agree that if it's cooperative federalism and the States have choices, then that is perfectly okay. But when -- that's why voluntariness in coercion is so important. Because if you force a State to participate in a Federal program, then -- I mean, as long as it's voluntary, then a State official shouldn't complain if a citizen complains to the State about the way the State's administering a Federal program that it volunteered to participate in. But at the point it becomes coercive, then it's not fair to tell the citizen to complain to the State official, they had no choice. But who do they complain to at the Federal level? There's nobody there, which would be -- I'm not saying it's the best solution to have Federal instrumentalities in every State, but it actually is better than what you get when you have mandatory federalism, and you lose the accountability that is central to the federalism provisions in the Constitution."

We are going to impose a special Federal education tax which will raise exactly the same amount of money as all of the States now spend on education, and then we are going to give you a grant that is equal to what you spent on education last year. Now, this is a great offer and we think you will take it, but of course, if you take it, it's going to have some conditions because we're going to set rules on teacher tenure, on collective bargaining, on curriculum, on textbooks, class size, school calendar, and many other things. So, take it or leave it. If you take it, you have to follow our rules on all of these things. If you leave it, well, then you're going to have to fine -- you are going to have to tax your citizens, they're going to have to pay the Federal education tax. But on top of that, you're going to have to tax them for all of the money that you're now spending on education, plus all of the Federal funds that you were previously given. Would that be -- would that reach the point -- would that be the point where financial inducement turns into coercion?"

But here, of course, I think it's important to trace through the history of Medicaid. It is not the case, as my friend from the other side suggested, that the norm here is that the Federal Government has offered to the States the opportunity either to stay where they are or add the new piece. We can debate that proposition with respect to 1972 one way or another. The States have one view about that; we have a different one. But starting in the 1984 expansion, with respect to pregnant women and infants, it was an expansion of the entire program; States were given the choice to stay in the entire program or not. 1989, when the program was expanded to children under 6 years of age, under 133 percent of poverty, same thing. 1990, kids 6 to 18 and 100 percent of poverty, same thing. In fact, every major expansion, same thing. And so, I just think the history of the program, and particularly when you read that in context of 42 U.S.C. 1304, which reserves the right of the Federal Government to amend the program going forward, shows you that this is something that the States have understood all along. This has been the evolution of it, and with respect to --"

Well, guess what, I can take away all your money if you don't make it. I win. Every time, it seems that that would be the case.

But as they said it in their briefs was it's not what you stand to gain, but what you stand to lose. But I think an important thing in evaluating that argument in this context is fully 60 percent of Medicaid expenditures in this country are based on optional choices. And I don't mean by that the optional choices of the States to stay in the program in '84 or '88 or '89. But -- but States are given choices to expand the beneficiaries beyond the Federal minimum and to expand services beyond the Federal minimum."

So, some States may have been more generous than others in Medicaid, but this Act freezes that so the States can't go back. Or am I incorrect?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "It's much more nuanced than that, Justice Kennedy. There is something called a maintenance of effort provision which lasts until 2014, until such time as the Medicaid expansion takes place and the exchanges are in place. That applies to the population. It says, with respect to the population, you can't take anybody out. It does not apply to the optional benefits where the States still have flexibility. They can still reduce optional benefits that they're now providing if they -- if they want to, to control costs. They can also work on provider rates. There's also -- with respect to demonstration projects by which some States have expanded their populations beyond the required eligibility levels, they don't have to keep them in. And then there's also, if the State has a budgetary crisis, it can get a waiver of that, as Wisconsin did. So, that is a -- that's a provision I think that does a significant degree less than my friends on the other side have suggested in terms of -- in terms of its effect, and its effect beyond that is just temporary. But I do think with respect to the -- the first of their three arguments for coercion, the sheer size argument, that it's very difficult to see how that is going to work, because if the question is about what you stand to lose rather than what you stand to gain, then it seems to me that it doesn't matter whether the Medicaid expansion is substantial or whether it's modest, or whether there's any expansion at all. The States, for example -- the Federal Government, for example, could decide that under the -- under the current system, too much money has ended up flowing to nursing home care and that money would be better serving the general welfare if it were directed at infants and children. But if the Federal Government said we're going to redirect the spending priorities of the Federal money that we're offering to you, the States could say, well, geez, we don't like that; we'd like to keep spending the money the way we were, and we have no choice, because this has gotten too big for us to exit. And so -- and in fact, it seems to me, standing here today before these expansions take place, under their theory, the provision is coercive."

And as I read that, that gives the Secretary the authority to cut off all the money that the States' refusal to accept the condition means they shouldn't have. But nothing there says they can go beyond that and cut off unrelated money. Now, there is a sentence, says maybe they could do that. But I thought they had to exercise that within reason."

And as I understand it, I mean, when the Secretary withdraws funds, what the Secretary is doing is withdrawing funds from poor people's health care, and that the Secretary is reluctant and loath to take money away from poor people's health care and that that's why these things are always worked out.

And no one is suggesting that people want to cut health care, but they have different views about how to implement policy in this area. And the concern is that the Secretary has the total and complete say because the Secretary has the authority under this provision to say you lose everything. No one has suggested in the normal course that will happen, but so long as the Federal Government has that power, it seems to be a significant intrusion on the sovereign interests of the State. Now, I'm not -- it may be something they gave up many decades ago when they decided to live off Federal funds, but I don't think you can deny that it's a significant authority that we're giving the Federal Government to say you can take away everything if the States don't buy into the next program."

And the reason Congress predicted it, I think, Justice Scalia, is because the Federal Government is paying 90-plus percent of the costs. It increases State costs by 21 percent."

    "speech": "So, what do you predict? If you predict the same, that 100 percent of the States will accept it, that sounds like coercion."

    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "Prediction is not coercion. I disagree, Justice Scalia. That's just an assumption, and if it proves to be wrong, then Congress has time to recalibrate. And beyond that, I do think -- I just want to go back to the -- the other part of Your Honor's point -- that with respect to the relationship between Medicaid and the -- and the Act and particularly the minimum coverage provision, my friend Mr. Clement has suggested that you can infer coercion because, with respect to the population to which the provision applies, if there's no Medicaid, there's no other way for them to satisfy the requirement. I want to work through that for a minute, if I may, because it's just incorrect. First of all, with respect to anybody at 100 percent of the poverty line or above, there is an alternative in the statute. It's the exchanges with tax credits and with subsidies to insurance companies. So, with respect to that, the part of the population at 100 percent of poverty to 133 percent of poverty, the -- the statute actually has an alternative for them. For people below 100 percent of poverty, it is true that there is no insurance alternative. But by the same token, there is no penalty that is going to be imposed on anybody in that group. To begin with, right now, the level of 100 percent of poverty is $10,800. The -- the requirement for filing a Federal income tax return is $9500. So, anybody below $9500, no penalty, because they don't have to file an income tax return. The sliver of people between $9500 and $10,800 -- the question there is, are they going to be able to find health insurance that will cost them less than 8 percent of their income? And so --"

So, it just didn't occur"

This is the essence of Congress's Article I authority under the General Welfare Clause and the Appropriations Clause. This is not some remote contingency or an effort to leverage in that regard. This is how Congress is going to have the Federal Government's money be used if States choose to accept it. Yes, it was reasonable for Congress to predict in this circumstance that the States were going to take this money, because -- because it is an extremely generous offer of funds: 90-plus percent of the funding. States can -- can expand their Medicaid coverage to more than 20 percent of their population for an increase of only 1 percent --"

There are going to be costs to set that up. But under the statute, the Federal Government is going to pay 90 percent of those costs, the short-term set-up costs.
