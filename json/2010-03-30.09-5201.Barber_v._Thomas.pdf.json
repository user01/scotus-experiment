Why is it that we have to do the calculation that you're talking about, which is start at 311 days and take back days, which makes no sense to me, or their very complicated ten-page number? Why can't they just take 54 days at the end of every year that there is actual service, and that the time served, plus whatever number of days have been earned, you subtract it from the term of imprisonment? So if he was imprisoned for 10 years, he got 540 days for whatever it is. At the end of the 9th year, he made up whatever -- you added up 9 times 54, and you took it away from 10. He serves 9 and that. That would make sense of \"beyond the time served\" language that's in this provision."

At that point of making the determination, that's when they go back to 54 days and have to reset. That way on a 10-year sentence you have 10 blocks that Congress intended to give prisoners to be able to earn 54 days in each of those blocks. Now, the way that we were hearing it posited from Justice Alito, if we have the 54 days on top of time served without any adjustment, then we end up with a 419-year first day -- first year, and you can only fit 8 opportunities to earn the 54 days."

And the reason for that is that they do not interpret \"term of imprisonment\" to encompass the possibility of good time. That is the only -- because you should have 10 blocks of 365 days. Each of those blocks, you may be able to get 54 days. Then it's 311. But maybe you didn't earn any time. Then it would be a 365-block. But the -- actually, the very good idea that Congress had was that you had an incentive at every stage of your term of imprisonment for good behavior. Even if you were misbehaving early in your prison term, at the end you still have the opportunity to earn 54 days against that last 365 days. It counts for every word in the statute. It gives every statute meaning. And it doesn't put us in the position of giving two -- two phrases the exact same meaning in the same sentence.

So January 2, after the first year, you write the word 50 -- the number 54. And you do that each year. And by the time you get to the year 8, what you have done is you have got 432 days. So then you subtract the 430 days from 10 years, and what you get is you are 67 days short of 9 years. So now you look at the last sentence, and what you do is you take 67 days, subtract that from 365, and you've got 298, and you simply prorate for those 298. And you subtract that, too, so he gets another 10 days or so, or 15 days credit, and that's it. And that's following the statute, it seems to me, absolutely literally.

We are institutionalizing a harsher system in a way that doesn't meet the statutory language, because the statutory language says \"term of imprisonment.\" And if it's term of imprisonment, 10 years of a term of imprisonment, I think a reasonable plain meaning is that you have 10 opportunities to earn 54 days."

So you are earning credit as you go through that first year.

He has got 298 days left and by the 260th day he earned 38 days of credit. So he is released after the 260th day of his 9th year.

At the end of each of his 17 years in prison, he has gotten 54 days of credit. What Petitioner Barber is here saying is, I am going to get 3 whole years knocked off the end of my sentence; I want the 54 days for those years, too. I want 54 days for every year of my sentence as imposed by the court, not as served by me behind bars, and that's what doesn't track the language of the statute. Because the only way you can do that, as Justice Alito pointed out, is to read \"year\" to mean 311 days, and it is no answer to say, as Petitioners do, well, you can do the determination whenever. What they are saying is at the end of a 311-day period, you should determine whether the prisoner gets the credit. But what the statute says is the determination itself has to occur at the end of the year. So you can't fold the 54 days into the year because you haven't made the determination yet."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

I understood them to be saying that the determination could be made at the end of 365 days, but if it's determined that the prisoner is entitled to 54 days of credit, then year 1 should be regarded as having begun on the 312th day, rather than the 366th day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALL",
      "speech": "I think that's right, which first it is inconsistent with the language of the statute, which says at the end of each year, so that reads \"year\" to be an 311-day cycle. But it also sets up a very odd system. What happens if the prisoner misbehaves during days 312 and day 365? On Petitioner's approach, it seems to me, the new year has started on day 312. Now, but take the example, he says, well, you can do it on the 365th day. Well, if the prisoner's misbehaved on day 340, is that coming out of the first year or out of the second year."

Petitioners think that you measure credit over these 311-day cycles, and if you -- you know, you get to the 311th day, you take the 54 days of credit, and together, they equal a year of the sentence imposed. But what the statute says is you make the determination at the end of the year. And we don't read \"year\" to be a 311-day period. We read it to be a 365-day period."

If the Rule of Lenity is thought of as a notice requirement insofar as giving you warning to what conduct is punishable, that's one thing, but doesn't the Rule of Lenity mean more than that?

Now, the strong -- a strong argument, I think, for his is the following -- think about that first year. That first year we are going to calculate 54 days, subtract it, everybody seems to agree we get to the number 311, right? But if you were to apply the last sentence to that first year, the prorating sentence, you wouldn't get 54. You would get like 45 days, or 47 or something like that. But everybody agrees under the Bureau of Prisons system that it is 54. And, therefore, in respect to the first year, they are calculating phantom time, i.e., not the first year, but a person who had a sentence to a year and a day. If you had a sentence to a year and a day, you agree it's 54 days, and everybody agrees with that, and that includes phantom time. So he said, well, if you include it for the first year, since the statute says nothing about the first year, why not include it for the other years, too? How can you possibly justify phantom time being included in the first year but not in the other years?"

What they are saying is fine, he may only serve 311 days, 312 days, 319 days, we want the full 54. So, instead of letting him out at 319, back him up to 312, we want the phantom week in the first year. And, so, I think the way the bureau interprets it, there is no phantom time in any year. The way the Petitioners interpret it, there is phantom time in every year, no matter the length of the sentence. As I said I think it creates a gap in coverage. It rests on this assumption that prisoners are always getting 54 days. That is just not the case."

      "speaker": "WALL",
      "speech": "There are no statistics on this, but, yes, Justice Ginsburg, I think the majority of prisoners do earn the full credit, certainly these Petitioners have. But I would say that there are, say, 15 to 20 percent Federal prisoner who tend to be repeat offenders, and they are often being docked to good time credit. So, I think what you will see is that the ones getting 54 days do it consistently, and the ones not getting 54 days, often do that pretty consistently. And, you know, the difficulty on Petitioner's method is that no matter when you want to do that calculation, Petitioners at bottom are saying what you should be looking at is a 311-day period, and you take the 311 days served, you take the 54 days of credit, and together they give you a year of the sentence imposed. And not only does that not serve penological interest, as the bureau has found, but it just doesn't track the language of the statute, which says during each year you have got to comply with the regulations. The statute cares not just about your conduct from days 1 to 311, but your conduct from day 312 to 365. All of those days are equal in the statute's eyes. If you want 54 days of credit knocked off the back end of your sentence, you have got to behave and comply with the rules for a full year each time you want the credit."

And while that might normally be the right course here, the agency has already done that. It has put forward its explanation, so I think this is one of the rare circumstances where we don't need to remand on Overton Park. We know why the agency adopted the rule, and it did it both because of the statutory language and because they thought it was the most sensible policy choice. And I guess I would turn it around a little bit and say you have a rule promulgated by the agency charged with administering the statute, an agency to which this Court has twice deferred in the interpretation of similar statutes. That rule has been upheld as a substantive matter now in 11 courts of appeals. The Ninth Circuit set the rule aside on a procedural basis, which has now been corrected by the agency. It's a republished rule which corrects the infirmities that the court of appeals identified.
