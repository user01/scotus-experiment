    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three Democratic principles at stake in this case. First, the people may instruct their legislators. Second, the people may request information and receive information on the ballot about candidate behavior. And third, the people may put the information called for by Article 8 on the ballot. None of these activities violate any provision of the United States Constitution. With regard to the instruct provision first, this is the issue that divided the panel opinion from the dissent. The instructional provisions are contained in Sections 15, 16, and 17, paragraph one, of Missouri's Article 8. The Eighth Circuit said these instructions violated Article 5 because the voters were third parties to the amendment process. Article 5 doesn't say that. Article 5 provides a specific mechanism by which the Constitution can be amended, and it allocates functions in Article 5 for certain branches of the government to perform. The exclusion of the people from any specific one of those functions does not exclude the people from the right to communicate to their representatives that they want the Constitution amended."

      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "And the instruction is physically contained in Section 17, paragraph one of the proposed amendment, and it relates to Sections 15 and 16 of the amendment, Your Honor, Section 15 stating the intention of the Missouri voters, and Section 16 specifically stating the proposed constitutional amendment that the voters support."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "That is correct, Your Honor. Standing alone, the instructions provisions, these three sections, have no teeth. They are a nonbinding instruction. And as we were instructed by then-Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Kimble, the nonbinding instructions and advice by the voters to a legislature does not violate Article 5."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "That would be correct, Your Honor. Moving on to the second principle, Missourians may request information and may receive information on the ballot about congressional candidate behavior. This Court has indicated and respondents do not contest that states may provide information on the ballot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I think their argument is that it goes beyond information to the point of putting the thumb on the scale, because essentially it uses pejorative language. It's doing more than informing. It's saying, you know, these people have, or this person has violated a trust. And that's more than information. That's a kind of conclusion of fault. That seems to be one of the points of their objection. How do you respond to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, there is nothing that really goes to point three that I made in my opening, that it goes to the specific ballot information and I respond to that by saying, there is nothing that provides voters valuable information that couldn't be used by those voters as the basis for a decision to vote against a candidate. There is no indication in this case, no evidence in this case, that voters will be so overwhelmed by the information contained in the ballot information that they will have the will --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, it's not -- I don't know that they have to make the case that the voters are going to be overwhelmed. The case that they are making is simply that the voters are being given something more than information. The voters are being given in effect a judgment by the state that the particular candidates have referred to, have done something wrong, and that is more than information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "I simply disagree with that, Your Honor. The voters are not being given any more than information. The State of Missouri --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. McAdams, can you point to any other example? There have been examples in briefs certainly of instructions that were given at the time of the Constitutional Convention, but this has been labelled a Scarlet Letter label. It's not the same as Democrat and Republican. It says, disregarded voters' instruction. It says, declined to pledge to support. Are there any other such labels that go on a ballot at a time when the candidate has no opportunity to answer back?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "Well, I would say that party labels go on the ballot at a time when voters have, I mean candidates have no opportunity to respond back. The history of the country is such that party labels were outcome determinative in numerous congressional districts, Your Honor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I asked you, you gave the party labels example. Is there anything comparable to disregarded voters' instruction on issue X, declined to pledge?"

      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."

      "speech": "I don't know of anything comparable to that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "There is something comparable, Your Honor. In the State of Nebraska, in the early 1900s as the people became disaffected with Congress' unwillingness to amend the Constitution to provide for the direct election of senators, they placed labels on the ballot about whether state legislative candidates --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Oh, but that's state legislative candidates, and that's different. There is no federal Constitutional control, except perhaps there might be a First Amendment argument, but we are talking about here -- whatever the state wants to do vis-a-vis state legislatures is different from what they can do, vis-a-vis people who are in a national body and when they are there, they are representing all the people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "Well, First Amendment is one of the claims that they make, Your Honor, and the First Amendment claim would equally be evadable to a situation like the State of Nebraska did. We would not have, for example, a Qualifications Clause analysis that would apply to the state."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, do you have any other example of someone running for federal office, the House or the Senate, where there is such a label?"

      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "I believe there -- not exactly like this label, Your Honor. There are situations where federal candidates have, for example, their address disclosed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I think in Arizona, at least at one time, candidates for the Senate and the House of Representatives had to say they were pledged to recall, which meant that if the state legislature recalled them, they would have to resign. Because they all pledged, and of course, it never happened, so --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "I'm not aware of that, Your Honor. The rules would seem to provide states, the election clause would seem to provide states an opportunity to place information on the ballot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, doesn't the information, given the courts' cases here anyway, have to be generally applicable and evenhanded, like all the regulation because if it's not, that's -- I mean, that phrase comes from a case called Anderson, but there are many of like tenor, it seems to me, that if it's not generally applicable and evenhanded, the state, for no legitimate regulatory interest, is biasing the election, which, which hurts the First Amendment rights of all those who happen to think that term limits is not the most important issue in the election, that would prefer the election were decided on the basis of other issues."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, of course, that's generally true, and it's for that reason that when we get down to the ballot itself, which normally, regulation of the ballot is not for information providing purposes. It is for fair vote purposes. And that's why it seems to me that these cases have held when we come down to ballot regulation, what we are interested in is whether the state's regulation is generally applicable and evenhanded."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes. Reasonable in terms of such purposes as the integrity of the electoral process, preventing voter confusion, ensuring orderliness, and ensuring fairness. Now, not, I haven't seen anything that says reasonable in terms of providing information about one issue but not other issues."

    {
      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "I'm quite certain that is true, Your Honor, and I think that's true for third party candidates today as well. In the example that the respondents give about the one time this was done in California, they give an example where a state legislative candidate who had won a plurality in the party primary came back in the run-off election and lost to someone who did not have a label. It seems that what respondents are offended by there is that the party label designation was not the piece of information that controlled the electoral result."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No? Well, isn't that about what they are doing here. Disregarded. Refused to pledge or declined to pledge. That's why we get into the Scarlet Letter analysis. We would be in a Scarlet Letter analysis if the Republicans said dirty Democrats. I don't see where you are going to draw the line."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "Well, the distinction is that that amounts to, in my mind, a recommendation to vote against the candidate. It would be as if in this case we instead of using the label disregarded voters' instructions concerning term limits for this same behavior, we use the phrase traitor. That is misleading. It would essentially take away, I believe, and overbear the will of the voter if they believe they were voting for a candidate who was a traitor."

But I submit to you that we already know the answer to that question. And we know it because the way in which ballots have been distributed has changed throughout history. Initially, we started out with nothing but write-in ballots. Then parties were actually around printing up ballots for people to cast and using that mechanism to control and buy elections, and the states came up with a mechanism which allowed the states to prepare the ballot. So there is nothing that requires us to use the conventional method."

It has been waived. The petitioner could have chosen if it had wanted to present that issue in its petition or its brief. It did not, and perhaps the reason it did not is the question of severability is predominantly one of state law as to whether under Missouri state law various provisions would be severable from one another, whether the voters would have voted for a preamble that didn't do anything. That is a question of state law. It was not presented in the petition. It was not presented in the brief.

And the reason is because the instructions are part and parcel of the law which the Court of Appeals has said stand or falls on its own, and the principal reason that the law as a whole falls is because it does exceed the state's neutral power to serve as a, an administrator of federal elections and instead has the state putting its thumb on the electoral scale."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANKLIN",
      "speech": "Yes. The reason that party labels would be permissible generally speaking is because they are integrally related to the conduct, the orderly conduct of an election which itself is organized around party lines. In Missouri, as in elsewhere, one does not come to be on the ballot strictly as an individual, but rather as the nominee in most instances of a party. It would be a different case if the state, and I understand it to be conceded here, if the state said to an individual who had achieved a ballot spot as an independent, that nevertheless, that person must disclose that they are, for example, a member of the communist party or the socialist party. That would not be related to the orderly conduct of an election organized around party lines because that would not have anything to do with how the person got on the ballot. Second, a party label unlike the labels in this case, a neutral requirement that all party labels be listed is not related to the content of any individual's views on an issue. Any connotation that the voters draw between parties and viewpoints is imperfect at best, but more important, it's a connotation that the party and the candidate voluntarily associate themselves with in the process of running in an election which itself is organized around party lines. Here, by contrast, the labels are both content and viewpoint based. They are content based because they single out only one issue, term limits, and say to the voters, that is the issue that we deem to be most important of your consideration, most worthy of your consideration. And second, even worse, they are viewpoint discriminatory. They are viewpoint discriminatory because the state is singling out one side of the issue and is labeling only one side and it is doing it in such a way that it is telling the voters that this person has disregarded or failed, pledged to follow a policy which the state deems to be the correct one.

But in any event, I will represent to you that he does intend to run again. The state, as this Court has held, has the authority under the elections clause to enact procedural or mechanical regulations that are nondiscriminatory, evenhanded and politically neutral. It does not have the delegated power to single out one issue which it deems more worthy of voter consideration than others or to disadvantage candidates who hold disfavored views on that issue. The State of Missouri, purportedly to maintain the integrity and the neutrality and the sanctity of the electoral process, prohibits candidates and their supporters from expressing any views to the voters within 25 feet of the polling place. Yet the state itself now seeks to be inside the voting booth to inject its own preferred views and viewpoints on the ballot.

I think the question would be what that hypothetical statute, which we don't have before us, means. This statute we know Missouri meant to make enforceable. We know that because it created an enforcement mechanism, and so the difficult question that you put, which would require determining what that hypothetical statute meant, isn't here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Is it accurate to call it an enforcement mechanism? I mean, usually you enforce laws by punishing people who break them. You send them to jail. You do this or that. Here, the punishment is simply telling people that you ignored the instruction. Is that a punishment? I mean, leaving aside the, you know, the pejorative manner in which the announcement is made, if all you are doing is telling the people he chose not to take on instructions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Well, it's still the case that it's, that it's an enforcement, one, because of the pejorative language, which you have asked me to set aside, but is present here. Two, because it is a decision by the state legislature to focus the attention of the voters and judge candidates on a single issue. And three, because it is done in the voting booth and not in a public forum where there is an opportunity to respond and to debate, so it is an effort, it has the intended purpose and the effect of disadvantaging a class of candidates, and that's something this Court said in term limits that the state cannot use its elections clause authority to do. It interferes with, as Justice Kennedy said, the direct relationship between the national government and its citizens. There is no other example of an effort to enforce an instruction with ballot labels in the case of a federal senator or representative, except for the -- the only one we have been able to find is the Arizona recall pledge. That went off the ballot in 1973. There is still a request to pledge, but it is no longer enforced by a ballot instruction. And of course, it doesn't involve a position on an issue. It doesn't involve a commitment to take a position on a particular issue in the legislature."

      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",

      "speech": "The word manner, in the context of the Time, Place and Manner clause, means the mechanics, the procedures of an election, neutral, evenhanded regulations that enable the orderly election process to occur, and what it particularly doesn't mean is putting a thumb on the scale to influence the result."

    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Yes. There is a question as you have noted, about whether the time, place and manner authority that the Constitution gives to the state legislatures goes to any entity that the state gives legislative authority to, or whether it actually only goes to legislatures. We haven't -- in either case, even assuming that it isn't restricted to the legislature as such, it's our position that the power has simply been exceeded, doesn't go, doesn't authorize the making of nonneutral regulations that are designed to and have the effect of attempting to influence the outcome. With respect to other labels that do sometimes appear on ballots, party labels and incumbency designations, those have, those are all understood as helping the voter identify the candidates. They are objective, identifying information. They don't, for one thing, involve a state official in assessing whether the label should apply or not, as this regulation does here. The secretary of state, subject to a state review process, has to determine whether the label applies, and the label is a judgmental label, not simply an identifying piece of information. The other thing about parties, of course, is that party labels recognize the role political parties play in the electoral process, provide candidates with a reasonable level of community support, provide voters with a means of exercising their First Amendment right of political association, and the party label therefore reflects that the party is the mechanism that put the candidate on, on the ballot. It's quite different from a label that is designed to influence the election and also to constrain the behavior of the legislator after having been elected as this, as this provision does. I think, if there are no further questions --"

      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "The elections clause. The Court of Appeals actually didn't -- well, the elections clause has been in the case from the beginning because it is the provision that the state has used to defend its authority against all other attack. That is the argument, when the argument is made that this is a qualification, or this is an improper this or that, the state has said it's a proper exercise of its authority under the elections clause, and we say it is not. I think that's the simplest way to decide this case, even though there are a number of other issues that could also be reached."

      "speaker": "ADA",
      "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. It Tashjian, this Court said, any claim that we enhance the ability of the citizenry to make wise decisions by restricting the flow of information to them must be viewed with some skepticism. This is precisely respondent's claim, and it should be viewed with considerable skepticism. As to the elections clause claim made by the respondent, the Court said in Smiley that the time, place and manner language are comprehensive words that embrace authority to provide a complete code for congressional elections. And in Tashjian they said state control over the election process for state officers is co-extensive with that grant to the states under the elections clause. It is a broad power. The alleged damage done to congressional candidates because of the ballot label is something that needs to be analyzed under a punishment analysis. There is no evidence in the record that suggests this language is punishing, and that was respondent's burden. Under the qualifications clause, it was Respondent's burden to show that the sole basis for putting this on was to add a qualification indirectly. The language of the amendment itself indicates that it is not the sole basis to add a qualification indirectly. It is the sole purpose to one, inform the voters, and two, to amend the Constitution. It was argued that the severance issue was waived. This is not so. This is contained in the response to the, or pardon me, to the reply to the cert. In point four, we say specifically because we use the word or in the first question, we preserve the severance question and we have already dealt with that in the reply suggestions. If there are no further questions?"
