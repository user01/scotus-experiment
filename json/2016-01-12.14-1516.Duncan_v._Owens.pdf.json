Now, I don't know what that was. I ­­ I ­­ I don't know. But what I do know is he immediately says what ­­ he then frames what the issue is to him. And in framing what the issue is to him, he says that Mr. Owens knew that this victim was a drug dealer and wanted to knock him off, presumably because he's a drug dealer. And from the very next thing that he says, his finding of guilty of murder. So those things follow one right after the other. It is the only thing ­­ it is the only fact that he discusses after expressing whatever dissatisfaction he has with the witnesses' testimony. And so it is ­­ at a minimum, it is an integral part of the process that he has gone through to reach the finding of guilt."
