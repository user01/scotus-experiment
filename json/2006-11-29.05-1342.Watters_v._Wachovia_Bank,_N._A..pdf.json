      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The dual banking system of State and Federal regulation in our nation which we've enjoyed for over 140 years is one of the finest examples of cooperative federalism in our history. For 35 years, the States, not the OCC, have prudently exercised their authority over non-bank State-chartered operating local subsidiaries of national banks. Indeed, respondent Wachovia Mortgage complied with Michigan law for 6 years until in 2003 there was a corporate reshuffling and now it claims it's exempt from the same Michigan laws it complied with. The OCC through its Regulation 7.40006 has disrupted the careful balance and seeks to deprive the States of the regulatory authority that they have historically exercised."

Do some subsidiaries of the -- of a national bank do things other than banking, say title insurance or something like that? I don't see anything in the record where the OCC wants to displace the State as to that. This is just a standard preemption case. When the OCC has regulations that control, then the State has no authority to add to those regulations or to have, or to have contrary regulations. But if it's something that doesn't have to do with banking at all, then I suppose they would say -- I can ask them -- I suppose they say the State has authority to regulate."

That it has the power, if its regulation is authorized, it has the power to what they say, preempt a state law that obstructs, impairs, or conditions a bank's ability fully to exercise its federally authorized real estate lending powers? That's what they say, and then they list some examples. Suppose they said nothing. Wouldn't we be in the same boat? After all, a state cannot under the Federal Constitution normally enact a law that interferes or stands as an obstacle to the achievement of the objective of the Federal law. So if that's right, or if it's wrong, explain why it's wrong, but if it's right, why don't you tell me whether the two laws that you are worried about do or do not stand as an obstacle to the full achievement of the purposes of the statute as implemented by their regulation?"

My understanding was that you did not question the OCC's regulatory authority over a unit that it says can do what the national bank itself could do in the real estate business, no more, no less. OCC regulation, visitation, all the rest, OCC's regulations validly applied to this subsidiary that has been set up in North Carolina and is operating in Michigan; is that right? It is one thing for you to say we have the authority to regulate. Are you saying at the same time that OCC is out of the picture because its dual regulation conflicts with the inevitable?"

    {
      "speaker": "BLANCHARD",

      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Right. And I would have thought your answer to Justice Breyer was yes, that they get to regulate to the extent they want to, and the state does, and if there's a conflict, the federal regulation will prevail, but what's the problem here is that they're issuing a categorical regulation saying the state can't regulate at all."

It seems counterintuitive to me. They're saying you can -- - you can -- you banks can exercise the Federal banking power through a subsidiary.

States do exercise visitorial authority over some affiliates of national banks. That's established. Operating subsidiaries are a special type of affiliate; 484, which was enacted during the Civil War, a hundred years before operating subsidiaries were authorized, really doesn't address the question of visitorial authority."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LONG",
      "speech": "But, but this really became clear, in answer to your question, in part two of my answer. In 1999 when Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, it directly addressed this question of affiliates of national banks. And this is on page 2A of our appendix. It refers to, it created a new type of affiliate, for the first time, financial subsidiaries which can do anything financial in nature. So they can actually engage in activities that the parent national bank could not. But if you look at the bottom of page 2A of our appendix, this is Section 24A now of the act, it said that financial subsidiaries can also engage in activities that are permitted for national banks to engage in directly, subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the conduct of the activities by a national bank. And then at the bottom of 3A and going over to 4A where they actually define financial subsidiaries, they do so by distinguishing them from the operating subsidiaries which had existed for decades. And at the top of 4A you see that the operating subsidiary again engages only in activities that the national banks may engage in directly and are conducted subject to the same terms and conditions. Then if you'll bear with me a moment longer, on page 12A of our appendix some additional provisions of GLBA -- actually, that's the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, GLBA people call it -- said -- this is on 12A -- that securities activities and insurance activities, activities that have been traditionally subject to State regulation, if they're engaged in by a functionally regulated subsidiary, operating subsidiary or a financial subsidiary, then they may be regulated by relevant State securities authorities or State insurance authorities. So Congress was actually quite specific. I mean, your question is about statutory language. You don't find this in 484, which is, since it's a century old, doesn't really get into this. But in this 1999 statute, it's all about subsidiaries of national banks. Congress was pretty clear if it's securities, if it's insurance, it can be regulated by States. They were specific about that. If it's a banking activity that the bank itself can undertake, it's subject to the same terms and conditions. And so, going back to the Chief Justice's question, you have this question of would it be a preempted State preempted state law if it were applied to the national bank when the national bank is making a mortgage loan. Not every State law is preempted because not every State law conflicts. But if it does - -"

      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin by addressing this question of whether what's going on here is conflict preemption or field preemption. Now, it depends on how one defines those terms. But as we understand it it's conflict preemption, not field preemption, in the following sense. Our position is not that State laws have no application to operating subsidiaries or to national banks for that matter. It's that State laws apply to the same extent to operating subsidiaries as they would to national banks. And as this court has made clear in the Atherton case and in the Barnett Bank case, State laws do apply to national banks and operating subsidiaries in a variety of respects, and State contract law would be an example. But with operating subsidiaries in particular, State laws dealing with corporate governance questions, for example the process of incorporation, dissolution, shareholder voting, and things of that sort, would be controlling and so federal law doesn't control those sorts of aspects."

      "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",

      "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
      "speech": "State agencies don't generally do that because there's a specific statutory prohibition on that. And Justice Scalia, this goes to your questions about the scope of these provisions at 12 U.S.C. 484(a) and 481. It's true that those provisions say by their terms that visitorial authority resides exclusively with the Comptroller of the Currency with respect to national banks, and there's another provision that deals with affiliates. And so that's the point with visitorial authority. But visitorial authority by its very nature is asserted in service of and enforcement of some underlying substantive requirement, and the underlying substantive requirement at issue here is the requirement that operating subsidiaries register with the State. And so there's a question of conflict preemption that applies both to the national bank and the operating subsidiary of whether that underlying substantive registration requirement could be applied to the national bank or could be applied to the operating subsidiary."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",

    {
      "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
      "speech": "But the Court's decisions aren't limited to prohibitions of that sort. I'd make two points in that regard. First of all, in one sense this is a prohibition, because the operating subsidiary can't engage in federally authorized activities unless and until it gets the State's permission. So at least there is a prohibition at the outset. But more importantly, the Court's cases aren't limited to situations involving prohibitions of the sort that Your Honor posits, because in the Franklin National Bank case that was a situation in which the national bank had the power to accept savings deposits and the State law that was deemed to be preempted there didn't prohibit the national bank from accepting savings deposits."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "What comes next? Can the OCC say, well, the corporate law of this State doesn't really allow subsidiaries to do as much as we think a subsidiary of a national bank ought to be able to do, so we're going to attribute additional corporate powers to this subsidiary? Can it do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
      "speech": "No, not if you're talking about corporate powers, because those are governed by State law. What it could do, though, is regulate the subsidiary's conduct of the business of banking, because, after all, an operating subsidiary has one purpose and one purpose only, and that's to carry out functions that the national bank itself could perform."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "What troubles me, and maybe you can answer to it more specifically than you have, is that the core function of a banking regulatory agency is the visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very clear that there is visitation power to national banks and makes it very clear that there is not for subsidiaries. And here is a regulation which under the guise, it seems to me, of defining the powers of the national bank simply eliminates that distinction. And it seems to me that perhaps goes beyond what an agency regulation is allowed to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
      "speech": "With respect, Justice Scalia, I don't think the statutes say that at all. There is a statute, 484(a), that says that the OCC's visitorial authority is exclusive with respect to national banks. But there is no statute that says that the OCC's visitorial authority is not exclusive with respect to subsidiaries. There's another statute that deals with affiliates. Now one point is that affiliates are not limited to subsidiaries, but they could include for example, I guess brother and sister corporations for lack of a better term, that are controlled by a common parent. But another point is that at the time these statutes were enacted, Congress simply didn't have within its field of vision the notion that a national bank would have the power to exercise its functions through a subsidiary corporation."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
      "speech": "Because what Congress was trying to do is to make sure that the OCC had exclusive visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of national bank function. It's just at the time that these statutes were enacted, the only play that national bank functions were being conducted was by a national bank itself. Now later on, when the laws of all 50 states, the OTS, the Federal Reserve with respect to state member banks, and the comptroller gives banks the authority to conduct national -- to conduct bank functions through its subsidiaries, then this issue arises about who exercises visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of those functions for a subsidiary. And it stands to reason that if the baseline rule is that with respect to the conduct of national bank functions through a national bank itself, the OCC visitorial authority is exclusive, then when a national bank exercises its Federal entitlement to conduct those very same functions through an operating subsidiary, the OCC's visitorial authority, likewise, would be exclusive. That seems to me to be an entirely reasonable regulatory determination by the comptroller, and there's nothing in those statutory provisions that speaks directly to that issue and that in any way precludes the comptroller from reaching that determination."

    {
      "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
      "speech": "Well, there could be. I don't know about this particular case but there absolutely could be, Justice Ginsburg, because when they become subsidiaries they are controlled by the national bank and not by some other entity. And the reason that a national bank would choose to engage in this sort of structure rather than folding the enterprise into the bank itself are many fold. And in part it's for efficiency purposes because you can have focused management, especially when you're dealing with the sort of specialized things that operating subsidiaries typically do. But there's also other reasons. For example, there's a modularity component to this in the sense that the best specialized functions such as mortgage lending, very often a national bank will purchase an entity that conducts that activity, and may be interested in selling the entity later, and it's much more straightforward to do that if those functions are maintained in a separate subsidiary corporation."

So if the question is whether the corporate veil is pierced, state law would dictate an answer to that question. But, may I just finish one thought? States won't have an incentive to liberally construe veil piercing principles with respect to national banks precisely because state member banks in all 50 states also have operating subsidiaries through which they charter banks to conduct banking functions.

Congress knew of operating subsidiaries when it amended 484 twice in the 1980s, and 481 was amended four times. Yet, never did Congress insert the word \"affiliates\" into the exclusive power of the OCC in 488. Secondly, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act is being greatly distorted. The same terms and conditions language that my opponent referred to was meant to return op subs only to the authority that the parent bank could engage in. It wasn't preemptive or meant to preempt the states. The comptroller had issued a ruling, 34.F, (f), and they had allowed operating subsidiaries to do things differently from the parent bank."
