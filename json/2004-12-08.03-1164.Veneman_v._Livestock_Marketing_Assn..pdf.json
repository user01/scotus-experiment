The beef industry found itself unable to respond to that situation through the promotion of its products. Congress responded to that situation by establishing a government program of promotion, research, and consumer information. In the Beef Act, Congress prescribed the central message for advertising under the Act, Congress established a government body, the Beef Board, to administer and implement the program, and it placed the program under the control of a Cabinet officer, the Secretary of Agriculture."

It makes perfect sense for the government to be speaking out in order to correct the market problem that Congress identified in the midst of a two-decades-long depression in the beef industry. Take the BSE incident last year. BSE imposes a potentially catastrophic and overnight impact on the beef industry. In response to that threat, because of the beef checkoff program, the government was able to respond immediately with the funds necessary to respond on a national scale, not only through promotion -- and this is an important part in which this case is different from United Food -- only about half of every checkoff dollar goes to promoting beef through commercial advertising, like the \"Beef, it's what's for dinner\" campaign. The rest of that dollar goes to things like producing information to consumers about the safety of U.S. meat, the -- addressing the health concerns imposed by BSE and other potential diseases, like E. coli; going to open up foreign markets so that we can export beef -- beef exports have risen dramatically under this program -- and going for things like research in order to identify an early- detection system for BSE. In United Foods, this Court emphasized, at least three times throughout its opinion, that the only aspect of the program that was -- the dollar was being collected for was commercial advertising.

So if the Court finds that attribution is a constitutional concern, it's no basis to bring down the act of Congress on the record in this case. The -- I want to emphasize, if I could, that the program in this case has been effective. The record establishes that the beef checkoff has had a statistically significant impact on increasing consumer demand for beef and an increase in prices. That's contained in the expert testimony of Professor Ward, at pages 100 and 173. The record also shows that for every checkoff dollar spent on the program, there's more than a 5.67 rate of return back to the beef producers in the form of increased prices for cattle. The Beef Board's 2003 report suggests -- finds that the price of a fed steer increased by more than $200 in the past few years. This program has worked. Thank you very much."

But the difficulty of having this Court enforce that principle, I think, would be very real. But no such difficulty, I think, is presented in a case like this one, because if this case came out their way because of government speech, of course, United Foods would be obliterated, but a good deal more would be obliterated, because the theory would have to be that because it's not on your license plate, because you don't have to carry it, you're only supporting it, then that's all the difference in the world.

As long as there is a public welfare justification, they can be spent. And it would be an odd result to have the First Amendment drive the way the government arranges a system like this. After all -- and Professor Tribe said it would be different if the cattlemen's Beef Board were gotten rid of. It actually -- the principal point here is the Secretary controls the speech. Whatever the cattlemen's Beef Board does -- and that is a government entity -- the Secretary controls the speech. So that -- this is not some jury- rigged system; this is a system of governmental control. Congress has prescribed the message, and the Secretary carries it out. It's important to recall that many federal excise taxes go into dedicated trust funds -- for highways, for other functions like that. And out of that dedicated trust fund, there may be money expended on highway safety. So the fact that it's dedicated really should not matter. And this case is completely different from cases like Keller. In Keller, the state bar was not appointed by the -- by the government, there was no governmental supervision of what it did, and the government certainly did not approve the messages in favor of nuclear freezes, et cetera. This is different in all the critical ways that make this a program of government speech. And, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, to strike down this program would have drastic consequences. There are many, many agricultural promotion programs like this. There are 13 at the national level. This program has been in existence since 1988. One billion dollars has been collected, and promotions have been conducted under it. These promotional programs go back to the '50s, and even -- and even earlier. And there are many programs on the state levels, as the amicus brief filed by the states in this case shows. This Court would be striking down a lot to hold that this commonsense way of approaching things is unconstitutional. It's also important to recognize that the ultimate beneficiary of the advertising is the consumer. Yes, it affects the industry, but it's the consumer. And the very first finding that Congress made in the Beef Act is, beef and beef products are basic foods that are a valuable part of the human diet. When the -- when the -­ because of the collective-action problem in this industry, that it cannot organize to advertise, that basic message is not getting to consumers. So this -- the justifications for this, to the extent one thinks of it in terms of the commercial speech, it is squarely within the ultimate purposes of the commerce speech doctrine, which is to correctly market failure with respect to advertising in order to get information to consumers."
