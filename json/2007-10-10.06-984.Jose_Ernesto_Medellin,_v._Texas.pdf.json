    "speaker": "DONOVAN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The President and the Senate entered into three treaties, the Optional Protocol, the UN Charter, and the ICJ Statute, by which the United States agreed that it would comply with the ICJ's decision in any case to which it was a party. We now have such a decision, and the President of the United States has determined that the United States should comply. Texas, however, tells this Court that it should tell the world that the framers left us a Constitution in which neither this Court nor the President nor maybe even Congress could ensure that the United States kept the promise that its elected representatives made to its treaty partners. Texas's position is directly contrary to the constitutional design."

The thing that concerns me about your position is that it seems to leave no role for this Court in interpreting treaties as a matter of Federal law. Suppose, for example, that the International Court of Justice determined in this case its judgment was the same, but they added: As a matter of deterrence, we think the officers who failed to give consular warning should each be sentenced to 5 years in jail. That's the ICJ determination. Would this Court have a role in reviewing that judgment?"

The nature of that obligation, itself, could be one that would be enforceable, in this Court's words, \"in a court of justice;\" and that's the nature of this obligation. Mr. Medellin gets a review and reconsideration. In the Chief Justice's hypothetical, that may well be an obligation that would be enforceable by other actors that would -- which would not be directly enforceable in a court as here."

Brussels has a treaty, and that treaty binds all the member nations, and supreme courts of various nations have come up against this problem: What would happen if the Brussels court or the EU court insists under the treaty that we do something that violates our own Constitution? I think this is an example of that. And the answer typically has been: Well, we'd follow our own Constitution, at least if it was a violation, what the EU said, of fundamental human rights or destroyed some basic structural part of our Constitution. And the question that I would have is, doesn't that kind of approach -- not exactly but that kind of approach -- satisfy whatever problem there is in this respect here?"

That becomes a second object. Of course, it would be a judicial function to interpret the -- interpret those obligations, interpret what the President meant. But in this case it's crystal clear.

But 94-2 says what happens when a country doesn't do that. It's a matter for the Security Council. And that, of course, I think necessarily implies that countries do retain the option to put themselves out of compliance with an International Court of Justice judgment."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "I know you agree, but it depends on whether it's up to the President to make that call. Usually when we have treaties that are not self- enforcing the judgment of whether that international law obligation shall be made domestic law is a judgment for the Congress. Congress passes a law to enforce the treaty, and you're telling us that, well, we don't need the Congress; the President can make a domestic law by writing a memo to his attorney general."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Scalia, let me take that in turn. Let me just first close the discussion of what happened here by saying the reason I think the commission-omission distinction doesn't have much purchase here is because the President did make a determination that we would comply. And I think if you ask the question who makes the determination as to whether we're going to default on our international law obligations or comply, especially vis-a-vis the UN, the answer to that question is quite clear: It's the President, and Congress has acquiesced in that with the UN Participation act at 22 U.S.C. 287."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "What if the President had said, we're going to comply with this judgment, but in a different way than the ICJ determined. We're going to comply by examining in each case whether there's already been a determination of prejudice, and if there has then there's no further review, but if there hasn't then there'll be further review. Would that be binding as a matter of Federal law?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It says that if there has already been -- the State courts are to determine if there's already been a determination of prejudice in the case, and if there has there's to be no further review. But if they determine there hasn't, there is to be further review. That's different than the ICJ's judgment, which suggests there should be a new determination in every case. Is that -- does that have the same status as the memorandum here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "I would say that it wouldn't -- I would say that it wouldn't, as you suggest, not fully comply and not fully discharge with our obligation. But the extent to which we did and purported to be doing that under compliance with the judgment, it would have the same force as providing the rule of decision, which, to get back to Justice Scalia's question, especially in a context like this, is not so unprecedented. It is not materially different from when the President supplies the rule of decision in the pre-FSIA practice by making a determination, binding on the courts State and Federal, that somebody has sovereign immunity."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",

But this case raises a question, not about the proper interpretation of the Vienna Convention, because as you remember we were four-square with this Court on its interpretation of the Vienna Convention in Sanchez-Llamas. The relevant treaties here the Optional Protocol and the UN Charter, and the question here is not the force of -- of the Avena judgment as precedent --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "General, can we just clarify something which I think is important? Justice Scalia suggested that this wasn't self-executing. The State Department with respect to the Vienna Convention itself told Congress very clearly: You don't have to do anything; this is self-executing. And then the protocol says: We the United States agree to accept the jurisdiction of the ICJ in a certain class of cases. And Congress ratified that, too. So I don't think that self-executing has anything to do with this case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that reflects that self-executing is one of those words that people use to cover a lot of different meanings; and I think in its most correct sense, you're right to say that the Vienna Convention is self-executing. So there didn't have to be legislation before Texas and its local officials were obligated to provide notice in this case; and of course, it's their default on that treat obligation by the State and local officials that has us in this predicament in the first place. Now, there's another meaning of \"self-executing\", or maybe it's a misuse of the term, to say whether it gives rise to individually enforceable rights in court without more. And we do take the position that if the President had done nothing, and certainly if the President had said we're not going to comply, we're going to respond to this ICJ judgment the way we did with the Nicaragua judgment, we don't think that this judgment would be enforceable as of its own terms."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But in Nicaragua the United States took the position from day 1 that the ICJ had no jurisdiction over the case. So the absence of jurisdiction is always an exception to the obligation, even within the United States, to give full faith and credit. If the court had no jurisdiction, another State doesn't have to give full faith and credit. But if it does have jurisdiction, then the obligation kicks in."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "That's absolutely right, and that gets back to the basic principle of reviewing foreign judgments; and it's not that this Court is disabled from its judicial role. It's just the judicial role here is not a straight-up question of the interpretation of the Vienna Convention. It's a question of what effect to give the judgment that's been effectively validated by the executive branch. And there's two things --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "I agree that we should give that determination great weight, but that's something quite different from saying that he can displace the authority of this Court on that issue of law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Oh, but the -- the President can't displace the role of this Court. It's just that the role of this Court in a situation where there's been a judgment and the executive branch has viewed that judgment as something we should comply with, then the role of this Court is limited to deciding whether there was jurisdiction to issue that judgment in the first place; and then the secondary role of this Court would to be to say, does the rule of law embodied by that judgment violate the Constitution. And that's why the answer to the Chief Justice's original hypothetical, about a sentence to 5 years for guards that had no notice -- that's a different case. But here there's no colorable argument that the -- that the judgment here and what's embodied in it lies outside the power of the Federal Government as a whole to adjudicate and to put as an obligation on the States."

What if the President of the United States had said this judgment, the Avena judgment, will not be enforced, and this Court interpreted the Avena judgment as binding, as providing a rule of decision and a rule of decision which was entitled to respect by Texas? Would this Court's authority to make that declaration and issue a judgment to that effect be displaced by the President's determination that it would not be that the Avena judgment would not be enforced?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",

    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "You could. I think another route, of course, that would be available to you is to simply say: Here we have a judgment and we have the President effectively espousing the judgment, and in those cases we don't have to worry about what would happen if we didn't have one or the other."

    "speech": "The President espousing the judgment -- Texas takes the position that this memorandum has -- has no legal effect; it's a memorandum from the President to the -- to his attorney general. It's not a directive to the States. In fact, it even refers to pursuant to the principles of comity, which suggests, you know, do it if you want to be cooperative, don't do it if you don't want to be cooperative. What is your response to that? And would it be enough if the President simply wrote a memorandum to himself saying that, I think this is the way that the -- that the judgment of the ICJ should be enforced? He doesn't have to tell Texas. He can just tell his attorney general?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Scalia, I think there's two questions there. I'd like to try to answer them both. One is, what degree of formality is required? And we would say that if you look to historical practice, this is not something where you a need a high degree of formality. So look to the executive agreement that this case -- this Court gave its positive effect to in Belmont and Pink. It was an exchange of diplomatic letters, nothing more. Look to the executive determination that this Court give dispositive effect to, dismissed the lawsuit completely in Ex Parte Peru. It was a letter from the undersecretary of state to the attorney general. Going back to the very beginnings of the nation, look at the extradition of Thomas Nash. What was the form of the President's determination we would extradite him? A letter from the secretary of state to Judge Bee in South Carolina."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "In none of those cases were we talking about a determination contrary to a legal determination by this Court concerning the scope of powers under the treaty."

  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, with respect --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "And in Nash he was being held under Federal custody. So Nash is just inapplicable here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, I don't think Nash is inapplicable, Justice Kennedy; I think it is on all fours."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Of course, Nash is just a wonderful speech by Marshall anyway; it's not an opinion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "But it is a wonderful speech, and I really do think you should take a look at that speech. If you want to find it, it's actually appended to volume 18 of the U.S. Reports. And I think you should look at that speech before rejecting our position here, because it really is on all fours in that there you had a treaty obligation duly approved by the Senate, and there was a question: Do we need an act of Congress before the executive can extradite somebody? And Marshall I think put the law exactly right in that case when he said: Sure, Congress can make a determination and if it does, that's the end of matter; but absent the congressional determination, the President has the authority to extradite Nash. Now, that's a situation where somebody's personal liberty was at stake. So I would say that in some respects it's a fortiori that in this case what's at issue is simply recognizing that there's binding Federal law here, that I think if the Texas court had recognized that it was binding Federal law, it would have applied under their own State procedural default law. Now, just to finish up, and then I will sit down, there's a second part of your question, Justice Scalia, which was addressed to what does the reference to comity mean. Obviously, from the very beginning in this case we have taken the position in this Court that the President's memorandum directs the State courts, in its words, to give effect to the Avena judgment -- not decide whether you want to give it effect based on your State law of comity, but give effect to the judgment. I think if you actually look at the law of comity, one of the things that it talks about is comity is really what the courts should do in the absence of a controlling view from one of the political branches. Here the President has made clear, it's clear to me what the answer is applying comity, which would be to give effect to the judgment. Thank you."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "-- shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. Now, as I understand it, the United States entered into a treaty. That treaty said we will follow the interpretations and the judgments of the International Court of Justice in respect to the Vienna Convention. And that Court did make a judgment in that respect, in respect to this client, and it said: Our judgment is that Texas, or someone in the United States, must redo the procedural hearing simply to see whether, in deciding whether there's prejudice or whether there's a procedural default, full account is taken of the importance of the Vienna rights. That's what we're talking about. It's a judgment of the court. The United States has promised to follow that judgment of the court. The Constitution says, since it promised by treaty, that is the law; and the law binds the States. That may be simple-minded, but I'd like to hear what the answer to that, rather, chain of logic is -- chain of law."

They call it -- well, you tell me what they call it.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CRUZ",
    "speech": "I would be happy to provide those, Justice Stevens. The first reason is because the Optional Protocol is not self-executing, so it does not have force in United States courts. The second reason is, if it was a binding judgment, that would violate Article III. It would give to a tribunal other than this Court the authority to determine Federal law. The third reason is in Sanchez-Llamas a majority of this Court rejected this argument and provided explicitly, quote, \"nothing in the structure or purpose of the ICJ suggests that its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on our courts. The fourth reason is the parties in Avena were the United States and Mexico. Neither is a party to this proceeding. The argument as to why it is binding in this case is that Texas is vicariously part of the United States. That was equally true of Oregon in Sanchez-Llamas. In both cases, there's one State who is in some sense one of the parties. The fifth reason is the Breard case was in many senses equally a judgment, in that you had the ICJ issuing an order to this Court concerning Breard, concerning his specific case, to stop his execution, and this Court concluded that that could not trump U.S. law. And the sixth and final reason that it is not a judgment is to treat it as a binding judgment would be to cut out the President's authority not to comply. Everyone agrees, for example in the Nicaragua case, that the President retains the authority to say no, we're not going to comply. Which is why the entire purpose of this adjudication is not to resolve something finally in a court of law, but it is rather a diplomatic measure, much as -- much like when the United States sued Iran during the hostage crisis. We didn't believe the Ayatollah was going to listen to the ICJ and suddenly let the hostages go. We didn't -- we didn't expect that Iranian courts would give force to it, but it was helpful diplomatically to bring it to that tribunal to then put international pressure. That --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Then this is consistent with what you've been explaining to Justice Breyer in your answer, that for 200 years we have had some treaties that are very important, but they're not self-executing; their violation may put us in violation of international law; but it is for us to determine how we are going to comply with the international obligation; and there is no obligation on the part of the State to comply with that law because it's not self-executing."

    "speaker": "CRUZ",
    "speech": "Justice Kennedy, that is exactly correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "At some point I think in the course of your argument, we may get back to whether the Vienna Convention itself is or is not self-executing. I think the Solicitor General was correct in saying that that's a difficult word. I think it is self-executing in that the State has to comply with it. I'm not sure that it is self-executing in that the State has to accept whatever procedural framework the foreign national demands."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CRUZ",
    "speech": "I would agree with the characterization you suggest, which is that the Vienna Convention was self-executing in the sense that it didn't require legislation to go into effect, but it was not self-executing in the sense that it provided judicially cognizable rights. But let me add a caveat to that, which is in both Breard and Sanchez-Llamas, this Court assumed the Vienna Convention created individual rights, and although Texas maintains that it did not create individual rights and the United States maintains that it did not create individual rights, we don't have to win on that proposition to prevail in this case. Even assuming it created individual rights in this case, Medellin defaulted on that claim and this Court held with Sanchez-Llamas that procedural default is consistent with the treaty. And the real question here in this case, particularly with respect to the President's order, is whether the Optional Protocol is self-executing, the decision of the Avena court, or, as a subsequent matter, whether the President has some sort of independent authority to make Federal law. And in this respect --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Well, I still -- I would like to get back to that Optional Protocol. It -- was it submission to jurisdiction? My understanding is that any two parties that can agree, can have a formed selection clause, can agree that we accept the authority of this tribunal, and then it follows from that that if you accept their authority to adjudicate, you are bound to follow its decisions. And that that seems to be understood in the world community because, is it not so that even though there are cases like Nicaragua and Iran, most ICJ judgments are indeed complied with by the nations that agree to submit to the jurisdiction of that tribunal?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CRUZ",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, that is correct as a political and diplomatic matter, but in my judgment it speaks volumes that of the 166 nations that signed on to the Vienna Convention and of the 50 nations that signed on to the Optional Protocol, zero -- not a single nation -- treats ICJ judgments as binding in their domestic courts. What Petitioners are arguing here is for an interpretation of this treaty that no other nation gives. And in fact, if I found myself in the nation of Mexico and arrested without consular notification, I could not raise this claim in Mexico. The Mexican courts would not treat it as a defense to my criminal prosecution. And so --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Of course it matters. But the -- of course it matters. That's why when I read the -- the ICJ opinion, I read it as saying that they're not telling you to set aside a procedural default rule. What they've asked you to do is to provide, by means of the United States' own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences by taking account of the violation of rights. And throughout they ask -- when you decided whether the person was really prejudiced, when you decided whether there had been forfeiture of the rights, at that time, did you ask yourself that the reason he might not have raised them was because he knew nothing about them and his lawyer knew nothing about them, because nobody ever told either about them? In which case there might be a causal connection. As I read it, the ICJ left all that up to you but just asked you, please, look at it again having read our opinion and keeping this in mind."
  },

    "speaker": "CRUZ",
    "speech": "But the ICJ's decision -- I think your question goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question about the effect of an ICJ decision. The legal -- legal adviser to the State Department told the Senate, when it was ratifying the UN Charter, that decisions of the ICJ are \"a moral obligation\" and there is \"no provision\" for the enforcement of such decisions. And one fascinating example of this is the entire debate over the Connally Amendment. One can look in the entire course of legislative history, and it's an argument back and forth about whether it is wise to require the United States to cast a veto in the Security Council over an attempt to enforce an ICJ. And not a single senator of the entire U.S. Senate suggested the proposition that ICJ decisions might be independently enforceable. Nobody discussing that understood it that way."

And the State courts are not at liberty to ignore Federal law. This is a very curious assertion of presidential power. Because the presidential power is not directed at the Federal courts. It is directed at the State courts,and the State courts alone. And I would submit is the only instance I'm aware of, of a Federal mandate that falls only on the states, singles out the states, and commandeers those judges.

Indeed, if the ICJ had asserted the power it claimed to annul U.S. convictions, under the U.S.'s theory the President presumably could have issued an order effectively pardoning State prisoners despite the fact that the Constitution limits its pardon authority to Federal crimes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Cruz. Mr. Donovan, you have five minutes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DONOVAN",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, there is nothing in the ratification history that suggests that Avena made any assumptions about whether or not the Optional Protocol would be self-executing. The Connally Amendment went to the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ, and the discussion to which Texas has referred is entirely about the international ramifications. In fact, the Senate specifically declined to apply the Connally Amendment to the Optional Protocol. So that gets to the question that we have been discussing here, which is: What is the scope of the enforceability of an ICJ judgment? There are obviously constraints to that. One is illustrated by the Chief Justice's hypothetical. That is, there are affirmative constraints in the Constitution, itself. The second is illustrated by a point I made, but Mr. Cruz misunderstood, which is that the nature of the obligation emanating from the judgment is directed at a constitutional branch such as the obligation to enforce an active statute. Obviously, that is not enforceable in court. If the nature of the obligation is to cease hostilities, that is obviously directed to the President and is not enforceable in court. And that's illustrated by the Nicaragua case in which the ICJ issued a judgment. Congress passed a statute that said it wasn't going to comply; and the President said he wasn't going to comply. That, in turn, applies to the third constraint, which is the political constraint, itself. The Nicaragua case illustrates that if the ICJ issues a judgment that the United States does not want to comply with, Congress can pass a statute to say we repudiate the obligation. So the obligations that we are talking about here in which the ICJ judgment would be enforceable by an individual fall squarely in the class of cases that this Court has decided for two centuries where an individual has a right conferred by the statute. And he walked into a court, and he asked that court to enforce that right, and he invokes that right in -- as in the Caffa core case, the Roucher case, cases going back to the founding. And this Court has said when the right is of a nature to be enforced in a court of justice, this Court will enforce it. And that is all Mr. Medellin is asserting here: The right to enforce a right that is eminently suitable for judicial enforcement because it goes to the judicial process, itself. The second point with respect to Article"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "III",
    "speech": "It cannot be the case that this Court can never enforce -- gives away its Article III authority when somebody else enforces a judgment. We know from the Comegys and the Abba cases that we have cited that the Court has in fact said that when the U.S. submits a case to international adjudication that international adjudication is binding and it's not reexaminable in a U.S. court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I read the Comegys case, however you say it, to be for the exact opposite proposition. There they were saying, this is an international arbitration, there's no reason to go behind it. But the question of whether or not that arbitration is binding in the bankruptcy proceeding that was at issue there was very much one for the U.S. Supreme Court to make."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DONOVAN",
    "speech": "But that's because that was not part of what the court had actually decided, or rather that the international adjudication had actually decided. You think about, if the proposition is that nobody else but an Article III court can decide a Federal question, this Court could not have decided Mitsubishi. In Mitsubishi the Court sent Federal statute antitrust claims to an arbitration panel in Tokyo and said that the result would be everyone forcible so long as the panel actually took cognizance of the claim and actually decided it. This Court if it evaluated the claim that Mr. Medellin is entitled to review and reconsideration as a result of the treaty obligation under 94-1 and the President's determination that that treaty obligation will be given effect, this Court would be performing a supremely judicial function, that is it would be interpreting and applying Federal law in the form of a statute, which is exactly what the Supremacy Clause requests the Court to do. With respect to --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Put precisely, it would be making it Federal law and then applying it. If you assume it's not self-executing, somebody has to make it to domestic law. Now, Congress can obviously do it by passing a law. But you're saying the Court can do it, can make it dmestic law and then enforce it."

    "speaker": "DONOVAN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DONOVAN",
    "speech": "-- when we're talking about self-executing here we're saying what branch is the obligation directed to. And what the Court has said time and time again is when the obligation is of a nature to be enforced in a court of justice it is directed to the judicial authority."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Then what you are saying if I understand you is that Justice Scalia was wrong when he said that would be making it Federal law. I think you were saying that would be a -- the branch that was responsible for determining how to execute, i.e., to apply, Federal law. Is that your point?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DONOVAN",

There's a treaty obligation under the Vienna Convention, which this court has now dispositively interpreted, and there's a treaty obligation to comply. And it's the very nature of an obligation to put a dispute to a third party that you may not agree with the result, and that does not in any way compromise this Court's Article III authority to rest that judgment on an obligation committed to by the political branches, three treaties ratified by the President and Senate that said when this country commits itself to do something we're going to do it. Now we have the President of the United States saying that it's in the paramount interests of the United States for purposes of enforcing --"

The applicable instrument is now the Avena judgment, pursuant to the treaties and the President's determination, independent sources. In applying that judgment, there may well be interpretive questions because the Avena judgment lays down standards and requires obligations and that would be part of the judicial enterprise."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So we have the authority to interpret it, we have the authority to construe whether it's carry to the Constitution, but we do not the authority to consider whether it's consistent with Federal law?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DONOVAN",
    "speech": "That's right, because that's the very nature of enforcing a judgment: You do not re-examine the merits. You take the judgment and you enforce the judgment. And it's the judicial enterprise to construe what that -- it may be a question about construing that -- what that instrument requires, what that judgment requires. But it's the judicial function in enforcing that judgment that calls upon this Article -- the Court's Article III authority, and does not in any way compromise it, which in turn goes to the question about what the judgment requires. It requires prospective review and reconsideration. The Texas court didn't suggest that Mr. Medellin had received review and reconsideration. The ICJ made it clear that it had to be prospective, and one of the fundamental reasons for that is because the judgment says that the treaty rights have to be determined on it own. Mr. Medellin is entitled to show that the violation of the treaty standing on its own two feet and not filtered through a constitutional right affected -- that he is entitled to show prejudicie."
