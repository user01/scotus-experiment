    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: What is at stake in this case is the authority of the Federal courts to uphold the rule of law. Respondents assert that their actions are absolutely immune from judicial examination whenever they elect to detain foreign nationals outside our borders. Under this theory, neither the length of the detention, the conditions of their confinement, nor the fact that they have been wrongfully detained makes the slightest difference. Respondents would create a lawless enclave insulating the executive branch from any judicial scrutiny now or in the future."

We are not asking to imply a private right of action from the Geneva Convention or any other treaty. What we are saying is that the cause of action is created by the Habeas Corpus Statute and by the Administrative Procedure Act. The treaty provides a rule of decision, not a cause of action."

  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "No. We don't. Now, if you look at the Court of Appeals ruling in this case, the Court of Appeals assumed that these people were friendly aliens, assumed that they had never been members of any armed forces, and had never carried out any belligerent activity against the United States. Assumed that they had never had the hearing required by the Geneva Convention to determine whether or not in fact they were civilians who should have been repatriated. What the Court of Appeals held was, and it's on page 1141 of the court's opinion, if the Constitution does not entitle detainees to due process, and it does not, they cannot invoke the jurisdiction of our courts to test the constitutionality or legality of restraints on their liberty. Thus the Court of Appeals assumed that the -- that the result turned on the absence of a constitutional right, and that simply misreads the Habeas Corpus Statute. Section 2241(c)(1), which is carried forward in virtually identical language from Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, antedated the Bill of Rights. All it required, all it has ever required is Federal custody simpliciter, and that gives habeas corpus jurisdiction."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "What the judge is supposed to do is determine first whether or not the government's response that the detention is legal is in fact an adequate response. Now, the government in this case probably will respond, we don't have to give the hearings required by the Geneva Convention. But if you're going to treat a binding United States treaty as the supreme law of the land, that is not an adequate answer. Now, this question of, is the treaty self-executing or not self-executing, I suggest is a straw man. Since 1813, if a treaty provides a rule of decision and something else provides a cause of action, the treaty nevertheless provides the rule of decision. That was several --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I think the latter part of your sentence is probably an overreading of Johnson. In Johnson, which I suggest is clearly distinguishable from this case, there were three critical facts. One was that they were admitted enemy aliens. Our Petitioners plead that they are not. The other was that they had a hearing before a military tribunal which comported with Federal legislation and with the extant rules of international law, and our Petitioners have had no such hearing."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Wouldn't that depend on what the review showed? And I thought you have alleged that your clients were not enemy aliens. If it showed they were tourists, they were just picked up by mistake, would you be here or would you not be here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "If they were detained after a hearing determined that they were civilian detainees who under Article IV of the Geneva Convention should be repatriated, we would be here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I don't see how those merits question go to the issue of jurisdiction of the Court. It may well be that if those factors you mentioned were changed, you'd be entitled to judgment here, even though the plaintiffs in Eisentrager were not entitled to judgment, but we are not talking about the merits right now. We are talking about jurisdiction. Certainly jurisdiction doesn't turn on the merits whether you were an enemy alien or not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "Well, I suggest that a fair reading of Eisentrager is that that did turn on the merits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but I thought your -- may I, may I ask you this, because I'm having the trouble Justice Scalia is having. I thought your principal argument on the basis of Eisentrager was that it cannot stand for the proposition that there is no jurisdiction because in fact, in Eisentrager, there was enough mention of matters on the merits so that it was clear that's what was driving the ultimate resolution in Eisentrager. And it cannot stand for the proposition that a court cannot even inquire, and the only issue we have got is whether under the Habeas Statute the court can even inquire. Do I misunderstand your position?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "No, you do not, Justice Souter."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "It's our position that Eisentrager was a decision on the merits as a matter of fact. The Court says that they -- Petitioners were extended the same preliminary hearing as the sufficiency application that was extended in Quirin, Yamashita and Hirota versus McArthur, all of which were decisions on the merits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But in several different places, Mr. Gibbons, in Eisentrager, the Court says that we are talking about the Habeas Statute, and we are saying these Petitioners are not entitled to habeas."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "Well, they are not as a matter -- let me be clear about that. The result on the merits in Eisentrager is perfectly correct. What the Court did in Eisentrager was apply the scope of review on habeas corpus, which was standard at that time. If the military tribunal had lawful jurisdiction, that ended the habeas inquiry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, there is another problem. At that time, that case was decided when Ahrens against Clark was the statement of the law, so there is no statutory basis for jurisdiction there, and the issue is whether the Constitution by itself provided jurisdiction. And of course, all that's changed now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, in Eisentrager, both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court made it clear that they disapproved, they were not adopting the ruling of the District Court based on Ahrens v. Clark. Of course, in any event, that does not go to subject matter jurisdiction. That's a Rule 12(b)(2) issue of in personam jurisdiction, whether a proper Respondent is before the Court. In Eisentrager, the Court assumed --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you didn't raise the question  of whether the territorial jurisdiction provision covered it. There was no territorial jurisdiction if they were outside the district under the ruling in Ahrens against Clark, which means they had to rely on the Constitution to support jurisdiction, which in turn means that once they have overruled Ahrens against Clark, which they did, there is now a statutory basis for jurisdiction that did not then exist."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, respectfully, I don't think you can fairly read Justice Jackson's opinion as adopting the Ahrens v. Clark position."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No. But Ahrens v. Clark was the law at the time of that decision, and it was subsequently overruled. So that -- that case was decided when the legal climate was different than it has been since Ahrens against Clark was overruled."

    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "In any event, there is no question that the Ahrens v. Clark rule does not apply today. These Respondents are the proper Respondents."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Of course, it's a question of how much it doesn't apply, whether it doesn't apply only when there is at least clear statutory jurisdiction in one, in one Federal court so it's almost a venue call. It isn't clear that it's been overruled when there is no statutory jurisdiction in any Federal court. That's certainly an open question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, as to the absence of jurisdiction, 2241(c)(1) could not be plainer. It's been plain for 215 years. If there is Federal detention and there is a proper Respondent before the Court as there is, there is habeas corpus jurisdiction. I don't see any, even ambiguity in that statute."

    "speech": "I mean, you have to think down the road, is there an alternative to the Geneva Convention that is on the substantive claim. I was also thinking, and here I want your view on it, that if you have, if they get in the door, and now they have a claim that they are being held without a competent tribunal assessing it, you get to your route as well by saying that the part about the Fifth Amendment in Eisentrager is, in effect, overruled by Reid v. Covert. And in fact, if you follow Harlan and by following Harlan, you apply some kind of due process, and the Geneva Convention comes in to inform the content of that due process. Now, is there an argument there or not?"

Circuit said it decided the merits as well as jurisdiction, so I think Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy were asking you before, well, if you prevail on jurisdiction under that opinion, don't you go out the door immediately because the D.C. Circuit said, at least as far as the Constitution is concerned, nonresident aliens have no due process rights."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Can I ask this, Mr. Gibbons. If the jurisdictional question rests on Habeas Statute simpliciter, without reference to the Geneva Convention or any of the other merits points that you've been raising, how then do you answer Justice Kennedy's question if the merits are out and it doesn't matter whether you are a combatant or noncombatant, is there jurisdiction when somebody is captured on the field of battle and held immediately on the field of battle, why wouldn't there be jurisdiction there? The only answers you give are merits answers, not jurisdictional answers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, what I'm suggesting is that whether you call it jurisdiction or whether you call it the merits, in the battlefield situation, it's going to go out under Rule 12, in any event."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But that's, that's quite different. I mean, all we are theoretically talking about here is jurisdiction. And the idea that, you know, you have Justice Kennedy's example, a lawful combatant, a declared war, detained at Guantanamo maybe two months after he is captured, and an action's brought here in the District of Columbia for habeas corpus and what does a -- what does a judge say when he considers that sort of petition?"

  {
    "speaker": "GIBBONS",
    "speech": "When he sees that petition, he should dismiss it summarily, whether he dismisses it under 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), it won't take him any more time. Habeas corpus, as the historians' brief, and others among the amici point out, has never run to the battlefield, as a matter of habeas corpus common law. And it is, after all, a common law writ. It has never run to any place except where the sovereign issuing the writ has some undisputed control."

Now, Guantanamo Navy base, as I can attest from a year of personal experience, is under complete United States control and has been for a century."

    "speech": "But, for example, if one of the detainees here assaulted another detainee in Guantanamo, there is no question they would be prosecuted under American law because no other law applies there. Cuban law doesn't apply there. Now, if the test is sovereignty, that term must be given some rational meaning by judges. Respondents concede that habeas corpus would extend to citizens detained in Guantanamo. That would be no interference with Cuban sovereignty, and extending habeas corpus to noncitizens there is no more an interference with Cuban sovereignty. If there isn't -- if there isn't sovereignty over that base where no law applies, legislative, judicial or otherwise, the term has no meaning. Sovereignty for legal purposes must at least mean that some political organization has a monopoly on sanction in that defined geographic area."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Gibbons, I'm quoting from page 8 of the government's brief, which I assume is an accurate quote of the treaty. It doesn't just say that Cuba has sovereignty if we give up the lease. It says the United States -- this is the treaty, recognizes the continuance of the ultimate sovereignty of the Republic of Cuba over the leased area. Now I take that to mean that they are sovereign even during the term of the lease. You may say it's artificial, but there it is."

One of the amicus briefs that surveyed a United States Navy base elsewhere points out that this is the only base, for example, where the United States has not entered into a status of forces -- forces agreement. It's not at all clear that we have exclusive jurisdiction, civil jurisdiction in any of our other enclaves in foreign countries. But we have exclusive jurisdiction and control over civil law in Guantanamo, and have had for a century. So it's -- so it's so totally artificial to say that because of this provision in the lease, the executive branch can create a no law zone where it is not accountable to any judiciary, anywhere. Now, in some other places where the United States has a base, there may be other civil authority that can demand an accounting. But what the executive branch is saying here is we don't have to account to anyone, anywhere. Justice Breyer, you asked me a question before, and someone else, that's not unusual, interrupted before I answered you. And to tell you the truth, I don't remember your question at this point."

Now, of course, that reading of Eisentrager assumes that it was a decision on the merits and not a jurisdictional decision.

And one of them is, is an enemy alien, and another is, was tried and convicted by a military commission sitting outside the United States. Why would the Court think it necessary to say this is what we confronted in this case which makes it worlds different from our case, where there has been no trial and conviction, where these people are saying, and we must accept for the moment that it's true, that they are innocents. That they are not combatants of any kind."

And the Court went on to say, no such basis can be invoked here for these prisoners at no relevant time were within any territory over which the United States is sovereign, and the scenes of their offense, their capture, their trial and their punishment were all beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.

The statute that exists today is the same statute that the Eisentrager Court was considering."

And the Court went on to say, well, there are various reasons why there is no ultimate due process entitlement, and therefore, due process does not demand entertainment of jurisdiction. After Braden, that argument is gone. Why, therefore, is Eisentrager not undercut to the point where it's no further authority on the jurisdictional point?"

    "speaker": "OLSON",

The Court made clear that it was deciding -- and everyone -- the reason I mentioned the briefs is the context in which the case was presented to the Court, and argued to the Court and the decision that was made by the majority in the Court, focusing on the identity of the Petitioner, whether alien or friendly. Justice Black in his dissenting opinion says this decision would apply to whether someone was hostile or not, and the entire context of the case, Justice Stevens, it seems to me, and does not --"

What -- the other portion of the decision that it seems to me important to recognize is that this is a decision that was widely perceived, and has been consistently perceived, as a definition of the scope of the Habeas Statute. Going back to the early 1800s, this Court decided that the extent of habeas jurisdiction arose from the statute, not from the common law."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but there are no rights that can be recognized unless there is jurisdiction in the first place.

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Certainly the argument is available that in that situation, the Constitution requires jurisdiction.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it's obvious that there is language in Eisentrager that supports you, obvious to me, but you have just heard that judges don't always distinguish between 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), not even in this Court, at least we don't always get it right. And there is also language, as you have heard, that's against you. I think there is some in there. So what I'm thinking now, assuming that it's very hard to interpret Eisentrager, is that if we go with you, it has a virtue of clarity. There is a clear rule. Not a citizen, outside the United States, you don't get your foot in the door. But against you is that same fact. It seems rather contrary to an idea of a Constitution with three branches that the executive would be free to do whatever they want, whatever they want without a check. That's problem one. Problem two is that we have several hundred years of British history where the cases interpreting habeas corpus said to the contrary anyway. And then we have the possibility of really helping you with what you're really worried about, which is undue court interference by shaping the substantive right to deal with all those problems of the military that led you to begin your talk by reminding us of those problems. So if it's that choice, why not say, sure, you get your foot in the door, prisoners in Guantanamo, and we'll use the substantive rights to work out something that's protective but practical."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Breyer, there are several answers to that. You started with the proposition that there was no check and that the executive is asserting no check. This is the interpretation of the scope of a Habeas Statute. Congress had -- has had 54 years with full awareness of the decision to change it. Indeed, as we point out in our brief, eight months after the Eisentrager decision, a bill was introduced that would have changed that statute, H.R. 2812, which would specifically have changed the statute to deal with the Eisentrager situation, so there is a check."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It could have been just a clarifying, General Olson. As you well know, the fact that a bill was introduced and not passed carries very little weight on what law that exists means."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

If the people think that this is unfair, if Congress thinks it's unfair, with a stroke of the pen, they can change the Habeas Statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "That's precisely correct. And they had a bill before them eight months after the Eisentrager decision which had -- that Congress proceeded on it. Congress has also dealt with the Habeas Statute in a variety of other ways. It has seen fit in no way to change the decision required by this Court with respect to the statute. You mentioned several hundred years of British history was your second point. All of those cases, or virtually all of those same cases that have been brought up in the briefs, and the amicus briefs today, were in the briefs that were before the Eisentrager --"

But then on that assumption, I'm still honestly most worried about the fact that there would be a large category of unchecked and uncheckable actions dealing with the detention of individuals that are being held in a place where America has power to do everything. Now, that's what's worrying me because of Article III, and the other thing on the opposite side, as I said, is it's possible to tailor the substance to take care of the problems that are worrying you. Those are my two basic points."

In fact, the reply brief refers to the front lines in Iraq, in a battle station in Iraq. We are talking here about battlefield decisions and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The battlefield, I might, since -- all I mean by working out the substantive rights is what Justice Harlan meant and what Justice Kennedy meant in adopting Justice Harlan's view in Verdugo. And that really derives from the insular cases, and I don't think it's something that requires witnesses and reticulated whatever they are, tax cuts. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, to the extent that the Court would say, the executive, you must give a military process because the Petitioners in this case, first of all, demanded in their petition and they would have a right to raise these issues to the extent they have not backed off in this case, but they demanded in their petition, their release, unmonitored communications with counsel, cessation of interrogations, evidentiary hearings."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Wasn't it --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Our, our doctrine would have to be applied in the first instance by 800 different district judges, I take it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, there is no question that that is exactly right. And to the extent that what the Petitioners are seeking is to oversee the circumstances -- this is the language in their brief, to oversee the circumstances of detention. That is going to vary from case to case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "General Olson, I have looked at the reply brief, which is the last chance to say what they mean. And they say we are not asking for any of those things, and certainly not asking to have a lawyer there while these people are being interrogated. They are saying, look, we are claiming that our people are innocents. And for purposes of this proceeding, we must assume that. And all we want is some process to determine whether they are indeed innocent, and it doesn't have to be a court process."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "But Justice Ginsburg, the relief that I was articulating is what they asked for in the first instance. If they have jurisdiction in this Court, the next Petitioner doesn't have to say well, I only want a process. And if they only want -- now they are saying they only want an executive branch process to review. As we explained --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But to go back to the jurisdiction, so I understand really what your argument is. Would this be entirely different, as far as their jurisdiction is concerned, if we were talking about -- if the people were prisoners on Ellis Island or in Puerto Rico?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Yes, we would. Because we are talking about territorial sovereign jurisdiction of the United States. What -- what exists in Guantanamo is no different than existed in Lansberg Prison and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why is that, why is that crucial? I mean, it's not crucial, I take it, under the respective jurisdiction clause of 2241. Is it crucial under the Due Process Clause?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "It is, it is the line that this Court drew and repeatedly articulated --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But why is it a good line? I mean, what is -- what is the justification?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Because it is a line that is, is -- has the virtue of what Justice Breyer was talking about, of having relative certainty. It is a line that's defined by State to State relationships."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why does it have complete jurisdiction? No one else has jurisdiction. Complete jurisdiction of satisfactory lines."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, the complete jurisdiction is a phrase in that lease, the lease specifically says that ultimate sovereignty is Cuba's. It specifically says that the United States"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How many years have we been operating in Guantanamo with Cuban law never applying?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "With respect -- the lease restricts the ability of the United States to use that property for only Naval or coaling purposes. It specifically says it may not be used for any other purpose."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "General Olson, there is a whole other issue in this case which you have not addressed and I don't think your brief much addressed it. There is also a claim of jurisdiction under Section 1331 in the Administrative Procedure Act. Will you say at least a few words about what your response to that is? I don't even see the APA cited in your brief."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "What is cited in the brief, and we explain that the President is not an agency under the APA, that the United States military with respect to operations and military operations are specifically exempted by the APA."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That goes to the merits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "And that the fundamental nature of what the Petitioners are seeking here is the review of the nature and status of their detention, which sounds in -- and is examined by this Court repeatedly under the doctrine of habeas corpus. And that there is no foundation. In fact, I submit that the way the briefs have been written, the Petitioners don't even feel strongly about the APA position. What they are talking about, and why most of their briefs explain, they are focusing on fundamental habeas corpus as it existed throughout the centuries. What is important to emphasize here with respect to all of these questions, with respect to, well, how much control would there be, how much control would there be in Guantanamo versus a place in Afghanistan or another place --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, I think Guantanamo, everyone  agrees, is an animal, there is no other like it. The closest would be the Canal Zone, I suppose."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "The Canal Zone was treated differently by Congress. Congress created, applied, under its responsibility with respect to territorial and insular or unincorporated territory, applied laws there, put a court there. So it's very different than the Canal Zone."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why isn't this like, as I asked Mr. Gibbons, a Federal enclave within a State?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Because it is -- because it is a -- in the first place, the question of sovereignty is a political decision. It would be remarkable for the judiciary to start deciding where the United States is sovereign and where the United States has control --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The word is physical control, power."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "We have that, Justice Ginsburg, in every place where we would put military detainees, in a field of combat where there are prisons in Afghanistan where we have complete control with respect to the circumstances."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But those -- Afghanistan is not a place where American law is, and for a century, has customarily been applied to all aspects of life. We even protect the Cuban iguana. We bring -- in bringing people from Afghanistan or wherever they were brought to Guantanamo, we are doing in functional terms exactly what we would do if we brought them to the District of Columbia, in a functional sense, leaving aside the metaphysics of ultimate sovereignty. If the metaphysics of ultimate sovereignty do not preclude us from doing what we have been doing for the last 100 years, why is it a bar to the exercise of judicial jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "The Court actually heard a case, Neely vs. Henkel, in 1901, which specifically addressed that, and held that the United States did not have sovereignty for the enforcement of its laws in Guantanamo. And at that point --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "We've been doing a pretty good job of it since then, am I right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "With respect to a certain area, a military base in Germany, a military base in Afghanistan, the United States must have and does exercise relatively complete control. Every argument that's being made here today could be made by the two million persons that were in custody at the end of World War II, and judges would have to decide the circumstances of their detention, whether there had been adequate military process, what control existed over the territory in which they were being kept. What this is --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Are you saying that there is no statutory regime that applies to Guantanamo which is different from the statutory or legal regime that applied to occupied territories after World War II or indeed that applies to territory under the control of the American military in Afghanistan or Iraq?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "There is a great deal of differences in connection with every area over which the United States has some degree of control. The degree of control that it has here is limited to specific purposes in -- with respect to the sovereignty of Cuba."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Thank you, General Olson. The case is submitted."
