The obligation to participate in those programs posed no threat to the central purpose of the Compensation Clause, which is to protect the judiciary from interference from the other political branches. As this Court recognized in O'Malley v. Woodruff, judges are also citizens, and the Compensation Clause does not grant them an immunity from participating in the burden of Government, whose Constitution and laws they are charged with administering. A nondiscriminatory tax that falls on judges as well as most other citizens does not violate the Compensation Clause. The concern that the Framers had with Congress' possibly abusing its power to set judges' statutory salaries does not apply to Congress' application and extension of a nondiscriminatory tax on income. Now, the Framers understood that when Congress exercised its authority to enact statutory salaries, it would have the opportunity for mischief."

After all, the same claim was made in Will. The judges argued that the formula for adjusting the statutory salary had been built into the statute at the time they took the judges, and they fully expected that those adjustments in salaries would come automatically each year, and yet Congress in 2 years prevented those salaries from taking effect."

For example, Congress surely could have raised the rate of the general applicable income tax on all citizens in the exact same amount as was the amount of the Medicare and Social Security taxes in this case, and Congress could have done so, in fact, because it had decided that from this point on these programs of social insurance should be financed out of general income tax revenues instead of a separate tax on income."

Some of them are contributory, some of them are noncontributory, but that is part of the whole scheme of compensation, and it may well be the case that the general taxes are something entirely different, but does that necessarily show that contributions to retirement schemes are entirely different?

And the reason why that is different from a statutory form of compensation, or why, I should say, that the concerns that the Framers had with diminishing direct reductions of statutory salary don't apply here, is that when Congress enacts and shapes a general tax like Social Security, it legislates with the broad perspective of society at large, and it doesn't have a narrow focus on the judiciary, and when Congress sets the generally applicable tax rate, it is also constrained by political checks, by the popular political objection to --"

I mean, it's one of many extensions that Congress has made. In 1984, along with Federal judges and new hires in the Federal Government, it brought in employees of nonprofit organizations. In 1986, it extended mandatory coverage to employees of State and local governments who weren't otherwise covered by a system similar to CSRS."

Once you allow Congress, whether it's part of a step-by-step proceeding or not, to single out judges for an imposition of this sort, you run the risk that, you know, that they're doing it for a wrong reason, and we can't inquire case-by-case whether they did it because they were mad at judges or not."

First of all, I think that tax equalization, bringing judges into line with the vast majority of other people and also extending, of course, the benefits of the -- the attendant benefits of the coverage that I discussed earlier to them as well as everybody else, as well as 90 percent of the civilian labor force, I believe that that is a significant reason for tax equal -- for treating judges for tax purposes equally, as all other citizens. Now, the hypothetical that you gave me is not tax equalization. I mean, it's -- it is imposing a special tax on judges. So that, I think is -- I think that is almost always, perhaps always, a legitimate objective of Congress, which is to treat judges equally with all other citizens for tax purposes, because the Constitution does not require Congress to grant judges a perpetual exemption from taxes. What it does require Congress to do is to recognize that when judges take office with a particular salary, that they cannot reduce that level of salary."

Now, we decided a case that deals with the prospective aspect of it and said that's okay if someone was coming on the bench, once the tax is in.

So judges did not have any expectation -- if they came into office at the salary of $100,000 and the income tax rate was 30 percent, there's no question, or it isn't disputed in this case, I don't think, that Congress could have raised the general income tax on everybody 5, 10 percent. It might have required -- it might have been required to by economic distress, by wartime. Not only that, Congress could have imposed what it has called from time to time a surtax, which is, you know, a special kind of tax that is found necessary to impose from time to time. Now, that has the exact same economic effect as a -- as the elimination of the 5.4 -- the exemption for the 5.4 percent for Social Security taxes and the Medicare tax, so I think it's just wrong to say that the judges had an enforceable entitlement that required Congress to freeze this in place, because their economic situation could have been changed in exactly the same way."

I mean, the Medicare tax applies to everybody across the board, so that's completely nondiscriminatory, but as for the OASDI tax, if Congress had required incumbent Federal employees to pay that, they would have been subject to double deductions, and Congress realized that that in itself was unfair. That is, it would be required to treat alike things that were not, in fact, alike, so the fact that judges had the guaranteed retirement annuity was a difference for treating them differently. I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal."

We contend that it can in at least two circumstances. Circumstance number 1 is where Congress or the political branches change the economic tradeoff that a judge makes when assuming the bench, and secondly, where Congress discriminates against Federal judges."

With respect to the issue of the tradeoff, the tradeoff is derived from both Will and Evans, which refer to the fact that one of the primary purposes, an equal purpose of the clause, was to bring judges -- bring qualified judges into the judiciary. To quote Alexander Hamilton, one of the purposes of the clause was to get people with the requisite knowledge, combined with the requisite integrity. That was a primary purpose, as he indicated in Federalist 78. Therefore, the purpose was so that -- and I'm again quoting Hamilton. It was so that a man knew what ground he stood on, and the ground that these judges stood on was, they didn't get -- they got a lot of disadvantages, Your Honors, from when they became Federal judges, but one of the small advantages they did get was, all of the plaintiffs were free from OASDI and HI, and that was retroactively changed."

The Government says, oh, we have a rationale for discrimination, and that is equalization. I would answer that, number 1, this Court's decision in the Will case said, equalization can't justify a diminution, because the Government made the same argument in Will. They said, oh, we lowered Federal judges' salaries, but we were lowering all Federal employees' salaries at the same time, and this Court said, equalization can't be a rationale. But secondly, the fact is that it doesn't take a very creative legislature to come up with some reasonably sounding rationale to justify a diminution in a particular case, and equalization, which is an argument concocted -- excuse me, an argument presented by the Solicitor General's office, nowhere appears in the legislative history of any of these statutes. There's nothing -- this equalization doctrine, as we point out in our brief, is nothing that appears in the statute or in its legislative history. They didn't say, we need to tax Federal judges because we need equalization.

Now we're not in such a situation. We're saying, well, this isn't so clearly literally within the core of the Compensation Clause, and maybe one of our -- maybe our principle criterion ought to be to determine whether this is also prohibited, since it gets away from the core, is a discrimination criterion, was it used to discriminate for purposes of cowing the judges and so on, so the fact that in the core case we didn't look to it doesn't mean that we shouldn't look to it here."

As the Court may recall, that was a case in which State employees were exempted -- State retirees were exempted from a tax on their retirement benefits. Federal employees and the rest of the Michigan public had to pay income taxes on retirement benefits. This Court held, under the intragovernmental immunity doctrine, that that was discriminatory. There was no intent to discriminate against Federal employees."

The discretion with Congress is how much to increase. There is no dispute -- there is a factual finding by a rather unsympathetic trial court that there was a reduction in our salary in this case. There was a reduction in take-home pay, so we're dealing here with a reduction in take-home pay, and the question in this case is, was it an unconstitutional reduction? So we distinguish it from cases where there are different levels of increase, where, frankly, political factors do play a role, but that was a decision made by the Framers, that when you deal with increase Congress has a much greater role than with a decrease, where a prophylactic rule has to be --"

It includes exactly the circumstance you're describing, in which a distinction is made between Federal judges. Suppose the distinction weren't merely based on the pension, but the fact that we think you should get less because you've got a lifetime job and everyone else holds their job at the pleasure of the President of the United States. Any factor that inheres peculiarly within the judiciary, and is a basis for a distinction, I think could also be a basis for finding discrimination. In other words it covers a broad mix of factors."

I point out this is not so unusual. Congress for a number of years gave the President $50,000 for expenses tax-free.

A congressional action doesn't remedy or terminate an unconstitutional diminution if the judge's compensation is the same, unless it is the same as it would have been but for the unconstitutional diminution. We are subscribing to a but-for test. It's quite clear that the increases that took place after OASDI and HI were imposed were general cost- of-living increases that applied not just to judges but to broad categories of Federal employees. We would have gotten those anyway, and in that circumstance it can hardly be said that those terminated or remedied our particular diminution in this particular case. We do contend, however, that if Congress were to provide us with the amount of our diminution plus interest, that would compensate us for past periods. We urge this Court to affirm the Federal Circuit and hold that in order to vindicate both the text, which we believe is clearly applicable in this particular case, and the purposes of the Compensation Clause, that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that's ordered."

      "speaker": "WOLFSON",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. When Congress extended Social Security taxes to Federal judges and to other Federal employees in 1984 it had several objectives that had to be balanced. One objective was to bring as many people as possible within the Social Security system, people who had been exempted from it in order to sustain the fiscal soundness of the system. Another objective was to treat Federal -- people in Federal service similarly in that each should be subjected to one, but only one, contribution for retirement income security, and a third was, Congress understood that Federal employees in the Civil Service retirement system had a large vested interest in that system, which had been in place since 1920, and that it would be extremely disruptive just to terminate it and start as if it had never existed, especially because many Federal employees would not have been able to accrue enough service in Social Security after that point to become eligible in Social Security, especially if they were older. The Federal -- the Civil Service retirement system allows retirement at age 55. It also is more expensive on the cost side for Federal employees than Social Security in some sense, because the contribution rate is higher, and there was no earnings cap on Social Security -- on CSRS, as there was under the old age tax system, so all of those factors had to be balanced. The point is, at the end of the day, Federal judges joined virtually everybody else in our society in being subject to a 5, 6 percent mandatory contribution for a retirement income security system, and that's what I mean when I say that the overall objective of Congress was equalization, and that Congress treated them no differently at the end of the day than it treated everybody else. Now, it is true, there are issues that come up in a transition, as there are any time when Congress extended Social Security, or where a State might adjust -- a State might adjust an exemption, for example, the intragovernmental tax immunity system doctrine was alluded to. Well, there was a time when States exempted all Federal employees and Federal contractors from their taxes because they thought they were required to under this Court's decisions in Collector v. Day. Then along came Graves, and the Court said that States could tax Federal employees and Federal contractors on an equal rate. The States were required to adjust their systems, or had the opportunity to adjust their systems, and they were able to do so in many different ways. It required some -- it required a lot of adjustment because of the ways that different people had been treated differently, and this Court has many cases on that point, reviewing the adjustments that the States made, but the point is, the principle that emerged from those cases was, what was required at the end of the day was nondiscriminatory taxation of those who dealt with the Federal Government, and that principle we think is the same principle that should govern here. That is, at the end of the day, Congress is required to do more than treat Federal judges on par with the vast majority of American citizens. I do want to touch on the termination of violation point, which is, even if we're wrong about everything that I just said, it seems to me the only expectation that judges could have had when they took office was that their net pay would not have been reduced below the level at which they took office. So the expectation -- the expectation that judges had was not that they remain exempt from Social Security taxes in a kind of indefinite number that is just, they have an interest in an exemption, quia exemption, but a particular number has to be put on that, so if a violation did occur, the violation came to an end when Congress brought judges' net pay back up above the highest level that it had ever been at any earlier time. If the Court has nothing further --"
