The Federal Circuit has done that by moving away from historical practice in two key ways. First, it's made the test all about recklessness rather than also intent. Second, it judges recklessness based on legal defenses developed in litigation rather than the facts at the time of the infringement. The net result, now that this Court in Octane and Highmark set aside a similarly artificial test for fees is a one­of­its­kind, good for patent­damages­only framework that does not track the enhancement statute's text, history, or purposes. It was not always this way. For nearly 150 years, district courts conducted a totality inquiry subject to deferential review.

Had to be intentional or reckless infringement, but based on the facts at the time. It was a traditional, willfulness inquiry.

But no. I think the only reason that we and the PTO have pointed to the compensation cases and the misconduct cases is just to show that for 150 years it was a totality inquiry, and district courts were looking at a lot of different things. These cases are primarily about the nature of the infringement. Most cases will be like that. I think if the Court wanted to provide guidance to the Federal Circuit about how to run the statute, it should say go back to doing a totality inquiry, and here's some of the principles that historically guided your exercise of discretion.

And that's exactly historically how cases played out, and it's how they should play out once this Court takes care of Seagate, which is both parties come in at the enhancement stage; most of the evidence has come in on infringement for liability or damages. And the patentee will say, you copied a patented product and haven't shown any evidence that you had a reasonable belief in invalidity. And the defendant, if the patentee has carried its burden, will say, no. I did some investigation. I thought I wasn't infringing. Or I thought it was invalid. And a district court will make a judgment call faced with those competing narratives about what the right answer is based on the facts. Our point is that that judgment call that district courts were making for a very long time has essentially been stripped from them because it no longer matters. Even if you acted intentionally at the time, as Zimmer did, what the Federal Circuit says is, if you can hire good lawyers and come up with defenses in litigation, you'll be off the hook. And as Justice Breyer pointed out in the Octane litigation ­­ and I now know it's true from preparing for this case, you can ­­ a patent lawyer can virtually always come up with some nonfrivolous defense in litigation.

The statute just says: In either event, the Court may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed. I don't get too much guidance from that. Let me assume against you, assume against you, that the history does not favor you. The history insists upon willful. Let me assume with you that there isn't good ground for clear and convincing. Nothing suggests that. But now, the hardest part for me ­­ and it is hard. I don't have a clear answer ­­ is there are, indeed, some preliminary in tests. If, for example, the patentee has a flaw in his patent ­­ not enough to kill it, but enough to make it pretty uncertain, a weak patent. There are all kinds of things wrong with it. No willfulness damages, irrespective, almost, of the state of mind of the infringer. So what could be said for that? You've read their excellent briefs on both sides, and you know perfectly well what can be said for that. And if I summarize it ­­ and that's what I want your answer to. Today's patent world is not a steam­engine world. We have decided to patent tens of thousands of software products and similar things where hardly anyone knows what the patent's really about. A company that's a start­up, a small company, once it gets a letter, cannot afford to pay 10,000 to $100,000 for a letter from Counsel, and may be willing to run its chances. You start saying, little company, you must pay 10,000 to $100,000 to get a letter, lest you get willful damages against you should your bet be wrong. We have one more path leading us to national monopoly by Google and Yahoo or their equivalence, and the patent statute is not designed to create monopolies throughout the United States. It's designed to help the small businessman, not to hurt him. So leave those words for interpretation to the expert court, and in this area it may well be the Federal Circuit."

The one point I just want to make, because I think it's very important, is to get into the recklessness box at common law, and traditionally, you had to show an objectively high risk. So as a patentee, you've got to show to the judge, not just that infringement occurred, but that a reasonable person looking at it would have said there is a very high risk that what I am doing is unlawful because it trenches on someone else's valid patent. That's a pretty high bar. You're not going to be able to satisfy that. You shouldn't be able to satisfy that in a lot of cases. I think the strength of the PTO's argument is when you can show that, the district court should be able to make a judgment call about enhancement. And the fact that it can't shows you that you've really skewed the incentives. Because on the other side of the parade of horribles you're worried about are the people who can infringe, knowing that they can discount by the probability that they'll be found to have infringed in litigation with virtually no back­end penalty, even if they were a very bad infringer, as Zimmer was here."

I think the Federal Circuit, in our view, took the law in a good direction or a better direction when it reversed its Underwater Devices standard which it said was akin to negligence, and it tried to tighten the law versus ­­ about willfulness up to make it harder to get enhanced damages. We think that was a step in the right direction, but we think that they made two important mistakes when they did that. The first one is essentially that they said that in a case where you have subjective intent, that, in and of itself, is not enough to establish a case for enhanced damages. Essentially that you have to prove recklessness under an objective standard in each and every case. We don't think that's consistent with the history of the statute, with the purpose of the statute, with the way punitive damages have ­­ have always been considered, with the way willfulness has always been interpreted. So we think that's wrong. The second mistake we think that the Federal Circuit made is with respect to how the recklessness inquiry is supposed to happen. So recklessness, everyone agrees, is an objective inquiry. And in every other area of law where courts are conducting an objective inquiry, what you ­­ what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to take a reasonable man, and you put him in the ­­ the actual person who is accused of wrongdoing, in his shoes. And you take what that actual person knew, and you figure out whether a reasonable man in that person's shoes would have thought that there was a very high risk that the conduct at issue was unlawful. And what the Federal Circuit does is not that. What they are essentially doing is taking the reasonable man and giving him the benefit of omniscience, giving him the benefit of hindsight and saying, what facts do we know at the time of trial?

And the reason that we're not leaving it up to 475 trial judges is because those 475 trial judges don't see patent cases very much. And where they have a pretty good idea of how employment law, tort law, and all kinds of other law works, they don't have that, a good idea in respect to patent law. And we, the Federal Circuit, do.

My assessment of this, and I think it's borne out by the way the Federal Circuit has looked at this problem, is that there are not that ­­ there are not very many pirates out there. And if you keep a rule that is designed simply to get the one in a million pirates ­­ I would call them unicorns ­­ but one in a million pirates, you'd end up with a rule that will allow the trolls to go after every legitimate producer of products and services in this country.

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, I have two fairly simple points. The first is, as we and the PTO and many of Respondents' amici recognize, the system as it currently stands is out of balance. And we have tried, and I believe we have succeeded, in crafting an approach that balances the Court's concerns with the need to respect the rights of patentees, including small companies like Halo. And we've done it in a couple of different ways. Reasonable, good­faith efforts to ­­ to challenge patents are not going to result in enhanced damages. And intent and recklessness are not going to be and should not be easy to show. Now, the Federal Circuit hasn't adopted a contrary approach based on its expertise. It thought it had to in light of this Court's decision in Safeco, which it has misread. Safeco says if you adopt a reasonable view of the law at the time, you're not acting willfully. It doesn't say if you subjectively and correctly believe that you are violating the law, you are held not to be willful because you have hired a good lawyer and come up with a defense later. And that approach is what has skewed the incentives in the patent system and taken us out of balance. Our approach incentivizes good, commercially reasonable behavior under the full set of circumstances at the discretion of the district court. Their approach is incentivizing good litigation. And the second point I just want to make quickly is we do have the evidentiary burden and standard of review in this case. I think it's clear that the ­­ there isn't any basis for the clear and convincing standard. On the standard of review, I think Highmark resolves and I think Pierce v. Underwood resolves it. These are determinations bound up with the facts, and just as the Court said in Pierce, whether a litigating position is substantially justified is a mixed question of fact and law. So too the questions here. These should be reviewed for abuse of discretion, and it's very important for the Court to say that. Halo should go back to the district court and be analyzed under the right standard so the evidentiary burden matters. In Stryker the district court actually got to the discretionary way, did it, and on appeal, Zimmer never challenged that as an abuse of discretion. It just argued about the objective prong. When this Court takes that out of the analysis, as it should, there's no basis to disturb the district court's discretionary ruling. As the Court knows from looking at it, it's a thorough and reasonable opinion. So ­­"

And as Pulse candidly, and I think honestly, concedes in its brief, you can read 298 to have effect on either side's view of the ­­ how you ought to treat the enhancement statute. So I don't think 298 cuts either way. And I would just stress for the Court that Congress at the time looked at putting \"willfully\" in the statute, and it looked at putting something virtually identical to Seagate in the statute.
