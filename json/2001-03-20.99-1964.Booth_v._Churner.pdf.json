      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves an excessive force action brought by a State prisoner under Section 1983 that was dismissed on the grounds that the prisoner had not exhausted the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's three-tiered prison grievance system. The case turns on an issue of statutory construction, whether when first enacting and then amending Section 1997e(a), to limit the exhaustion provisions to, quote, such administrative remedies as are available. Congress intended to require a prisoner, whose remedy is one for monetary damages, to address a past- completed constitutional violation to exhaust a prison grievance system that cannot provide such a remedy. Of course, the backdrop of this case is that there's no general exhaustion requirement in Section 1983. But what is key here is that when Congress first enacted the Section 1997e exception in 1980 and then when it amended Section 1997e in 1996, while dramatically strengthening and changing the exhaustion provision in many respects, it retained the key words, such administrative remedies as are available."

Congress took out the words plain, speedy and effective in 1996, along with making exhaustion mandatory rather than discretionary, removing the stay provision and a number of other changes. The purpose of taking out plain, speedy and effective, though, those words did not drive the result that we're seeking here. They didn't drive the inquiry of whether, in fact, the prison grievance system could provide the relief. What those words -- what the work that those words did in the prior statute, and this is evident from looking at the present statute, which is reprinted on page 5A of Respondent's brief."

It says no action shall be brought until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted. Your client, I take it, brought an action and in that action, he wanted a transfer of records, a bunch of different things, as well as damages. So at least as far as this case is concerned, why wasn't there for that action remedies to exhaust, namely all the transfer part, all the other parts?"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

And I would think there's a very strong argument that whatever you think about somebody who runs into court and files a claim only for money damages, where a prisoner asks for both, he shouldn't be able to bring his money claim in court until after he's exhausted his prison remedies in respect to what there is to exhaust and there's a lot."

      "speech": "The Courts of Appeals haven't explained their reasoning in the decisions, but one possibility would be a practical one, which is if in a mixed claim situation the prisoner has to go back and exhaust both the injunctive and the monetary part, it's likely that their monetary claim -- they would risk -- face a high risk of forfeiting their money claim because it would be too late to exhaust that through the prison grievance system. Pennsylvania's, for example, is five days. It's 15 days for bringing your initial grievance. So if Mr. Booth's case had been dismissed, he would have been out of time, in all likelihood by that point, to pursue the money claim through the grievance procedure, which is why I think the Courts of Appeals had approached the issue and dealt with this problem by permitting --"

      "speech": "I don't follow that if he hadn't come to court at all. If the rule is, if you want more than one kind of relief, you must go to the administrator within five days, whatever. So the idea is, I think what Justice Breyer was suggesting, that is if you have a mixed claim, this -- what you're trying to present, you said, the question we presented is damages only. You want this Court to treat this case as though there were never any claims, anything else other than money damages and I understand that that's how you would like this case to be treated, but if we take this very case, I am not following your argument that there would be any loss of time and a time bind for the defendant if you must go swiftly to the prison system and name everything."

If he had been -- if that action had then been dismissed, go back and exhaust because there are injunctive claims in here that need to be exhausted, he would have been, he would have been time-barred from pursuing the money damages claim then in Federal court because he had to bring his grievance, under Pennsylvania's grievance procedure, within 15 days of the incident. By the time he brings his action in Federal court, the Federal court then dismisses. He's too late."

      "speech": "If our interpretation is right on the money damages point, and I'd like to go there, if that's right then the approach that the Tenth Circuit took in the Miller case, I think, addresses the concern. The prisoner brings a mixed claim. The court allows the money damages aspect of the claim that the Tenth Circuit agrees does not have to be exhausted to go forward, thereby avoiding this problem of the prisoner perhaps losing the money damages claim all together because they could never exhaust the claim. It's too late."

It says until such administrative remedies as are available. I mean, that's a very broad phrase, such administrative remedies as are available. It could be all sorts of remedies, damages, injunctions. On what basis do you want it limited to only those remedies that provide your client the same relief he wants in the 1997e action. I don't understand that."

Here there's no question --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I understand that. That may well be with respect to those exhaustion requirements that are devised by the courts without any statutory requirement, but it is entirely conceivable that an exhaustion requirement would have other purposes as your opponents claim here, simply making the prisoner go through a lengthy procedure that may satisfy him even though the relief is not the same or that may persuade him that the factual basis for his claims are so insubstantial that it's no use troubling the Federal courts with them. There are a lot of other reasons for making him go through these hoops before he is one of the, what, 45,000 prisoners a year who run into Federal court right away. That seems to be a perfect valid purpose and it seems to me that the way the statute reads."

When Congress had the opportunity in 1996 to create this kind of blanket exhaustion, we want all prisoner problems to go through the prison grievance system, it didn't do that, it retained the six words."

The statute is at issue in McNeil, the Federal Tort Claims Act, an action shall not be instituted under the FTCA unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency. So this statute could have said Congress could have, rather than advertently leaving in the words, until such administrative remedies as are available, Congress could have written a broad exhaustion statute."

There may be cases, not just as Justice Scalia indicated where the claim is insubstantial, there may be cases where it's very substantial. But the courts are certainly helped by having a -- suppose they had a hearing, the guard was disciplined, reprimanded. They restored whatever disciplinary demerits or they erased any disciplinary action that was taken against the Petitioner. That would be very helpful to the court. Now maybe they can't give damages, but that's the next stage."

This statute served purposes that are not served by the FTCA example you put out and this statute is -- it doesn't seem to me that the Congress could have taken the FTCA analogy to accomplish the result that it wants to accomplish here."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I would agree with you that Congress perhaps could have been clearer about it. But I want to ask you just a textual question to see whether we disagree on that. I will admit that when I first looked at the statute I thought remedies referred to form of relief. But after reading the briefs and reading the statute a few more times, I came to the conclusion that, in fact, remedies was an ambiguous word. It could either mean form of relief or it could mean administrative process. And one of the textual clues, it seems to me, that's in there to indicate that Congress meant administrative process was its use of the word exhaust. We don't normally speak of exhausting the relief that you get. I mean, like running through the money damages and having a good time, that's what -- I mean, exhaustion usually refers to exhausting a particular process. So just at kind of step one, the textual point here seemed to me probably to make a better argument or support a better argument, that what Congress was talking about when it used relief was administrative process rather than -- a remedy rather. It was using administrative process rather than particular relief awarded. Would you comment on that?"

In fact, the empirical evidence would point to the contrary that in the Circuits, in the Fifth and the Ninth Circuits, that have held our away on the money damages point, there hasn't been this bypass and this explosion of litigation and that makes sense because if what the prisoner wants, the prisoner can, in fact, get through the prison grievance process, then just like the State's amicus brief points out, numerous grievances are resolved in a prisoner's favor. They would go there. I need a different cell. I need to be housed without a smoker. Why would they give up the injunctive relief that they want simply to get into Federal court where they have to today pay a filing fee, at least in installments, where they risk losing one of their three lifelong strikes if, in fact, their proceeding IFP and their case is dismissed?

You were candid in saying before, if you have this kind of claim, you can go directly to court with no administrative filing at all. Suppose the administrative process does include some kind of monetary relief, but it's got a cap, say a thousand dollars capped. And your client's view is they beat me to a bloody pulp and a thousand dollars wouldn't begin to compensate me for my injury. Could such a person, in your view, go directly to court because there's no available remedy? There's a monetary remedy but it's capped."

But in that situation there is a monetary damages remedy available. It may not be a perfect remedy. It may not be the one-to-one fit, but the difference between that case and our case, is that in our case there was no monetary damages remedy available at all and that's why Mr. Booth, as a matter of administrative exhaustion, didn't have to go through that process. Remember, when we're talking about administrative exhaustion and Congress can be presumed to have been legislating when it chose and then retained these words, such available -- such administrative remedies as are available, that there's a long-standing jurisprudence in the administrative law area about the futility --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I'd like to ask you now, I understand the nature of the claim you're asserting. Suppose I were of the view, this statute is nor crystal clear. It could be read either way. It could be read to say, if there's administrative process, you have to exhaust it or it could be read to say, only if the kind of relief you're seeking is available must you exhaust. Then when the text doesn't tell me which one of those is right. Why isn't the proper perspective what Congress was trying to do? One thing we know Congress was trying to do, is to curtail prisoner litigation. Why wouldn't it be appropriate for a court to say well that's going to be how I break the tie? The text could be read either way, but I know that Congress wanted to curtail prisoner litigation so I'm going to read it the way that will keep cases out of court."

We acknowledge that and there are numerous provisions in the PLRA that go to that point, the filing fee, the three strikes provision, all the enhanced mechanisms for a district court's screening of prisoner complaints. And even this very statute was amended in significant respects to channel far more grievances and complaints through the grievance system before they could come to court. It's mandatory rather than discretionary. There's no more stay. There's no more Federal oversight of the adequacy of the State procedures, but Congress fell short we believe when it retained those words against a backdrop of administrative law jurisprudence about futility.

I presume your answer would be the same since there is a damage remedy available in the administrative procedure you have to exhaust, which means that, you know, that what you're proposing to us besides not, in my view, corresponding to the text of the statute doesn't even have the virtue of providing fairness it seems to me. Why should it be if I can get $50 I have to go through the prison grievance procedure when I'm claiming $10,000 of actual damages? It doesn't make any sense."

I don't know exactly where that line is. But the other point in terms of statutory interpretation is that, if all Congress meant to do was to say that prisoners have to go through every prison grievance system, then these words would be superfluous. What could they mean, such administrative remedies as are available? Certainly, if there's not a procedure in existence, Congress wasn't trying to say a prisoner has to go through that."

Even Respondents acknowledge that the procedure has to be, the administrative remedy has to be capable of addressing the subject matter of the prisoner's complaint. And with that in mind that would create more work on the district courts because instead of just looking at what the prisoner is seeking, what relief and then is that available in the grievance system, they're going to have to parse through the subject matter of the complaint, parse through whether the grievance system can actually address that, which I think it would create more work for the district courts."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAPPERT",
      "speech": "No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't, Your Honor. And where I respectfully differ with your question is again the presumption that it means nothing. The process means nothing if there isn't money at the end of the line and the reason that that is not correct is that there is an indefinite and almost endless list of ways that the prison could satisfy the prisoner, short of money. There is always a possibility that the prison can satisfy the prisoner short of giving him or her money because in essence the currency equivalence isn't money. Money has a value within the prisons, but the currency of prisons is in-kind relief. And there are many things within a prison that money can't buy and that are very valuable to the prisoner."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, that's a different argument. Don't tell me that you're helping the prisoner because there a lot of things that he would think even more valuable than money. If he would think them even more valuable than money, he'd use them. This is forcing the prisoner to go through the prison procedure, which presumably he doesn't want to go through."

      "speaker": "PAPPERT",
      "speech": "He says he doesn't want to go through it, Your Honor, but again I think we make a mistake to equate what the prisoner says he wants or needs when he files a grievance, with what the prisoner says he wants once he files his civil rights complaint. And the entire premise upon which the Petitioner's interpretation is based is that there's absolutely nothing the process can do for him and that's simply not true. There are many things the process can do for him, but Your Honor, in your hypothetical if the prisoner goes through the process, if he doesn't accept any of the various forms of relief that he's offered, if his allegations, of course, are found to be true by the prison, he can still go to court. We have no problem with that. This is just a mechanism to try to weed as many of the court claims out as possible."

I believe the statute of limitations claim may start to run earlier and if it does, that is just something that Congress took into mind when it imposed no doubt a dramatic difference in how they wanted prisoner litigation handled. Such that, you know, as long as he goes through the process, he conceivably can still file a Federal court claim.

There may be an instance where there is a harsh result following the prison process and if the statute of limitation expires it's for a number of reasons. First of all being that Congress wanted to leave the setting of the deadlines to the discretion of the States and the departments of corrections and the local institutions. So --"

And even if you're in the twirls of the administrative process, it continues to tick and if the time is up while you're still in the administrative process, too bad, you can't get to court, but that's what you're telling me this statute does. And I don't see the rationale to that."

That was, you indicated that the prison could in effect drag the process out. We would not agree with that. And we would say that if the administrative process is not honored by the prison, the prisoner will still have a remedy. We are not saying that courts do not have the discretion under this statute to determine whether exhaustion has, in fact, taken place."

The prisoner can still --"

Justice Souter was saying, and I confess I don't know any other situation in which you are compelled to exhaust and the statute keeps on running while you're exhausting. That seems to be a very unusual situation. Justice Souter was suggesting that the statute of limitations is simply tolled while you're exhausting and you think that is conceivable too, isn't it?"

      "speaker": "PAPPERT",

But another point here though is that, under the Petitioner's interpretation, we still have the problem Justice Ginsburg referred to. If there's a short deadline for the bringing of the claim to the administrative process, whether or not there's relief at the end of the line that the Petitioner wants, they still may have that very situation. So the Petitioner's interpretation of the statute doesn't satisfy some of the problems that could come."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "PAPPERT",
      "speech": "That was in the context, Your Honor, of what I thought was Justice Ginsburg's hypo of the prison unreasonably dragging out the process for the purposes of blowing the statute of limitations. And what I was saying in response to that is, that in situations like that, we would determine that exhaustion -- we would feel that exhaustion has taken place if, for example, the prisoner submits his claim, the prison sits on it, they do not honor their deadlines under the exhaustion process. Exhaustion has taken place under that and what I am saying is there's no prohibition on a court recognizing that."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAPPERT",
      "speech": "Well, if the deadlines in this process are honored by Pennsylvania, the process would take on average probably under 90 days, Your Honor. If the deadlines have not been honored and the prison has, in effect, sat on the grievance, the prisoner would have a remedy, yes. The Petitioner's interpretation of the statute I think most importantly would reintroduce the effectiveness requirement that came out in some prior questions. And it would also allow the prisoner to bypass the process simply by manipulating the relief that he requests. And there's no better example of that, I think in response to a question, we heard that it's not just money. Money might not be the only issue and we get to the questions of the caps and that is that next time it may be that the prisoner wants the prison regulations be declared unconstitutional. And he says that you can't declare it unconstitutional, prison, so I have to go the Federal courts. There will be different ways to evade the process other than by saying that money is all that the prisoner really wants and that is a risk here. And that, in fact, happened in one of the cases cited by the Petitioner in the Fifth Circuit where the prisoner filed a mixed claim, as in some of the prior questions, the magistrate recommended dismissal of the claim based on failure to exhaust. The prisoner quickly amended his claim and made it solely a money damages case and the Fifth Circuit allowed that. I mean, that's a clear example of empirical evidence of how a prisoner got around the exhaustion requirement and that we know is contrary to what Congress wanted in this statute."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "May I ask you to clarify one other thing? As I recall, in your brief, you said one of the virtues of the administrative process is that it can establish a factual record, but I think part of this, isn't it part of the Pennsylvania rules that whatever's developed in the grievance system cannot be used in court?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAPPERT",
      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, and that's - it is. Under the Pennsylvania process it's almost as though a provision tries to foster use of the grievance process by putting it into the context of settlement negotiations. We were not speaking in terms of a factual record as a lower court would deliver to an appellate court. But what we meant there was there can still be an investigation. There can be the gathering and preservation of evidence by the prison, all of which can narrow the claims that do make it to court and that's what we meant by the value in a record sense of exhausting the process."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "May I just clarify one thing in my own mind about your position? I understand if the prisoner files a case in which he just asks for damages and nothing else, it's accusing a guard of beating him up on a particular occasion. You'd say he must exhaust and maybe you can satisfy him by transferring the guard or moving or something like that, but supposing the guard is dead and there's nothing that could be done to remedy a situation except money damage, do you still say he should exhaust?"

The problem with the Petitioner's interpretation of the statute is, we will never know that. We don't know that in this case before the claim gets to Federal courts and we will not know that in all the cases that are similar to this that follow because we never gave the prison the chance to try."

Congress focused more broadly in this statute and there still things that can benefit the other inmates who remain at the prison and the prison itself by putting the prison on notice of the problem and giving the prison the first opportunity to correct it. So those are benefits that can flow generally from exhaustion of the process. Even though under your question, Your Honor, that particular prisoner was not satisfied."

So the available remedies that have to be in existence is just something that addresses complaints about excessive force and it could be transferring the inmate to another area, it could be disciplining the officer involved and directing the officer not to repeat that conduct and that would show that administrative remedies are available and an inmate would have to exhaust, even if he only wants to seek money in court. Now that conclusion follows when the textual changes that Congress made in the statute. Before the Act was amended, exhaustion could only be required when the available administrative remedies were effective. And this Court said in McCarthy against Madigan that administrative remedies are not effective when the inmate seeks only money and the administrative process does not offer that specific form of relief."

What Congress was faced with was an interpretation of the term effective and the Court interpreted it to mean then when administrative remedies do not offer money and the inmate is seeking money, the administrative available remedies are not effective and in that context, Congress's elimination of the term effective shows that Congress intended to require inmates to exhaust available remedies in all cases, including ones like that in McCarthy, in which the inmate seeks only money and the available remedies do not offer money. So what we have, what the statue essentially says to an inmate, is if you have a complaint about prison conditions and the administrative process will address it in some way, you must give the administrative process a chance to do it to your satisfaction and if they cannot do that --"

A grievance procedure is something that offers some relief for the kind of complaint that an inmate is complaining about. And the reason Congress made the particular changes that it made here is it wanted to reduce the enormous burden that these kinds of cases were placing on Federal district courts and the change that it made accomplishes that in two important ways. First of all, an inmate may start out wanting nothing other than money and he may end up being satisfied with something else. And second of all, you have cases where the inmate receives a decision on the merits and he decides after seeing that decision that this is not a claim that's worth pursuing in court. And finally, it's important to note that very few State administrative programs offer money for anything other than personal property loss. So the consequence of accepting the Petitioner's construction here would be that an inmate would have the ability in a wide range of case to avoid the exhaustion requirement simply by formulating a complaint that seeks only money.

The only remedy available to address that wrong to him is money damages. Transferring the prison guard is not going to provide redress to Mr. Booth for the wrong that was inflicted upon him. And as counsel for the Respondent conceded, Mr. Booth has a high risk of forfeiting his money damages claim under Section 1983 completely for no reason. The prison grievance system cannot remedy that wrong. He has everything to lose."

      "speaker": "WINKELMAN",
      "speech": "That's true, but in the injunctive context, he has something to gain. Here he has nothing to gain. The second point is, is that in terms of what about couldn't it just mean that the prison grievance will hear the complaint. I would return this Court to the words in First Iowa of 55 years ago. When Congress intends for a litigant to do something futile, it has to be explicit about it. Here Congress was far than explicit about it. Under our view, we think it was said the opposite. At best it was ambiguous, but certainly Congress didn't explicitly require a prisoner to do a futile act. And the final point on the deletion of the word effective, I would point the Court to the prior statutory scheme because the words plain, speedy and effective in that scheme right on the face of the statute went only towards the procedural aspects of the State grievance procedure. Did it prevent against reprisals? Could it deal with things quickly enough? That's what Congress took out. But what Congress left in was such administrative remedies as are available, which we believe have force and in this situation the only remedy available was to pay damages."
