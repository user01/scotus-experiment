      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: This case concerns whether a police officer could be held personally liable for using force to terminate a dangerous high-speed pursuit. The undisputed facts show that Deputy Scott did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Respondent had led the police officers on a nine-mile pursuit at exceptionally high speeds. As the videotapes that have been admitted in evidence show, Respondent was driving on narrow two-lane roads at night. He swerved across the double line to pass cars that were in his path, actually traveling in the wrong lane of travel. He ran through a number of red lights. He weaved through a shopping center and collided with Deputy Scott's vehicle. Deputy Scott at that point had tried to block the exit from the shopping center, but Mr. Harris was successful in using his vehicle to escape. At that point, he continued driving at exceptionally high speeds."

There is a factual dispute as far as whether Deputy Scott's vehicle collided with Mr. Harris' vehicle or vice versa, but we do not believe that that is a material dispute.

We would contend that it was Mr. Harris that was in control of the force that the officers need to terminate, the risk that he presented. At any time, any time, Mr. Harris could have either slowed down his vehicle or stopped, and he chose not to do that."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAVRIN",
      "speech": "Your Honor, as I read the Garner opinion, the court did not need to reach a definition of deadly force because shooting someone in the back of the head is clearly going to be deadly force. The circuit courts -- I can tell you that the circuit courts in the wake of Garner have said that Garner did not create a test and have created different tests along the lines of the Model Penal Code to reach that definition. But the point -- I was going to say a point that I would like to make is that there are degrees even within the continuum that might be within a definition of deadly force, such as using a vehicle to make contact, blowing out the tires, using stop sticks, using a firearm. Those have different degrees of potential lethality, so even if they are all considered deadly force there are decisions that an officer has to make."

I would say that the Third Circuit decision in the Philadelphia litigation case, where the officers dropped a bomb on a building in order to gain access and they ended up killing 11 people. The Court found that that was not deadly force because the officers were trying to gain access to the building and they reasonably believe that they were able to do that without the loss of life. I think that if that definition were applied to this case, then I think that this would not be deadly force. But I think - -"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAVRIN",
      "speech": "Let me cite the Court to the Eleventh Circuit's own reasoning in the Adams case. And that case involves a misdemeanant where the officer intentionally made contact with the vehicle several times. The last contact caused the death of a passenger. The Eleventh Circuit found that Garner did not apply to that situation and further said that a policeman's use of his vehicle is very different from a policeman's use of his gun."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAVRIN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAVRIN",
      "speech": "Your Honor, because Mr. Harris could have regained control of his vehicle. The point is that Mister -- that the Petitioner had limited options based on the manner in which Mr. Harris was driving. Even if this would be considered deadly force, we do believe it would be justified under the circumstances."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
      "speech": "Well, that's a different issue and you may prevail on other arguments in the case. But as to whether or not there's a likelihood or a reasonable likelihood of serious injury, it seems to me that's clearly a question for the jury. I mean, we might argue about it up here, but that's classic jury question, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAVRIN",
      "speech": "I believe in the context of the Fourth Amendment and the Graham factors and the question of probable cause, that it's not the same as simply a jury question. But I do concede that if it's not deadly force it's very close to it. But I think the important thing is that, whatever force Mister -- the Petitioner used was limited by Mr. Harris' driving."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "Mr. Savrin, one technique that Officer Scott asked permission to use was described as a PIT technique that would be a life and limb- sparing measure. One oddity about this case is that he called and asked permission to use that less risky method and yet when he determined that he couldn't do that, given the speed of the vehicles, he didn't ask permission to do what he did do, which was life-endangering."
    },

      "speaker": "SAVRIN",
      "speech": "Your Honor, if I could respond to that in two respects. First, it is not, it is not the case that the PIT maneuver, as it's commonly called, is safe. What it does is spin the car out, and if Mr. Harris' vehicle had been spun out in this case it is more likelihood that he would have lost control. In other words, it causes the vehicle to lose control. The second response I would have is that the Petitioner did ask permission to do the PIT maneuver and the permission that the supervisor gave, which was Mr. Faninger that's in the record undisputed, was to use force up to deadly force. So Mr. - -"

So aren't we supposed to look at all the circumstances, including the circumstance of what -- one that interests me, one, is that the right standard? Two, did Scott know that the reason he was chasing this person was because he had violated a speed limit, or was he ignorant of the reason why the individual was racing away at 90 miles an hour, which is as far as the record could show?"

But then when I read what I read out to you, in Graham, it seemed to me that Graham, which comes after Garner, says that's not the standard.

What Graham did is it expanded the Garner rule, which you can't use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect who is merely fleeing, expanded that to include the entire range of use of force, deadly or nondeadly. And with regard to the factors that are to be considered in determining whether the use of force is reasonable under Graham, the balance with respect to a fleeing suspect who is subjected to deadly force was already drawn by Garner. Garner created a bright light rule. Graham extended that to an ad hoc balancing test with all use of force applications.

If it does, then any officer who perceives that someone is driving unsafely and that they may cause an accident to someone who may or may not be down the road if not stopped, would be justified in using deadly force, to literally take out anyone who is speeding."

And it doesn't seem to me that we have to adopt a rule that will, that will discourage police officers. There's, there's enough disincentive to engage in this kind of activity in the fact that the police officer may hurt himself. It's pretty risky to conduct this kind of a maneuver, don't you think?

The officer had no control over what was going to happen once he used deadly force, like the officer who fired into the cab of a flying vehicle in Barn v Cox, once you disable the driver the car keeps going.

I would have guessed that, if the police stopped chasing, you don't go 90 miles an hour anymore.

Let me refocus for a moment that in order for the officer to be denied qualified immunity in this context a jury would have to be able to find two things. One, that no -- that there was no probable cause, and second, that that was clearly established. And I think that the discussion this morning if nothing else shows that it's not clearly established. As far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned, I think the measure needs to be exactly as this Court stated in Graham versus Connor, which is looking at the facts from the standpoint of the officer on the scene, because after all, he has to make split-second decisions.

But I would go back to Garner, and Garner says that an armed suspect would have been a different case. And Garner also says that some misdemeanors such as drunk driving are more dangerous that some felonies such as white collar crime. So I think the question should not be whether it's a technical issue of crossing the line from misdemeanor to felony, but the harm that is being caused by the continued driving that's exactly what occurred in this case. And if I could respond to Justice Breyer's question about what to do in terms of responding to Mr. Marx's question, I think the Ornelas case says that you would review it for clear error. And in this case you would not owe deference of a finding of fact by the lower court."
