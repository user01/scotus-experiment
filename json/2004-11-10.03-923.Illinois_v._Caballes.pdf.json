      "speech": "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This Court has made clear on several occasions, including 21 years ago in Place and 4 years ago in Edmond, that a sniff by a drug-detection dog is not a Fourth Amendment search, and if something is neither a search nor a seizure, then it requires no Fourth Amendment justification."

We -- we have said that that is a kind of seizure. Why do -- I think your -- your argument assumes that this for -- for purposes of search analogies that something is either a -- a full-dress search or it's not a search at all. Why isn't there a -- a possibility of - - of a kind of middle ground on searches just as there is on seizures?"

We're -- we're opening rather a -- a large vista for -- for dog intrusions, and -- and that's what's -- that's what's bothering me. Why -- why should we -- why should we open that vista if there is a possibility of a -- of a middle ground that would prevent it?"

      "speaker": "MADIGAN",

I can tell you that because of the limited resources - - and this is a point brought up in the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police amicus brief -- that that is not likely to occur. In addition, I can also tell you that in the State of Illinois, the Illinois State police do not train their dogs nor do they use their dogs on people. They only use them on objects. But yes, in answer to both of your questions, because a dog sniff does not constitute a search, dogs could be used to walk down streets. They could, hypothetically, be used in parking lots, and at times they are used in parking lots."

No search is no search. So for purposes of -- if I -- I want to understand your case, and as I understand it, for purposes of your case, there is no significance in the house because there doesn't have to be.

Now, but -- but this is not a new technology. This is a dog and -- and they had that ability in 1791 just as they had it today. And the rule that when there's no intrusion, there's no search -- there's no reason to depart from that rule with respect to a dog although there would be with respect to some sophisticated new technology that would enable you to find out all sorts of things."

The language of the Court in Place is significant because it says that we are aware of no other investigative procedure that is so limited in both the manner in which the information is obtained and in the content of the information revealed. That language goes not only to why it's not a Fourth Amendment search but why the use of the dog sniff during a probable cause traffic stop here, where it doesn't prolong the duration, does not transform an otherwise lawful seizure into an unlawful one."

The Illinois Supreme Court's concern and where we think they got off track was that they were concerned that the use of the dog sniff during this 9-minute traffic stop was that it transformed it -- it used the language that it transformed the sniff into a drug investigation. We would submit that the Fourth Amendment is about the reasonableness of searches and seizures and not about what the scope of the government's investigation is. And in that sense, the court got off track. These -- this is a -- this is a means that law enforcement has been using properly in reliance on this Court's decision in Place, reinforced just 4 years ago in Edmond, for more than 21 years to detect everything from drugs to bombs to smuggled -- we have beagles in the airports that smuggle produce that's being smuggled in.

So there's no question that in that case, as -- as you have argued it, they could make a full-blown search and -- and certainly can use the dog. But if they choose not to arrest on the highway, they can't.

And I think there your - - your reasonable expectation to privacy does, in fact, go out the window. But this is so different. This was just a warning. Period. It was nothing worse than a warning. What makes this stop so pernicious is that it takes place in front of the whole world and is accusatory. It is profoundly embarrassing, and it is humiliating to everyone on the street. So if a person is stopped and the officer just decides to stop you for a minor traffic offense, that's the worst part about this case. Just a minor traffic offense, really a frivolous offense, basically what any law-abiding citizen would happen to -- it could happen to anyone.

It's like -- I think you said in one opinion once if it -- you used the duck analogy, well, if it walks like a duck or quacks like a duck. Here it's still a search. It walks like a -- a dog and it acts like a dog, but its specific function is in fact to search out in public and humiliate people. If there are any further questions.

Number one, Justice Ginsburg asked a question about something that was in the respondent's brief, whether or not it made a difference if a dog was with Master Sergeant Gillette when he initiated the stop or if the dog was later brought, as was the case here, by Trooper Graham. Really what Mr. Caballes is arguing for here is an inadvertence requirement which this Court very clearly held in Horton, there is no such requirement of inadvertence. And so a law officer, if they are at a lawful vantage point, do have the ability to detect incriminating facts. That is not something that has to occur inadvertently. It can happen intentionally. Second, Justice Scalia asked a question about plain view, and similar to plain view, a dog sniff does not effect an incremental search or seizure. And therefore, similar to plain view, a dog sniff does not require Fourth Amendment justification. And let me finally acknowledge something that Justice Souter brought up, which is whether or not, by walking a dog around a house, you in fact would have a search. Let me -- now, that is certainly a closer case than whether walking a dog around a car constitutes a search, which we say is not. But ultimately you would reach a similar result because the principle is not going to extend to cars in the same manner in -- in Kyllo as the thermal imager did. Finally, if there are no further questions, we would ask that the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court be reversed."
