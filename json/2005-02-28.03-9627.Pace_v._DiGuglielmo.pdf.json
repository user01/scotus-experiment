So they were different claims. Let me start with statutory tolling. Section 2244(d)(2) of AEDPA provides tolling during properly filed applications for State post-conviction review. Under this Court's unanimous decision in Artuz, Mr. Pace's PCRA petition was properly filed. In fact, the PCRA time bar functions in all material ways like the New York State procedural bar rules at issue in Artuz. Now, Artuz also identified some types of rules that would prevent an application from being properly filed, for example, the AEDPA successive bar which makes you go to the court of appeals first and get permission before you can actually file in the district court, and it has a screening mechanism to make sure that only petitions with a prima facie chance get filed. The PCRA time bar is nothing like that at all. It's like the State court procedural bar rules in Artuz. There's no condition to filing. You can go and file at any time. The court, as a matter of law, has to take your petition, has to give it judicial review -- yes, Your Honor."

And Artuz, though, reserved the question presented here of whether a time bar with exceptions, like the PCRA time bar -- whether that could be properly filed. And so obviously, Artuz reserved the exact question here. But what -- the analysis of Artuz controls here and shows that this petition was properly filed."

Well, that's -- that's an answer. I'm not sure it's a strong enough answer to respond to Artuz. But I thought you had a second part to the answer, and I thought your second part to the answer was in that kind of situation, the Third Circuit practice, the Third Circuit rule is that unless we go through the Pennsylvania process, even if we know from day one that we're out of time, we think we have a -- an excuse, but even though we -- we think from day one we're out of time, unless we exhaust the Pennsylvania process, they will throw us out for nonexhaustion.

One is it creates a problem with Artuz because that type of rule -- assuming the exceptions are like the PCRA exceptions which go claim by claim, that's a claim-by-claim rule which would then create the anomaly that Artuz shied away from, that you look to whether it was a properly filed application, not to whether it was an application with properly filed claims. The second point is that -- is that for Mr. Pace, whatever the merits of that rule may be going forward, it -- it can't be used against Mr. Pace because there was no such requirement in Pennsylvania. I mean, presumably the -- I assume the Federal courts are not going to make up this rule, that it's going to be up to the State courts to say what their filing - -"

It's a - - it's a form that he filled out and handed in and appointed counsel came up with that claim in the first post- conviction proceeding. This is much more complex than that. If you look at his briefs, which are in the joint appendix, Pennsylvania had a very complex system of law here where they had statutory bar rules but they had judicial exceptions to those rules. And it's not an easy matter for someone to figure that out. Mr. Pace educated himself. Just compare the pro se pleading filed in 1992 to what he filed in 1996, and you can see what he did during these 4 years. The other -- the other -- just -- my light is on, but just the other things I'd like to mention about that are that keep in mind, during this time there were no time limits on filing in either State or Federal court. The commonwealth has never alleged any prejudice from this time, and there's never been any allegation that Mr. Pace acted in bad faith and with any -- any intent to delay. In fact, this is someone who wanted to get his claims heard, wanted to figure out how to do it right, and did figure out how to do it right in the end. I would like to reserve the rest of my time."

      "speech": "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address the structure of the Pennsylvania filing deadlines for post-conviction review because I think they shed some light and need some discussion here. What Pennsylvania did was to establish a 1 - year, flat time limit that applies to everybody. 1 year from conviction. It's automatic. It doesn't matter what the nature of your claims are. It doesn't matter when you discovered your claim. In order to comply with that time limit, all you have to do is file a post-conviction petition within 1 year of finality. The rest of the statute is essentially a separate set of filing deadlines for petitioners, for successive petitioners, for people who either have already had one round of post-conviction review or who haven't bothered to pursue it. Those people, said the legislature, are only going to be entitled to further post-conviction review, to additional rounds of post- conviction review if they fall into a particular class of claim that couldn't have been raised earlier. And -- and the legislature identified three classes that mirror the three provisions in the Federal statute of limitations. And if the petitioner falls within any of those classes, he then has 60 days from the time that that claim arose in order to come into court. Now, if a petitioner files a post-conviction petition and he's within a year of finality, those so- called exceptions don't come into play. They don't apply. He doesn't need to meet them. Those are for the second petitioner. So what Pennsylvania really has is a two-level system of statutes of -- of filing limitations. And of course, in order for the court to determine whether the petitioner has met the filing deadline, he has to look at these three classes for someone who has passed 1 year from finality. That's not an exception in the way I think that the petitioner and some of the lower courts have used the term at all. These are simply different kinds of filing limits. And of course, the court has to look at the statute and the nature of the claims to see whether review is available and to see whether the petitioner has sought review within the proper time. Nothing about that system makes those so-called exceptions not time limits. They're still time limits, and if you don't file in time and come within one of those classes, then the second petition, successive petition time limits don't apply to you and you're out of time."

The first one and the fourth one are the important ones. The first one is final in the State courts, your first round, and the fourth one is newly discovered evidence. Now, my guess is most States also allow you for collateral -- to file collateral relief in those two circumstances. And in most States probably you get nearly a year from the same kind of event. So if you go after the year, you're out of luck in Federal court. If you're within the year, you're probably okay for the State. But there are a few States that have -- maybe Pennsylvania - - just 60 days from one of the events, newly discovered evidence, but a year for the Federal.

If a new claim arises at that point, then he has to go to State court and try to exhaust that claim in State court. He can do that while a Federal petition is pending or even after a first Federal petition has already been disposed of. In fact, he may have to because the claim may not arise before the end of litigation in Federal court. When he gets to State court, he's either going to be deemed timely or not. Actually the fact that we have a 60-day time limit as opposed to a whole year helps him because it helps make it clear to him that he's got to come to State court at a point where he's really got a long time left to deal with Federal court because he's going to - -"

I've looked up or got a rough idea of the statute of limitations for a first petition in many States, and most of them are a year or more. So there's no problem. But 11 have less than a year, and in particular, Oklahoma has 3 months apparently. And Oklahoma is -- a lot of death cases come out of Oklahoma. So what rule would -- where I have to have -- I focus on Oklahoma for the reason that I think this has bite only in death cases because I don't see why anybody would want to abuse the system except in a death case. But there are a lot there. Now, am I supposed to say in Oklahoma which has the 90 days but exceptions, that where somebody has filed a petition in State court, let's say, on the 180th day, and he thinks an exception applies, is he supposed to also run to Federal court and file a protective petition which could well have been dismissed on exhaustion grounds? What's he supposed to do and how is he supposed to know what to do? And one system that might work is Justice Scalia's idea."

And I'd like to get back, as I was discussing with Justice Kennedy, to what the defendant knows. He knows that if he's outside the time that he's guaranteed automatic review, whether direct appeal or State review, State post-conviction review, that his chances of exhausting more claims in State court --"

    {
      "speaker": "EISENBERG",
      "speech": "The practical approach to the problem is to look at the statute that says you have a year. If you file your petition within that year, whatever you've got at the end of that year, you can take to Federal court and be confident that it's exhausted. If you want to do something after that year, you can't be confident anymore. All you have to do is -- is count a year. Now, if something comes up after that time, you're supposed to go to State court first, even if you've got something in Federal court. This statute of limitations isn't supposed to be interpreted in order to make the Federal successive petitions standard moot and unnecessary. It exists for a reason. So if a -- if a claim arises at a later point, after you have finished your guaranteed review in State court, go back to State court, whether or not you've got something pending in Federal court. Don't put that new claim in with your old claims in Federal court because then you have a mixed petition. If you get exhaustion in State court, whether you're timely or untimely, you're going to exhaust. You can then go back to Federal court with a request for a successive petition. It -- that's what you have to do and that's appropriate because that's how Congress set up the statute, with the 1-year filing deadline and -- and a provision for successive petitions."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",

It just allows it for the judge to decide. Would there be tolling during the period in which the judge decided whether or not the petition was timely in your view?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EISENBERG",
      "speech": "No, Your Honor, because all the court is doing is deciding whether the time bar applies, and in order -- in a State that has those kind of categories, what the court is, in effect, doing is deciding what kind of time limit applies to this particular petition."

Does that mean that the State court isn't going to have to take some time to look at it and decide? What if there's a prisoner mailbox question?

I -- I think I understand Artuz to have said that if the application was untimely, then it was not properly filed and it was not properly filed from the get-go, Your Honor. The question that was reserved in Artuz is whether something about exceptions changes that statement in Artuz. And my response is that certainly nothing about the kind of exceptions that were present in this case changed the response."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
      "speech": "No, but if I understand you correctly, you're saying that even if it takes the judge 6 months to decide whether it was timely, if he ends up with the conclusion that it was not timely, there would be no tolling for that 6-month period."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EISENBERG",
      "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. Now, in Pennsylvania, of course, all you have to do to be timely is file within the 1 year. And whatever you've exhausted is done. That -- I'd like to go from that into expanding more on the equitable tolling because I think that that plays in here. This defendant had two rounds. The first round was 4 years, not even just 3, but I believe closer to 4 years before there was a filing deadline in either State court or Federal court. Now, when you decide to wait -- he didn't have a filing deadline, but when you decide to wait, you take your chances. There's a rule that's even more immutable than time limits or jurisdiction, and it is that things change. When you wait, you take the risk that your evidence may change, the facts may change, the law may change. That's what happened to this defendant while he sat and did nothing. He says he was learning the law during that period. Well, then would it -- is it just 4 years? What if it had taken him 8 years or 12 years to learn the law? He had the filing deadline that came up. He never claimed that he didn't understand what it was. He could have beaten any of those filing deadlines in State or Federal court. He says, I have no incentive for delay. I'm not a capital defendant. All I wanted was a speedy resolution of my claims. But in that case, he didn't need a filing deadline to make himself come to court. The fact is that there are thousands of cases in which noncapital defendants file these kinds of late petitions, and the State courts are trying to deal with them. And this is the way that Pennsylvania chose to try to deal with the problem in State court, in its State courts, not just for capital cases, but for noncapital cases."

That's what this defendant did, although they weren't really new. They were facts that were available to him as of the -- the day of his guilty plea in 1986. He claimed that they were new.

A police officer came on to the scene while the defendant was bashing the head of the victim with a nightstick. But even in a simple case, you're going to have problems of proof, and the party with the primary problems of proof is the party with the burden of proof, and that's the prosecution. So, of course, there's going to be a problem for the prosecution, and that's why we adopt -- one of the reasons that we adopt this kind time limit. Even once the petitioner did come back to State court, though, Your Honor -- and this gets back to the questions that Justice O'Connor was raising initially - - he raised essentially the same claims. He says, well, this time around, I put them in a different guise, different facts in support of my claim about my guilty plea, different legal labels. Yes, but all in the context of -- of ineffective assistance because the only way he could get into court a second time for a second round of post-conviction review in Pennsylvania was to say that my lawyer at my first round of State post-conviction review was ineffective.

So not only did he wait 4 years when he had no filing deadline impediments to come to court, but he then raised in State court claims that he couldn't have turned into exhausted Federal claims anyway in order to add to what was available to him, to the universe of claims that were available to him after his initial round of State post-conviction review. And we're talking about equitable tolling for somebody who only has a problem because of his own inaction for 4 years and who even then spent another 3 years in State court on claims that he couldn't bring to State court, and even then, in the face of developing State law about the time bar, refused to look at it.

He had not one but two lawyers appointed for that review and he litigated it on up through the State highest court. But even when he came back in 1996, he knew the statute was there. He's never claimed he was confused by the new time bar. He says, I thought I would get some exceptions to it. But then the State court came and said, no, it's jurisdictional, no exceptions. Defendant didn't do anything. It was 1997, still 2 years before he filed in Federal court. Didn't take note of that State -- he took note of it. He acknowledges in his pleadings that he knew about it, but he decided not to go to Federal court anyway. More -- more cases come out from the State courts, even the decision in his own court -- in his own case from the State's highest court. Even when we get to July of 1999 and the State supreme court denies review on the timeliness question in his own case, the petitioner says, even then how was I supposed to know that I wasn't going to get some kind of exception to the State time bar? I didn't know that until the next month when another case came out from the State supreme court. This was the third or the fourth from the State supreme court in somebody else's case. Only then in August of 1999 did I finally know that I was time-barred, meaning I knew then that I had never been getting any tolling, that for the last 3 years, I didn't have 1 day of tolling on my Federal claims. And at that point did he then go to Federal court? Even then he didn't. Even in August 1999 when the petitioner says, finally I know that I've been out of luck for the last 3 years, that I'm 3 years late to Federal court, does he rush in then? No. He waits another 5 months after August of 1999 to finally come to Federal court and say here's my petition, here's the claims that I've been working on and that I have litigated in State court. That's not equitable tolling, Your Honor. It's not equitable tolling under the circumstances of the specific circumstances of this case, and it's not equitable tolling in general when a petitioner claims essentially I have a mistake of law, I thought that I would win, I knew there were arguments against me, I knew I might lose those arguments, but I really thought I could win, and therefore you should give me equitable tolling while I pursue them."

      "speech": "Several things. First of all, the respondent said that in the second petition Mr. Pace only presented State law, ineffective assistance of post- conviction claims, which are not Federal claims. That's absolutely not true. He presented the ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel as a waiver- overcoming mechanism not as a substantive claim for relief. The substantive claims were due process claim, ineffective assistance of counsel, and new facts which needed to be exhausted under Third Circuit exhaustion law. Second, respondent suggested and -- and the Third Circuit also suggested that State law somehow became clear in mid-December 1997 when the Superior Court, which is Pennsylvania's intermediate court, decided a case called Alcorn. Alcorn was the first case to apply the time bar. But the Third Circuit itself, after Alcorn in the Lambert case, held that the -- the statutory language of the time bar is not dispositive and you have to exhaust even if you don't meet one of the statutory exceptions because the court may fashion judicial exceptions just like they did for all the other procedural bar rules. In fact, Pennsylvania in the Lambert case, in their opposition to the certiorari petition in May of 1998, said that that's a correct statement of Pennsylvania law, that there are judicially created exceptions, including the miscarriage of justice exception which will probably apply to the time bar, just like they applied to the other statutory bars. So Alcorn did not, even if it could have, since it's an intermediate court, it did not clear up the state of the law. The law did not become clear as to the specific things that Mr. Pace alleged, which is the miscarriage of justice exception under Pennsylvania law and the illegal sentence exception, judicially created exceptions to bar, were not rejected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court until July of -- I'm sorry -- August of 1999, which is -- by that time Mr. Pace was already out of State court so those -- the law became clear in State court after he was already done litigating. The Third Circuit did not actually find the statutory language of the PCRA time bar dispositive of the exhaustion question until March of 2000. The district courts, not just Judge Giles, Chief Judge Giles' 20 years experience on the bench, not just him, lots of district courts send people back to exhaust during this same time period. State law was unclear. State law appeared to provide remedies and possible merits review. Because the State law was unclear, Third Circuit exhaustion law required petitioners like Mr. Pace to go back and exhaust. And he did exactly what the circuit law required of him. And as a matter of equity, the court cannot punish someone. A Federal court can't say, do X, and then after that person does it, say, sorry, you're out of court. It's not fair and it shouldn't happen here. As to statutory tolling, I just want to -- the -- the Court I think can just easily decide this case just by reaffirming the central holding of Artuz which is when a State court allows you to file, gives your filing judicial review, applies a bar rule on a claim-by-claim basis, that was a condition to obtaining relief on claims in the petition. It's not a condition to filing the petition itself. And if the State court eventually holds all your claims are barred, as they did in Artuz, the petition is, nevertheless, properly filed and should toll AEDPA's statutory -- under AEDPA's statutory tolling provisions. If there are no further questions."
