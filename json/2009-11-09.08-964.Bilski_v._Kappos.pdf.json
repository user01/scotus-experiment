      "speaker": "JAKES",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Circuit's rigid and narrow machine-or-transformation test for all patent-eligible methods should be reversed. The requirement that any and all methods must be either tied to a particular machine or transform specific subject matter doesn't find any basis in either the language of section 101 or anywhere in the patent statute. It's not required by this Court's precedence, and it's contrary to the established principle that section 101 should be read broadly to accommodate unforeseen advances in the useful arts. There are recognized exclusions from section 101, from that broad language, such as laws of nature, natural phenomenon, and abstract ideas. Those may not be patented. But these exceptions, which are drawn from the Court's precedent, including this Court's Diehr case, also find support in the statutory language, which says that any process must be new and useful. So the prohibition against patenting laws of nature or abstract principles -- it applies equally to all four categories of subject matter under 101, but, here, the Federal circuit has created a new test just for processes that are not found in the statute or required by this Court's decisions."

What’s wrong with that analysis, that that's what \"useful arts\" meant, that it always -- always was thought to deal with machines and inventions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAKES",
      "speech": "Certainly, \"useful arts\" encompasses industrial processes, manufacturing processes, but it has never been limited just to those types of processes. I'll admit that during the Industrial Revolution most of the inventions concerned machines and manufacturing processes. But we have cited counter-examples that show that business was also within the useful arts. It's also up to Congress to decide how to implement the patent system and the statutory scheme --"

But if it covers everything under the sun, I've never seen a case where Congress would take something out. Now, if we are relying on Congress, I guess the circuit would say, let's go narrow, and we won’t have -- you know -- since you referred to Congress, I thought I would bring that up and see what you think."

His firm wouldn't be successful if he didn't have anything that others didn't have. He thinks of a new way to organize. He thinks of a new thing to say on the telephone. He thinks of something. That's how he made his money. And your view would be -- and it's new, too, and it's useful, made him a fortune -- anything that helps any businessman succeed is patentable because we reduce it to a number of steps, explain it in general terms, file our application, granted?"

You initiate a series of transactions between commodity providers and commodity consumers. You set a fixed price at the consumer end, you set a fixed price at the other end, and that's it. I mean, I could patent a process where I do the same thing. I initiate a series of transactions with sellers. I initiate a series of transactions with buyers. I buy low and sell high. That's my patent for maximizing wealth. I don't see how that's different than your claim number 1."

In your view, I think, clearly those would be patentable, the -- the explanation of how to compile an actuarial table and -- and apply it to risk. That certainly would be patentable under your view, and it's -- it's difficult for me to think that Congress would want to -- would have wanted to give only one person the capacity to issue insurance."

Now, claim 1 may be written in broad terms, and it may some day run into the prior art, but it does require people to do actual things. I think even the Patent Office agreed that there are physical steps in our method here. And in the insurance method --"

There are actually four things in the patent law which everyone accepts. There are two that are plus and two that are minus. And the two that are plus is by giving people a monopoly, you get them to produce more. As you said, you get them to disclose. The two minuses are they charge a higher price, so people use the product less; and moreover, the act of getting permissions and having to get permission can really slow things down and destroy advance. So there’s a balance. In the 19th century, they made it one way in respect to machines. Now you're telling us: Make it today in respect to information. And if you ask me as a person how to make that balance in respect to information, if I am honest, I have to tell you: I don't know. And I don't know whether across the board or in this area or that area patent protection will do no harm or more harm than good.

The reason that Bell's method was patentable was that it operated in the realm of the physical. Bell had devised a process implemented through machines by which sound was transformed into electronic current. Current was then transmitted over a distance and transformed back into sound. Innovations as to new techniques of public speaking, new techniques of negotiations, techniques that go to the substance of what is said may be innovative. They may be valuable. They are not patent eligible because they don't deal in the realm of the physical.

First, we would fairly vigorously resist the notion that the rule that was announced by the Federal Circuit is rigid or inflexible. That is, all that the Federal Circuit has really said is that to have a patent-eligible process you have to identify some link to a machine or a transformation of matter. And the Federal Circuit has said with respect to some processes the link to the machine may be so attenuated, the machine part of the process may be such a small segment of the process as a whole, that this wouldn't be enough. But the Federal Circuit said: We leave for another day the hard questions that will arise when part of the process is machine-implemented and another part is not. And in order for the PTO and the Federal Circuit to go about the business of devising more precise rules as to when particular links to machines are sufficient to create patent eligibility, we first need to establish the -- the basic principle that some link to a machine or transformation is necessary. So I think we -- we have made the alternative argument in our brief, and I think it is a basis for affirmance. But if the Court decided the case on that basis, we would lose at least the -- the limited clarity that the Federal Circuit's opinion has provided; that is, it would still be open to people in the future to devise new contractual arrangements designed to allocate risks, new methods of teaching antitrust, and --"

If we’re unsure about that, wouldn't the safer practice be simply to say it doesn't involve business methods?"

So, to say that business methods are categorically ineligible for patent protection would eliminate new machines, including programmed computers, that are useful because of their contributions to the operation of businesses. And similarly, the court -- the Federal Circuit in other cases has held that a claim to new and innovative computer software may be held patentable as a process, as a method of accomplishing particular tasks through the use of a computer, and those might be business-related tasks.

One, transformation; how broad or narrow is that? We don't know. Many people's problems will be solved if it's either broad on the one hand or narrow in the other. Two, are you automatically patented -- in the patent statute, if you just sort of reduce this to a machine by adding a computer on at the end? They've flagged that as a problem.

    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",

The first thing is that in Diehr when you had the “e.g.” cite, it was \"e.g., transforming an article into a different\" state of -- state or thing. And I think the obvious inference is \"e.g.\" was used because the other prong of the machine-or-transformation test is use as a machine. That is, in the context of Mr. Morse's invention or Mr. Bell's invention, there is transformation of a sort, but it wouldn't naturally be characterized as transformation of matter. Those things were held to be patent eligible not because they transformed matter, but because they involved the use of a machine. And so, what the Court in Diehr said transformation of a matter or an article into a different state or thing is the clue to the patentability of a process that doesn't involve a particular machine. And the -- the type of process it had in mind was the process that was described in Corning v. Burden or the process in Cochrane v. Deener, situations in which an individual had devised a method of, in one sense -- one case, it was manufacturing flour, and in another case it was rolling puddle balls, of manufacturing items. And that person said, here is the series of steps that you have to go through, but it’s not essential that you use any particular tool or machine for each of these steps. That was why the word --"

And you say this is not -- simply the method isn't patentable because it doesn't involve a machine. But then you say but it might be if you use a computer to identify the parties that you are setting a price between and if you used a microprocessor to calculate the price. That's like saying if you use a typewriter to type out the -- the process, then it is patentable. I -- I -- that takes away everything that you spent 53 pages establishing."

The first is we described a hypothetical interactive Website in which people -- parties and counterparties could essentially find each other by the computer and could agree to terms on that basis. And in that situation, the -- the computer would be at the heart of the innovation. It would be --"

But I guess the fundamental point I would make is -- and this is really responsive to the second part of Justice Breyer's question -- I think it is both a virtue and a vice of the test that the Federal Circuit has announced and that we are advocating that it doesn't solve all the hard questions. That is, the Federal Circuit has said since this particular patent applicant didn't identify any machine or any transformation that would be necessary to the accomplishment of its method, that person is out of luck, and, therefore, it's inappropriate for us to go on to decide kind of the precise level of substantiality that a machine or transformation must play --"

It could leave open the possibility that some new and as yet unforeseen technology could necessitate the creation of an exception. But -- and the point we would also make is this seems to be a very unlikely candidate for such an exception, because the hedging method that Petitioners have -- for which they have sought a patent is in no sense different in kind from risk management techniques that have been undertaken for centuries."

First, people could dispute whether particular advances are properly regarded as technological advances, and, second, we would still have the difficult problems that the Chief Justice has referred to, where you have a process that is described as involving technology at some step along the way, and courts will still have to make the determination, is that a sufficiently substantial step to make the process, as a whole, a technological one. So I don't think that, by adopting a technological arts test, the Court would avoid the difficulties that it has appropriately identified with the machine-or-transformation test. The other thing I would say about the machine-or-transformation test is this is not a government position of recent vintage; that is, the government's brief to this Court in Gottschalk v. Benson -- or its reply brief, which was filed around 1971 -- basically said, although this Court has never announced machine or transformation of the test, that is the principle that can be abstracted from the totality of the Court's decisions."

Now, that -- what I think we were looking for was -- or at least I was -- was why that isn't so, and how you are going to later, down the road, deal with this situation of all you do is you get somebody who knows computers, and you turn every business patent into a setting of switches on a machine because there are no businesses that don't use those machines."

    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "And we would -- we would be entirely content with a ruling like that. And we would say that the claimed hedging method here is not the sort of Space Age innovation that might cause Justices to say: This is just different in kind from anything that the drafters of the patent statute could have imagined. The other point I would make about the programmed computer is, to follow up on my television and DVD example, that when you claim a machine or a manufacture, as the committee reports to the 1952 Act said, those words are broad. They encompass everything under the sun that is made by man. And so a television is indisputably a machine, even though its function is not to transform matter. It's only when you get to the term \"process\" that you are left with -- that the machine-or-transformation test kicks in. And really, the argument on the other side is: The term \"process\" in ordinary speech is extremely broad. It can literally be read to encompass any series of steps, whether or not linked to technology, whether or not linked to a machine or transformation. And the other side argues you should construe it that way in the patent statute. I guess the -- the three reasons we would say that's not so are, first, under the canon of noscitur a sociis, it’s appropriate to construe the term \"process\" in conjunction with the other terms. Those other terms are broad, but they all refer to physical objects that don't exist in nature and are created by man. And a huge array of very productive, innovative activity doesn't culminate in the creation of any new physical substance, and the word \"process\" surely was intended to add something, but it would be quite strange to construe the word \"process\" to encompass the whole range of human endeavor when the other words are limited to the creation of new things in the physical. The second thing is that when this Court in the past has explained the term \"process,\" it's always linked it to the operation of machines, as in the telephone cases and in Morse, or to the transformation of matter in ways that may not be dependent on a particular machine. And the third thing I would say is that in a sense, there’s a strong “dog that didn't bark in the night” quality to our argument; that is, even though the Court has never said in so many words that a method of allocating risk by contract is a patent-eligible process, the economic history of this country really would have been fundamentally different if it had been believed from the outset that innovations of this character could be patented and potential competitors could be foreclosed from engaging in the same method. If the Court has nothing further?"

      "speaker": "JAKES",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The Federal Circuit did announce this test as the sole test for all processes. It said it applied no matter what the process was. So we do have to face these difficult questions. I think the question can be avoided, because we don't need a rigid test of this type based on machine or transformation. The question we’re looking at and should be looking at is: Are we trying to patent an abstract idea? Now, the government has gone farther than that and really wants to exclude methods of organizing human behavior. I think that's the way they describe it. That's really the business method rejection in other words. And I think that runs contrary to section 273 of the statute, which recognized that there were business methods that could fall within the patent statute, and as a result, prior user rights should be granted. To speak briefly about the State Street Bank case, that was a type of business method that was implemented on a machine. The Federal Circuit said it didn't matter. They weren't looking at whether it was in machine form or method form. Their reasoning would have applied the same either way, and to do otherwise would be to place form over substance. And in a sense, that's what some of the transformation debate is about. It's form over substance. Why should transformation be the key? The key should be: Is it a practical application of a useful result? Our method, we believe, is a practical application. As the Patent Office has said, it does involve physical steps. I think that was one of the clues that the patent office has relied on in saying whether or not something is abstract. Since it is not an abstract method, it's rooted in the real world, we think it should be eligible to have its examination at the Patent Office and it shouldn't be thrown out on an arbitrary test."
