      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Circuit's opinion is simply wrong. Enactment of Section 6404(h) did not repeal district court and Court of Federal Claims refund jurisdiction over interest by the Internal Revenue Service. Both circuits have found that there was pre-existing jurisdiction prior to the enactment of Section 6406(h). Nothing in Section 6404(h) expressly repeals that jurisdiction, and there are many instances in the code where Congress when it does intend to expressly limit jurisdiction, will state that in the enabling statute. Reference to the tax court, specific reference to the tax court in 6404(h) was mandated unnecessary by Section 7442 and the nature of the tax court. The tax court is only given jurisdiction over those matters where it is specifically set out in the tax code. And the established framework of pay and sue jurisdiction in the district courts and prepayment jurisdiction in the tax court is a well established framework for tax litigation. That has been accepted and enunciated by this Court as far back as the Flora opinions. It's a well established pattern of duality of jurisdiction in the two forums."

      "speaker": "REDDING",
      "speech": "Not with respect to abatement of interest, Your Honor, but as a general basis. The availability of a prepayment forum that was originally enacted to be complementary to the ability to pay and sue in order to protect smaller taxpayers, and avoid the hardships faced by having to pay in full before having access to refund jurisdiction, and in fact perhaps to avoid bankruptcy. That is completely consistent with the way this section is enacted. Section 6404(h) even includes the limitation that only taxpayers with a net worth below $2 million or corporations below $7 million have prepayment access to the tax court. And abatement by itself is generally a prepayment remedy."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "That's a -- on that point, Mr. Redding, it seems odd that given this tripartite system, Congress would want only the tax court to be restricted in the people who could claim the abatement, the net worth test applicable in the tax court on your theory, if there is authority in the claims court and in the district courts, they're not limited to the net worth restrictions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REDDING",
      "speech": "That is correct, Your Honor, but I do believe that it is consistent with the intent of the formation of the tax court to provide a prepayment forum to especially avoid hardship and the potential even of bankruptcy. It's very consistent with that pattern to say that the larger taxpayer can afford to pay the tax and sue, whereas the smaller taxpayer may be in greater need of a prepayment forum. It's also consistent with imposing the very short limitation period for bringing an action in the tax court, because there the government has a very vested interest in being able to proceed with collection of the tax."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

    {
      "speaker": "REDDING",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I can't speak to Congress's reasoning behind that but I can understand the logic behind saying we're going to create a special prepayment remedy that allows the smaller taxpayer an expedited means of resolving these issues without having to first pay it and sue, whereas the larger taxpayer is not put into a hardship position, is not inconvenienced as bad by having to follow the old well established procedures of pay and sue. And I will note that 6404(h) does not apply only to 6404(e)(1), which is the subsection we're coming under. 6404(h) applies to all of the abatement grounds under Section 6404. And if we were to repeal jurisdiction in the district court and the Court of Federal Claims over all of those provisions, then we would be completely taking away a remedy that has been there all along to the larger taxpayers. But to create a new remedy that is consistent with the pattern that allows a small taxpayer access to a prepayment forum, I think is completely consistent with the entire history of this court. This court meaning the tax court. And its purpose. In evaluating two statutes that appear to either conflict or overlap, I think it is, in reviewing whatever doctrine you call it, whatever canon you call it of interpretation, it appears to me that what this Court has always done is to look to see if the two statutes can be harmonized rather than seeing if one supersedes the other. And here considering the extension of prepayment jurisdiction to the tax court merely an additional form of prepayment jurisdiction being granted to the tax court is completely consistent with the long-standing pattern of pay and sue jurisdiction in the district courts, prepayment jurisdiction in the tax court - -"

If you qualified under (e)(2) there would have been no impediment to bringing that as a refund action because there was a clearly established standard. The (e)(2) provision is a must standard. Now, under 6404(h) if it is exclusive over abatement jurisdiction, then any taxpayer who would have had access to the courts, for example for an (e)(2) abatement case, unless they are a small taxpayer they will be completely denied any remedy whatsoever."

A prepayment forum which delays the collection of the tax to the Government, you know, the Government has a special interest there in restricting access to that relief so that it can proceed with collection.

There are also other subsections - - subsections under 6404 which are made provisions in other 6404 subsections, which are must provisions. There are about five different subsections under 6404 that provide for interest abatement. Again, I come back to the long-established pattern of having prepayment jurisdiction in the tax court and postpayment refund jurisdiction in the district courts and Court of Federal Claims. It's a well established system, and adding a new prepayment form of relief into the tax court in no way should be implied to be a repeal of the long established refund - - pay and sue refund jurisdiction that normally exists."

The taxpayer at that time doesn't even have a notice of what the adjustments are going to be, let alone what his tax liability is. In a partnership case, the partnership level determinations are made at the partnership level. The Government then, without any further notice to the taxpayer, is free to make the computation of the taxpayer's liability and send him a bill.

Basically, Your Honor, I believe that, I believe that this case really rests on what I think the Fifth Circuit summarized quite well when it says that it makes more sense in this case to simply believe the Congress, quote, \"simply intended\" -- \"simply chose to extend concurrent jurisdiction to the tax court over a certain class of claims.\" And that's all it really has done here. It has implemented and expanded the conventional jurisdiction of the tax court as a prepayment forum before you do have to pay the liability to resolve a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. There is no reason, I don't believe, to see this as a major departure from the existing structure of pay and sue jurisdiction versus prepayment jurisdiction. This is just a well established plan that's been in the code for many, many years. Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court has no other questions I would reserve my remaining time for rebuttal."

The language, structure and history of the interest abatement review statute supports the court of appeals' decision as to principles of sovereign immunity. Under Petitioner's theory the specific restrictions on the remedy that Congress created may be avoided by the simple expedient of filing a challenge in another forum. Nothing in the interest abatement review statute or this Court's precedent permits that result. The place to start is the language of the interest abatement review statute. Section 6404(h) provides the tax court shall have jurisdiction over an interest abatement action brought by taxpayers who meet the net worth limitations set out in another part of the code and who file their claim within 180 days of the Secretary's mailing of a final determination not to abate interest."

We would first look to the statutory language of Section 6404(e)(1) and that provision provides that the Secretary may abate interest when there is an error or delay committed by an IRS employee in the performance of a ministerial act, and that \"may\" language contrasts with other provisions that have mandatory language that requires the Secretary to abate.

      "speaker": "MARCUS",
      "speech": "Well I think some cases - - there is some case law that has said that when there is an error of law committed by a lower court that can constitute an abuse of discretion. But in our view again it's not the natural reading of the standard that Congress put in. And also, if you look at the legislative history, Justice Kennedy, you'll see that Congress was focused on the absence of a judicial remedy with respect to determinations by the Secretary that involved an exercise in discretion."

They would just say there's no standard to apply, so it's committed to agency discretion by law. Then all of a sudden 6404(h) comes along and gives you a standard, so that removes that objection. What's wrong with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARCUS",
      "speech": "I think that's -- with respect, I think the Fifth Circuit's reasoning is too clever by half. The Fifth Circuit basically extracted one piece of Section 6404(h)'s integrated whole and held that there now is a refund cause of action that's not subject to the specific restrictions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Well, that's because of the way that Congress enacted the language. It doesn't say that the tax court and only the tax court shall have jurisdiction. It says the tax court shall have jurisdiction. That is a, in many respects a preferred forum and they're saying you can bring it there as well, but it doesn't take away the jurisdiction that the prior courts had recognized."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARCUS",

If Congress would have wanted to reverse those decisions that had said there's no cause, no refund cause of action for interest abatement, they could have easily referenced the refund statute and said there is a refund action available. They also could have specified that the Court of Federal Claims or the district courts can exercise jurisdiction over interest abatement issues."

      "speech": "I don't think, I don't think it's anomalous. I think if you consider the concept of interest under the tax code, the way it works under the tax code is interest accrues on an unpaid tax liability from the time the tax is due until the time the tax is paid. So the amount of underpayment is the amount of taxpayer is borrowing from the Government. The interest that accrues on that underpayment is not a penalty; it's just a charge basically for the time value of money."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "That's what I thought, too. But then your friend explained that in the initial bill is where the interest is contained in a lot of these cases and in this case in particular. So it's not as if you have the opportunity to pay it in advance to stop the accrual of interest. Just you get the bill and you find out, you know, you owe a 1,000 dollars and 300 of it is interest."

    {
      "speaker": "MARCUS",
      "speech": "I don't think that's correct, Your Honor. The way this is -- the interest that's abatable is, a taxpayer is in full control of whether that interest runs or not. If the taxpayer pays his full tax liability on time, interest doesn't accrue, so there's no interest to abate."

This abatable interest doesn't accrue until the taxpayer receives notice from the IRS that there is a problem with the return.

Do you think there wouldn't be a constitutional problem there? Remember, they have the same claim for the same amount, with the same precise strength of their argument.

It refers to a hearing in March 1995. And if you read through that, you can see where that concern for the - - for average taxpayers and lower net worth taxpayers came from. Nothing in Section 6404(h) gives rise to an inference that Congress intended to establish additional remedies in the district court and Court of Federal Claims. To the contrary, this Court has consistently applied the rule that when Congress creates a specific remedy, it intends that remedy to be exclusive. That rule is fully applicable here. Otherwise, the specific restrictions Congress imposed on the remedy could be defeated by bringing the claim in a different forum."

And there's another case where there's an administrative determination, it doesn't go to the underlying substantive tax liability."

And so this isn't as if we're looking at something that says the tax court has jurisdiction and trying to use that as a wedge to get other jurisdiction. There's already a grant of jurisdiction. The problem was, there was no standard of review for these may abate claims, and all of a sudden we find in this provision there is a standard of review, it's abuse of discretion, and that fills the void. Why can't they just use that?"

That's what the courts held, and Congress responded to that, not by saying you do have a legally entitlement to this through a refund action, which they easily could have said if they wanted to reject those prior decisions, but instead they created a limited remedy in the tax court. I don't see how you can read that limited remedy in the tax court to give rise to a broader remedy that doesn't have those restrictions that Congress imposed on the tax court remedy. So it should be -- I think 6404(h) should be read as an integrated whole and you can't just extract one piece and then bring that over, as the Fifth Circuit said, to apply to a refund action. I don't think that's the proper way to interpret the."

There's no such thing. It is totally committed to agency discretion. It's only other decisions that are not committed to agency discretion by law where you -- where the discretion can be abused.

The other, the other anomaly the Fifth Circuit identified was the taxpayer, the taxpayer seeking a refund having to split off his claims. This too is not a significant anomaly. The vast majority of taxpayers seek redetermination of their tax liability in the tax court and those taxpayers must split their claims because the interest abatement claim doesn't ripen until the taxpayer's underlying liability has been assessed. Moreover, the interest abatement question is distinct from the taxpayer's underlying liability."

I will note that there are several hundred cases below waiting the outcome of this case. As in the Cramer and Weiner opinions that came out of the Fifth Circuit, the Court can note that there are claims for interest abatement, abatement not under 6404, but that interest was overcharged by applying the penalty rate of interest. There is a refund claim for the penalty portion of the interest. There is also a refund claim that the tax was assessed outside the statute of limitations; that's clearly a refund claim. None of those claims would be encompassed under 6404(h). These taxpayers would have had to have completely split their claims, asked for an interest abatement in the tax court for abuse of discretion on 6404(e)(1)."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REDDING",
      "speech": "That's only relatively true to 6404(e)(1), Your Honor. But I will note that under 6404(a), where cases are now coming out of the tax court for the first time, because it now has jurisdiction under (h), it provides authority for the Commissioner to abate interest where the IRS has erroneously or illegally assessed the tax liability after the statute of limitations runs or whether it's simply an erroneous assessment. Those claims have nothing to do with discretion, and they are not really just ancillary to the tax liability; they arise out of the substantive challenge to the liability itself. The Woodrall case that has come out, which is the, I think is the first of the 6404(a) cases, was an assertion that the interest had been charged after the tax had been paid. Now that's not a discretionary abatement; that's an illegal assessment of interest and that's a 6404(h) claim now. Previously it would have been strictly a refund claim under 16 -- under 1346. I would also note that in terms of the being able to pay it to cut off the interest accrual, that in these cases, these cases that are before the Court, the F quality -- the document the Government first sent out proposing adjustments to the partnership level, if you had computed the liability based on what the Government's position was, the ultimate tax liability including interest to any point in time would have been at least three times the amount that results from the tax court decision. It's just ludicrous to say that the taxpayer should be expected to take whatever the Government's proposed adjustments are, compute what his maximum liability may be, and pay it in advance or post a bond in advance in order to cut off the interest accrual. That argument just doesn't -- in my mind does not fly, Your Honor. This, this Court in Bob Jones University did address the pay and sue versus prepayment jurisdiction issue in terms of constitutionality and due process. And, and basically said that as long as there is a pay and sue remedy available, the taxpayer has no due process rights to a prepayment remedy, but that the Court might have come down differently had there been no remedy available in terms of pay and sue. I would also note that both the tax court, the district courts, the Court of Federal Claims and the appellate courts have long reviewed other discretionary acts within the tax code by the Commissioner where no standard is set forth on an abuse of discretion standard, such as the authorization of the Commissioner to abate certain penalties where the taxpayer has sought an independent appraisal on the overvaluation penalty under 6659. Those cases have been reviewed for years by the tax court and by the district courts in refund cases on an abuse of discretion standard. It is the Federal common law standard for reviewing an abuse of discretion. The determinations in Horton and Selman Holmes are unique in holding that it's totally discretionary. Thank you, Your Honor."
