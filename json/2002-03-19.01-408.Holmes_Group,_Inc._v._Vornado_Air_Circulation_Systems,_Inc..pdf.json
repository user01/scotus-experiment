      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns how far the Federal Circuit can properly go in taking jurisdiction to the exclusion of the regional circuits. In its recent construction of its appellate jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit has effectively taken the position that the defendant's answer containing a patent counterclaim acts like a super removal petition. The Federal Circuit says that if the defendant in a non- patent suit files an answer that includes a patent counterclaim, that pleading automatically removes the plaintiff's non-patent suits from regional circuit jurisdiction and transfers it to Federal Circuit jurisdiction. According to the respondent, that same pleading automatically has the effect of changing the substantive law governing non-patent claims in the plaintiff's non- patent suit from regional circuit to Federal Circuit law, and the decision below demonstrates that these principles apply even when a judgment is entered which doesn't address patent law at all. The petitioner respectfully submits that the decision below is antithetical to what the Congress had in mind when it established the Federal Circuit."

Right then and there the Court was faced with the question, how do we know if a case properly belongs in the Federal Circuit? And the Court held, we know that because Congress has told us the answer. What Congress said is, cases fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit in the same way that they are said to arise under Federal law for purposes of general Federal question jurisdiction under 1331. The cases are legion which say that what a defendant pleads in its answer, whether it's an affirmative defense or a counterclaim, is irrelevant to whether a case falls within the original arising under jurisdiction of the Federal court."

And it seems to me that you can't just say that what arising under means in the original jurisdiction context it necessarily means when we're talking about an exclusive appellate forum for a case that's colored Federal totally.

In footnote 2 of Christianson, the Court expressly recited maybe our arising under jurisprudence is irrelevant in this case since, after all, we're only deciding whether the Seventh Circuit or the Federal Circuit should decide this antitrust case in which the district court invalidated a number of patents. And citing the legislative history that the Congress chose, for better or for worse, to make the referent of Federal Circuit jurisdiction the same as the referent of district court jurisdiction under 1331 and 1338, under the page and in the passage that I just read, this Court I believe specifically considered and decided that notwithstanding that the outcome in this type of case is simply which of two Federal courts of appeals will hear a case. Nevertheless, for better or for worse, Congress has decided that the referent of Federal Circuit jurisdiction is the same."

A couple of years later, the Federal Circuit looked at the issue again in Aerojet and it wrote an opinion saying these are different. In one case we were dealing with a defense, an issue, a question, and in another case, we've got a claim. And for purposes of which court of appeals it goes to, maybe the court is -- in Aerojet is saying we have to qualify Christianson's reasoning if not -- not its result."

      "speaker": "DABNEY",

The Aerojet case said that the plaintiff in that case had fully exhausted his right to choose his court and to choose his law because he had access to a district court forum. This Court -- this case demonstrates how that rationale of Aerojet is mischievous and dangerous and incorrect. Since Aerojet in 1989, there has been a sea change in the Federal Circuit's approach to what law it chooses to apply in cases such as this, and it is the Federal Circuit's choice of law approach, adopted in the late 1990's, which has given birth to this entire action."

And the Federal Circuit, being a co-equal court of appeals, is fully entitled, I suppose, to fashion its own liability rules and apply them even to claims over which it has only nonexclusive or pendent jurisdiction. But by doing that, it has given rise to great incentives, which the respondent has attempted to avail itself of in this case, to get a case into the Federal Circuit and take advantage of the different law of the Federal Circuit on a non- patent claim. So, I would suggest to Your Honor that this Court has never wavered from the idea that a person who comes to court seeking relief -- there's a lot of uncertainty in litigation. I'm called upon to advise clients all the time whether they should or should not bring suit, where they should bring suit, how they should bring suit. The one thing this Court has said, whatever else is uncertain in litigation, the one thing you know is, number one, if you bring a suit, you have -- you are absolute master to decide what law you're going to rely on in your complaint. That's your claim. If I specify the law of California in my complaint, that's my choice.

And the Federal Circuit in that case was considering whether or not a plaintiff could properly claim trade dress protection for the shape a boat trailer winch post.

      "speech": "I don't know that the legal significance of the source of a district court's power to act in that situation has ever been a subject on which any legal consequences followed so that the body of law that developed on that would have any precedential significance in this situation. The fact -- the critical distinction between this situation and the one Your Honor is positing is that in the situations Your Honor is talking about, you're not talking about a plaintiff who had a well-pleaded complaint who he prevailed on being ousted of his chosen court and forum. I don't believe that the appropriate disposition of a counterclaim in that situation sheds any light on what should happen to a plaintiff who files suit under non-patent law and wins, and the plaintiff doesn't seek relief under Federal patent law. The plaintiff doesn't care what the defendant does with other claims the defendant has. If the respondent wants to have a patent counterclaim, go to the Federal court or litigate a Federal patent counterclaim in the International Trade Commission, more power to it. This suit was brought to get preliminary injunctive relief against threatened, imminent, irreparable harm to the plaintiff's business which was granted. There was a preliminary injunction that was issued in January of 2000, which remains in effect to this day upon the posting of a $100,000 bond. The plaintiff had every right and entitlement to go into court, to plead his claim in the way that the plaintiff thought would best accomplish the plaintiff's objectives. That is a prerogative which this Court has said over and over and over again is the plaintiff's right. No well-counseled plaintiff could possibly file a lawsuit without thinking what court is most likely to give me the relief that I'm seeking. That's not forum shopping. That's good lawyering. And that's what happened in this case."

Would it really have mattered in Lear v. Adkins if the defendant in that case hadn't just said, the contract is invalid because the patent is no good and there's no consideration, if it had filed a counterclaim, as was done in Cardinal Chemical and said, I want a declaratory judgment that the patent isn't valid? No legal consequence should follow from that.

What was it understood to mean when it spoke of a claim arising under any act of Congress relating to copyrights and trademarks? And that's a different question. And when you have a long history known to every first-year law student that a case arises under a certain law, if the well-pleaded complaint invokes that law and does not arise under that law if -- if a counterclaim invokes it, I find it hard to believe that anyone would interpret the statute, written with that magic language, in any other way. Now, it -- it might well be the case, as you argue, that another disposition is more sensible for the Federal Circuit. But we have to deal here with what Congress said, and the -- and the whole issue is whether a claim arising under an act of Congress isn't magic language that -- that the whole legal community has known for many years, which means you have to have a well- pleaded complaint invoking it."

If -- if you look at the second point of Chief -- Chief Judge Markey in Aerojet, he was -- he was taking a -- a look at claims. And a patent claim, as Justice O'Connor pointed out earlier, has its own separate, independent jurisdictional base under 1338. Once you find that a patent claim comes in under 1338 with its own jurisdictional basis, under 1295 that is an appeal- directing mechanism that Congress put into place. And -- and I think that if you go again to Aerojet, as Chief Judge Markey pointed out in his first reason for why the patent counterclaim should be considered arising under and give appellate jurisdiction, had that counterclaim been filed as a complaint, there's no question that -- that Federal Circuit jurisdiction would have been invoked."

And -- and we're not talking about that. This Court does not need to, I think, even go there. We're talking about a situation where you have a Federal question that has been properly presented in a Federal court. Original jurisdiction has been applied. A -- a patent counterclaim comes in that has its own separate jurisdictional base under 1338. The question then is, from an appellate standpoint, has Congress set up and dictated an appellate-directing mechanism with 1295? And I think they have. And they recognized when they said, as long as jurisdiction was based in whole or in part under 1338, that not all of the case would have to be patent cases. It could be part of it. And once you have the nexus between a district court having original jurisdiction under 1338, 1295 directs that that appeal -- for the patent cases, 1295 directs that appeal should go to the Federal Circuit. I -- I think the basic purpose of -- of the well-pleaded complaint rule was -- was to avoid the -- the sort of State/Federal conflicts. Since that's not here, then there is -- is no reason to say that there should be a compelled disregard of -- of counterclaims.

But I mean, the claim is made that the Federal Circuit is not doing that."

      "speaker": "GOWDEY",
      "speech": "Well, I think the Federal Circuit is making an attempt to look at its -- its historical base for decisions with respect to those issues that relate to, in effect, patent law issues. Now, the way I read cases coming from the Federal Circuit, they're making an attempt to apply law of their own where they find either there -- there is conflict or where there has not been a well- grounded set of policies or law to decide an issue. Where the regional circuit has laws that are not affecting patents, my reading is the Federal Circuit is applying regional circuit law in an appropriate way as they see fit from panel to panel."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I understand at the time Aerojet was decided, they did that. But I thought there was a recent -- in the last year or 2, they had taken a different view and were applying their own law as opposed to the Tenth Circuit law in this case on the non-patent law issues."

      "speaker": "GOWDEY",

To that extent, they certainly were looking at new law and saying where there is an interaction of laws and holdings with respect to patent issues, that that is an area that they -- they can and perhaps should get into."

      "speech": "Okay. So, now the trial judge has to say, well, there may be two circuits involved here. One is my own circuit and it's not related, and so the Federal Circuit won't control, but if it's somehow related to the patent claim, then the Federal Circuit would -- so, this -- this is a further metaphysical exercise. This -- this is great for the legal profession actually."

    {
      "speaker": "GOWDEY",
      "speech": "It keeps all well employed, Your Honor. I -- I think that where -- where there are issues that relate to patent law, certainly they -- they will be looking to Federal Circuit precedent to help them. Where there are non-patent law issues, it's the regional circuit law that can and should control. And -- and I think that as the court develops in time, there will be -- there will be a larger body of law that -- that will help district circuit judges in that regard. As respects this case, however, where -- where we have a patent counterclaim, I think the Aerojet decision and looking at what went on before Christian -- Christianson, looking at -- at the Christianson decision itself and the analysis that that court did with Chief Judge Markey speaking for the whole court en banc, very carefully and thoughtfully gives a legitimate basis for why a Federal Circuit should have jurisdiction over cases where there is a well-pleaded compulsory counterclaim at the district court level. Chief Judge Markey also noted at 895 F.2d at 742, in all events, the Supreme Court did hold in Christianson or in any other case that for all cases and circumstances only the complaint and never a counterclaim can serve as the basis of district court jurisdiction. And under section 1295, the basis of district court jurisdiction is for this Court an appeal-directing mechanism. And I think that's where 1295 really is -- is important and the interconnection with -- with 1338. If there are no other -- no other questions, I thank the Court."

      "speech": "In response to your question, Mr. Justice Kennedy, there is no difference between different interpretation and adaptation. The respondent's position would call for this Court to retreat from Christianson and to adopt some special interpretation of arising under unique to 1338(a) that deviates from the arising under language as it was clearly adopted by Congress in 1295. Secondly, with regard to the question of -- of Federal Circuit choice of law, what Mr. Gowdey stood here -- I just would call -- call Your Honors' attention to page 94a of the joint appendix which is the district court's opinion in this case in which the district court says, Vornado -- that's the respondent -- contends that this change in the law exception is met because in Midwest Industries, the Federal Circuit expressly rejected the Tenth Circuit's Vornado I holding, ruling instead that a claim for trade dress protection was not barred by the fact that a product configuration has been claimed as a significant inventive element of the patent. As part of its ruling in that case, the Federal Circuit abandoned its prior practice of applying regional circuit law on questions involving the relationship between patent law and other Federal law rights and said, quote, henceforth, we will apply our own law to such questions. There is no doubt whatever that the Federal Circuit has recently and radically changed how it adjudicates trade dress claims, and it was the opportunity to try to take advantage of the -- of the Federal Circuit's view of trade dress protection which was before the Court in the TrafFix case, and rejected by the Court in the TrafFix case, which drove the case that's currently before the Court, which isn't to say that the Federal Circuit can't do that. But by doing that, whatever legitimacy could have been before it, even as a matter of common sense, Justice Scalia, in derogation of clearly expressed congressional intent, in 1989, the Federal Circuit has done a 180 degree U-turn in its approach to its choice of law in these matters. And therefore, the -- a critical underpinning of the Aerojet principle has been completely wiped out."
