These laws have been formulated by the Florida legislature pursuant to an express delegation of authority, to wit, by the United States Constitution. The election code that the Florida legislature developed conformed to Title 3, Section 5 of the United States Code. That provision invites states to devise rules in advance of an election, to govern the counting of votes and the settling of election controversy."

That is to say that if the rules are complied with, if disputes are resolved according to the rules that are set forth, then not only will the electors chosen by the voters in that state be given conclusive effect at the time they are counted by Congress but we will not have the controversy, dispute and chaos that's been taking place in Florida."

The state legislature adopted the code that the Section 5 of Article 3 of Title 3 invited it to do. The state supreme court, which had no right under the Constitution, but I can't divorce the constitutional provision from Section 5, then overturned the plan that the state enacted through its legislature to make sure that what happened down in Florida was not going to happen.

The Florida Supreme Court said, there's the deadline, and that conflicts with another provision of this law, the provision that says there shall be under certain circumstances recounts, and then there's a rather detailed description of the process that's necessary, the time line for when you can ask the recount is on the 6th day."

The Florida Supreme Court said, it's right in its opinion, there's two conflicts, and the first one they mention straight out on page 21A of your appendix, is that there has to be a reconciliation between this, yes, there can be recounts and, yes, there's a deadline. So they are trying to reconcile two provisions."

      "speaker": "OLSON",

Under certain circumstances after the sampling part of that process is taken, if it's taken in the county canvassing board's discretion, then under certain circumstances it's supposed to go forward with a more fulsome process, but the legislature being fully aware of the recount provisions and the importance of -- this ties in with the protest period for the election, which overlaps the recount provisions, and the contest provision for the election, and the fact that all of this has to be done in the context of a presidential election. Under any other kind of election, these things wouldn't be nearly as important, but we have very important timetables, and as this Court has said a presidential election is so important to the rest of the nation, and there is such high Federal interest in accomplishing these things in the right way, what the Florida legislature did is balance the protest period, the recount period with the contest period, and state that there shall be certain deadlines before which certain things need to be done and after which, so what those two statutes say is that there may be a recount, but that there shall be compliance with the time deadline. It also says that --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But that's something that one can certainly argue. My problem is, one could also argue what the Florida Supreme Court said, and I do not know of any case where we have impugned a state supreme court the way you are doing in this case.

We submit this is one. What the Florida Supreme --"

      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "Yes, but then the Court has also said, then we go on to see the extent to which what the state court did, as we cited in the Lindsey case, for example, in the ex post facto context, we go on to see what the import of that is in connection with the Federal right.

It doesn't -- she doesn't much anymore because what has happened -- and I would like to finish that one point, that the Florida Supreme Court said we are not going to be bound by technical statutory requirements or what the supreme court called hyper-technical statutory requirements. Instead, we are going to resort to the will of the people, the will of the electorate, the will of the voters, so to speak, and we are going to -- because we can't rewrite the statute, but we are going to partially rewrite the statute, we are going to resort to our equitable powers. So what -- and among the things that the court did, and there are a range of them, as I have indicated, they took away the discretion of the Secretary and instructed her to accept these manual recount returns."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I don't read their opinion that way, Mr. Olson. It seems to me that the portion of their opinion dealing with statutory construction ends with a conclusion that the Secretary has discretion.

It was one of the longest debates that took place during the formation of the Constitution. Where should this power be lodged, in the Federal legislature, in the state legislature, at the ballot booth or what. The one thing that was discussed and rejected by virtually everyone is that the power to select the manner in which electors would be appointed would be in the state judiciary, and we quote -- in the state judiciary. That was rejected. The notion that it would be vested in the state judiciary was something that was rejected, and what the framers decided to do is to vest it in the state legislature and vested that authority under Article II, not just in the state, but the legislature."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "All right. Mr. Olson, let's assume that it did that, for the sake of argument. I want to go back to the issue that the Chief Justice raised a little while ago, and I'd like you to comment on this line of reasoning. You've got Section 5. Congress in the statute seems to have gone to great lengths to provide what to do in the situation that you are describing, accepting your view of the case. Section 5, it says if you do certain things within certain times, the conclusion that you draw is going to be conclusive upon the Congress. In Section 15, it sets out in fact an elaborate set of contingencies about what the Congress is supposed to do and can do if there is a dispute as to whether a given set of procedures in the state have conformed to Section 5. Section 15 refers to regularity. It refers to legality and illegality. It looks to me as though at least at this stage of the proceedings, Congress has said if there is a question about whether this if-then provision in Section 5, construing Article II, has been satisfied, then this is the decisional tree for the Congress to follow in deciding what to do about it and in resolving challenges. It looks to me as though at this stage of the game, the statute has committed the determination of the issues that you raise and the consequences to follow from them to the Congress. Why should the Court, why should the Federal judiciary be interfering in what seems to be a very carefully thought out scheme for determining what happens if you are right?"

The record shows very clearly that there was no dispute that there were any problems with voting machines or any other tabulation problems with voting machines. It was simply when they went through the process of what is, Justice Ginsburg, a discretionary right to a manual recount, not a mandatory one, when they went into that and did the test, each of those canvassing boards did not find any problem with a mechanical problem.

That was the issue so that the solution to that was not the machines, even when they're operating properly would not read these ballots, so what was left of the county canvassing boards then was to do the full manual recount, and the language of that statute again says they shall do a full manual recount in those circumstances."

Now, the question for Congress, I suppose, would be, although I don't see how this Court could get into that question at this stage, but the question would be, is a particular change extending a deadline for exigent circumstances because a recount has been authorized, a change in the judicial or methods of procedures for resolving the contest."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Tribe, I don't -- I don't agree with that. I don't -- I don't think that the Florida Supreme Court used the Florida Constitution as a tool of interpretation of this statute. If you look at its opinion, it's separated into, into various sections, issues; IV, legal opinion of Division of Elections; V, the applicable law; VI, statutory ambiguity; and that's -- and VII, legislative intent. That's the section where they construe the statute in view of these ambiguities and so forth. That section concludes, under this statutory scheme, the county canvassing boards are required to submit their returns to the department by 5 p.m. of the seventh day following the election. The statutes make no provision for exceptions following a manual recount. If a board fails to meet the deadline, the secretary is not required to ignore the county's returns, but rather is permitted to ignore the returns within the parameters of this statutory scheme. So what the statutory interpretation gives you is a firm termination date of December 7th and discretion in the secretary. The opinion continues, VIII, the right to vote. The text of our Florida Constitution begins with a declaration of rights. And it goes on to say that to the extent the legislature may enact laws regulating the electoral process, those laws are valid only if they impose no \"unreasonable or unnecessary\" restraints on the right of suffrage contained in the Constitution. In other words, I read the Florida court's opinion as quite clearly saying, having determined what the legislative intent was, we find that our state constitution trumps that legislative intent. I don't think there is any other way to read it, and that is, that is a real problem, it seems to me, under Article II, because in fact there is no right of suffrage under, under Article II. There is a right of suffrage in voting for the legislature but Article II makes it very clear that the legislature can itself appoint the electors."

That would be a totally crazy provision. As this opinion understands, if you were not to reach a reconciliation of this sort, this result was overdetermined under Florida law.

I do think, also, that some people reasonably could argue the contrary, and I guess I think that this language should be interpreted whether by a court or by Congress in a way that gives some deference to the state government and its organs, and I think any degree of deference here is inconsistent with saying that there's been a Federal violation, especially when -- I want to remind us all about the context.

Now, if that's the case and if it's therefore assumed that the legislature is surrounded with both executive and judicial authority, then a decision by the legislature to completely exclude the judiciary from any possible role, the state judiciary, might be inconsistent with the underlying meaning of Article II itself."

And because of that, these provisions of the statute which are very much quintessentially legislative, the timetables that are involved in this statute, particularly the November 14th deadline, is a part of a composite package. There is one week for a protest and certain recounts to the extent that they can be done and there are four weeks for contests. When the Florida Supreme Court truncated, when the Florida Supreme Court expanded the protest period from 7 days to 19 days, it necessarily limited the contest period to a shorter period of time. It changed the discretion. It allowed certain things to occur that couldn't have occurred and it justifies all of those things on the grounds that the Florida Supreme Court, the Florida Constitution trumps those legislative concerns, and that's why it said we are not going to be dissuaded by hypertechnical statutory considerations. So the court was doing what this Court said in the McPherson vs. Blacker case that it cannot do, allow itself to insert itself or the Florida Constitution over what is required by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution. It also seems to me quite evident in response to what Justice Kennedy was asking earlier, that there was concern about the Federal statutory provision, the language to which I think Justice Kennedy was referring is on page 32-A of the appendix to the petition from the court's decision, and there is a footnote there that does refer to reference to 3 U.S.C. 1 through 10, which of course includes Section 5, and it says so in conjunction with the statement that the exercise of the discretion by the secretary of state could not be done in such a way that would preclude Florida voters from participating fully in the Federal electoral process. The court was assuming, it seems to me, that it did not, was not conflict -- the decision that it was rendering was not going to cause a conflict with the Federal statutory scheme, and it was, we submit, in error in that regard. So the -- the -- to sum up with respect to this, the Florida Supreme Court radically changed the legislative scheme because it thought it could do so under the Florida Constitution. By doing so, it acted inconsistently with Article II of the Constitution, and inconsistently with Section 5 of Title III, and it has brought about precisely the circumstances that Section 5 of Section 3, Title III, was designed to avoid."
