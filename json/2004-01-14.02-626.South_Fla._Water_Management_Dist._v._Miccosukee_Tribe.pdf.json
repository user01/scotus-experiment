    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress in the Clean Water Act provided that a section 402 permit is required for an addition of pollutants from a point source to navigable waters. Now, the South Florida Water Management District concedes that the S-9 pump, through which it conveys navigable waters from a canal to a water conservation area, is a confined, discrete, discernible conveyance, and we agree that the water in the C-11 canal contains pollution which enters that water from a wide variety of point and non-point sources. What we do say is that our pumps do not add pollutants to navigable waters. There is no addition of pollutants to navigable waters when navigable waters are simply moved around, which occurs all the time every day all around the country as public water management agencies allocate and transfer the navigable waters to serve beneficial public purposes."

There are exceedances, phosphorus exceedances, from time to time, but those are built into the permit.

If I accept your side of it, it seems to me I live -- leave the EPA without any power to deal with what I just called the filthy river problem, or at least not the -- I'm not trying to be tricky in my words. I -- I understand they have other authority and so forth. But there is a filthy river problem if I take your side of it. And if I take their -- if I take your side of it, that is some kind of a problem. You can explain to me in 1 second why it's no problem whatsoever. I'd like to hear that. I want to say the opposite thing. Your problem that you raise, if I take their side, is suddenly everybody in the California water project, which is huge, central valley irrigation, has to run off and get permits, and that too is a big problem. So it sounds to me that that second problem could be dealt with by EPA through rules that would, in effect, not make them come in because they'd automatically get permits in certain circumstances. But if I take your side of it, the opposite filthy river problem, there's nothing to be done."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "Your premise is incorrect, Justice Breyer. Of course, moving filthy water to a pristine water is a problem. I've already explained that it's addressed and addressed comprehensively and rigorously at the State level, as Congress contemplated in the statute through the water quality standards and TMDL's. But beyond that, it is simply wrong to say that the Federal Government lacks power in these cases. First of all, it has broad power under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act to protect navigability, and that -- that provision also includes power for the Corps to engage in a broad public interest review whenever the course of a waterway is changed. Second, there are other provisions that deal with emergency type situations. If public health or welfare, for example, is implicated, then section 504 of the statute gives EPA broad powers to go into court and get a restraining order not just for the discharge of pollutants, but much more broadly than that."

The Corps has built a new set of pumps right next to the S-9 that is intended to intercept that cleaner seepage water, and it will pump that seepage water right back into the WCA before it is mixed with the more polluted waters from the C-11 basin. So that is one part of the effort. It is to get the seepage water back into the water conservation area before it mixes with more polluted water."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "And the solution to that problem is that with the Corps and the task force and the EPA, a number of huge storage basins are being built. These require, obviously, buying a lot of land, putting together the land necessary for these STA's. But the -- the purpose of the plans under CERP is to stop as much water as possible getting from the C-11 to the water conservation area. And so storing as much water as possible in these basins will allow the phosphorus and other pollutants to settle out, and so water that is -- and will also reduce the total amount of water that needs to be sent back into the conservation area. The combination of these new pumps getting the -- the cleaner water back into the -- into the conservation area and the storage basins, which will reduce the amount of flow and allow the pollutants to -- to seep down, is -- is the essential way in which under CERP the problem of the phosphorus will be addressed. No one disputes -- and the district least of all disputes -- that cleaning up the Everglades and reducing the amount of phosphorus that gets into the water conservation area which, in turn, feeds the Everglades is a very important consideration. But you also have to understand that our purposes -- we are not -- we are not just dumping this water in -- in the water conservation area. This water could be sent to the ocean. In fact, on the eastern portion of the canal, the water is sent to the ocean.

    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "Well, we think that there is more to it than just the term, navigable water. We think that -- that we do -- we have argued throughout this case, including in the lower courts, that the navigable waters are a unitary concept for purposes of section 402."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Bishop, isn't the problem with the unitary concept idea that given the purposes of the Clean Water Act, it makes great sense if there is a way of distinguishing between bodies of water to distinguish them in terms of their -- their pollution? And the -- in -- in effect, the -- the function of the kind of unitary definition is a function that -- that works against the protection of clean water as against to dirty water that can be added to it. And -- and shouldn't the -- shouldn't the purposes of the act be taken into consideration in defining what is a body or a unified body of water?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",

    "speech": "Well, I mean, that's -- that's -- I mean, because of the complexities of the act, that's not quite right. As a definitional matter, the Congress clearly distinguished between the navigable waters and those portions as to which water quality standards were to be set. In implementing water quality standards, a State may take account of the -- of effluence reaching the water through point sources. And in fact, there is a separate provision of the statute --"

And I think you're saying that for a point source emission issues, we don't make that kind of distinction. My question was, if the distinction can be made and in fact is made, with respect to water quality standards, why should it follow that the same distinction cannot be made for purposes of definition in point source problems?"

That is backed up by the use of the broad term discharge in section 401(a) where Congress meant to reach much more and which isn't limited by this language of an addition to the navigable waters. It is backed up by 304(f)(2)(F) where Congress described as non-point source pollution pollution resulting from the changes in the flow and circulation of navigable waters or ground waters caused by flow diversion devices like the pump. And it's backed up by the fact that neither Congress nor EPA has ever at any time since 1972 suggested that these sorts of movements of water should be governed by section 402.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States submits that the Clean Water Act does not require the South Florida Water Management District to obtain a section 402 permit for the operation of water control facilities like the S-9 pump which simply move water from one location to another. We believe that position is correct on the basis of both the text of the statute, the overarching purposes of the statute and its structure, and also EPA's actual practices. I'd like to turn first to the text of the statute. Section 402 states that a NPDES permit is required when there is an addition of a pollutant to navigable waters from a point source, and section 5027 goes on to state that a -- the waters -- the navigable waters are the waters of the United States. Under that definition and those statutory provisions, when an industrial out-fall introduces pollutants for the first time into the waters of the United States, an NPDES permit is required. However, when a water control facility like the S-9 pump simply moves water from one place to another, together with any pollutants that might be contained therein, that regulatory regime is not called into play."

  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "No. I think that in fact the -- the approach that EPA has taken in this is -- can be seen from a number of sources. First of all, EPA has never attempted to regulate water control facilities like the S-9 pump in the 30 years that the NPDES program has been in place. And what's more, in cases, the closely analogous cases, of dams where water is simply being passed through a dam, EPA has taken the position that an NPDES permit is not required. Part of the reason for this is there are other regulatory programs that deal with these problems. Justice Breyer mentioned the problem of taking a polluted river and combining it with a pristine river. That actually implicates a number of different programs. First of all, in the case of the polluted river, that river is subject to 402 requirements, and so there will be steps taken to prevent the discharge of pollutants into the polluted river. The States also are required, or at least strongly urged by the Government and with strong carrot and stick type incentives, to adopt non-point source pollution programs to reduce any non-point pollution that might be going into that polluted river. If there's an attempt to connect that river to another river, it does implicate, as Mr. Bishop indicated, the section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act which deals with regulations that result in the change in the flow of --"

So it was subject to the public interest review provisions that the Rivers and Harbors Act envisions.

In this case it could be very substantial for projects throughout the Nation."

    "speech": "I think that's correct. And in addition, I think we have to consider what would a permit accomplish in this case that the CERP project that the Corps of Engineers has -- is implementing is not already doing. That project is designed to deal with these problems. The permitting program is really designed to deal with the specific problem of introducing pollutants into waterways for the first time. It's really not capable of dealing with this problem of water transfers that move from one place to another. Rather, there are other programs that deal with this. If it's a Federal program, it would be subject to NEPA, for instance, and there would be an environmental analysis before any action was taken. In the case of the Rivers and Harbors Act that I described before, that would also implicate section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which requires a water quality certification, a determination from the State that in fact  waters would be -- would not violate water quality standards. I'd like to make the point also that our position is not an extreme one in saying that the -- the text requires that we only look at the pollution when it first enters the water. Rather, it's a -- it's a approach that recognizes that cleaning up polluted water requires a number of different control strategies. The NPDES permitting program is only one."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's done the same thing in Florida. EPA has delegated to the State agency, hasn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "That's true. In fact, it has in most States. So in fact, in most States the States are issuing these permits with substantial guidance from the Federal Government. The Federal Government is setting the floor for what the permit requirements are, but the States are free to supplement their permitting programs with additional State requirements and many do so. Many States like California actually operate with additional programs apart from the Clean Water Act. I think that Judge Kennedy when he was -- or Justice Kennedy -- excuse me -- when he was a judge on the Ninth Circuit, wrote an opinion concerning the New Malones project where he talked about the imposition of water quality standards at -- at the State level on Federal projects and indicated that the States, in fact, do have that authority as well. My -- my point here is that there are a number of different mechanisms here in which these problems can be addressed, and the important point is to choose the right one. In this context, the NPDES permitting program is not the correct mechanism for dealing with the problems that the Florida Everglades faces. Instead, that problem is being addressed comprehensively through Federal and State programs."

The brief of the United States here is it reflects a consensus of a number of agencies, not only EPA but the Department of the Interior, the Corps of Engineers, and the Department of Army. And I'd like to mention there's been some suggestion that this Court should draw inferences from the names that are on the cover of the brief, and those inferences should not be drawn. The names on the brief have no relationship to whether or not -- the absence of the names of an agency does not indicate the brief does -- does not represent the views of a particular agency. That can be seen in a number of briefs, including the Swank brief from two terms ago in which Administrator Browner was a party in that case, a party to the proceeding, and yet there are no EPA counsel names on the brief."

    "speech": "They're relying on a 1975 general counsel opinion that addressed the question of irrigation return flows. Congress repudiated the position that was taken there 2 years later in the 1977 amendments. It mentions this point only tangentially. It's not even among the 17 questions presented that are listed in that opinion. And I think what's more telling is the practice of EPA since that time. EPA has not required permits from water control facilities to do no more than move water."

The receiving navigable water body is the point of focus under the Clean Water Act because the act specifically provides for designating different water bodies with specific designated uses and with associated water quality standards that will protect those uses. And the associated permitting system of the act 402 rests on the assumption that the proprietary of the -­ proprietariness of the proposed addition of a pollutant will be measured against the receiving navigable water body's designated use and against the receiving navigable water body's water quality standards."

  {
    "speaker": "LEHTINEN",

The -- the problem of the polluted river or dirty river is one problem with the interpretation that there's a singular navigable waters. An example -- a specific example is the Dubois case, in which the Pemigewassett River was, in fact, so bad that the First Circuit said it peeled paint off of the adjoining buildings on the bank. That river, under this interpretation, would have been put into Loon Pond strictly for the purpose of resupplying Loon Pond. It didn't always go through snow-making equipment. The First Circuit made it clear that sometimes it is directly from the east branch to Loon Pond. Furthermore, it would make it impossible to actually administer the permitting system because a permit writer is told to evaluate the propriety of the proposed addition of a pollutant based on the designated use and the water quality standards of the receiving navigable water. It wouldn't be effective if thereafter that permit were deemed, as a matter of law, to have authorized the addition of that pollutant throughout the entire United States to any navigable water no matter what its designated use and no matter what its water quality standard."

A big problem. And if we think of California and the central valley water project, my goodness, you're not going to say that's all one body of water. You have the Sacramento, San Joaquin, Los Angeles. You know, it goes all over the place. And so that's their big problem. They are saying if you -- if you don't take a strong reading of the dam cases, one that hurts you, we're suddenly going to find ourselves with -- with water valley projects all over the United States and 15 million permits required, and it just won't work. All right. So what's your response to that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LEHTINEN",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, first with respect to the same body of water, if you were referring to the Everglades, this is a -- C-11 is a canal that has gas stations, urban shopping malls, industrial parks around it. And the canal itself was dug out. It's not as though 99.99 percent of the Everglades were removed. So that canal has been dug deeper. The Everglades' ecosystem removed. It's distinctly different."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's why I think we need a separate body of water requirement there. But what about the other part of what they say?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LEHTINEN",
    "speech": "Well, with respect to these larger water projects, Your Honor, first of all, if they're withdrawing water, they're not going to come under our condition, withdrawing and then being used for a consumptive use and so forth. That's already dealt with a different way. If they're returning the water through irrigation return flow, that's already exempt. Otherwise, if they're -- the State does designate the use and does designate the water quality standards. So these large movements through canals and water projects -- the State controls the designation of those uses. And even if they were found to be a movement from one navigable water to another, they're likely to qualify for a general permit. As Colorado said on page 3 of its brief, none of their movements of water, through any structures in Colorado, interbasin transfers, result in a water quality standard violation. Accordingly, Colorado solves any problem it has with one general permit. As well, most of these big movements of water move water that doesn't distinctly, as in this case, move water that's four times higher in a certain content than the receiving water body's water quality standard. The State law for the Everglades and only the Everglades protection area, not the C-11 canal, is now 10 parts per billion. That actual number was changed and became effective January 1 of 2004, but it had a separate designation and water quality standard throughout all of the time of this case."

My second question is in your view does the record tell us where the water from the C-11 basin primarily comes from?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LEHTINEN",

The fact that one water will flow eventually into the other doesn't make them the same water body.

And in the State of Florida, the State legislature has designated the Everglades protection area quite distinct from the canal, a different water quality standard and a -- and a different use for that water. And as a hydrological matter, they are -- they are able to -- to deal with that. They've given them different water body numbers in the State of Florida.

    "speech": "We -- we believe, as -- as Congress did, that the Clean Water Act -- that the programs in place were not always implemented and that the Clean Water Act was necessary as a backstop to stop the backsliding. The Federal Government's litigation in 1988 required the State to do no more than the State in press releases was saying that it was doing and intended to do, but the litigation, reinforced by Congress that specifically said we don't intend to interfere with any of that litigation, indicates why Federal enforcement is a -- is a useful and necessary tool to ensure that States under different pressures don't backslide. Our brief appendix indicates that 2 years ago they indicated they would meet water quality standards in the S-9 by 2005, and then with the pendency of this litigation, they have eliminated any commitment to reach it by 2005, hoping that this litigation will first relieve them of the oversight of the NPDES on S-9 and then they will use this litigation to eliminate the NPDES's that were required from 1993 forward on the other projects. The only thing that keeps those -- those other discharge structures under the restoration project from not being extended or otherwise modified by the State are the EPA- placed NPDES permits that already exist on all of those Everglades restoration projects. We simply want the same permitting backstop on the S-9 structure. With respect to the question of singular waters, the singular waters approach of the United States eliminates the different designated uses and the ability to actually determine the effects of a permit. The Minnesota amici brief is very useful in this sense because it points out that St. Paul now, like the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and others, does get an NPDES to remove water from the Mississippi to its lake and water reservoir. However, if the Solicitor General's position were correct, St. Paul would no longer need that NPDES permit, and St. Cloud, substantially up-river on the Mississippi, would -- would be under a -- a review for does its discharges to the Mississippi, which have been found to meet the NPDES requirements, not changing the designated use or violating the Mississippi's water quality standard -- it -- its discharges should be deemed to be somehow removable artificially downstream in the Mississippi so that anyplace anyone at any time might construct the pipe and move them into a more pristine water body, you, St. Cloud now have to anticipate that and will be put under that -- that mandate. So the inability of a permit writer to construct a 402 permit because he doesn't know that the evaluation is now to the receiving navigable water, but instead I have to evaluate where anyone with a pipe might move it, hundreds and hundreds of miles, without an NPDES permit, that permit writer essentially has to permit only for the highest designated use and the highest water quality standard anywhere in the United States, notwithstanding that where the discharge -- point source is discharging to is a particular designated use. That would make the act either impossible to administer or place burdens on the governments that the petitioner says should not be placed on the governments. Instead of placing it on the government that for some purpose, some economic purpose, is able to -- to determine the costs and to -- and to clean the water or at least subject itself to review, when it takes it from a navigable water into a pristine navigable water, you place the burden instead on anyone else who might discharge so -- and -- and whose -- whose discharge, might, if removed anywhere downstream by anyone for any reason, might end up causing a violation of a water quality standard."

But if we agree with you on the meaning of the act, permitting will be mandatory not just when -- when there are differences between the pollution levels of the two bodies of water, but whenever there is a transfer from one body of water to another. Even when the two bodies of water are equally polluted, you would need a permit because you are adding -- you are adding pollutants."

  {
    "speaker": "LEHTINEN",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. A general permit can be statewide. The permit looks almost like a rule, but the permit says -- and in the case of the Corps, they do nationwide permits, but 404 is not at issue here. The general permit statewide could say that under the following circumstances, when you are an unimpaired water body discharging to an unimpaired water body or discharging at levels that have pollutants but don't impair the receiving water body, you automatically qualify for this permit. Do some monitoring. Let us know every year. That general permit is -- is frequently used and -- and is very close to rulemaking. But it's also possible, under those circumstances -- and this is not our case. Our case discharges at almost four times the water quality standard, 10 parts per billion, for the receiving water body. It clearly impairs the receiving water body. But if the standard for a water body were 20 of a substance, its actual receiving level was 10 and you discharged at 5, not to get too complex, but you're discharging at a lower level than the receiving water body and the water bodies are not impaired, it's possible mathematically, but not our case here -- these hypotheticals should be left to another time. It's possible that the 1 gallon in the receiving water body that had 10, with 1 gallon added to it that had 5, the 2 gallons now have 15, or in fact, 7-and-a-half per receiving unit. That may be determined by rule or other appropriate analysis in the western cases, if they ever come up, to not be an addition. But that's not our case here. The Court, in an abundance of caution, could point out that our case here is an artificial canal that receives substantial surface water runoff, itself probably a conveyance under the Clean Water Act definition of channels or discrete conveyances, that it discharges at levels up to four times the receiving water body's water quality standard, that it is itself an impaired water body. So that the hypothetical situations or application to western States or elsewhere is -- are not being addressed by the Court. Now -- now, the -- the amici from the Tongue and Yellowstone River Irrigation District point out actually that in the west, they believe that ranchers and farmers will suffer from the Federal Government's unitary water theory because they will now be subject to water that is not of sufficient quality for their irrigation district and so forth. It's not simply a west -- and the State of Washington also joined in our brief. We, of course -- we don't count States, but more States support the tribe in their briefs saying this is essential than do support the -- the district and the United States. The -- it's particularly important to recognize the C-11 was itself dug, is not a residual part of the Everglades, and that it's -- the C-11 basin is not simply a -- a water body divided from the WCA or the Everglades protection area by a levee. Looking at pages 6a and 7a of our brief, which are the appendix to our brief, are from the district's own web site, which it cited in its brief, and it shows the urban construction right to the boundary. So it's not that the C-11 basin is water just divided. It's an artificial canal. It's no -- no more part of the Everglades protection area than Fenway Park in Boston is part of the Charles River because it's built on the landfill where the Charles River once was. They're quite distinct. With respect to federalism issues, the Clean Water Act itself is a federalism instrument because it provides for the States to do the designation of uses. It provides for the States to -- to create the water quality standards, and it does protect the ability of the States to allocate quantities of water, but this is not a quantity allocation. The record shows clearly that the S-9 pump is turned on when you get to 1 foot of -- turned off when -- when the C-11 basin is at 1 foot and turned on when it's at 4 foot. It is strictly a drainage mechanism to take surface water runoff and other water out of the C-11. They're disposing of water. They don't want the water. They're dumping the water wherever they can put it. And actually the water is not our concern. It is the pollutants. Whenever they say merely conveying water, we would say conveyance is defined as a point source and they convey pollutants. If they didn't convey this massive amount of pollutants, we would not be before Your Honors. The district, by pumping pollutants contained in the water against the natural flow of that water into the specially designated Everglades protection area, added that water to the Everglades protection area within the plain meaning of -- of the Clean Water Act and within the common usage of -- of language. The district put those pollutants in the Everglades and nobody but the district put those pollutants in the Everglades. An effort to reconstruct the term, addition to navigable waters, to allow them to dispose of those pollutants anywhere in the United States with a navigable water of any designated use or of any water quality standard would decimate the Clean Water Act's protection not only of the Everglades, but of the case law that -- that Your Honors have had cited in the brief. Now, the circuit court cases are not particularly precedent for your Court, but it does point out that Loon Pond would have had water that peeled paint off of the adjoining buildings put into it and not just through snow-making devices. The -- the court clearly indicated that sometimes the Pemigewassett water was put directly to Loon Pond to -- to increase the amount of water in Loon Pond. Now, the -- the United States would try to save its singular water theory in some cases by saying, well, water might be removed. They said on the Dubois case, the First Circuit Loon Pond, that it was removed for snow- making, but I point out that the court said in several places that it also went directly, never through snow- making devices. They would say that when you put it through tunnels or so forth, perhaps it loses its navigable water character. The State of New York, of course, is strongly in favor of the tribe because the 18-mile Shandaken Tunnel to them needs --"
