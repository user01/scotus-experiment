    {
      "speaker": "GELLER",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The plaintiffs in this case are people who underwent back surgery in which particular medical devices were used. They brought this suit under State law to recover for injuries allegedly caused by their -- by these devices, but this is a very unusual form of State law product liability action. The plaintiffs don't claim that these devices were in any way defective. There's no claim here of manufacturing defect. There's no claim here of design defect. The plaintiffs also don't claim that the surgeons who used these devices did anything wrong. There's no claim here of medical malpractice. Instead, the plaintiffs' sole claim in this case is the following. They assert that the Federal Food & Drug Administration was deceived into giving regulatory clearance to these devices, that, absent this deception, these devices would never have been on the market, and that, if the devices had never have been on the market, they wouldn't have been used in their surgeries and they wouldn't have suffered any injuries. So this lawsuit is, in other words, a direct attack under State law on the decision of the Federal Food & Drug Administration applying Federal law to allow these devices to be marketed in interstate commerce and, if this suit is allowed to proceed, it means that a jury applying State law would have to decide such issues as, what sorts of disclosures have to be made to the Food & Drug Administration in the context of seeking 510(k) approval for a device? What did the FDA know about these specific devices and their intended use? Was the FDA deceived in any way in granting regulatory clearance?"

If you look at the complaint, for example, at page 21 of the joint appendix, paragraphs 131 and 132 allege not only that a false statement was made but reliance and causation and all the things that you have to prove in order to prove a State law cause, State law fraud action. So it's not enough simply to prove that a misrepresentation was made in order to recover on it. You would also have to prove whether the misrepresentation was material, whether the FDA knew what was allegedly not told to it, whether the FDA thought that it was relying on the absence of the information, relied on the misrepresentation and then finally, what would the FDA have done if it had been told the truth, the causation theory."

      "speech": "Your Honor, the -- what the manufacturer has to show in seeking 510(k) is, in addition to showing that the device has the physical technological characteristics of the predicate device the manufacturer also has to put down what the intended use of the device is. It's -- the manufacturer under the law is entitled to put down any intended use it wants, as described in the labeling. What the plaintiffs seem to claim here is that the FDA, is that the manufacturer had to allege not simply that the intended use was for the long bones, which was the manufacturer was entitled to allege, but also, according to the complaint, that once the device got on the market the manufacturer intended that it be used for spinal applications, and that our -- and therefore a State jury would have to determine what would the FDA have done, if it had been told, as the plaintiffs allege the manufacturer should have told the FDA, that once this device gets on the market the intent was to see it used significantly for spinal applications."

I think it shows that the FDA was well aware of the possibility of using these devices for spinal applications and when the manufacturer came in, as it was entitled to do, and that now we want to seek 510(k) approval to label these devices for the long bones of the arm and leg, the FDA was well aware that the devices had some possibility of being used for spinal applications.

In other word -- is that in effect what you're --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GELLER",
      "speech": "In effect, although whether it was even a fraud at all -- you see, I think one of the problems here is in viewing the intended use statement under 510(k) as a factual representation at all. It's not a factual representation at all. It's simply a request for marketing clearance. The manufacturer decides by its labeling what sort of marketing clearance it seeks for its devices. The FDA's role is simply to look at the labeling and determine whether there was a device on the market prior to 1976 with those physical characteristics and that labeling."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It's really a misnomer, then, if they're going to use it the way you say they have been and ought to use it, they shouldn't call it intended use. They should have -- it should be called permitted use, or approved use, or something like that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GELLER",
      "speech": "Absolutely, Justice Scalia. I think intended use is a misnomer. It's a term of art in the food and drug law, and I think the statute and the regulations are as clear as can be, it is simply a request for marketing clearance by describing how you intend to label your device. It is not at all a factual representation as to how that device will actually be used off-label once the device is on the market, which is, I think, one of the many problems with the plaintiffs' claim here. But the point that I was simply making is the sorts of inquiries that a State judge or jury would have to make if this State law claim were allowed to proceed are inquiries that would delve heavily into the intricacies of the Federal regulatory process and, in addition, in addition to prevail on their claims the plaintiffs would have to convince a State jury that these devices should never have been on the market and were not lawfully on the market, even though the FDA has decided as a matter of Federal law that the devices are lawfully on the market, so to rule for plaintiffs, a jury under State law would have to essentially disregard and nullify a binding decision of the FDA. Now, our position is that a claim such as this, which essentially amounts to an attack under State law on a binding determination by a Federal agency is both expressly and impliedly preempted by the Federal food and drug laws."

It is perfectly lawful, perfectly consistent with the statute, perfectly protective of the public health, to seek approval under section 510(k) for a device by saying it has intended use A, even though you hope, expect, intend that once the device gets on the market it would be used primarily, or even exclusively, for use B.

This is section 336 and 337 of the act. The FDA is to decide whether there is a violation and, if there is a violation, the FDA is to decide whether it's a significant enough violation to cause some sort of penalties to be imposed, and this was a very, very important part of Congress' scheme. Unlike many other regulatory statutes, the securities laws, the antitrust laws, Congress here decided there should not be a private right of action and the reason is because you're dealing here with the public health.

Thousands and thousands of pages of documents that allegedly documented this fraud were presented to the FDA in a citizens' position, and when the FDA was reclassifying bone screws. The FDA decided not to do anything. It obviously didn't feel itself defrauded. It decided not to take these devices in any way off the market, and yet the plaintiffs' fraud claim here would have the potential to completely undermine this entire statutory scheme by allowing State courts and juries to second-guess the decision of the FDA to allow these devices to remain on the market to protect the public health.

Now, either one of those theories is independently sufficient to resolve this case. Now, the final point I wanted to make is that the respondents say that this case is just like Medtronic, and the claims here shouldn't be preempted for the same reasons the claims in Medtronic were not preempted, but there are three basic differences between the claims in Medtronic and the claim here. The claims there, the State was performing its traditional role in enforcing ordinary duties of care running from the manufacturer to the consumer, whereas here it's seeking to impose an obligation on somebody not to defraud a Federal Government agency. The claims there had an existence that was completely independent of the Federal scheme. This claim is entirely derivative. Without this Federal regulatory scheme you could not have a fraud on the FDA claim. And finally, the claims there were not preempted by the Federal clearance decision. They all assumed that the devices had been permissibly cleared under Federal law, whereas here, the claim conflicts with the Federal clearance decision. If there are no further questions --"

I would suggest to the Court the answer to that question comes from the unanimous -- the unanimous portions of this Court's decision in Medtronic. In Medtronic the Court was confronted with the question about whether or not the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the medical amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act preempt State common law claims which are founded on a violation of Federal requirements, and what the Court said, and said so unanimously, was that there is nothing in Federal law which prevented the States from affording a private damage remedy, one not given by Federal law at all, for violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the medical device amendments to that act, and that was not limited to negligence cause of actions. It was focused on violations of the act. In the present case, our claim does not derive from some newfangled principle of tort law. Our claim derives from a longstanding principle of tort law which has been in force in this country, in the States, in various forms since they became States, and that is the principle reflected in section 536 and 557(a) of the Restatement of Torts Second --"

You run through the stop light, the State can either choose or not choose to prosecute you, they can choose or not choose what remedy to afford, but there's no doubt, we all know this from our basic tort law, that the injured individual, notwithstanding the potential exercise of State power, has the right to go into court and recover damages for that violation."

And I think it's significant that in the regulations governing 510(k) disclosure -- I believe it's 807.87(e) of title 21, or of 21 C.F.R. -- what the FDA says is, don't just give us the label that's going to accompany this product. You are obliged to give us the labeling sufficient to describe the intended use of the device, and labeling through a series of case law and decisions says that it is not only -- and in your decision in Cordell, in fact, it is not only what is on the product, it is the promotional materials which accompany the product which demonstrate how the product will be characterized in the marketplace which determine intended use, and that is consistent with the legislative scheme.

There are also other appellate cases within the appellate system which are cited in our brief, Learjet v. Spindlauer, which I think is a Fifth Circuit case, and there are a few others which recognize -- and that case was an aviation case, where a fraudulent -- a license was obtained fraudulently from the FAA, also a case called Hawkins, cited in our briefs, where the -- again a Federal court case, an appellate case, where the court recognized that that kind of misrepresentation changes the whole regulatory calculus, deprives the public of an informed decision with respect to the product, and that could render the product dangerous and people can recover based on that. So there is a recognition both in the common law of that, and what I would suggest is that in Medtronic, both explicitly and as a matter of implied preemption which is not dealt with directly in Medtronic, that States are not foreclosed from doing that, because there is no impact here on any function with which the FDA is entrusted."

So the question then is, is this a substantive safety regulation that we're talking about here, or is it a procedural regulation, and I say it's a substantive safety regulation, because the heart of the Federal scheme, and there's hundreds of cases on this regulating food, drug, and cosmetics, is, you are only regulating by -- with respect to what the device or drug is, and that is a function of two things, both what it physically is and what it's conceived to be for marketing purposes, and if you misrepresent to the public what it is, or you misrepresent to the agency what it is, you're undermining the central safety aspects here. For -- it's easy to see that in this case, because when the agency was told this was a spinal fixation device and that that's what it was, they said, you can't put that on the market."

The -- if you push it towards the substantive side, then I get into the problem of the agency having a bunch of powers. They could enforce it through injunctive relief, monetary penalties, seizure, criminal prosecutions, withdrawal of market clearance. And then I think, well, shouldn't that be up to them? I mean, after all, their job is to protect the public from monopoly, and if they think that really this particular misrepresentation is not that serious in light of their basic job, shouldn't it be up to them to decide how to enforce it rather than up to a jury?"

I do think that section 337 of title 21 does preempt the ability of States to give, for example, injunctive relief, civil penalties, and to suspend somebody's license to sell these products. I agree with all that.

      "speech": "That's because the FDA doesn't want them compensated for this kind of thing because it's decided that the harm to them, which they're not understating, would be outweighed by the need to get this drug on the market to fight the monopolistic advantage that people would have without it being there."

      "speech": "No, no, that's true, but they say, the way we make these determination is by deciding which remedy to pick, and we pick the lesser ones when we think we want this thing on the market. We pick the greater ones when it should be gotten rid of, and if you leave it up to the jury, of course, that's the same as getting rid of the product."

Now, if the FDA has not revoked the 510(k) clearance it's because the product is still legitimately on the market as a bone-screw product. The problem is here, we have an illegitimate pretextual application which the Government concedes was pretextual and would be improper if the facts we allege are true."

The Government's position, and I think it's right, is that the use must be bona fide. You must intend, the product must have an intended use, meaning you intend to characterize it in the market for that use. Now, true --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Shouldn't there be some, even a notion of -- assuming that there could be such a complaint at all, of primary jurisdiction, or exhaustion or something, to let the agency speak for itself? If it doesn't think that it's been defrauded, that should be the end of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHBEIN",
      "speech": "The doctrine of exhaustion I think does not apply here, because that presupposes that the agency has the power to give a remedy that the plaintiffs want and in this case that would be damages, and the agency clearly does not have that power. The doctrine of primary jurisdiction is a doctrine which enables a court to make a referral to an agency to make a determination of some issue of fact that's germane to the case. Of course, nobody asked for such a referral here and, looking at your recent case, Southwest Marine, Inc. v. Gissone and Rider v. Cooper, it seemed to me that if there was no primary jurisdiction asserted in those cases, one, for example, whether someone had Longshoreman and Harbor Workers Compensation Act status or seaman status, that was not to be referred to the agency there, that this seemed to me to be an inappropriate case for the exercise of primary jurisdiction."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Don't you think that's significant? Doesn't it tend to support Mr. Geller's contention that all the FDA cares about is what use do you want authority to market for, and so long as you set forth that use, you'll have authority to market for it, and anything else, you may anticipate it's going to be used for other things, but that's all we're approving, is this marketed use?"

It was only marketed for spinal application, and it was marketed -- in fact, the president of AcroMed within a few days of this clearance told somebody that this was -- their application to the FDA was a labeling sleight of hand which in no way changes the intended use of the product. There virtually is fraud conceded here by virtue of the circumstances. It's an unusual circumstance, I grant. There's not too many people that would be this brazen, but that's what happened here."

It was -- in fact, it was -- we contend that this fraud did not occur by itself but occurred as part of a deal, or a concocted scheme between Buckman and AcroMed as a two- step process. First, they couldn't get it on the market as a pedical screw fixation device, which is all it ever was. So they lied to the FDA, then they got clearance, meaning, it was found substantially equivalent for long- bone use, but they knew they were going to market it the second it got approved for -- not for long-bone use. There's not a person in the United States that ever received this, as far as we can tell, for long-bone application, and --"

As to other defendants, yes, but as to other defendants, why would we bring Buckman in this if we had other solvent defendants? The principal defendant here was AcroMed Corporation. AcroMed Corporation was basically insolvent with respect to this liability and we ended up settling our claims against AcroMed on a limited --"

      "speaker": "FISHBEIN",
      "speech": "They have additional assets, that's correct, and we are attempting to try to recover for our clients all the damages to which they're legally entitled. I suspect even Buckman does not have sufficient assets, because this fraud and its consequences were so widespread and caused so much injury that there's simply not enough money with the potential culpable defendants."

      "speaker": "FISHBEIN",
      "speech": "I disagree with that, Justice O'Connor, and here's why. The FDA did nothing wrong, or nothing that needs to be second-guessed. They were told -- if we look at page 58 of the joint appendix, the FDA asked Buckman, what is the intended use of this device? Page 58 is a letter from Buckman back to the FDA, because the FDA had reviewed this and seen it was a spinal device before. Now it's being presented as a long-bone device, and Mr. Shlerf of Buckman said, for purposes of this 510(k), this is a long-bone fixation device, and as a long-bone fixation device, the FDA was correct in determining that there were predicate devices on the market which had the same technical characteristics as this device, and it was okay. There's nothing about our claim that would require a jury to say the FDA was wrong. In fact --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, except section 132 of the complaint says, were it not for these fraudulent acts and statements the FDA would not have issued the 510(k) clearances for the screw for any purpose, the devices wouldn't have been introduced into interstate commerce, and plaintiff wouldn't have been exposed."

      "speaker": "FISHBEIN",
      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I mean, that looks pretty much like second-guessing to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHBEIN",
      "speech": "Actually, it's enforcing what the FDA had previously determined on two occasions, one of which was about 3 or 4 months before that. The FDA made a specific determination that these devices were not substantially equivalent for pedical screw use or spinal use twice, and the consequence of that was that they didn't belong in the market. So what we're doing here is simply vindicating an explicit regulatory determination made to protect persons in the position of the plaintiff from the kind of harm that occurred here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But you're also something of an interloper. I mean, under the Government's view the FDA has various authorities to follow this thing up and may choose not to follow it up."

      "speaker": "FISHBEIN",
      "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor, but the Government's authority is in its capacity to protect the public through the remedies given to it, and my contention is, and I think --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, the Government's authority is also to limit those remedies if it so chooses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHBEIN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, if you say Congress didn't intend to limit damages you're probably right, but the Government -- assuming if Congress felt otherwise it would be true, too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHBEIN",

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, but specifically, assuming what you say is right, after the event the FDA finds out about this, it says, we want to leave this stuff out there, because it's more helpful than it is harmful, and therefore we give you a wrist slap, you see, and why are they doing that? Because they want the drug out there to lower price. Now, you come along and say, I'm going to a jury, and that will make sure it can't be out there. Now, why doesn't this range of remedies give the FDA just the authority that I mentioned, an authority that you'll take away from them if you go to the jury, however meritorious your case might be here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHBEIN",
      "speech": "I think, Your Honor, that Silkwood basically answers that question both in terms of the majority and the dissent in Silkwood, which said that there is an independence here of regulatory restraint and damage recovery which can and should and must peacefully coexist with one another, so that the FDA, or in that case the nuclear regulatory authorities, regulate -- from a public regulatory standpoint they do what they do and the State courts administer a remedy system which may, in fact, have penal aspects to it, because in Silkwood, remember, there was an award of punitive damages. We're not asking for that here. So I think that the two can peacefully coexist, and it's up to the State system applying State rules -- there are some States that would not allow us to recover here, but there are many others that would, and there's -- I think what Congress made clear in enacting both the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the medical device amendments to that act, was that empowering the FDA to have certain nondamage remedies should not usurp the State's power to provide remedies for people who are hurt."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GELLER",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few things. First, in response to Justice Scalia's question, there is no precedent for this cause of action. Every court of appeals, with the exception of the court below, has held that the so-called fraud-on-the-agency claims are preempted. Secondly, I want to address Medtronic, which is the centerpiece of the plaintiff's argument here. This case is completely unlike Medtronic, in part for some of the reasons Mr. Gornstein was getting into. Medtronic was a garden-variety product liability claim under State law, design defect, failure to warn. There was no requirement in Medtronic that the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act be construed, there was no suggestion that you had to inquire into any agency determinations, there was no fraud-on- the-agency claim in Medtronic, and there was no claim of implied preemption in Medtronic. In fact, the existence of Medtronic suggests, the decision in Medtronic suggests that the plaintiffs have many common law claims available to them if these products were defective, so it's not a case that the Court was confronted with in Medtronic, where the argument of preemption would have wiped out many preexisting State law claims. Here, no claim -- the States would not be ousted of any claim that would have existed prior to the enactment of the medical device amendments in this case. Third, I just want to focus for the Court's attention at, if you look at page 136 of the joint appendix there's a strong suggestion here that what the plaintiff's label as fraud on the FDA the irony here is, actually was an idea that originated with the FDA to break up this one device into its two constituent parts and to seek 510(k) approval for each, so the notion that a State court years later could conclude this was a fraud on the FDA and enter a judgment that would -- might have the effect of removing the device from the market is completely inconsistent, we think, with Congress' scheme here, which is to centralize enforcement authority with the FDA."
