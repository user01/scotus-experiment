    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The agreement between Antonio Jackson and Rent-A-Center should be enforced as written. There is no statutory impediment to the enforcement of the clear and unmistakable agreement that gives the arbitrator exclusive authority to decide Jackson's challenge to enforceability, nor is there any language in the Federal Arbitration Act that would prohibit the court from making the determination -- prohibit the arbitrator from making the determination of Jackson's challenge to unconscionability. Through frequent holdings of this Court going back 50 years to the Steelworkers trilogy, this Court has plainly recognized that parties may delegate issues as to scope and validity to the arbitrator in the first instance. The district court and --"

  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "Justice Stevens, the argument was that there was unequal bargaining power because Mr. Jackson was the -- a putative employee and Rent-A-Center was the employer. He also complained about a couple of the provisions in the agreement, one pertaining to discovery, one pertaining to an alleged fee-splitting provision in the agreement. He did not complain as to the terms that Justice Scalia just referred to. With respect to making, it is a very limited inquiry, and section 4 is the provision in the Federal Arbitration Act that gives a court the power to enforce the arbitration agreement. Once the court is satisfied that the making is not an issue and the making is a very basic issue, the court, pursuant to the plain language of section 4, must submit the dispute to arbitration."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",

    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Sotomayor, unconscionability and fairness attacks go to post-formation issues that -- that are --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "We just gave you one that didn't: If someone was forced into signing the agreement in an unconscionable way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "But, Justice Sotomayor, if for example it's fraud in the inducement, such as in Prima Paint, that does go to the section 4. It does go to the making of the agreement because there would not be mutual assent if somebody was forced to enter into the agreement. In contrast, unconscionability, and certainly the allegations we've seen here against the agreement, go to post-formation complaints, complaints about the fairness of the agreement. They do not go to the actual, very limited making of the agreement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "But I suppose that the substance of the agreement -- maybe this is just the same question as Justice Scalia's. I suppose the substance of the agreement is evidence -- could be evidence on the unconscionability at formation."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "No, Mr. Chief Justice. Attacks on the fairness and simply pointing to provisions and saying, well, these are very unfair; it must be an indication of it being forced -- no, that would be for the arbitrator to decide, because it’s simply an attack on the fairness and there’s speculation as to why somebody entered. And in this agreement --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "I don't agree with that. I mean, if -- if the argument is made -- I gather it wasn't made here, but if the argument is made that this agreement was not voluntary, and the evidence of that involuntariness is how outrageously unfair it is -- now, I'm not sure that that's enough evidence. You may need some other stuff as well to -- to persuade a court. But if that is the argument, that the one-sidedness is evidence that the agreement was not voluntary, I don't see how that's for the arbitrator."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, under the section 4 analysis, in the making there needs to be some evidence that it was forced, the gun to the head example. Simply pointing to the language in the agreement as evidence of that would not be enough. That is an attack on the language of the agreement after it's been formed. The section 4 analysis is very, very limited, and it goes to these most basic elements. So the language of the agreement, while certainly the party opposing it will have the opportunity to make the argument it's unconscionable, but that would be for the arbitrator."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "You don't think that could be used along with other evidence? I think all you’re saying is that it is not in and of itself enough, that every unfair agreement is not a coerced agreement."

    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "It certainly would not in and of itself be enough --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

    "speech": "Your Honor, you would have to look at the objective manifestation of mutual assent. For example, in this agreement --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "I think you can answer that yes or no. Can you use that in addition to other evidence to show that the agreement was not voluntary?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, I don't think so. I think you would have to look to what transpired at the time the agreement was actually entered into and was made."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "And that's no matter how one-sided? I mean, suppose the agreement provided that the employee shall pay all the costs of arbitration no matter who wins and also at the end of the arbitration shall pay a penalty if he fails to -- it seems to me you could have a really one-sided -- that would not be admissible on the issue?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "Justice Stevens, if there is an issue about arbitral access, as in there is a block at the door, you cannot get a ticket to the show, because of some impediment in getting to arbitration in the first place, under the Court's principles announced in Randolph and in First Options, you must have access to the arbitrator. So in your example, if there is something prohibiting access to the arbitrator, that would be a different story. Getting back to Justice Scalia's question about the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "What about the specific examples he gave, that the -- just take that the -- that the employee must bear all the costs of the arbitration, win or lose, that's the provision. Would that provision be enough to make the issue one for the court rather than the arbitrator?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, if it's simply a complaint about the fairness, it would not be. If the parties --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But is it? We don't need the \"if.\" Tell me whether you think a provision saying the employee under any and all circumstances pays all costs -- would that provision make this question of unconscionability one for the court rather than the arbitrator?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "It could, Justice Ginsburg. It would not be a question of arbitrability if the party opposing arbitration can meet the very heavy burden established in Randolph to show that the fees would be -- would prohibit them from actually getting to arbitration. It would not be simply an attack as we saw here, with no evidence, that we think a term is unfair. The party opposing arbitration would have to meet their burden. They would have to put evidence in. And, for example, in Randolph the Court stated that in certain instances Mrs. Randolph could have put evidence in, and had she put evidence in, which she did not, much as in this case, if she had met her burden to show that she could not have access to arbitration -- in other words, if arbitration is an illusory remedy -- that could be for the court to decide, because, after all, even in the First Options decision, the anticipation is you have a clear and unmistakably delegation that the arbitrator will make a decision, and implicit in that that there is an arbitrator to make that decision."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Yes, that's -- that’s true. The thing I was wondering in this case is there's a -- a dispute that's about racial discrimination and so forth. There’s a clause, and the clause says this is arbitrable, but that is being disputed because the plaintiff in the case says that's an unconscionable provision, so it doesn't really apply. And then you say but now that dispute is referred to the arbitrator to just read the language. But the plaintiff says that that language, too, is unconscionable, and as long as that language is unconscionable, then how is it clear and unmistakable that they, he, agreed to do it, because an unconscionable provision is not a provision? So if we apply First Options -- I mean, it's complicated because of the language; it's not complicated once you think it out, and -- I hope. But just applying it very literally, it would seem to say that you do not have clear and unmistakable evidence that they agreed to submit this kind of dispute to arbitration for the reason that what you point to is itself according to them a product of unconscionability. How do you -- how do you respond to that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "Justice Breyer, under section 4, which is the enforcement mechanism, the court is limited to make decisions about the making. Once the making issue is not an issue -- and it has never been an issue in this case; there has never been an allegation the making has been affected -- the court at that point should enforce the agreement pursuant to its terms."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Well, making itself could be, but I think that's a harder question, whether a -- certainly if the person says you see my signature there; that's not mine; that's Joe Banana's, who tries to imitate me -- there is no contract, and no matter what it says, it doesn't go to the arbitrator. All right? Now, we can argue about whether it is or is not analogous to that when he claims it's unconscionable. There's a very good argument it is analogous. There's a very good argument it is like fraud in the inducement, and there are some arguments the other way. But First Options I think cuts through that, by saying whether that's true or not, unless it's clear and unmistakable that they wanted this matter, the matter of whether the arbitration clause itself is unconscionable referred to the arbitrator, whether or not they wanted that referred to the arbitrator has to be clear and unmistakable. And they are claiming no, because the lack -- the provision that says that is itself a product of unconscionability. That's to repeat my question. But, having repeated the question, why isn't that the simplest, most direct, and four-sentence ground for deciding this case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "Justice Breyer, Jackson, first and foremost, did not ever complain that the arbitrability provision, the clear and unmistakable delegation provision, is unconscionable."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "He’s not saying that this whole arbitration clause is unconscionable?"

    "speech": "He’s complaining that generally it's unconscionable --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Well, all right. So he's -- he’s complaining the whole clause is unconscionable, and that's part of the clause."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "Justice Breyer, this is really very similar to First Options, in which the party said: I'm not party to the agreement; the scope does not cover --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Yes, and in First Options, we said it wasn’t clear and unmistakable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "The Court said it was not, but in First Options the Court set out the rule --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "And the rules were what I just described."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "The rule is -- in this case, there is language that has never been contested, and that language clearly and unmistakably says that the arbitrator has exclusive authority. That language has never been attacked. And as to the issue of unconscionability, pursuant to section 4, which gives the court the authority to send the arbitration to the arbitrator, the court should do exactly that. It should send it to the arbitrator once the making issue is satisfied, and then the arbitrator can make that decision."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So your position is that the arbitrator gets to decide questions of unconscionability, but the court gets to decide whether the arbitrator can do that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "In some instances, Justice Roberts -- Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct. The court must decide whether the agreement is made. The court must also decide whether there was a clear and unmistakable delegation. So under First Options and the cases that interpret it and the cases before it, the court must make the initial determination of whether there is a clear and unmistakable delegation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, do you understand -- and we can ask the Respondent. But, as you understand Jackson's case, is he saying that part of the clause, part of the arbitration clause, is unconscionable, that the whole clause is unconscionable or that the whole contract is unconscionable?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "He has made generalized --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "Justice Kennedy, he has attacked certain provisions specifically of the agreement. He is arguing about the discovery provision. He is arguing about the fees provision. And he is arguing about certain terms excluding claims, that bilaterally exclude claims. So he has attacked about three provisions of the agreement specifically."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "So let's go back to that. Maybe the other way is simpler. You say you agree that if my defense to this contract, which you are trying to enforce against me or which gives me a right to sue you, look at the argument, you put up this four-page document, and I say: Look, that is not my signature; that is the signature of Joe Bananas. We agree that's for the court."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Okay. Now, we agree it's for the court if my defense is, what he did is he got me drunk, told me a bunch of lies, and I signed it. I grant it's my signature, but look at how squiggly it is. And my will was not a free one because I was under the influence of alcohol and lies."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Okay? Now, he says the reason that I did not sign this contract -- I agree it's my signature; I agree it is not squiggly -- but still my will was overborne. What was it overborne by? It was overborne by those very situations that lead courts to label contracts unconscionable. The reason we don't enforce unconscionable contract is because the person who was the victim had no free will. He did not sign it of his own accord. And that doesn't -- there’s no other reason, and that's the basic reason, and therefore assimilate it to the other two. What's your response?"
  },

    "speech": "No, there could be other types of unconscionability."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "But I'm not interested in arbitration law. I’m interested in contract law, and I want to know why as a general matter of contract law an allegation of unconscionability, defense of unconscionability, is why is it not enough like the coercion defense or the inducement defense or the \"I was in Alaska\" defense? Isn't it enough like that that they should be treated alike? And now you're going to say no, and I want to know why not."

It had a clause -- it had a provision for back-end review with the court. The review -- at the end of the line, there was to be court review, and as the parties said, it should be just like review of a district court decision, a much -- much more focused review than would be in the case of an arbitration agreement. Now, that clause comes out because of our decision in Hall. That leaves the -- the arbitration agreement in -- in an imbalance. There was court review assured at the back end. So why isn't it reasonable to say the parties contemplated vigorous court review; if it can't be had at the back end, it should be had at the front end?"

Under the clear and unmistakable delegation, that issue, like other issues, should be decided by the arbitrator. Nobody is contesting -- at least certainly nobody contested prior to us getting to the Supreme Court -- both the district court and the Ninth Circuit held that the language was clear and unmistakable. There was never any contest to that issue until we got court should proceed to send us to the arbitrator. Nobody is arguing that Mr. Jackson can't make these challenges once he gets to arbitration. In fact, he certainly can. And the arbitrator will make that decision. And the arbitrator may decide that it is unconscionable, in which case he’ll set it down. Or he may decide -- or he or she may decide that it’s not unconscionable, or he or she may decide that certain terms are problematic and to sever those. At this point, if there’s no other questions, I’d like to reserve my remaining my time."

They would have people like Mr. Jackson waive their right to go to court through the use of a clause delegating this judicial function to the arbitrator."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SILVERBERG",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, that -- that what is unconscionable about this is it's unusually one-sided in that the issues that are most important to Mr. Jackson, such as his racial discrimination case, he is required to arbitrate, but those issues that might be most important to the Petitioner, such as trade secrets and unfair competition, they are not bound to arbitrate. So --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

The issue would be whether there is unconscionability in the making of the whole contract. In other words, it's the same question I asked your friend: Why isn't it all or nothing? If it was -- if there was no unconscionability in the making, then the arbitrator decides. If there was unconscionability in the making, then -- then the arbitrator doesn't decide anything. Questions 1 through 10, not simply, you know,  1, 8, and 9."

  },

The Petitioners here, one, they have made a huge concession, we believe, in their reply brief by saying that if there’s an illusory remedy, that that is a section of unconscionability that the court can hear and must hear. But all these other --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

They have, we believe, carved out a section of unconscionability law at the exclusion of all other unconscionability law. We know that States and Federal courts have routinely applied State unconscionability law, and they would have a rule whereby all this jurisprudence of the States delineating unconscionability law would in essence be preempted."

But can he really disregard State law regarding unconscionability?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SILVERBERG",
    "speech": "Well, the problem is, Your Honor, and if I understand Your Honor's question correctly, that determination must of course be made by the court, because the arbitrator doesn't have any authority to do anything until the requirements of section 2 are met. And I hope I’m understanding Your Honor's question."

My understanding is that he's -- he is obliged to take account of State law regarding unconscionability, but it's going to be his call, as it would be the district judge's call if this had gone to court, whether in fact this is unconscionable. Afterwards, there will be court review. And if he has totally disregarded all State law regarding unconscionability, wouldn't -- wouldn't you have a basis to set aside the -- the arbitration?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SILVERBERG",
    "speech": "Respectfully, I -- I disagree with that, and here's why, Your Honor: The back-end review -- presumably it would be, I believe, under section 10(a)(4) that he exceeded his authority. And once the arbitrator is empanelled under the Federal -- under section 2, once he is authorized to make any decisions at all, including the issue that the Petitioner would have him decide of unconscionability and arbitrability, it would be impossible for anyone to say he has exceeded his authority."

He's going to be able to exact a pound of flesh. Now, there are State laws which invalidate contracts to maim. Do you think that the arbitrator can ignore that, and say, well, you know, I don't really think it's so bad; a pound of flesh sounds reasonable to me?"

    "speech": "What is -- what I'm not sure about what you are arguing now is my -- as I came into this, I thought there were three situations. Situation 1 is common in labor arbitration. It's an arbitration agreement that says wages, hours, and working conditions disputes will be arbitrated, and we have a question about whether a particular dispute is or is not full within the definition."

It's the scope of the arbitration agreement. That's a little hard to distinguish, but sometimes that's not the argument. The argument could be: Well, there are four different provisions in the arbitration section, and we think one of them is void because it's, say, unconscionable, but the others are okay. Now, that one, I mean, normally, you could if it's clear enough say I want that one to go to arbitration. And the third one is that you have a contract, and it's an arbitration contract, and it's on four separate pieces of paper, and what you’re saying is, I was in Alaska, or the equivalent, and maybe unconscionability is the equivalent. On that one I'm with you. I don't see how you can submit -- agree to submit that to the arbitrator, because there’s no agreement, or at least no valid one, at least no valid one under State law. But what are you arguing? That this is that case or this is the other case I just mentioned, that middle case where you have 10 provisions and you’re saying that this one over here is unconscionable but that one isn't; and -- but I did sign a valid arbitration agreement. I agree with that. It's just that certain provisions of it are invalid because they’re unfair. What are you arguing in this case?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Well, the second one -- I don't see how you get there, because if it's the second, one you concede that there is an arbitration agreement that’s valid. And if you concede that there is a valid arbitration agreement between you and your client, and you’re arguing over the scope of different provisions or whether certain provisions within it are valid or invalid, why can't you submit that to an arbitrator if it’s clear enough?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SILVERBERG",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "But suppose you and your -- your client -- rather, your client and the other side have absolutely agreed, clear as could be, under the arbitration agreement: We want arbitrated too whether the provision that these words are contained in is unconscionable. Can't they agree to that?"

  {
    "speaker": "SILVERBERG",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I think that what Your Honor is describing is the first part of First Options that looked -- and that's what the Petitioner would like to rely on, is objective contract language. But then the Court adds the entire other section which says we don't presume that parties intend to arbitrate certain matters and -- because we’re not yet at that scope -- but we want clear and unmistakable language, not just objective language in the contract. And there's an important reason for that, because it's impossible to draw the line. You’re carving out certain issues of unconscionability --"

And as Your Honor mentioned in the -- in the Doctor's Associates case, there are certain issues that are certainly involved, and unconscionability is one of those issues that can be presented to the court without violating section 2, as well as fraud and duress, I believe, were the other ones that the Court had -- had delineated in that case."

So their position --"

He goes to arbitration, or at least the company tries to take him to arbitration on it. And he says, no, because I was fired in violation of Nevada law. Now, is it your position that that -- that that case would have to go immediately to court and could not submit to the arbitrator the issue of whether indeed he was fired for coming less than 10 times, and indeed whether if he was coming in less than 10 times, that would be an invalid basis for a dismissal?"

But there was no question as to the making of the agreement to arbitrate. So, in Your Honor's hypothetical, if there is no dispute as to the arbitration agreement being subject to a ground of revocation at law or at equity as defined in section 2, then I would -- I would concede that that was something that would go to the arbitrator, Your Honor."

I may be subject to a contract that was induced by fraud, but I may like the benefit of that bargain. So I may be able to go ahead with that. And same with an unconscionability challenge. We’ve got an agreement that was made that -- that the innocent party can decide to opt out of. And I think that’s very consistent with this Court's holding and with what the various State courts have been doing in reliance on those holdings."

And that's really a huge concern in -- in not just in this case, but in the bigger picture. Courts must remain open to protect people. I would venture to say that there are many people in this room who are subject to arbitration agreements, and they don't even know, through --"

Are all those contracts subject to the unconscionability argument that you’re making or only some of them? And if only some, which ones?"

We are advocating the status quo be maintained here, Your Honor, and there is no reason to suggest that there will be some rush to court on this. Courts are quite capable to do this in a summary fashion. If a party comes before the court with a baseless unconscionability challenge, I would imagine not only will the court dispose of it quickly, but if an attorney makes a routine practice of bringing baseless motions to the court, he’ll have his own issues to deal with. So, I don't -- I -- I disagree that there will be some floodgates or that this will in any way -- to the contrary --"

It seemed to me that the limited discovery clause, that that was quite common to say we’re not -- we don't want to get involved in the massive discovery you can get in a -- in a civil proceeding. Is there something unusual about limiting discovery to documents?"

I’m hearing terms like \"safe thing to do.\" And in response to -- I think it was a question from Justice Scalia, I’m hearing my colleague state that there is concern that the arbitrator is not going to apply State law. This is merely distrust of arbitrators. This Court has rejected this bias that arbitrators cannot make these decisions. And, in fact, this Court and many others have sent very, very complicated issues to the arbitrator to decide. There is no reason to believe that already been made."

What is the one-sentence answer, one sentence, to the thing, this is a very interesting case, lots of stuff in it that we needn't reach because irrespective of everything else, they in their reply, the district court, and the court of appeals all said these whole four pages, the whole four pages were unconscionable, so none of it’s enforceable, and all we have to decide is whether that's an issue for the court.

    "speech": "The problem -- I -- I keep going back to my initial question to you, is you want to parse out what making is from unconscionability, and you want us to say, well, if it's too onerous a fee for arbitration, that goes to the making, because you’re depriving the party of -- of an arbitration forum. If it's discovery, that doesn't go to depriving them of anything because the arbitrator could give them more discovery if he or she chose. Am I correct, this is your argument?"

    "speech": "No, Justice Sotomayor, our argument about the onerous fee -- and it would have to be evidence put in by the party opposing counsel -- by the party opposing arbitration, that there was an actual barrier, an impossibly burdensome barrier. So it does not come under making; it would be under a -- a Randolph standard or under a First Options standard. There’s two areas that we agree are for the court. One is to determine whether or not there’s an issue with the making of the agreement. The other one, if it's challenged, is to determine whether or not there is indeed access to arbitration. The First Circuit in Awuah applied this test very neatly in a very reasonable manner and applied both First Options and Randolph, harmonized those cases, and made a determination that unconscionability is for the arbitrator based on a clear and unmistakable delegation. But issues as to whether or not --"

    "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
    "speech": "Exactly, Justice Scalia. It fails the First Options test. There can't be an ability under First Options for the arbitrator to make a decision if there’s no access to the arbitrator. So those are the two tests. In -- in this case, what I think I’m hearing is my colleague is saying that the arbitrator can decide nothing; the arbitrator should decide nothing, notwithstanding this Court's regular holdings sending very, very complicated matters to the arbitrator. In this case, the arbitrator can absolutely decide these issues of unconscionability as well as a judge can. Thank you."
