Even though the existing lawful map already had 20 of 32 districts which strongly favored the Republicans, lawmakers went to extraordinary lengths to lock in control of 22 districts, moving around 8 million people into new districts, abandoning concerns about compactness, wherever necessary, and most importantly, segregating the population by race and by politics into 32 districts which are extremely noncompetitive."

Now, they started out by trying to engineer the defeat in the -- in the legislative process, engineer the defeat of the six Democratic Congressmen who had managed to be elected in Republican-leaning districts because they were moderate to conservative and they were, as the district court put it, able to appeal to voters to split their tickets and vote for them in 2002. By the end of the legislative process, they went further and decided to take the risk of eliminating one of only four districts in the State in which African Americans had an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice and also to eliminate one of the Hispanic opportunity districts in south Texas. Now, in the latter case, they did try to replace that with another Hispanic opportunity district, but that was the one that we've called the land bridge district, District 25, which spans 300 miles, linking up urban concentrations of Latinos in Austin and in McAllen down on the Mexican border."

And I as understand the Court's cases, there are times when the shape and the extra efforts that are made to -- to kind of gather up minority voters as, for example, in Miller v. Johnson where we had a very similar district, where race is said to predominate in a different sense than it does when you simply are creating a minority district to avoid retrogression or to -- to stay in compliance with the Voting Rights Act. Clearly, the Voting Rights Act requires you to create minority districts. It should require that it makes sense that people make efforts to do that. We're not saying you shouldn't do any of those things. We're just saying in this instance, under this Court's cases, you shouldn't be able to use your political agenda to allow you and justify you to do it in a different way which sends this extra message of excessive racial consideration."

It just so happened that the voters in those districts, in six of those Republican-leaning districts, happened to like voting for moderate to conservative Democrats who they were comfortable with. Now, if you tell me -- I -- I find difficulty -- I find it difficult to understand how anyone could say the legislature can, as a matter of -- use the machinery of government to decide that those voters should not have that opportunity to do that again, that that was a mistake."

Let's assume that the 1990 legislative plan was one that was done with -- without a wholly partisan intent, but over the years, it -- it now freezes in the Democrats or party X to having a much greater advantage than the general registration would give it.

Now, they also said -- and -- and this is a reason why the State didn't actually put their expert on the stand -- that the map that the legislature had drawn instead was wildly biased in favor of the Republicans in that at 52 percent of the vote, they would still get 22 districts, and at 50 percent of the vote, they'd still get 20 districts."

The fact of the matter is the large majority of the Members of Congress who went to Washington after the 2002 election were elected by Republicans in Republican districts. That's what the facts are.

Our position is you can't redraw the lines purely for partisan gain, and the case I would point to that I think most strongly speaks to that is Cox v. Larios. In that case, the district court found that population deviations, sufficiently small that they weren't even usually requiring justifications, didn't pass the rational basis test because the only explanation you could offer for those deviations was that they were systematically attempting to help the Democrats at the expense of the Republicans."

And the answer is that if you go back between 1970 and 2000, there were 36 of them, and only two of them were redrawn in very small, technical ways, one in Hawaii where they only have two districts and then the one in Texas, which was changed in Dallas.

The only thing that I think really fairly can be said about the court-drawn map is it did give a separate district to all of the incumbents, which is what you'd expect a court to do. They're not going to sit around and decide mutual incumbents ought to have to run against each other. And so it did have that effect, I think, of allowing some incumbency advantage to continue on. But it is -- it is not true that the -- that the court tried to keep some pattern in the map beyond that. The court specifically said otherwise in 2001 when it drew the map, and then it said in --"

Then we have an appeal and we go back down on remand, and suddenly we're starting to hear about vestiges of gerrymanders. But the court didn't withdraw its finding of fact that there were 20 Republican districts in its own map. That's true. I mean, look at the way the votes were cast in 2002. There were 20 Republican districts in the map. The six districts that these Democrats represented who they -- who they -- the moderate Democrats that they were targeting -- the average vote for statewide office in that district was something like 65 percent -- 55 to 65 percent for the Republican candidate. I -- I looked, for example, yesterday at the -- there was an election for the Attorney General in Texas in 2002. It was an open seat, two -- two non- incumbents running against each other, two people from Austin. And the average vote for the Republican Attorney General candidate, Mr. Cruz's boss, in that election in those six districts was 62 percent for him and 38 percent for the -- the Democrat.

Miller. With respect to the question whether Latino voters voted with such a high correlation -- and that's the phrase used from Easley v. Cromartie -- whether there was such a high correlation between Latino voters and Democratic voters, particularly in district 23, to justify removing them because of their race and then saying that they were Democrats, that nexus simply doesn't exist under the facts of this case. Besides the State's arguments and -- and the many assertions that it makes with respect to Latino voting support for Republican candidates and especially Congressman Bonilla, we also have Latino voting for Bonilla that rises and falls. If Latinos were close adherents to the Democratic ticket, you wouldn't see fluctuating support for Congressman Bonilla. You would see low and steady support if Latinos were Democratic voters. Instead, we see something very different, which is Congressman Bonilla gaining support in the Latino community within his district up until 1996 where the peak is 30 percent Latino support and then a steady decline over a series of elections, ending in 2002 with only 8 percent, as the district court found, Latino support for Congressman Bonilla.

Congressman Bonilla has never been able to garner a majority of Latino support, not more than 30 percent. But with respect to a somewhat different question, which is whether partisanship and race correlate so highly in district 23, that you can remove Latinos and in the hopes of being able to take the Democratic index down, we say that that kind of voting is not tight enough. In Easley v. Cromartie, of course, the Court found that African American voters voted 95 to 97 percent for Democratic candidates across elections."

And as the voters became increasingly disenchanted, I suppose, with the incumbent, that decline was steady. It didn't fluctuate up and down. It was going down and it went down even farther. Mr. Bonilla was always opposed by a Latino candidate in each of his general elections that he's had since he's been elected. So that hasn't really been a factor for the voters.

And you could have been a former supporter of Congressman Bonilla. It doesn't make you a Democrat in that sense that race and partisanship are completely interchangeable so that the State can scoop in and grab 100,000 people of the same race and then say later, well, we were taking out Democrats."

Similarly, under section 2, the State saw that it was terribly vulnerable and so again tried to make an offset district which caused its own problems.

In each of those, 49 percent in Illinois elected one extra seat to Congress; in Tennessee, 48 percent. In Texas, by contrast, 45 percent of the two-party vote and 41 percent of the overall State vote elected not just a one-seat majority, but a two-seat majority.

Now, this Court resolved in -- in Vieth that majoritarianism is not a constitutional mandate, but that being said, as Mr. Smith characterized in Vieth, he characterized the fundamental principle of democracy -- and this is Mr. Smith's characterization -- is the principle that a majority can elect a majority of the delegation.

That being said, the question here is not whether that is required. Indeed, it is ironic. In 1992 the Republicans in Texas brought a political gerrymandering challenge to the predecessor map here, and that map was rejected -- that challenge was rejected under Bandemer, and the district court in 1992 told the Republican plaintiffs -- said even though this may be tilted against you, there is nothing to prevent you, over the ensuing decade, from running candidates, from building support, and from eventually taking control by electing your candidates to the machinery of government and adopting a map you deem fair. That -- those words of the district court prove prescient because that is precisely what happened over the ensuing decade, and it is equally true today. There is nothing in Texas to prevent the Democratic Party from doing the exact same thing over the ensuing decade if they can command a majority of votes at the polls."

There were a whole host of specific motivations about the surrounding districts that were drawn. Indeed, the district court said on remand that appellants' argument ignores, as it must, the reality that the lines are infused with the myriad mixtures of local politics and accommodations, often inconsistent with overall objectives of partisan gains. That was the district court's finding on remand, that there are a host of decisions here that have nothing to do with partisan gain, that have to do with drawing a map that are the constitutional responsibility of a legislature in drawing a redistricting map. Appellants frame their basic challenge on partisan gerrymandering because they cannot look at effects, because any examination of substantive effects yields the conclusion that the current map is much more fair than the prior. They disavow any examination of effects. Instead, they frame it as solely partisan intent, which has never been the standard under this Court's precedents. But even under that standard, they base it on a simple syllogism that is found nowhere in the Court's precedents, a syllogism that says because there was an extant legal map in place, the redistricting was unnecessary. And so anytime there is a court map, it is unnecessary redistricting. The problem is appellants raise a false dichotomy because every legislative redistricting is voluntary. Whether it is Texas in 2003 or Pennsylvania in 2001, the legislatures face a binary choice. They can act and adopt their legislative policy preferences, or they can not act, in which case they know with an absolute certainty that a court-drawn map will govern the election that follows. In Pennsylvania, to be sure, it was a map that would be drawn subsequently, but the decision is the same. Does the legislature act to embody its preferences or does it allow a court- drawn map to govern the elections in the States? And I would note the consequence of the rule that appellants are urging is that it would create an enormous incentive for the minority party in every State to attempt to deadlock the system, to shut down at the beginning of the decade any effort to adopt a map because if they're able to deadlock the system, if they are able, as happened in Texas, to flee the State and no map passes, the consequence of that -- they would know for certain under appellants' rule -- is a court will draw the map. And under the Upham standard, the court map will reflect the preexisting policy judgments of the predecessor legislature. So any minority party has an incentive. If they can stop it from happening at the beginning of the decade, they have an incentive to seek a better map."

The appellants point to a host of perceived policy problems about the specter of seriatim redistricting of legislatures coming back every 2 years and tweaking the line here and tweaking the line there. To the extent that is a problem, Congress is the institution constitutionally authorized to address it, and there is no indication that there is a looming threat of seriatim redistricting.

Indeed, they voted in an almost completely polar manner in Democratic primaries. And third, the district court found that there was not Anglo bloc voting. And so all three of the prongs -- what the district court found as a factual matter is that district 24 functioned as an Anglo Democratic district. And indeed, this case is unusual in that there were some extraordinary direct testimony that the way district 24 operates is not accidental, that in 1991, it was explicitly drawn by Anglo Democrats for the specific purpose of electing Anglo Democrats and only Anglo Democrats. And that was testimony not from a State witness but from Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Democratic African American incumbent from the adjoining district who was in the State legislature in 1991, and she said the African American population there was deliberately split up to create a district that would be -- elect white Democrats. That direct testimony is extraordinary and it shows that what the data demonstrate, which is that white Democrats control the district -- and that's what the district court found as a factual matter -- is not an accident. It was precisely the intended effect of the map-drawers. Indeed, if one looks to the three races that the appellants' experts examined that were African American versus Anglo in the primaries, of those three races, an African American candidate of choice who was Black prevailed in only one. Of the 20 races appellants' experts examined, of those 20, only one Black candidate prevailed, and that case, the district court found, was aberrational because that candidate was Ron Kirk. He was a former mayor of the City of Dallas. He was a very popular, local politician with a strong friends and neighbors effect. If you take that aberrational case out, the two other cases appellants' experts looked to both showed that the African American candidate, one of whom was supported by 76 percent of African American voters, lost. And indeed, what happened was the Anglos and the Hispanics voted in virtual unison against the African American candidate. That data -- if one looks to the endogenous races, there had never been an African American opponent to Martin Frost, or the exogenous races, those three we talked about -- the data demonstrate quite persuasively that African Americans were drawn into a district where they did not have an equal opportunity to elect their candidate of choice because they lacked the ability to elect a Black candidate. Now, they could choose to do otherwise, but in this district, they could not choose to elect a Black candidate. And that was the district court's finding and that's what the data demonstrated."

And in particular, if one looks to Webb County, which is the county that was split, Webb County centers on the City of Laredo. And in 2002 -- the race that the GI Forum appellants focus on principally -- the candidate that ran against Congressman Bonilla was Henry Cuellar, a popular, local politician from Laredo, and he had a very strong following in Laredo. And as a consequence, Mr. Cuellar did very well in that election, came within slightly under 4 points of beating Mr. Bonilla and Mr. Bonilla's percentage of the -- of the Latino vote dropped to its lowest historic point. That, as the district court found, was also aberrational because of Mr. Cuellar's very strong local support, and the clearest evidence of that is under the new map, when half of Webb County was placed in the adjoining district, district 28, Mr. Cuellar ran against the incumbent Democratic Congressman, Ciro Rodriguez, and beat him in the primary, which demonstrates that his success was because the -- the voters in Laredo are supporters of Mr. Cuellar and, accordingly, voted for him against either opponent, Henry Bonilla or Mr. Rodriguez. And so, when the legislature was determining which section of voters to remove for political reasons, the region that voted heavily against Mr. Bonilla in the preceding election, Laredo, Webb County, was a natural place to move voters who had in the last election demonstrated they would vote for his opponent. Under any assessment of 23, the prior map had five districts that were indisputably Hispanic opportunity districts, plus district 23 that elected Congressman Bonilla, an Hispanic Republican. The current map has six districts that are indisputably Hispanic opportunity districts, plus district 23 which elects Henry Bonilla. So the result is the same in district 23, and there is an additional Hispanic opportunity district in district 25. If I may turn to district 25 and return to Justice Kennedy's questions earlier about racial gerrymandering with respect to that district. The first indicium this Court has looked to in racial gerrymandering case -- cases is unusual or bizarre shape, and on that indicium, this district does not fall anywhere near the districts this Court has struck down as racial gerrymanders."

And -- and so the appellants call a series of seven whole contiguous counties a land bridge, but those are very sparsely populated counties. In whatever district they're in, they're going to have to connect with a population zone. And what the district court found as a factual matter is that the elongated nature -- the relatively elongated nature of district 25 was a function of the geography and the fact that you have population along the border and then you have a large space of relatively low population, and then you have to get back up to population. So Texas historically has run north-south districts to get enough population to form a congressional district under this Court's one person/one vote precedents. District 25, if one examines -- the district court expressly found that the plaintiffs failed to prove purposeful discrimination. The State defendants introduced at trial a Cromartie analysis that was precisely drawn from this Court's first Cromartie decision, Hunt v. Cromartie, and it's found on pages 331 and 332 of the joint appendix.

It assessed the lines in Travis County, the northern part of district 25, and it asked are the cuts the legislature made driven by politics or driven by race. And so what the State's expert did is drew a map that would be based on race that would maximize the Hispanics in district 25 on the northern end of Travis County. He then compared that map to the map that the legislature had drawn and said what are the differences between what it would look like if the legislature was attempting to maximize race as compared to what it would look like if it was attempting to maximize party. And what the State's expert found is there was on the order of a 1 percent differential which is you're talking between 24 and 25 percent. So it was about 4 percent differential of fewer Hispanics in the State's map and more Democrats in the State's map. And so what the State's expert found is precisely along the lines as the evidence in Cromartie I that the legislature had drawn the map looking for Democrats rather than looking for Hispanics. In addition, if one examines the two numerical measures of compactness, smallest circle and perimeter to area, smallest circle this map measured 8.5, which is smaller than North Carolina's reconfigured district 12 upheld in Cromartie, which was 8.6 Its perimeter-to-area score, 9.5, is terribly low. As a -- as a means of comparison, districts 18, 29, and 30 that this Court struck down in Vera had perimeter-to-area scores of 106, 144, and 69, as compared to district 25's score of 9.5."

And so it drew in the districts it was required to draw because Texas had two new districts. It drew in what it believed the Voting Rights Act required, and beyond that, it made as few changes as possible. And so the district court recognized that the consequence of that map-drawing technique is whatever partisan bias was there before is reflected in its own map that just neutrally carries over the preexisting bias. And that's why the district court found it was perpetuating the prior bias, not because it intended to do so, but because it was consciously restraining itself from doing anything to alter the partisan composition other than to carry over what was already there."

She's arguing they should have been more aggressive drawing lines on -- based on race, which is -- which is not an argument that sounds in the Shaw line of cases. What the district court found is that it was purely a political motivation that drew that decision, and if one is looking to the Voting Rights Act, under any assessment, the district is performing identically as it did before. And on the totality of circumstances, either based on the region, in which case their argument -- argument is one for maximization -- they have six of seven districts. They're arguing they're entitled to seven of seven districts -- or on a statewide basis, the district court found totality of the circumstances was met. With respect to district 24, the findings -- the -- two of the three findings, with respect to Anglo bloc voting and cohesion, the appellants have made no attempt to get around other than in their reply brief, they have -- have briefly challenged them. But it was their own expert who provided the information that the district court found credible, that there was no cohesion, that African Americans couldn't elect their candidate of choice. And it is undisputed that in new district 9, African Americans can elect their candidate of choice. And so from a statewide -- from a totality of circumstances perspective, the ability to elect a candidate of choice for African Americans in the State is higher under this map than it was in the preceding map. In sum, the basic question here is whether courts or legislatures are the principal decision- makers. If appellants' proffered rule is adopted, it removes the safety valve that the Constitution provided. It is rarely employed because it is rare that one finds a plan so out of step with the demonstrated preferences of voters for a decade. We are aware of no other plan that allowed a minority of voters who never crossed the 44 percent threshold to control the majority of the delegation. We're aware of no other map in the country. And so if there is a standard that this is impermissible, that consequence would either elevate courts above legislatures, contrary to the constitutional text and to 4 decades of this Court's precedents, or if it looks to substance, it would call into question the districts in a host of other districts because on any objective measure, the districts in Texas are fair as a partisan matter, compared to the other States, compared to the predecessor map, compared to any metric that one applies. Indeed, the social scientists say, based on the seats/votes curve, that given that Republican voters are currently voting at roughly 60 percent for Republican candidates, one would expect a higher percentage of Republican candidates elected than -- than what this map is yielding. And so on any coherent measure of a substantive measure of fairness, this map should survive. If there are no further questions."

This case deals with a section 2 claim which is addressed to a particular region of the State, a region that's marked by its high concentration of Hispanic citizen voting age population, as well as common geography and other factors. And we know that the claim is addressed to that particular region of the State because that -- that region is the focus of the plaintiffs' demonstration plan. Mr. Cruz referred to it. It's at page 241 of the GI Forum jurisdictional statement. That's the plan that they claim they're entitled to under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and it's addressed to the entire part of the State. So in that situation where you've got a claim where you have a -- a Voting Rights Act section 2 claim addressed to a particular region of the State, we don't think that the Shaw II principle would come into a play.

In -- in the De Grandy case, this Court confronted a very similar problem where you had one part of the State, the Miami-Dade area of Florida, which had a high concentration of Hispanic citizen voting age population, and the State was drawing various districts in that part of the State. And the Court looked to those districts and considered whether there was a proportional representation of the minority group in that area and -- and found that, under the totality of the circumstances, there was, and therefore, there was no violation of section 2. Here, you have a situation where the district court found that the citizen voting age population in the south and west part of the State was 58 percent, and that under the State's plan, Hispanics enjoyed 85 percent majority minority districts in that area, which is to say, six of the seven districts under the State's plans were districts in which Hispanics enjoyed a majority of citizen voting age population. The decision within that area of where to draw district lines is a decision that section 2 and this Court's precedents leaves up to the States. And, in fact, in the De Grandy case, this Court in -- in particular considered the situation where a district line ran through a minority neighborhood and split up that neighborhood. The Court discussed it on page 1015 of its decision. And it said that the fact that the district line went through that neighborhood and had an effect on minority voters, in terms of which district they went into, didn't in itself establish a section 2 violation. And we think the same principle would apply here, where the fact that the district lines separating district 23 and 28 in the southern part of the State near Laredo splits a Hispanic neighborhood, which is, after all, not -- not surprising given that the large percentage of the population in that part of the State is Hispanic, doesn't in itself establish a section 2 violation. The plaintiffs' section 2 claim in that part of the State really sounds very much in a section 5 retrogression or dismantling claim, and this Court made clear in the Holder v.

      "speech": "-- specific case that has addressed that concern. I suppose it would go perhaps to the cohesiveness analysis under the Gingles factors. I mean, what -- what is clear under this Court's cases and the text of section 2(b) is that the Court has to take into account the totality of the circumstances in the area, not just the rough proportion -- the existence of proportionality between the Hispanic population and the number of districts in which they enjoy a majority, but all the circumstances that could bear on the region. And the district court in this case conducted that analysis and it found, under the totality of the circumstances, that there was an -- that there was not a section 2 violation in the south and west region of the State. And we certainly think that that finding is entitled to respect under the clearly erroneous standard that this Court applies in reviewing findings of -- ultimate findings of vote dilution. The Court has -- has said repeatedly that it will not disturb such a factual finding unless it is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made, and we don't think the record in this case would support such a conclusion with respect to either the section 2 claim in the south and west or the section 2 claim in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. As we have explained in our brief, that claim -- and I'm now turning to the Dallas/Fort Worth claim -- fails because of the district court's finding that African American voters in old congressional district 24 lacked the ability to elect candidates of choice in that district in the sense that they would be unable, in a contested election, to put their candidate, the African American candidate, into office. That finding too is supported by ample record evidence and we think could not be set aside under the standard that this Court applies."

Answer: Of course, there is. It's the old way. And you say, well, why didn't you do it the old way?

And this case is a little bit unusual in that instead of coming up with a -- a new district, they've just pointed to the old district, which in itself is -- is similar to more of a section 5 claim. But with respect to that district, the district court failed -- failed to -- the district court found that plaintiffs failed to meet the first Gingles precondition, which is that they could not show in that district that they had the ability to elect the candidate of their choice because African Americans were 22 percent of the population in that district, the third largest racial group, and because other evidence, including the past elections in that district and direct testimony of politicians with intimate familiarity of that district, supported the logical conclusion that a group that comprises only 22 percent of the electorate --"

      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. As I understand the State's argument, it is that the rational, legitimate governmental purpose that was served in passing a new map in 2003 was to eliminate an anti-majoritarian map drawn by the Federal district court in 2001. I submit to you that's an odd use of the word in a couple of different senses. First of all, as the experts for both sides found and as the court itself found, that -- the court- drawn map was not unfair or biased in any way. It did not in any way maldistribute voters in a way that -- that hurt -- hurt Republicans' chances to elect Members of Congress. So when Mr. Cruz says that the problem with the old map was that a minority of voters were controlling the delegation, that is factually untrue. What happened was that Republican districts chose to elect moderate to conservative Members of Congress who happened to be affiliated with the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party, but that does not mean that Democrats were controlling the delegation. The anti-majoritarian name is odd in another way because the map that replaced it, of course, is terribly anti-majoritarian, as the experts for both sides agreed. It totally flunks any -- any kind of standard analysis about bias in a map to the point where it locks in 22 to 10 regardless, essentially, of how anybody votes in the State of Texas, and it's going to produce majorities that are going to average about -- margins of victory that are about 40 percent in -- for the rest of the decade, even if the Democrats gain votes over time. Now, it's a dangerous road we're going down, I submit to you, if we start authorizing this kind of partisan festival every couple of years adjusting the lines. Now, we've had three States redo their congressional districts already in this decade, and if this Court were to uphold this one, I think we'll start seeing lots and lots of other ones tit for tat around the country. There's another particular aspect of this that I think is potentially dangerous, which is as you get further into the decade, the census numbers get older and older and more and more out-of-date. And what the line-drawers then do is they've got the census numbers over here, they know where the real people are over here, and they can exploit that differential using the old census numbers. So it seems to me that even if you're going to say there's a legitimate public purpose for redrawing the lines through the decade, we ought to require the States to come up with fresh numbers. The population -- one person/one vote requirements are so incredibly strict in the congressional area. Simply to sort of assume that these people can use the old numbers when they're redrawing the lines 5 years after the census seems -- seems mistaken to me and it does invite terrible abuse. There -- and there are mechanisms for getting new census numbers if the States really feel it's important to do so. Let me then turn, if I might, quickly to respond, I think, to Justice Stevens' question about what the record shows about the intent for taking the -- the African American community in Fort Worth and sending it up to Oklahoma, so to speak. That intent is set forth in pages 87 to 88 of the jurisdictional statement appendix where the map-drawer himself -- his testimony is quoted, and he explained that we had to find a Republican district in the -- in the neighborhood that we could -- we could tack them onto that could sort -- that could, quote, handle that particular component of the current county population, which is to say a district sufficiently Republican that they would be completely disempowered for the rest of the decade. Now, there was -- there was a comment from Mr. Cruz about how the district 24 was created for a Anglo -- Anglo Democrat to win. The district that -- that was talked about in the testimony was the district drawn in 1991. What Mr. Cruz didn't point out was that in 1996, that district was completely changed by a Federal district court in Bush v. Vera. The old district went way down into the southeast into the countryside. The new district, which is the one you see in the maps before you, was drawn by the Federal district court. It wasn't drawn by anybody seeking to uphold any Anglo Democrats' opportunities."
