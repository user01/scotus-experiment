On remand, however, a panel of the Seventh Circuit found a way to keep this case alive. It held that 4 of the 121 RICO predicates somehow survived this Court's decision, and it strongly suggested that the Hobbs Act punishes acts or threats of physical violence that have no connection to either robbery or extortion. Today, we are asking this Court to reverse the erroneous decision below and remand with very explicit instructions that judgment be entered in favor of Petitioners. Reversal is warranted because of three separate legal errors made by the Seventh Circuit. First, the lower court failed to obey the clear holdings and remand instructions of this Court. Second, the Seventh Circuit erroneously held, in conflict with two other Circuits, that the Hobbs Act plausibly can be read to cover freestanding acts or threats of physical violence. And, third, the Seventh Circuit erred in its previous decision, in 2001, in holding that the racketeering law, RICO, authorizes private injunctive relief."

If the Court rules in our favor on any issue, the case is over. Let me turn to our first point. The Seventh Circuit's decision is inconsistent with this Court's previous holdings.

It says, \"Extortion, they all go.\" But here are these four that don't involve extortion, and there's no ruling from the Court on those.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNTEREINER",
      "speech": "I'd be happy to move on, Justice O'Connor, to those two issues. Our second argument is that the Hobbs Act does not punish freestanding acts or threats of violence. By \"freestanding,\" we mean unconnected to either robbery or extortion. And I think that's apparent from the language of the Hobbs Act, which has three clauses. And the third clause covers acts or threats of violence, quote, \"in furtherance of any plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section,\" unquote. So, there needs to be a connection. There needs to be a violation of this section. And our position is that that refers back to the principal offenses under section 1951, robbery or extortion. Now, the Respondent's position is that the mere act of obstructing commerce, or affecting commerce, or, I suppose, even delaying commerce, is a violation of the Hobbs Act. And I don't think it's possible to read the statutory language that way. So, we think that argument is clearly foreclosed. Now, if there's any doubt about that, based on the language of the Hobbs Act, as amended in 1948, one need only look back to the 1946 version of the Hobbs Act, as originally passed. And there, it -- there's no debate that Congress intended to cover acts or threats of physical violence only if undertaken in furtherance of a plan or purpose to commit robbery or extortion. So, Respondent's position rises or falls on the proposition that in 1948, when Congress recodified and revised all of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, it dramatically expanded the Hobbs Act. This Court, in reviewing revision and recodification statutes, applies special rules of construction. It requires a clear statement -- or clear expression of intent to make a substantive change; and, if there isn't one, it assumes that no substantive change was intended. If you look at the revisor's notes to section 1951(a) in the 1948 revision, it's clear that there is no intent to make any substantive change. So, I think the Court really doesn't need to go any further on that second issue to rule in the Petitioner's favor."

We'd be happy with any of them. Our principal argument on RICO is that RICO's civil-remedies provisions were drawn from the antitrust laws, from the Clayton Act and from the Sherman Act before it. In fact, the treble-damages provision of RICO is taken almost verbatim from the Clayton Act and Sherman Act provisions. This Court, in a long line of cases, held that the Sherman Act does not authorize private injunctive relief. And that holding -- those holdings were based on the provisions on which these RICO remedial provisions were modeled. And so, we think when Congress took that language, which is essentially identical, at least in the -- in the -- in the treble-damages provision, from the antitrust laws, that it was entitled to assume that they would be read the same way in RICO."

And in that situation, the Court does apply a presumption that all available remedies are -- will be -- will be imputed. In this -- in the second line of cases, which is what this case is all about, Congress sets forth a detailed remedial scheme. And in those cases, I think it's inappropriate -- and this Court has said that repeatedly -- for courts to add remedies to those schemes which Congress is -- has selected. Now, this is especially true in this case, because Congress relied on those antitrust precursors. And, beyond that, section 16 of the Clayton Act, which expressly authorizes private injunctive relief, is -- has no analog in RICO. Now, Congress thought about including a provision like section 16 of the Clayton Act when it considered RICO. Again and again, proposals were made, but Congress did not adopt those proposals either during the consideration of RICO or shortly thereafter.

And \"law of the case\" type principles are discretionary, and this Court has the discretion to reach the two other issues in the case. Now, the RICO issue is more squarely presented, because there's an actual holding by the Seventh Circuit on that point. It's also an issue on which the Circuits are divided. It's important and recurring, and it's been before this Court twice. At the same time, the Court also has discretion to clean up, or clarify, the Hobbs Act issue. There was a remand. And although there's no holding by the Seventh Circuit, there was a remand that was predicated and based on an assumption that the plaintiffs had raised at least a substantial question. And this Court has discretion to say that was an error of law, because, under the plain language, the physical- violence clause is linked to robbery or extortion.

There's also the arson statute and the bombing statute, the use of any explosives in a -- in a -- in a facility that's used in interstate commerce. And the Government has brought thousands and thousands and thousands of Hobbs Act prosecutions, and, but for those two, the only two that we can identify, all of our prosecutions have been linked to robbery or extortion. And if I could address the superfluous point, we don't think the clause is superfluous either, for two reasons. It applies to a defendant who injures innocent bystanders during a robbery. Now, the defendant has committed the crime of robbery, but he's also committed the separate crime of using violence against any person in furtherance of that robbery.

That would -- that would cover this specific case, and then there's the more general statutes I was speaking about earlier. But there is a specific right to injunctive relief, and I think the plaintiffs in this case tried to add claims under the FACE Act, but they were -- they were denied the ability to do that. The second way it's not superfluous is the example given by Petitioners, in that it applies to a defendant, for instance, who tries to enlist another person in a robbery, but the neighbor, or the -- excuse me, that person just refuses. The physical-violence clause would apply to that situation regardless of whether that conduct also qualifies as an attempt."

And we think it's highly relevant that, after this Court repeatedly held that private parties cannot get injunctive relief, that the United States cannot get damages under the antitrust laws, Congress, in the Clayton Act, passed two express provisions: a Government damages action -- that was in 1955, and now it's a treble-damages action -- as well as an express private injunctive action. And, thus, there was this menu of remedies in the antitrust laws of express Government equitable, express Government damages, express private treble damages, and then Government damages. But Congress, in RICO, only picked up two of them. It picked up an express, a right for the attorney general to seek injunctive relief and other equitable relief, and it picked up an express right for private parties only to seek treble damages. In light of the holding after holding after holding, we identified six cases that were -- that were rendered before the passage of RICO, and the Cooper decision, which said the Government cannot seek damages. We think it's very clear that when Congress borrowed from the antitrust laws, but did not pick up those two express rights, that the governing principle is that when Congress borrows a statute that's been definitively construed, Congress adopts that judicial construction along with the statute. And it's particularly relevant because of those two express provisions. And RICO is -- just contains that structure that was there in the Sherman Act, with the express public equitable action and the express private treble-damages action.

It sent the case back to the District Court and asked the District Court to determine whether an injunction could remain, based on the four counts of physical violence and threats of violence. It asked the District Court to determine whether or not the Hobbs Act applies to physical violence and threats of violence apart from extortion and robbery. This made great sense. No court, in this long litigation, had yet discussed the meaning of the Hobbs Act and whether it applies to physical violence and threats of violence apart from extortion and robbery. There's already been a good deal of discussion about what this Court meant in its prior decision. I think you find clarification if you look at page 399 of your prior decision, where the Court lists the predicate acts that it was considering. And if you add up the numbers, it adds to 117 predicate acts, but if you go to the jury's verdict, the special interrogatories, they found 121 acts. What was omitted from the Supreme Court's listing last time were the four counts of physical violence and threats of violence in violation of the Hobbs Act."

In fact, if you look at page 397 of your prior decision, it clearly states that there were two issues presented, what \"extortion\" means under the Hobbs Act and whether injunctions are permissible under civil RICO.

And robbery/extortion involve property.\" Then it had a section 5. And section 5 said, \"This Act forbids physical violence or threats of violence related to section 2.\" Now, all that happened since then is, there was a recodification. And the recodification wasn't meant to change anything substantive. Second and related point: Enmons. For 35 years, working people in this country have thought they had a right to strike, free of the Hobbs Act. And your interpretation, as the AFL-CIO points out, will gut the right to strike. Now, those are two strong arguments against you, and I'd like to hear your response."

The fact that it has to be a plan to obstruct or affect interstate commerce is an important limitation here. And it's key to remember that this is the position that the United States Government took for at least 25 years -- from the Franks case, in 1974, to the Milton case, in the Fourth Circuit in 1998, the Yankowski case, in 1999 -- and it hasn't had those effects. But if it does, Your Honor, then the appropriate solution is for Congress to change the statute, but not for this Court to ignore the plain meaning of the law. The final issue that was presented concerns the RICO statute. Here, section 1964(a) clearly authorizes courts to have jurisdiction to issue injunctions. Unlike the Sherman Act provision that only authorized the Government to seek injunctive relief, section 1964(a) allows Federal courts of jurisdiction, in any instance.

United States versus Umansky would be an example where this Court said that, as well as the language from Franklin versus Gwinnett County.

      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I just want to make a few very quick points. First, I heard Mr. Chemerinsky say that the third clause was unnecessary in the Hobbs Act, because robbery and extortion necessarily involve acts or threats of violence. I just would like to point out that the Hobbs Act also covers official extortion, which does not require acts or threats of violence. Secondly, on the Enmons point that Justice Breyer was asking about, you're quite right, Justice Breyer, that to accept the other side's position would effectively overrule Enmons. Enmons did not rely, in any way, on section 1951(c), had nothing to do with the Court's analysis. If you look at section 1951(c), which is reprinted in the Scheidler blue brief at page 2(a), you'll see that it just refers to some labor statutes. It says that the Hobbs Act is not meant to repeal, modify, or affect those laws. But those laws don't protect violent conduct, so that's a red herring. And, number three, I'd just like to point out that in this Court's last decision in this case, the Court made clear that coercion is not covered by the Hobbs Act. But under the Respondent's reading, some acts of coercion would, in fact, be covered by the Hobbs Act. Finally, we'd just like to reiterate our request that, if the Court rules in our favor, it make very clear, in remanding the case, that judgment should be entered in favor of Petitioners. Thank you."
