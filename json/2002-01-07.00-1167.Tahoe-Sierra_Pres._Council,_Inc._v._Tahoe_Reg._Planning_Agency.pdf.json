      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three important things that should be kept in mind while we're addressing the issue this morning. First, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency totally prohibited a select group of individual landowners scattered around Lake Tahoe from making any use whatever of their land. These prohibitions were never designed as the kind of planning time-out touted by TRPA and its amici. Rather, they were amendments --"

A taking?"

      "speaker": "BERGER",

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "My impression is that most of these moratoriums, or moratoria, whatever they're called, would not be total. I mean, if you're considering altering a rural zoning scheme that now doesn't have any limit on number of residencies per acre, and you're thinking of, say, no more than one house on every 3 acres, the only -- and that's what you're thinking about, the only moratorium you would have to impose would be no more -- until we make up our mind, no more than one house on every 3 acres. It wouldn't say, nobody does anything while we're sucking our thumb on this question, right?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Why, why is it -- I guess this is going to be your basic point. Why is it the case -- let's take not this moratorium, but let's take a moratorium that lasts for a year, and after that time everyone believes the board will allow certain kinds of development. Other things being equal, that year of no use would probably have reduced the value of the land by 5, 10 percent. Now, so why, since that's the effect of the moratorium I'm imagining, should the public have to give compensation for that small diminution in value?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Because it's not the diminution in value we're talking about here, Your Honor. It's the total elimination of the ability to make use of the property, and in all of this Court's cases you have talked about denial of economically productive use of land, and what we're doing here, and what you're talking about in your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, is taking away the right to use that land. It's as if I took away your car for a year and I parked it in the garage and I kept good care of it, and I returned it to you at the end of the year with no diminution in value whatsoever, or perhaps the 5 percent that Your Honor hypothesized. You still would have been without the use of that car for a year, and I think that you would be entitled to compensation for the fact that I deprived you of the use of that car."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, certainly if the respondent here had simply said, we're going to need your property for 3 years, and so we're going to take a leasehold interest for 3 years, the respondent would have had to compensate for that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Chief Justice, I couldn't agree with that more, and I believe that that is in fact what we're dealing with here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, but you're -- it seems to me you're not dealing with that here, because in that hypothetical the person, the third party in fact takes the property in the sense of using it for that party's own benefit. Here, no one, the Tahoe Regional Planning Authority isn't using the property for its benefit. It's saying that during this period of time there are some things that you can't do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "That's true, Justice Souter, but frankly I don't see the difference between them, because the Government --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, one difference is that the person taking in the one hypothetical gets a considerable personal value, i.e., the use of a car, or the use of property for a period of time. There's no such fact in evidence here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Absolutely true, but this Court's jurisprudence has always examined cases like this from the impact on the property owner, not from what the Government gains by the taking. Justice Holmes said that in the Boston Chamber of Commerce case a century ago."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Isn't your argument, and wasn't your answer to Justice Breyer's question in effect to invoke the kind of standard language which has come out of the Lucas case? In other words, it is preventing all use of the property, or all economically productive use of the property, and yet Lucas garaged that phrase in the circumstance in which the denial of economic use was assumed to be permanent. Here, we're dealing with a situation -- Justice Breyer's question dealt with a situation in which the deprivation is assumed to be temporary, so that it does make sense in his hypothetical to say, well, it reduces the value of the property during the interim period maybe by 10 percent. That is a very different economic fact from an indefinite, permanent deprivation which would reduce the economic value of the property down to something close to zero, and doesn't that distinction have to be recognized, and isn't that the reason why the Lucas formula simply cannot be used uncritically in this circumstance?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Justice Souter, I believe that that distinction gets recognized at the valuation phase, not at the liability phase. In other words, taking for a small period of time, or for less than the full life of the property, would be compensated less than taking the full fee interest."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but what you're really saying is, if the -- I think, that if in Justice Breyer's hypothetical there is a diminution in the value for this period of 10 percent, that you've got to compensate for the full 10 percent, and it seems to me that our cases are pretty clear in saying, that's not how you measure the compensation obligation. That's the -- that's an example of taking, you know, the one stick out of the bundle and saying because you can't use that one, you've got to compensate 100 percent for that one, but I think our cases rule that out, don't they?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Actually, your cases in quite a number of different circumstances say that if you do take one important stick out of the bundle, you may well have taken the property --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Permanently. Permanently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Well, except in First English, Your Honor, where this Court expressly said, and examined all the cases, that temporary takings are constitutionally no different than permanent takings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, except that that gets to the argument that the other side makes throughout here, that the assumption of that statement was that we had a taking in the first place, whereas the issue in this case is whether we do have a taking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Well, that's correct, and what we're talking about here is a deprivation of all use. That's why we have a pretty clean case for the Court to deal with here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It's a deprivation of all use if you fit it into Lucas. Lucas was a case that did not involve a permanent taking, so that it seems to me your first argument has got to be not that the Lucas formula can apply here, but that the Lucas formula should apply here as opposed to this Penn Central formula. You've got to do that in order to get into First English."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "I agree with that completely, but I think that what we're dealing with, if you examine the facts of the case, is that from the time that these ordinances were enacted in 1981 until whatever end point you want to look at, there was a total deprivation of use."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, Mr. Berger, you may well have been able to prevail under the Penn Central approach, I assume, viewed in its entirety over this period of time, but that was waived. Am I correct in that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "We did not present a Penn Central case, that's correct."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Well, there was this 3-year period chopped out at the beginning of the time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And that's what we're focused on here as the case actually comes to us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "That appears to be what the Court is interested in, as the Court reframed the question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "May I ask you this question, Mr. Berger? Just looking at temporary takings, and just looking at the liability stage as opposed to the valuation stage, is there a distinction in your view between a regulatory taking and a physical taking?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "I don't believe so, Justice Stevens. I think that this Court did deal with that in the First English case, and it explained that physical takings and regulatory takings are judged by the same constitutional standards."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So that in your view -- of course, the physical taking, even for 10 minutes, would be a taking. There's no doubt about that. But your view is, even if the regulation prohibits all use of a piece of property, an automobile, whatever it may be, for 10 or 15 minutes, there is a taking. The damages may be infinitesimal, but there's always -- past the liability stage."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Berger, can you reconcile the different approach that this Court has said goes for spatial separation, like the air space in Penn Central, and time segregation? It seems to me that if the one -- if Penn Central is the regime for splitting off the air rights, it should also be the regime for splitting off a discrete period of time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Your Honor, this Court and other courts have always dealt with the time value of property, if I may, differently than they have in these spatial terms. The fact is, leasehold interests, future interests have always been recognized as independent items of property that are independently protected by the Constitution. If you had a piece of property that had a landlord and a tenant and a lender and some remainder person --"
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But these are all physical takings."

    },

      "speech": "Suppose I --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "What do you do about the fact that there is a regulatory taking of sorts whenever you have a permit system, let's say the normal zoning regime in which you cannot construct any building on your acreage without first applying and getting the approval of the zoning agency?"

      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Justice Scalia --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Clearly you cannot do anything until you've gotten the property approved, but it seems to me that there is a fundamental difference between a landowner working through a system whose end product is, at least theoretically and probably very likely, the issuance of a permit to go ahead and develop something that is economically productive on that land as opposed to being stuck in a system where you're forbidden --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But that would have been during that interval of time it meets your test. Nothing can be done until the permit issues, so a fortiori, under your theory, compensation due."

      "speech": "I don't believe so, Justice O'Connor, because --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, that's what it sounds like. Now, what about your basic zoning law? I'm going to, as a city, limit the use of this property to one house per acre. You can't have unlimited apartments or commercial property owner. Now, for the enactment of that, is there a taking immediately?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "No, Your Honor."

      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, but you are not totally deprived of the use of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But can we get back to the basic question that Justice Scalia asked, and Justice O'Connor asked it as well. I want your answer. Why is it that a delay for purposes of ordinary zoning, which, let's assume, prohibits you from any use of the property, is not a taking?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Because you are there in a process working toward the actual development of the process, of the property, pardon me, in contrast to being in a situation like these people are, where there is no process for development. There is instead the desire --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Let's assume that the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency thought, in good faith, that there would be some development allowed, but they needed a year to think about it. My -- that's the same as the World Trade Center hypothetical. We know something very valuable is going to be built, but you say it's a taking, and I don't understand the difference between that and the regular zoning procedure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "The difference is that in the second situation there is a conscious and total prohibition on use, and that's the purpose of the regulation, is to prohibit the use. In the former situation, where you're applying for a permit, the purpose of the regulation is not to prohibit use but, in fact, to enable use."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well then, it seems to me you have to change your answer about the World Trade Center hypothetical, where you say there's going to be a very valuable use, we just don't know what it is, but we need a year to think about it, in addition to the normal -- and you told me that was taking, but now your rationale seems to me to back away from that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "If they are in a process where there will be development at the end, then I believe that there is not an automatic per se taking, but it seems to me that what we're dealing with, if we've got a total use prohibition, we do have a taking. It's a question of time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But Mr. Berger, your -- it seems to me your deciding whether the temporary taking is -- whether the temporary interference is a taking or not depends on what's going to happen after the temporary period expires, because in one situation you think, well, they know they're going to get something valuable out of it, in the other they don't, but that means that the test for the temporary period turns entirely on an evaluation of the future."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Well, if I made it sound that way, Justice Stevens, I apologize. I -- what I'm saying is that you have two different schemes set up. One is a process leading toward development. The other is a process of total blockage, and where the intent of the Government is simply to block the use of property. We're not looking at the future --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, you're not suggesting they're doing it just for the sole purpose of blocking the use. Don't they have some ultimate goal in sight here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Sometimes they may. Sometimes they don't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But your -- you rest on the hypothesis that they are just interested in a total blockage for a temporary period of time, and they don't care what happens later."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "But that is the fact that we're dealing with. We're dealing with --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "They don't have any interest in protecting the lake?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "We have no question about their ability to protect the lake. The question is how they do that, and what they've decided to do in order to protect the lake is to prohibit these people from making any use of their land."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But it seems to me in effect -- maybe this is a variant on Justice Stevens' question -- that you're saying, what's really wrong here is that this is not done in good faith, that this is not done, let's say, in the case of the period of time necessary to get permits, with an actual development in mind. This is called a moratorium, but they mean something more than just moratorium, they just mean stop, period, and it sounds to me as though you're making it turn on whether it's good faith or bad faith."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Oh, I don't think it needs to. I think, in fact, in this case, when they put this moratorium in the context not of -- they don't even call it a moratorium. They did this as amendments to their Water Quality Act. What they said was, these properties need to be kept frozen in order to protect the clarity of Lake Tahoe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And your argument in effect contrasts that with an existing permit system whereby if you comply with certain requirements you will ultimately end up with a permit, the purpose of which is to make sure you do comply with the requirements."

      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Exactly, Chief Justice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But you still have -- I mean, in the one case the regulating agency has said, you can't do anything with your land while we're thinking about the scheme we're going to adopt, and in the other case the agency has said, just as categorically, you can't do anything with your land while we consider your application. In both cases they're, for a later regulatory purpose they're both saying, you can't do anything with your land."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "Justice Scalia, in a sense that is certainly true, but in the case of the processing of a permit application, we know that there is permitted use. It's there. It's in the books."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",
      "speech": "The regulations of the agency say that for this property there is permitted use. The question is how you make that use, and under what conditions and circumstances, not whether there will be use at all, where you have in the second situation a total prohibition on use and we don't know what's going to happen at the end of that total prohibition on use. The key to it may be this case itself, where the light at the end of the tunnel that they keep touting as the saving grace of this kind of a regulatory regime turned out to be no light at all. There was a complete continuation of the use prohibition when this temporary so-called period ended."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, under your theory it would seem that -- suppose that a building catches fire and is substantially destroyed by fire, and the fire department comes, and the police department, and they block it off for a period of time, no use while this is investigated, none, property owner can do nothing, can't enter it, you're out of there. I guess the city or the governing jurisdiction would have to pay the property owner."

      "speech": "But it fits squarely within your argument."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGER",

You've got a wrecked building that is a hazard, and at least the Government would have the ability to order the property cleaned up before anything else could be done with it, and I think in those circumstances --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But that seems to make the question whether there's a taking turn on the nature of the motive of the -- underlying the regulation or the prohibition, and I thought your position was, regardless of the good faith and the great public interest in doing it, the State has to pay when it does this."

That's the type of distinction that we're talking about here between physical appropriation or, extended to Lucas, a ban on total economic use, and the temporary regulation that's at issue here.

I assumed that under Penn Central the lessee would have his claim against the lessor because the lessor was not delivering.

This is how the Court phrased the question presented in Lucas, whether the act's dramatic effect on the economic value of Lucas' lot accomplished a taking.

Of those that are not sold, two-thirds have a score that makes them buildable under the '87 plan, so two-thirds of the petitioners who still own property can build on those lots according to the record in this case, and that is just petitioners' allegations."

That's a different case, and he brought that case, and it was thrown out because it was too late. There were challenges brought to the '84 plan, there were challenges brought to the '87 plan.

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

Now, the best that Justice Holmes could do was say that when it goes too far it becomes a taking, and I may not be able to do much better, but the Penn Central factors allow consideration of things like, what is the need for it? The need may not be sufficiently compelling to justify a moratorium of 2 years, or the need may be sufficiently compelling to justify a longer moratorium. What was the impact on your -- the property? Keep in mind, the petitioners submitted no evidence of impact on value. We have no idea from the record what the impact of the temporary moratorium was, other than the evidence that we submitted which shows that properties were sold for significant amounts of value during the period of the temporary moratorium, which makes sense. A temporary ban on development doesn't render property valueless. If you have two parcels of property, one subject to a permanent ban on use, and the other subject to a temporary ban, it is true, as some of the amici say, the permanent ban could be made temporary and the temporary ban could be made permanent, but you're not going to pay the same price for both of those parcels of property. The one that's subject to the temporary ban is going to have a higher market value, reflecting the fact that future uses are available, or will be available or not, depending on the plan that's ultimately adopted."

That's the basis for the Government action in this case that the petitioners have never challenged. But I want to emphasize in concluding that it's important to remember that the issue is not whether a total ban on use for this period effects a taking. The issue is whether a temporary moratorium from August of '81 to April of '84 for the purpose of carrying out the responsibility of undertaking planning with respect to these lots is on its face with respect to every lot that it applied to a per se taking without regard to the reason."

Now, what are we supposed to say to them? Aren't they supposed to have some remedy at law? And that's I think why he wanted to hear all his questions, not just one, and there is that lurking in this case, and I'm not totally sure how to deal with it."

Second of all, the supposition in your question makes this not a facial challenge. In other words, it's not the mere enactment. It's because we know what's really going on here. That's an as-applied challenge, that's not a facial challenge, so the landowners in your case said, as, in fact, some have, bring an as-applied challenge saying, as applied to me this is a taking."

Those are two separate periods. The character of the Government action is different in those two periods."

Petitioners knew per se rule of takings jurisprudence, taken to its logical end, would make every freeze in the status quo, however brief, during a permitting, planning, or rezoning process equivalent to a condemnation, to use their words --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I don't understand it that way, General Olson. I thought Mr. Berger separated out, or at least certainly tried to separate out the normal zoning process where you're working towards a permit and a permit is realistically possible at the end of the road."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "It seems to me that's a very difficult distinction for him to make, because it requires an analysis of the nature of the Government's interest in each particular permitting process. We know that they can be short, we know that they can be long, we know that they can be comprehensive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I don't think that's necessarily true. I think you can segregate, at least to my satisfaction, the idea of a zoning requirement in existence -- you have to file for a permit -- and basically to show that you comply with the zoning requirements. In other words, if you're going to have zoning at all, a permit process is almost necessary as opposed to a moratorium which doesn't say, you know, look, we're going to look over your application and decide whether you can build. It simply says no, you can't build."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "Well, what we would submit is that that zoning permitting process is part of the background principles of land use, land regulation, just as temporary moratoria have always been, that when there's rezoning process, a process referred to by this court in the First English case, that process may have to come to a halt. The purpose for the temporary moratoria here was to allow the agency to develop a sensible plan and, as Mr. Roberts has already noted by reference to the record, there's no indication that it was not in good faith. The length of the period, 32 months, was held by the district court to be a reasonable time to accomplish the objectives. The purpose of the plan, as acknowledged by the petitioners themselves, is that the purpose for the plan was to prevent the degradation of the lake and they indicated that a slowdown -- in their brief, they mentioned in their brief that a slowdown in building permits was an appropriate governmental response to that measure. Now, in each instance the question is going to be, how long did it take, was it in good faith, what was the Government up to? Here, the Government was attempting to preserve the value that Mr. Berger's clients wanted. They themselves purchased their property and planned to build a home on it because of the pristine quality of the lake. They make the argument in their brief that it was being degraded, that something had to be done about it. A limit on development they say -- I think it's on page 3 of their brief -- was the logical objective to solve, approach to solve that particular problem. So what Lake Tahoe, the regional board that we're dealing with here today, was doing was saying, wait a minute, before we destroy the lake let's stop, let's have a process in which we evaluate how to solve the problem that every landowner around the lake, including the petitioners, want to have solved."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, that's extraordinary. You refer to it, General Olson, as just a traditional moratorium. I don't think this is a traditional moratorium at all. I think it's quite extraordinary to just say, you know, a time out, nobody does anything with this land. I just don't think that that's the normal kind of moratorium. Nobody does anything beyond the limited use that we anticipate we will ultimately impose. It's very rare that you impose a complete prohibition of use, because that's a condemnation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "It may be unusual, but it is not so rare. In fact, page 5 of the petitioners' brief refers to the two --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Two cases, as I recall, that involve -- total, right, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "Two instances, and the first one that they refer to is to aid the preparation of a comprehensive plan by precluding developers from obtaining permits that conflict with the plan being drafted. That is precisely almost the same words that were used by the legislator in connection with the compact that suggested that there ought to be a moratorium. This is the compact itself in the 1980 amendments. It specifically said that it was necessary temporarily to halt works of development in the region which might otherwise absorb the entire capability of the region for further development or direct it out of harmony with the ultimate plan. Now, if there is some challenge to the good faith of what was going on here, that is not this case. If there's some challenge to what happened afterwards -- I think the questions Justice Stevens asked point out that, well, if there was something that was done improperly to take these people's property with respect to what happened afterwards, or how far it went, or how it affected a particular property owner, that is the Penn Central test. Now, for tactical reasons, the property owners in this case decided not to pursue a Penn Central case. We heard here today that because it would be too expensive and too complicated for any individual property owner to bring that case. Well, that is going to be the case every time anybody challenges Government action as a taking of a piece of property. These property owners decided to pool their interest and decide not to show what the Government's interest was, the degree of invasion in individual property rights, how much it hurt, whether or not it was in good faith and so forth, so they eschewed tactically all of those considerations. Now, instead --"

What it also does is cause the permitting agency, the Lake Tahoe Regional Planning Board, to try to do this on a permit-by-permit, quasi- adjudicative process, as opposed to what they did do, as instructed by Congress, a legislative process in which things would stop, reasoned decisionmaking would take place --"

First, General Olson talked about this Court's cases that generally have built on the question of, we can't tell how far the regulation goes until we know how far they went. Well, that's true, and in this case we know precisely how far they went. They totally prohibited the use of all of the property owners who are here in front of this Court, and it's that question that we're here to answer. When we know how far they went, we don't need to get into any detailed, factual investigation of other circumstances. Justice Kennedy asked about the First English case, and whether the Court wasted its time there if the Ninth Circuit's opinion in this case is simply affirmed, and I would have to conclude that that is indeed what happened. The clear message of merely affirming what the Ninth Circuit did in this case would be to tell all the lower courts that they need to pay no attention to First English, because this Court laid out a lot of clear messages in the First English decision that the Ninth Circuit paid no attention to, and --"

As you, justice Ginsburg, pointed out, the trial court examined at great length the question of whether these people were creating a nuisance and concluded that there was no nuisance created here. As much as he was concerned about the fact that continued development around Lake Tahoe might change the color of the lake, there was no health problem with changing the color of the lake. There was no safety problem with changing the color of the lake. We would all be the poorer, I think --"

The 1980 compact amendments that the two legislatures and Congress went through are interesting in this case, because while they, in fact, said there was a need for a moratorium, but the moratorium that the legislators and Congress agreed to was not the one that TRPA enacted here. They said, what we need is a cap on the number of building permits that are issued, and that's in the record here, too, and they said we're going to limit the number of building permits that each city and county can issue to the number that they issued in 1978. The first thing that TRPA did after that was enacted was to say, we need to rearrange that, and we're going to say, you can issue those permits, but you can't issue any of them to these people. These people are totally frozen out, and they're being frozen out as part of a major public project so that we can clarify the waters in Lake Tahoe, and it just seems to us that where you have these people who are being asked to make this sacrifice on behalf of the greater public good, either of the people who already own homes around Lake Tahoe, and whose lands therefore gets more valuable, or on behalf of the rest of us who don't own homes up there but who might like to vacation there so that we can also enjoy the beauties of Lake Tahoe, that those people shouldn't be left flapping in the breeze with no compensation for the fact that they're the ones that have been asked to pay for this project."
