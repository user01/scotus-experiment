When Congress enacted all three of these fee- shifting statutes, it did not condition an award of fees only upon the result of a judgment, consent decree, or settlement. In fact, nowhere in these --"

If I sued someone for damages I think is an easy way to put it, if I sue them for $50,000, and they hand me $50,000 and say, go dismiss this lawsuit, I don't have a judgment, I don't have a consent decree, I don't have a settlement, but I have the $50,000."

It says you have to be a prevailing party, and I think prevailing obviously means prevailing in the lawsuit, not -- it doesn't say the happy party, you know, the party who goes away smiling.

Why am I the prevailing party? I mean, we both -- everybody agrees on the facts. I got exactly what I wanted, but also there is no piece of paper in the suit that says anything. All it says is, the suit is dropped. Now, I think the Chief Justice and Justice O'Connor and I wanted to know why that's a prevailing party within the meaning of the word prevailing in this statute.

      "speech": "Two reasons. First, because I think it's consistent with the meaning of the word, prevail, which can also mean persuade, induce, or influence another to act, and second, because I believe that's what Congress intended. When one looks at the House report, for instance, it says similarly, after a complaint is filed, the defendant might voluntarily cease the unlawful practice. A court might still award fees, even though it may conclude as a matter of equity that no formal relief such as injunction is needed, and the legislature then cites to the decision of Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Company."

That's what the language says, and this is what is under the discussion of prevailing party, and so the issue is, is that what Congress intended, we think that you can look to the legislative history and to the plain meaning of the terms, prevailing party, and say that yes, that is what is intended here."

This is a very peculiar area for courts to be functioning in, to try to figure out what prompted legislators to enact a particular law. I mean, would it be enough to be a catalyst, for example, if one legislator found out about this lawsuit and said, why, that's outrageous, that the law should be that way. In other words, they weren't worried about losing money. All they were worried about is, all the lawsuit did was bring to their attention a disposition that seemed to them outrageous, and so they said, let's change the law.

We don't think that the inquiry in this case, the facts rule investigation that we're trying to establish here, will involve the legislature whatsoever.

He said that it was absolutely impossible for the State of West Virginia to adopt this rule. Six to eight weeks later, he changed his mind. He made the decision to promulgate the rules and change the rules as we were requesting in the lawsuit. What happened in that interim? We took the deposition of Dr. Bernard Levin, who was the expert who explained how the States had all abandoned the position that he was taking."

What we're saying is, there should not be a per se rule just when the legislature acts that we cannot then present our evidence. The second thing is, unlike a lot of the legislative cases, when they talk about the legislative cases they talk about intervening causation, that here is some third party that has taken the lawsuit away, the legislature has acted.

First of all, the defendant has it within his control, if they make that decision promptly, to avoid the build-up of attorneys' fees. Indeed, that's what often happens in Government cases.

There's the causation as a matter of fact, but then there's also the question more of a proximate causation, that that change has to be because of the claim, not because of the nuisance value of the lawsuit, for example. That's why there is -- the lower courts have always applied the type of frivolousness standard, and we suggest it should be a standard where you state a claim upon which relief could be granted. And if I could, Your Honor, I want to really make the point clear that that is the same standard the courts currently, and have for a long time, applied to cases involving consent decrees and settlements.

Here, they have a cease and desist order that was pending against them before the lawsuit that can no longer be enforced. They have a statute and a regulation they can enforce. I also want to point out that in both the consent decree and settlement situations, there is no requirement of a determination of any violation of law, any determination of liability. In fact, as this Court repeatedly has recognized, that's one of the motivations for settlements, consent decrees, to be able to resolve the case without an admission of liability."

There will simply be the voluntary provision of the relief, whether it be affirmative, or the cessation of something the plaintiff is objecting to, and we're not going to get any more settlement cases in instances in which the plaintiff ends up getting what the plaintiff wants."

Now, if your question is, if the State or any governmental body can simply say, we're going to stop, and not enter into an enforceable agreement, is that going to prevent settlements? As a matter of judicial policy, of course, settlements are preferred. Would it cut down on them? There's the possibility, but I think --"

So it won't affect the split-the-difference settlement, but it will affect the give-them-what-they- ask-for settlement."

This case that you have before you is the kind of case that suggests that there ought to be some other avenue to address a case where some voluntary action moots the case. However, if Congress hasn't provided for that, Justice Stevens, then it doesn't exist and, as the Court pointed out earlier, if you connect these fee-shifting statutes in any action a prevailing party may be entitled to fees, it has to be within the action. We're talking here, Your Honor, about a nonparty who takes the action."

We can match example for example. Then you're back to the language. All right, what about the language? Prevailing party covers their case literally. Then you have Farrar, which favors you. Then you have, I take it, Hewitt, which uses an example of where you could recover where there is, quote, a change in conduct that redresses the plaintiff's grievances, and then we have the statutory legislative history where they define in the House report, prevailing party, they say, a court should still award fees where, after a complaint is filed, a defendant might voluntarily cease the unlawful practice. All right. Is that it? It seems to me we now have the whole case, and you have to balance the practicalities and decide whether you're going to give credit to that House report. Is that right?"

Where an unlawful act is used there, this Court has repeatedly, from Hanrahan, to Hewitt, to Farrar, said -- and Hewitt says this as well, by the use of ordinary language, prevailing party means that you must get some success on the merits. The catalyst theory doesn't provide for that."

Now, as I read that report, I thought it certainly favors your opponents, and then the question would be whether this Court should credit it.

The United States district courts don't have equity power to give attorneys' fees, so Congress must explicitly set out what the parameters of that power is and describe, pick who gets it. Congress decided in this case prevailing parties got it. Now, the House report does refer to informal relief, but the informal relief, Your Honor, could be a settlement. The informal relief could be a consent decree."

Now, with that in the back of my mind, would I think that Congress would want plaintiffs to get their attorneys' fees where they led to the cessation of civil rights violations? I would think yes.

The Hewitt case does suggest, particularly in declaratory judgment case, that a voluntary change that affords the relief might make the person prevailing in that circumstance. I believe that Hewitt has to be read with the other cases that this Court has considered, from Hanrahan to Hewitt, and including Hewitt, that say you must get success on the merits. Now, that voluntary change, success on the merits, and then we have Texas Teachers v. Garland two years later that says there must be a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties, and then Farrar, that says it must be formalized in some fashion, all those must be read together. If you read Hewitt by itself, it does support an argument for the other side. I can't deny that.

I would much rather look to the language of the statute, but isn't it -- if you look to the reports, isn't it possible that when whoever wrote it was speaking about voluntary cessation of the unlawful conduct, he was talking about voluntary cessation of conduct acknowledged to be unlawful, that there's a difference between ceasing it because oh, yeah, you got us, and we'll -- you know, I agree that this was wrong, and ceasing it because, my God, this lawsuit is going to cost us another $2 million, it is simply not worth it? By the way, I'm not sure whether that makes the lawsuit a catalyst or not. It probably does. You know, there's something to the claim, but it's just not worth fighting it for another 3 years and $2 million in fees. Let's throw in the towel, forget about it, even though I think what we're doing is lawful. I suppose that would be a catalyst. But can't you read the House reports as meaning voluntary cessation of conduct acknowledged to be unlawful?"

We never violated any law. That counts for the catalyst, because it's a settlement, and then to say if the same exact thing happens, it doesn't count, that seems irrational to me."

The difference is this. A settlement, of course, clearly, obviously, is tied to a litigation. We don't need to have district courts deciding whether 52 legislators met by their action --"

I'm just suggesting your position really doesn't require a legislature to be involved in order to have a valid objection to the fees, but I don't really get, except you say we ought to read a lot of other cases, what is your response to the rather clear language in the Helms case that a monetary settlement or a change in conduct that redresses the plaintiff's grievances, when that occurs, the plaintiff is deemed to have prevailed despite the absence of a formal judgment in his favor. I mean, it seems to me that reads on this case. There's a fact question, of course, but it certainly doesn't say there's got to be a settlement.

This Court is concerned with the issue of administration of justice, and I am concerned that if this Court does not accept the catalyst theory, then the game's been shifted we talked about that Justice Scalia pointed out, where a defendant that might be incredibly guilty on the eve of trial, after the plaintiff has incurred a lot of expenses, can moot the case out. On the other hand, there may be motivation on the plaintiff's part to start engaging in gamesmanship. We recognize that once we had the consent or the agreed order, we did not have damages. The home wasn't shut down, the people weren't thrown out, we had no damages, so we stipulated to take damages out of it. Had we known that this rule might have jumped up at us, we might have thought otherwise about the damages issue, so there can be gamesmanship on both sides if we don't have the catalyst theory. We think -- and one of the points that seems to get lost, we often talk about this as if the catalyst theory doesn't exist, but the fact of the matter is, the catalyst theory has existed. It has been applied for 30 years, and the courts have not had trouble. When you look at the cases, the courts are able to apply the causation test. They are able to deal with these issues. The district courts are equipped to make these decisions, and they have made these decisions for 30 years, and we think that the Fourth Circuit is wrong, and this Court should find, inasmuch as it did in the Laidlaw case, that Farrar had no catalytic effect, that the Fourth Circuit has misread Farrar, and that we should have our opportunity, our day in court to present the motion for attorneys' fees."
