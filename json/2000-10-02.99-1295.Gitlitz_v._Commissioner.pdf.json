      "speaker": "HALLETT",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: As a result of the position taken by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on the brief before this Court, the issue the Court needs to decide is a limited one. And that issue is whether the amount of debt discharge or cancellation of debt of an insolvent debtor which is excluded from income under Section 108 is income, such that it amounts to an item of income which increases the shareholder's stock basis under Sections 1366 and 1367 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Commissioner rests his entire case in his brief on the argument that under Section 108 no income is realized by the insolvent debtor. Your Honors, that position is clearly contrary to the statute. And if I may rather than paraphrasing initially, read the statute, I think it's really critical to this issue and resolves this issue. And that statute is section 108(a)(1) in the appendix to the petition, at Page 34. And it states as follows: Gross income does not include any amount which, but for this subsection, would be includable in gross income by reason of the discharge of indebtedness of the taxpayer if the discharge occurs when the taxpayer is insolvent. To paraphrase that, Your Honors, what that subsection (a) says in hopefully plain English is that an item is only excluded under Section 108 if it otherwise would have been included in gross income under Section 61."

And then consistent with that over in Sections 101 through 138, those items that are included in income are specifically excluded from gross income. So --"

    {
      "speaker": "HALLETT",
      "speech": "There's a reason for it is that in the final analysis, the basis reflects the shareholder's equity in the corporation, roughly speaking, and the shareholder gets equity in the corporation by contributing capital. He also gets equity in the corporation when income is realized, taxable or nontaxable. And the Congress recognized that if losses have accumulated such that they are not deductible because they exceed the basis, well when income is realized, nontaxable income such as municipal bond interest, that income goes down to increase the basis to reflect the fact that there now is an increased equity investment."

The peculiar thing about this provision is that every other taxpayer, say a Subchapter C corporation, a partner in a partnership, the insolvent would have to be that entity, that tax paying entity. But here you have the peculiarity that the Subchapter S corporation, which is not itself a taxpayer, is the insolvent, while the shareholders are highly solvent. And is there any reason why Congress would want to give those solvent taxpayers this advantageous treatment?"

    {
      "speaker": "HALLETT",
      "speech": "I think what -- they clearly did that in 1984 when the Congress said that in the case of an S corporation, the amount is excluded if there's insolvency at the corporation level. They certainly recognized that by doing that, the benefit of the exclusion would come down to the shareholder who could well be solvent. And I think to the extent the legislative history reflects why they did that, it made it simpler to look to the insolvency of the corporation rather than up to 75 shareholders. They may well have recognized that in any situation, certainly not all, if the S corporation is in trouble, the shareholder is in trouble as well."

And if we look at Section 108(b), it only comes into play if an amount is excluded under Section 108(a). Now if it's not income and it's therefore, doesn't come within 108(a) because it otherwise wouldn't be income, then the attribute reduction process which the Commissioner places so much weight upon would never occur."

Some disaster must occur in the tax code since the government did at one point push this argument, but it stopped, I want to know what disaster occurs if you just take 108(d)(7)(a), in which it says these things will apply at the corporate level. It says it applies at the corporate level, those three sub -- four subsections, (a), (b), (c) and (g); (c) and (g) are just special cases, but (a) and (b) is the main case. It says they apply at the corporate level. What does that mean? It means it doesn't flow through. It's very simple; nothing flows through. The attributes don't flow through. Nothing flows through. All right. Now once you say that, that cures what seems an anomaly from a point of view of policy. Why don't we interpret it that way?"

      "speaker": "HALLETT",

Isn't that right? There were no losses left."

    {
      "speaker": "HALLETT",
      "speech": "True. Once we go through the process of determining how much the losses exceeded basis for the taxable year, as the statute tells us to do, if the losses are completely absorbed by the COD, if they are completely absorbed because of the increase in basis, then assuming there's no other attribute, assuming there's no basis in assets that can be reduced, that would be true."

    {
      "speaker": "HALLETT",
      "speech": "No, no, that's true. That's correct. And I would just point out, it's a very important concept of Section 108 that, I think it's -- you read the legislative history and it does admittedly talk about a purpose is to pick up the income in the future through the attribute reduction, but Congress allowed a very very important exception to that. And that's the full ability to use net operating loss carryovers or basis in the case of property sold in the year of discharge. Very very important, such that certainly many taxpayers are going to have excluded COD income but they are not going to have any attributes to be reduced. I don't believe the situation we have here is in any way an anomaly. We have absolute proof of that in one of the cases. The Pugh case, there were no attributes at all. There were no suspended losses, there was no basis in assets to reduce. And the Court of Appeals of course held that the COD passed through. So we know that situation. We know that situation exists."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Why do you say it's no anomaly? I would think with an ordinary corporation the chance of an insolvent corporation ending up with a lot of positive income in the year of insolvency is pretty low. With an individual, the chance of an individual ending up with a lot of positive income in the year of insolvency is pretty low. In the case of an S corporation, the chance that a shareholder of the insolvent S corporation could have a lot of positive income in that year is pretty high. And therefore, if we accept your intention for an S corporation, your interpretation, we reach as a practical matter quite a different result in terms of tax windfalls than you do in the other two instances."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALLETT",
      "speech": "Well, I think though in the other two instances, take a corporation that's in trouble and has net operating losses, it could well be the situation that it doesn't have any basis in its assets in excess of the liabilities. It excludes the amount from income and it doesn't have any attributes to reduce. That's what I'm saying; it's not an anomaly to have a situation such as we have in this case that whether it's a corporation, a regular corporation or a partnership, that we don't end up with any attributes to reduce, particularly because they can be used in the taxable year of the discharge."

That would be reduced. It would be reduced though specifically, Section 1017 says it would be reduced after the taxable year of the discharge, as of the beginning of that year. I would just call the Court's attention as well to one other section that I think solidifies that income is realized as a result of debt discharge and that's Section 108(e)(1) on page 43. And it specifically says there is no other insolvency exception to the general rule that COD is income to be included in gross income. And that general rule is provided in Section 61(a)(12). And finally on this matter, the Commissioner goes back to 1923 and cites court cases particularly in the depression era, and a Treasury regulation that was promulgated before the substantial 1980 revisions of Section 108. And I would point out that those court cases are flawed reasoning. The notion is that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "They are what, Mr. Hallett?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALLETT",
      "speech": "They represent flawed reasoning. The rationale in those cases that if a debtor realizes debt discharge, that there is no income if he's insolvent. Of course the Court held in 1931 in Kirby Lumber that as a general proposition there is income. And these cases in the depression era picked up on some language in Kirby Lumber about the forgiveness of the debt frees up assets . And they said well, if you're insolvent, it doesn't add to assets. And so there is no realization of income. That was the rationale of those cases. And I submit that just defies economic reality where a debtor has $2 million in debt, or $1 million in debt, or $100,000 in debt, and that is discharged. And if he's a few hundred dollars or a few hundred thousand dollars still insolvent after the discharge, that's a real economic benefit. He can take the amount that otherwise would be paid for principal and interest on that debt and apply it to expenses to keep going. When you recognize that the insolvency is determined based on the fair market value of the assets, it could well have a situation where the real estate operating assets, the value doesn't exceed the debts. But when a million dollars of debt is discharged, that money is indeed freed up. It does indeed free up the liquid assets to either pay down other debts or refinance or pay expenses. If that rationale applied, if that rationale applied, that would mean where a debtor is insolvent and sells an asset for a million dollar gain, that -- but is still insolvent, and say he takes the million dollars and uses it to pay off debt, if that rationale applied, there would be no income in that situation. Because after the transaction, even though he's had gain, he's still insolvent. That's not the tax law. And I submit that that transaction cannot be meaningfully distinguished from the situation where the debt is directly discharged. Let me turn briefly to the specific language of Sections 1366 and 1367. And I think there's a question of where do you start here. Do you start with Section 108 or do you start with Sections 1366 and 67? I don't think it makes a difference. Because if you start with Section 108, you go to 108(d)(7)(b). And that sends you over to Sections 1366 and Sections 1367. Sends you over to determine the amount of the losses that are disallowed for the taxable year of the discharge before you can determine that there is an attribute. And those, I would just point out that 1366 and 67 are very, very broad. This isn't a narrowly drawn statute. It says in 1366 that all items of income, including tax exempt income, are taken into account in determining shareholder basis. Congress described the reason for the basis increase in some of the legislative history as insuring that if an item is nontaxable, then if there's later a distribution, the shareholder doesn't have to recognize income as a result of the -- it preserves its nontaxability. The Commissioner seizes upon this stated purpose of a shareholder basis increase and argues that, well, that means that you only could increase basis for a nontaxable item if you get cash, money in the till that you can distribute in kind. Well, the statutes don't require that there be a distribution in kind. The statutes don't say that you have to lock the cash up in a safe deposit box and use it in the future for a distribution. The fact is if you have municipal bond interest that's collected and used to pay debt you are in the same situation on the bottom line balance sheet situation of the shareholder and the corporation. But the critical event here, and this is -- I'm glad the Commissioner brought up this notion of realization of income, because commentators and some of the courts have said that, well, you shouldn't give the shareholder the losses because he hasn't had an economic loss. Well, the point is, he's had an economic gain. It's the economic gain, the income, that Congress has chosen not to tax, that permits the taking of the losses. I would finally point out under Section 108 that -- excuse me; before I get to that I would point out that what we are asking for is consistent treatment here. An S corporation that gets excludable municipal bond interest is entitled to up the basis and take losses. And we ask for the same thing. The -- all other debtors who exclude COD income get to use their attributes in the year of discharge and we ask for the same thing. And this 108(d)(7)(b) has really been a matter of confusion. It hasn't been read closely. It requires that before you eliminate any losses you have to go over to Sections 1366 and 67 and determine if there is an excess of losses remaining after the COD income is taken into account. I will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal."

Secondly, that 108(d)(7) recognizes and is an emanation of that fact. The Tax Court rationale was that 108(d)(7) says all of this happens at the corporate level.

The closest example, and I don't believe it's quoted in the appendix, is 1368(b). And 1368(b) is a provision that says that if a Subchapter S corporation has no earnings and profits and makes a distribution to its shareholder, that won't be treated as income and under 1367 it will reduce their basis.

There are 31 separate -- 29 separate subsections of this statute that use the words \"gross income does not include\". And I take it in respect to every one of those but one, you will say they are items of income. And obviously one thing I would be reluctant to do is to take those same words \"gross income does not include\", and say that those are items of income in every instance but this one. Or in every instance but three. Or create a new spider web of rules as to when the words \"gross income does not include\" does mean it is none the less items of income but doesn't in other.

Because if you kept it at the corporate level no problem I can think of would be caused and it eliminate the loophole and seems consistent with the language, but you have not pushed that argument.

Its sort of an intellectual fussiness that causes us to address the income issue first and then the shareholder issue, I mean the corporate level issue. And that is because (d)(7) wasn't enacted, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out until 1984. But in 1980 Congress already went ahead and said this is not to be treated as an item of income; it's to be used to reduce attributes and it is to have no further tax consequences. So we shouldn't have to look to 1984 legislation in (d)(7) to answer this question. Now (d)(7) is consistent with our answer and therefore and it is a sufficient answer. But it seems to me to be perfectly faithful to what Congress said they did and to what the text of the these statutes permit us to understand. We don't have to go to 84. We can go right to where Congress said. And I want to point out in this respect that it is solely on the 1980 legislation that professors Victor and Lokin reviewed the history, reviewed the provisions and agreed with us that the discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent party does not represent an item of income and is to be ignored after it's applied against the tax attributes. Now what Petitioners' is: let's not ignore it, let's get a tax benefit from it. We'll pass it through as if it were income. We will get a basis adjustment that allows us to deduct the standard losses. And what they have done is used 108 to enhance their tax attributes when section 108(b) makes it clear that the whole point of 108(b) is to reduce tax attributes."

    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "I am not familiar with that. The contention that if it is not an item of income then its tax exempt income is also fundamentally flawed for the same reason. Its not tax exempt income because its not an accretion to wealth. Its not income in the first place."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "JONES",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And it also says it does not include income from a lot of other things. I mean, as Justice Breyer was pointing out earlier, there are a lot of other things as to which it says the same thing. And all it means is that although gross income would normally mean this, for purposes of subchapter S, it will not mean that. But that does not mean -- it is in the abstract, not income. I thought the argument you are making here"

      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "I don't have any objection to what you just said. I think it is perfection correct. I think it's a proper concern. But our point is that what you are supposed to, what we have to resolve here is what did Congress mean when it said items of income in 1366 because that's what flows through. Congress said this is not an item of income. And I say this, I mean the discharge of the debt of an insolvent. My only point about the congruence of 61 and 108 is that they cannot win on those provision because all those provision say is what we say: It's not income. And what the legislative history of the provisions say is exactly - is why we are here today ,which is that Congress has always said this isn't income. Has never permitted it to have any tax consequences other than attribute reduction. And I go back again to Victor and Loken. I mean, they are a pretty objective neutral source on this, and they agree with us, that this is not the way Congress used the term and that after it is used to reduce attributes, it's to be ignored. The reason."

And I don't understand their reasoning because the plain language of 108 says it is not an item of income. And the clear history of the statute says it should never be treated as one. And instead it is to be ignored after you reduce basis. I mean after you reduce the tax attributes."

      "speech": "As I explained to Justice Breyer, we think that the proper way to reach this, to analyze this is the way Congress did, to start with 108 in 1980. And then to point out that the amendment to (d)(7) in 1984 was consistent with that result and promoted that conclusion. Now, what the Tax Court did was different. They said, as Justice Breyer points out that all of this should be done at the corporate level and nothing escapes to the shareholders because it's all handled at the corporate level. I think that's a correct conclusion. But I think one of the reasons it's a correct conclusion is because there is no item of income that can escape to the shareholders and add to their basis and give them this double tax benefit wind fall. And I do want to point out that in each of these cases when a basis adjustment is allowed there is indeed a windfall there."

      "speech": "Could it not end up being a double tax in the other direction? Let's assume an insolvent chapter S corporation that later recovers. All right. The taxpayer would never have gotten the increase of his basis that arises from this reduction of indebtedness and therefore could not offset against any future gain that he gets from the corporation. Is that fair?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "I think that what you are pointing out is exactly the opposite of how Congress looked this situation. What Congress said was they are getting this immediate benefit not having this treated as income in the year that the debt is discharged. And recognize that they might benefit from that in future periods if they have income from other sources, Congress said I want to reduce the tax attributes, the favorable tax attributes, like suspended losses --"

      "speaker": "HALLETT",
      "speech": "With respect to Victor and Eustice Treatise, what it actually says is that COD income of an insolvent debtor is not gross income. And it's cited in the brief. Not one of the authorities cited by the government say that it is not realized. They say it's excluded from gross income. With respect to -- if the Commissioner were right that because an item is excluded from gross income, then none of the items excluded from gross income, life insurance proceeds, interest on municipal bonds, none of those would increase basis because they are not income and could not be an item of income. This double tax benefit. There is no tax benefit at all without a basis increase. The item just as well have been taxable. If it was taxable, the income would flow down to the shareholder. His basis would go up and he'd be able to his loss against the income. He'd end up with zero basis and zero income just the same position where the Commissioner urges he should end up here. Finally the Tenth Circuit did not develop the timing rule on its own. That rule is word for word what was urged upon it by the Justice Department in that case. This case has been a constant moving target. The only time the Commissioner argued the no realization was the first time this case was decided before then Chief Judge Cohen in Tax Court. She rejected it. It was never raised again until it was raised in the petition for certiorari in this brief. I submit, Your Honor, a plea on behalf of tax practitioners in this country. They should be able to read the Code as written. They shouldn't have to speculate as to whether or not a result that is called for on the plain language of the statute is too good to be true or is a wind fall. The tax laws are too complicated to have to get into that kind of speculation. Thank you."
