      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1986, Congress converted what had been before that time a merely peripheral concern of immigration policy -- that is, how to regulate worker authorization -- and converted it into a core concern of immigration policy by the passage of the -- of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. This Court has characterized that change in legislation as providing a comprehensive scheme for dealing with those issues, and that characterization is obviously apt because Congress provided for an exhaustive and exclusively Federal method of bringing to the attention of Federal authorities problems in worker authorization, the method by which those matters should be investigated, the method by which they should be adjudicated, all of which are controlled as a matter of Federal -- exclusive Federal activity; and, indeed, the ultimate judicial review goes exclusively to the Federal courts of appeals. The sanctioning provisions are very explicit and they're very clear and they are very balanced; and for a good reason. Congress realized in this context that if you over-enforce in one direction -- that is, if you try to deter the hiring of unauthorized workers -­ you run a very serious risk of causing employers to err on the side of not hiring others who are in fact authorized but who may fall into protected classes. And so Congress very carefully calibrated the penalties on both sides so that the employer essentially would play it straight down the middle and hire the best people for the job under these circumstances, while, of course, complying if at all possible with the Federal requirements. And so it's against that backdrop -­"

And I think what Congress said was -- I'm not going to deal with this problem in the kind of granular way you're looking at it, Justice Scalia, which is specifically at each of the individual employment decisions. I'm going to look at the generality of situations, and realize that if you put in -- on one side of the scale what Arizona has done here, which is to say you can -- you can essentially have the death penalty to the business, that is, complete eliminate the business's right to exist, and, on the other side of the scale, a $250 fine, it would -- it would be pretty remarkable to say, well, I -- you know, I'm going to hide behind the intent and knowing requirements and, instead, simply avoid if at all possible the risk of Arizona's sanctions being imposed upon me."

      "speech": "Right. It does ultimately does come down to the \"through licensing\" laws and -­ the -- the part of the -- and the fundamental problem, obviously, with Arizona's scheme here is that this is not a licensing law. This is a worker authorization sanctioning law."

But it really isn't. Your brief indicates you start with dictionaries, fair enough. You indicate what Federal licensing laws are. But I see no limitation on what the State can decide is a license in any jurisprudential principle that you've cited."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Right. Justice Kennedy, I think the better way to try to -- to grapple with the meaning of the licensing law or whether it ought to be construed broadly to allow the State wide authority to engage in supplemental enforcement in this, or narrowly in order to say that what really ought to happen in this context is, if you deal with a situation where the Federal Government has enacted -- I'm sorry -- has enforced a provision and imposed a penalty through the Federal scheme, that then as a supplement to that the State does in fact have the authority to add something over and above what it -- what the Federal Government has done. But it seems to me quite remarkable to think that Congress intended through a parenthetical referring to \"through licensing laws\" to allow the State to adopt an entire alternative shadow enforcement mechanism, a non-administrative decision-making process, completely a State-run operation; and even at the end, the sanction is not -- is not imposed ultimately in effect by the -­ by any regulating entity. It is ordered by a State court."

But what Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other States are in serious trouble financially and for other reasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration. And, therefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree this step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it to occur under this statute, but expectations change when the Federal Government has -- has simply not enforced the immigration restrictions."

And the -­ again, the notion -- if you look at the way the structure of the statute -- and this also responds in some ways to Justice Kennedy's question about how should you read licensing, since it's not a self-defining concept -- is if you -- is that, first, Congress said very specifically that the immigration laws should be enforced uniformly, which says that there shouldn't be 40,000 different localities offering up their view of licensing and -- and the additional 50 States. Second of all, and this part I think is particularly telling in terms of this massive State scheme that's been adopted, which is that under section 1324a(b)(5), which is in 134a of the -- of the appendix, Congress specifically outlaws the use of the I-9 form.

It's a little harder extending licensing to formation of a corporation, but when you issue a corporation charter you really do two things.

There are a group of people in Arizona, they may look as if they come from Mexico or speak with an Hispanic accent, and you're not certain whether they in fact are illegals or that they're legal. Now, think of that category. Congress has passed a statute that gives the employer just as much incentive to verify, so there's no discrimination, as to dismiss, so there's no illegal hiring. It's absolutely balanced. A $1,000 fine for the one, a $1,000 fine for the other. So Arizona comes along and says: I'll tell you what, if you discriminate, you know what happens to you? Nothing. But if you hire an illegal immigrant, your business is dead. That's just one thing they do. Now, how can you reconcile that intent to prevent discrimination against people because of their appearance or accent -­ how do you reconcile that with Arizona's law?

We also have criminal penalties if frivolous complaints are filed. Beyond that, we have the use of E-Verify, which is an added protection for employers to prevent the hiring of unauthorized aliens.

Arizona law that I was reading -- maybe there's another place I should read -- is it says, on determining whether he's an unauthorized alien, the court -- the court shall consider the Federal Government's determination. It creates a rebuttable presumption. That means it might be rebutted. Okay? So I see a difference there. And the reason that that's relevant is because, my first question, if I you are an employer, prior to your law, it's 50/50. better verify because if I'm discriminating, you know, da, da, da. And it's not that hard. I just look at the driver's license and I look at -- I'm home free, and the Social Security card, and if I hire an illegal immigrant, the same thing, da, da, da. Okay? So same both ways. Your law: Employer, look at the driver's license and Social Security, you are not home free. Employer, if it turns out that you've been hiring this illegal immigrant and he's not an American, your business is finished. But what happens if I discriminate? Under our law? Nothing.

It says -- the first thing it says is that, look, if you're found to have violated this -- where is it? It's page -- there it is. Suppose somebody has been found to have violated the sanctions provision in the Federal legislation. Now, you've found -- he has been found by the Federal Government. Then what the State does, it can revoke his license. Okay? That's one thing. And the second thing it says it wants -- doesn't want to pre-empt \"'fitness to do business laws,' such as State farm labor contracting laws or forestry laws.\" In other words, it's thinking of some precise set of licenses, and that's why this licensing thing was there. And the very next part of this Federal law are conforming amendments, and those conforming amendments apply to departments of government that were concerned with maintaining State farm labor contractor laws.

They also don't specifically say there has to be a prior Federal adjudication. That sentence has passive voice, \"has been determined,\" without specifying who is making that determination, and it specifically refers to State and local processes that provide for the suspension and revocation of State licenses. And then the sentence goes -- then there's a following sentence that says, you know, further, we don't intend to disrupt laws such as these forestry and other, you know, fitness to do business. We think this is a fitness to do business law in that we are establishing as a State standard that if you engage in this conduct of knowingly employing unauthorized aliens, we are going to have the ability to take an action against that license that we have given you to do business in our jurisdiction.

And I am -- there is that caution; it is good-faith use of -- of the I-9 system. We do have examples where, for example, if an employer is terminated because they are unauthorized and they show up with a different name and different papers 2 weeks later, you're not going to be able to establish your good faith. So you're home free but subject to that good-faith limitation. But we do incorporate the same obligations that exist under Federal law. And also I wanted to address more on the farm labor contractors and the amendments. And what we think that they were doing in those amendments was simply dividing responsibility at the Federal level between the Department of Labor and their processes that pre-existed IRCA, and what they were establishing in IRCA, and said we're not going to have these determinations of whether they -- the farm labor contractor has employed an unauthorized alien through a Department of Labor process; we're going to instead use the IRCA-established process. But, importantly, what Congress did not change in the agricultural worker regulations was the provision that addresses State law. It said, before IRCA and after IRCA, that those laws -- those Federal laws only supplement the authority of the States and that means that they preserved all of the State authority that they had before IRCA in the area of farm labor contractors. And that I think is reinforced by the legislative history that -- that again reinforces that those have been preserved through IRCA. This is an area that has traditionally been within the mainstream of State police power. We acknowledge that Congress does have the authority to pre-empt us, but they left important discretion in terms of our ability to impose sanctions through licensing and similar laws, and we are doing so by establishing this scheme that provides for the suspension and revocation of State licenses. It's an important part of the balance that Congress struck when it enacted IRCA by addressing what State authority would exist after that congressional enactment. We think the lower courts properly determined the scope of that provision. And unless there are further questions, I thank you for your attention this morning."

And what is the evidence that Congress did not intend that? Justice Breyer quoted from the House report, recognizing not everybody accepts that, but it does seem to me to articulate a very commonsense limitation that says you have to have a Federal adjudication in the first instance, and once you've got that, then the State is allowed to add that sanction. That -- that principle, it seems to me, is reinforced by the limitation on what you can use the I-9 for. Justice Alito, you asked that question, but it does seem to me quite clear that what Congress envisioned in 1986 when it adopted this is you're going to have an exclusively Federal enforcement scheme including the adjudicatory process, and it is only in that context that you are allowed to use the I-9. And the notion that the State could adopt a standard of intentional or knowingly, and not be able to have the I-9 materials available, seems to me flatly at odds with each other, and, therefore, it cannot be that Congress intended under those circumstances to allow these matters to be adjudicated in that particular fashion."

But remember, Congress was balancing three, at least, very difficult problems: minimizing burdens on the employers, minimizing discrimination against people who are permitted to be hired, and avoiding hiring people who are not permitted to do so. And how you properly reconcile that is very difficult, but the one thing that seems to me clear is that that was a choice Congress meant to leave to itself and to the Federal Government to sort out and not to give the States the opportunity to come in where they did.
