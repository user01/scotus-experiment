    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1986, Congress converted what had been before that time a merely peripheral concern of immigration policy -- that is, how to regulate worker authorization -- and converted it into a core concern of immigration policy by the passage of the -- of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. This Court has characterized that change in legislation as providing a comprehensive scheme for dealing with those issues, and that characterization is obviously apt because Congress provided for an Federal -- exclusive Federal activity; and, indeed, the ultimate judicial review goes exclusively to the Federal courts of appeals. The sanctioning provisions are very explicit and they're very clear and they are very balanced; and for a good reason. Congress realized in this context that if you over-enforce in one direction -- that is, if you try to deter the hiring of unauthorized workers -­ you run a very serious risk of causing employers to err on the side of not hiring others who are in fact authorized but who may fall into protected classes. And so Congress very carefully calibrated the penalties on both sides so that the employer essentially would play it straight down the middle and hire the best people for the job under these circumstances, while, of course, complying if at all possible with the Federal requirements. And so it's against that backdrop -­"

  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",

And I think what Congress said was -- I'm not going to deal with this problem in the kind of granular way you're looking at it, Justice Scalia, which is specifically at each of the individual employment decisions. I'm going to look at the generality of situations, and realize that if you put in -- on one side of the scale what Arizona has done here, which is to say you can -- you can essentially have the death penalty to the business, that is, complete eliminate the business's right to exist, and, on the other side of the scale, a $250 fine, it would -- it would be pretty remarkable to say, well, I -- you know, I'm going to hide behind the intent and knowing requirements and, instead, simply avoid if at all possible the risk of Arizona's sanctions being imposed upon me."

  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Right. Justice Kennedy, I think the better way to try to -- to grapple with the meaning of the licensing law or whether it ought to be construed broadly to allow the State wide authority to engage in supplemental enforcement in this, or narrowly in order to say that what really ought to happen in this context is, if you deal with a situation where the Federal Government has enacted -- I'm sorry -- has enforced a provision and imposed a penalty through the Federal scheme, that then as a supplement to that the State does in fact have the authority to add something over and above what it -- what the Federal Government has done. But it seems to me quite remarkable to think that Congress intended through a parenthetical referring to \"through licensing laws\" to allow the State to adopt an entire alternative shadow enforcement mechanism, a non-administrative decision-making process, completely a because nobody would think that, with this scheme in place, the Federal Government would not enforce it. Of course, no one would have expected that. But what Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other States are in serious trouble financially and for other reasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration. And, therefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree this step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it to occur under this statute, but expectations change when the Federal Government has -- has simply not enforced the immigration restrictions."

It's a little harder extending licensing to formation of a corporation, but when you issue a corporation charter you really do two things.

It's absolutely balanced. A $1,000 fine for the one, a $1,000 fine for the other. So Arizona comes along and says: I'll tell you what, if you discriminate, you know what happens to you? Nothing.

Now, how can you reconcile that intent to prevent discrimination against people because of their appearance or accent -­ how do you reconcile that with Arizona's law?

And I am -- there is that caution; it good faith. So you're home free but subject to that good-faith limitation. But we do incorporate the same obligations that exist under Federal law. And also I wanted to address more on the farm labor contractors and the amendments. And what we think that they were doing in those amendments was simply dividing responsibility at the Federal level between the Department of Labor and their processes that pre-existed IRCA, and what they were establishing in IRCA, and said we're not going to have these determinations of whether they -- the farm labor contractor has employed an unauthorized alien through a Department of Labor process; we're going to instead use the IRCA-established process. But, importantly, what Congress did not change in the agricultural worker regulations was the provision that addresses State law. It said, before IRCA and after IRCA, that those laws -- those Federal laws only supplement the authority of the States and that means that they preserved all of the State within the mainstream of State police power. We acknowledge that Congress does have the authority to pre-empt us, but they left important discretion in terms of our ability to impose sanctions through licensing and similar laws, and we are doing so by establishing this scheme that provides for the suspension and revocation of State licenses. It's an important part of the balance that Congress struck when it enacted IRCA by addressing what State authority would exist after that congressional enactment. We think the lower courts properly determined the scope of that provision. And unless there are further questions, I thank you for your attention this morning."

    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and, once again, may it please the Court: Congress did not intend that? Justice Breyer quoted from the House report, recognizing not everybody accepts that, but it does seem to me to articulate a very commonsense limitation that says you have to have a Federal adjudication in the first instance, and once you've got that, then the State is allowed to add that sanction. That -- that principle, it seems to me, is reinforced by the limitation on what you can use the I-9 for. Justice Alito, you asked that question, but it does seem to me quite clear that what Congress envisioned in 1986 when it adopted this is you're going to have an exclusively Federal enforcement scheme including the adjudicatory process, and it is only in that context that you are allowed to use the I-9. And the notion that the State could adopt a standard of intentional or knowingly, and not be able to have the I-9 materials available, seems to me flatly at odds with each other, and, therefore, it cannot be that Congress intended under those circumstances to allow these matters to be adjudicated in that particular fashion."

I think you have to decide it on a basis who are not permitted to do so. And how you properly reconcile that is very difficult, but the one thing that seems to me clear is that that was a choice Congress meant to leave to itself and to the Federal Government to sort out and not to give the States the opportunity to come in where they did.
