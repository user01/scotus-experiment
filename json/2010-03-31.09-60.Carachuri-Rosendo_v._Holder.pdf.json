  {
    "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Long-time lawful permanent resident aliens with two convictions for minor drug possession offenses are subject to removal from the United States, but they are not categorically ineligible to seek discretionary relief from removal from the Attorney General based on their connections and deep family ties to the country. Categorical ineligibility for discretionary relief arises under the Immigration and Nationality Act when a permanent resident has been, quote, \"convicted of an aggravated felony,\" close quote, with the relevant category here permanent residents who have been, quote, \"convicted of a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act,\" close quote. Individuals, such as Petitioner, who have been convicted of drug possession, but as to whom there has been no finding of recidivism, have been convicted of a misdemeanor punishable under the Controlled Substances Act rather than a felony."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Srinivasan, as a threshold question, is there a mootness problem here, because, as I understand it, the Petitioner came back to the country illegally and committed another minor crime? But his coming back illegally and being turned away again, as I understand the law, means that he cannot get any dispensation as a result of the illegal entry. So even if we were to hold in your favor now, I take it that he could not -- he would not have any hope of getting any cancellation of removal or any other dispensation. Is that so?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
    "speech": "That's not correct, Justice Ginsburg, in our view. And the government, it's notable, doesn't make a mootness argument. And I think the reason they don't is that the -- in Lopez, this Court understood that the initial removal doesn't annul the ability of an individual to get cancellation. And so, as Your Honor correctly observes, the question would be whether the reentry has an effect on the cancellation and the eligibility for cancellation. And it does not because Petitioner was removed again by reinstatement of the original removal order. And so, if there’s an argument that the initial removal order wasn't good because cancellation should have been granted, that also carries through to the reinstatement. And as a consequence of that procedural context, there is no mootness argument and I think that's why the government doesn't make -- doesn't take that position. So the question before the Court --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
    "speech": "No, it's not that his reentry wasn’t illegal. It's that when he was then again removed, that the -- the way that that was accomplished was by reinstatement of the original removal order."

    "speech": "-- but I think -- I think the way that gets taken into account is it would be one of the discretionary considerations that the Attorney General could take into account in determining whether to grant discretionary relief in the same way that the original conviction for drug possession could be taken into account. Our position --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "I -- I -- I think also in the picture is that he never contested removability. The only thing was the grace: Would -- would he qualify for discretionary relief by the Attorney General? So the -- the removal order itself, I take it, would stand."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
    "speech": "The removal order would stand, but if cancellation were granted, then he couldn't be removed pursuant to that removal order, because the -- the effect of granting cancellation would be that he’s no longer removable. He gets favorable discretionary relief that enables him to stay in the country. And I think the predicate of Your Honor's question is correct, that we don't contest removability. He was removable because of his drug possession -- drug possession conviction. The question is whether he retains eligibility to seek a favorable exercise of relief from the Attorney General based on affirmative equities in his -- in his favor, such as his deep family ties to the country, the presence of United States citizen children here, his lack of connections to the country to which he would be removed, his employment history, and considerations of that variety. And the question before the Court is whether he and other individuals who are similarly situated should have an opportunity to make that case to the Attorney General. He is removable. The question is whether the Attorney General is in a -- is in a position to grant him a favorable exercise of discretion. And we think the Attorney General is, because in order to be categorically ineligible for discretionary relief from removal, a permanent resident alien has to have been convicted of a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. And when you’ve been convicted of drug possession and there has been no finding of recidivism, you have been convicted of a misdemeanor punishable under the Controlled Substances Act."

You have to have the finding of recidivist in order for a felony sentence even to conceivably attach to an individual, and you just don't have that in the context of this case, where all you have is a conviction of drug possession alone. A felony sentence doesn't even come into the picture unless there’s a finding of recidivism."

And Justice Alito, I think it's important to understand -- and this goes to the second response to your question, Justice Scalia -- that the statute, the Immigration and Nationality Act, defines \"conviction\" in a particular way. It defines \"conviction\" as \"a formal judgment of guilt … entered by a court.\" As Your Honor's opinion for the Court in Deal v. United States understood, statutes could define convictions in one of two ways: It could define a conviction as a finding of guilty, or it could define a conviction as the formal judgment based on that finding."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Isn’t that right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
    "speech": "Under that statute -- different statutes conceive of it different ways, but the applicable definition of \"conviction\" here, because we’re talking about an immigration consequence, is the definition of \"conviction\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act. And that definition is set forth at page 2a of the appendix to our brief, the blue brief, the opening brief. And it's 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(48)(A), and it says that: \"The term 'conviction' means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court.\" And so, here you have \"a formal judgment of guilt\" as the operative definition of a conviction, and that formal judgment of guilt includes both the adjudication of guilt and the sentence. And so the important point to bear in mind is that at the time that the conviction, as defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act, is entered, we know whether the person has been found to have been a recidivist. At that point, the adjudication of guilt has happened, the sentence has been imposed, and we know whether a finding of recidivism has been made. In the absence of such a finding, the maximum sentence they could attach under Federal law, Justice Scalia, is a misdemeanor sentence of 1 year of imprisonment. A felony sentence is not on the table, and if the maximum sentence to which a person is subject is a misdemeanor sentence, the person has been -- has been convicted of a misdemeanor; they haven't been convicted of a felony. And that --"

He would only be subject to a misdemeanor sentence."

In that abstract sense, the person has committed recidivist possession, and if they were charged and found to have been a recidivist, they would be convicted of recidivist possession.

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Because there is no recidivist finding."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
    "speech": "They wouldn't have been convicted of recidivist possession. But it's important to note, Justice Kennedy, that doesn't mean that those prior convictions don't enter into the picture at all. They do, because, in the exercise of discretion by the Attorney General, the Attorney General can take into account any prior convictions, including those that don't render somebody categorically ineligible. All we’re talking about here is whether the person has a chance to make a discretionary case. They do have that chance in Your Honor's hypothetical, but those convictions would be taken into account. Now, I want to point out, though, that there’s another reason that I think the fact that in that prosecutor does prosecute under an available recidivist possession offense, then that would count because the State prosecutor would have brought the charge, the finding by hypothesis would have been made. That would be felony recidivist possession under Federal law, and there would be categorical ineligibility. Now, I think what may be -- what may be sort of lurking beneath Your Honor's question is the recognition that the Federal consequences of a State conviction are going to turn on State prosecutorial decisions. That's true. But that's a fixed feature of any scheme in which Federal immigration consequences turns on what happens in State court, and this Court's decision in Lopez recognizes that. For example, States -- several States don't have a Federal offense of possession with intent to distribute drugs. That's a Federal offense. What States, some States, have instead is possession with a degree of penalty attached to the amount of drugs possessed. They don't have the separate offense of possession with intent to distribute. Now, the fact that certain States don't have that offense doesn't mean that an individual who is convicted of state possession with no finding of an intent to distribute would be categorically ineligible for discretionary relief from removal, because what Congress understood was that some States will have qualifying offenses and some States won't. In those States that do, where the State has the offense and where the State prosecutor makes the decision to charge under that offense will -- at that point the State conviction will count as a Federal felony. It will be a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, and the person at that point would be categorically ineligible for discretionary relief."

Now, I -- as I understand what Your Honor is suggesting, you could look at all the -- the ken of individuals who have been convicted of State possession and you could ask as a matter of fact, do they in fact possess with intent to distribute?

But that doesn't happen in a situation in which the fact of a prior conviction is taken into account, for example, under a presentencing report. It doesn't raise the statutory maximum, and there’s no formal judgment entered based on that determination by the court. And so that's the distinction. And I think the relevant way to look at it is you take account of what would happen in the Federal system and you ask: Would it have the consequence in the Federal system of rendering somebody guilty of the felony of recidivist possession as opposed to the misdemeanor of simple possession? And it wouldn't in the Federal system, and by parity of reasoning it also would not have that consequence in the State system."

What -- what is the difference between someone who is found by a court under a State recidivism provision to have -- to be eligible for an increased punishment as a result of that finding and someone who is found by a court in the context of sentencing, discretionary sentencing, to have a felony possession,  to have a prior -- a prior conviction and receives an increased sentence as a result of that?"

But one way to look at it is to ask, suppose that a State or even Federal law made it salient for sentencing purposes whether somebody intended to distribute when they possessed. They were convicted of drug possession. There is an offense of possession with intent to distribute, but they’re not charged with that offense; they’re charged with drug possession. And then sentencing somehow makes it salient, not for purposes of raising the statutory maximum, but just for purposes of sentencing within the range whether the person intended to distribute. I don't think anybody would say that the individual was convicted of the felony of possession with intent to distribute because the -- the judge in sentencing took into account an intent to distribute in some way under a sentencing scheme."

And the reason that matters is that under this statute, the person has to have been convicted of a felony, and the only way they’re convicted of a felony is the offense of which they are convicted can lead to a felony sentence. And the sentencing factor in this case of recidivism is necessary in order to give rise to a Federal sentence. In the absence of that finding, the person has been convicted of a misdemeanor, because the maximum sentence they can receive is a misdemeanor sentence of 1 year of imprisonment. If the Court has no further questions, I’d like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal."

So what it tells us to do -- and we said the same thing in Nijhawan, and I have written in other opinions the same thing -- you go read the State statute. Forget what he's done. Read the statute and see if the statute proscribes conduct that would amount to a felony under Federal law. So let us read the statute. We turn to the statute of conviction. What it says is it is a class A misdemeanor for which you are punishable of less than a year if you possess less than 28 grams or whatever. It says nothing about recidivism. There is no increased punishment for recidivism. So all we did was read the statute. The statute does not proscribe conduct that would be a felony under Federal law; it proscribes conduct that would be a misdemeanor. QED.

He was convicted of drug possession in State court. That's what he would have been convicted of in Federal court. But the fact that he was convicted of drug possession doesn't answer the separate question of how that offense is punishable. If it were his first offense, it would be punishable as a misdemeanor. If it was his second offense, it would be punishable as a felony. And we think that that -- that approach is dictated by two different opinions, the first of which is Lopez, which says we look for a correspondence between the State offense and the Federal offense, but then we also have this question of how the offense is punishable in Federal court, and this punishability question is extremely relevant.

There is an entire body of law that when a conviction has been vacated, it doesn't count as a conviction under the immigration proceedings. So the answer is if it is a person in State court and they think that there’s a problem with their underlying conviction, they need to go to State court or use whatever procedures are available for challenging that.

Lopez said that we have a question here about whether the State offense -- and a State offense is made up of here drug possession; recidivism isn't something that you’re convicted of, it's a sentencing factor. You look at the State offense and you see does it correspond to a Federal offense? Here it does. There is State drug possession; there is Federal drug possession. And then you ask another question. And this Court said in Lopez that that's an important question because we care about what Congress thought, which is how is this offense punishable under Federal law. This is a two-part inquiry where the first part, the offense elements, does need to be established in State court, and the second part, which goes to how it is punishable, does not need to be established in State court.

So, what we’re talking about are these procedures that are necessary. And it's not a finding of a valid conviction. It's -- it's a long set of procedures. There doesn't necessarily need to be a finding of a valid conviction if the defendant doesn't object at all. There's burden shifting. It's very complicated. Congress did not apply it to the immigration code by its terms. It's not applicable to the States by its terms.

This statute not only doesn't deal with it at the punishment stage; it's forbidden to take it into account because what this says is you can only get recidivism if you previously had a conviction for a class A misdemeanor, and the prior conviction here was a class B; and, therefore, one thing we know about the statute is that under this statute, his behavior as a recidivist is as close to irrelevant as you could make it. That's why I’m back to the cat burglar."

    "speech": "Right. And what -- what I'm suggesting about that State statute is that -- and this Court said this in Lopez -- that Congress didn't want those variations in State law to change the treatment for individual offenders. What it wanted, and it did this in aggravated felony provisions, all throughout them, is to identify categories of persons who had done certain conduct that Congress thought was serious enough and treat them all the same for immigration purposes. And the Court said in Lopez, we’re not going to make the way that State law treats recidivism -- or we're not going to make State law treats an offense change the outcome. The outcome is going to be based on how Federal law treats the offense. And that's why, to get back to one of my earlier answers to your questions, we think that this Court's decision in Nijhawan is extremely important here, because what the Court recognized in that decision is that Congress, in defining an aggravated felony, sometimes talks about required elements of the offense, and it sometimes talks about extra facts that can be established in the immigration court. In Nijhawan, there was a fraud or deceit offense with this extra fact of this loss amount of $10,000 or more. And Congress did the same thing in this provision. They had --"

This is I think on page -- right at the beginning of the appendix to our brief. If you look at page 1a of the gray brief. You know, there are two different parts here. In 43(B), there is “illicit trafficking in a controlled substance … including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c)).” So this -- this first part, illicit trafficking, is like a generic burglary type offense where you need to just look at whether the -- essentially elements correspond under a modified categorical approach. But then the second part of it, the drug trafficking crime, is the one that's defined as a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. And when you look at a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, which this Court interpreted in Lopez as a -- an offense that is punishable as a felony under Federal law, it is just like Nijhawan. It is an offense with a certain extra fact. In Nijhawan, it was a fraud --"

    "speech": "-- because your time is running out. I take it your answer would be the same -- at least these two misdemeanors were committed a year apart, but if they were 10 years apart, your answer would still be the same?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAHARSKY",
    "speech": "Yes, and I think that’s because Congress has said when it wants the -- the timing to matter. For example, in the end of the aggravated felony definitions, Congress said it didn't want felony convictions that were more than 15 years old to matter. You know, Congress -- when it wants something old not to matter, it says so, an older conviction. So we don't think that there would be a difference for that purpose. So I just want to make sure I’ve answered the question. We just think this is like that situation where you have a conviction for a certain type of offense, which here is drug possession, and an extra fact, how it’s punishable in Federal court, and that extra fact can be established in immigration court. It's not the kind thing that this Court has said under Almendarez-Torres needs to be treated like an offense element. I should note that --- and this is the point you made, Justice Breyer, that there was not a recidivist enhancement available in Texas court. Justice Kennedy, that just highlights some of the problems that you identified in terms of the wide variations that we would see in how similarly situated people who have done the same things, two drug possession offenses, would be treated differently under the immigration laws. And that's just not what Congress intended. We talk in our brief -- and there’s a long list of differences in State laws, not only in the State procedures, which vary widely from Federal court, but in the State laws in terms of, you know, if you can consider a second possession offense for recidivist enhancement, or only a third or fourth; whether the first offense has to be final, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. That there -- these differences would just lead to a -- a patchwork application laws of the immigration laws, and if there’s any place where we don't want that, it's -- it's in immigration, with respect to immigration consequences."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAHARSKY",
    "speech": "In neither case does the prosecutor's judgment matter. What matters is the offense conduct that was established by the conviction in State court. What matters is the offense that the person was convicted of and if that corresponds to a Federal offense that was punishable as a felony in Federal court. It is true that some charges may be brought and some charges may not be brought, and that would impact what a person has been convicted of. So there could be disparities based on that. But what Congress decided was that it had to balance its need for uniformity with a rule that is administrable, and the rule that it picked as administrable is, let's look at the offense conduct that was established by the conviction. And when you look at that offense conduct, you have to ask how it could be punished in Federal court. And it's that “punishable” language that requires this more hypothetical inquiry on how the events -- how the offense could be treated. And just to summarize, it is clear from the last 20 years that Congress has had a very serious concern about recidivist criminal aliens in the United States, and Congress has made a judgment since 1970 in the drug laws that two drug possession offenses should be punishable as a felony. And under those circumstances, a person who concededly has committed those two drug offenses and who concededly, if taken to Federal court, could have been punished as a felony, just should not be able to escape the aggravated felony designation that Congress intended for all aliens who are similarly situated. If the Court has no further questions, we submit the judgment below should be affirmed."

And the Court focused on the fact that the text read \"in which.\" That was critical, and another thing that was critical in provision is one where you don't look to real conduct. She said that was a mistake, really. It was overstated, because what they’re saying is that recidivism analogous to the $10,000 was meant to be a real conduct aspect, not just offense of conviction, and -- and she gave similar reasons. That's why -- similar reasons are that the States are too mixed up in this; it will be too difficult to look at that element itself. So she’s trying to analogize that to the Now, why isn't that a good analogy?"

It would absolutely have practical implications under our reading, because anytime a person was found to have been a recidivist and their sentence was raised, their maximum sentence was raised as a consequence, they will have been deemed to have been aggravated felon. But here, that didn't happen. You'd have to understand that in the Federal system, even though an individual could not as a matter of law be sentenced as a felon, they nonetheless would have been deemed to have been convicted of a felony, and at the very least -- and this is the second point I'd like to make, if I could just --"
