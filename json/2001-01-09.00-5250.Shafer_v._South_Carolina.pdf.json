South Carolina. First, the South Carolina supreme court cited a -- an extraneous feature of a post-Simmons amendment which, the main thrust of which was to abolish parole in all cases of murder, to hold that Simmons v. South Carolina does not apply to South Carolina. Secondly, the State argues that even though Simmons recognized a due process right to inform the jury that the defendant was ineligible for parole, arguments of counsel and instructions of the court that never did that nevertheless somehow satisfy the due process requirements of Simmons in any event, and finally the State argues, seizing on a single word culled from the opinions in Simmons, the word argue, submits that because counsel rather self-evidently, out a desire to evade and avoid the due process rule in Simmons, declined to drive home in jury argument their future dangerousness case as it had been presented to the jury, therefore the rule in Simmons was not triggered."

      "speech": "That's correct, and here I think the State court is simply confused about what Simmons required. The South Carolina procedure is that the -- a jury is instructed to determine first whether any statutory aggravating circumstance is shown. This is a Georgia-type nonweighing statute in which the finding of an aggravator is a threshold finding. The jury is instructed, pursuant to the statute, and this jury was instructed that if the jury does not unanimously find the existence of a statutory aggravating factor, it goes no further. It does not sentence. It simply reports its failure to find the aggravator to the judge, and the judge sentences, and at that point the judge has the option, and only under those circumstances the judge has the option of either imposing a 30-calendar-year sentence or life, of course without the possibility of parole."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCK",
      "speech": "Well, that's correct, because that's all the jury needs to know. That's the jury's job. Once the jury finds an aggravating factor, then and only then the jury becomes the sentencer. Prior to that time, they don't need to know about parole. They don't need to know about aggravation, mitigation. They don't need to know anything."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And the 30-year alternative doesn't exist if aggravating circumstances have been found."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCK",
      "speech": "That's -- if they have them, that's exactly correct, and so the judge correctly told the jury, if you find aggravation, then you become the sentencer, and there are only two alternatives, the death penalty or life imprisonment. This is exactly the situation in Simmons. It cannot be distinguished. The only difference is that the -- if the jury never acquires sentencing responsibility in the first place, there is another option. There's no reason why the jury should know about that. It's not part of their job. It's not part of their responsibility. The State supreme court just yesterday filed another case which my friend helpfully filed, lodged with the court yesterday, State v. Kelly, in which the court finally explained its rationale -- this is the State supreme court -- for this holding. It said in Kelly that where another sentence other than life without parole was available to the defendant as an alternative to the death penalty -- this is at page 11 of the slip opinion -- then a Simmons charge would actually mislead the jury by representing that the defendant would never be released from prison, when, in fact, a 30-year sentence is a potential sentence for the defendant. Now, it's clear what has happened. This explanation doesn't appear in the Shafer case or in the accompanying Starnes case, but now apparently the South Carolina supreme court is laboring under the misconception that a Simmons instruction is a prediction to the jury as to the defendant's fate, rather than an explanation of the sentencing option of life imprisonment that the jury is given. Of course, the Simmons instruction is the latter. It has nothing to do with a prediction about what is going to happen to the defendant as of this moment, when the jury hasn't yet found aggravation. In any event, none of this really matters. The -- it's quite clear, I think, that Justice Kennedy's plurality opinion in Ramdass, which we quoted in our brief and, indeed, in the question presented in the cert petition, three times stated the holding of Simmons in a way that precisely encompasses this case. He said, the parole eligibility instruction is -- of Simmons is required only when, assuming the jury fixes the sentence at life, the defendant is ineligible for parole under State law. Simmons applies elsewhere in the opinion only to instances where, as a legal matter, there is no possibility of parole if the jury decides the appropriate sentence is life imprisonment, and I can go on. That is the holding of Simmons. That is the holding which was clearly violated in this case and which, according to the South Carolina supreme court, no longer applies in South Carolina. Now, clearly a mistake has been made and we submit that it should be corrected. This leaves the question of what to do with this case. The State asks you to remand the case back to the South Carolina supreme court to perform the rest of the Simmons analysis. We submit that the case has been fully briefed and fully argued as to every aspect of Simmons below. Surely if the South Carolina supreme court thought that future dangerousness had not been placed in issue in this case, they would not have gone to such a constitutionally tenuous attempt to reconsider the first --"

There it seems to me that the argumentation by the prosecution was really much more geared towards future dangerousness even than yours, and even in that case the supreme court of South Carolina thought that that issue had not been submitted to the jury in a way to trigger the Simmons instruction."

    {
      "speaker": "BRUCK",

In Kelly they actually used the word dangerousness, and apparently that's still not enough, so I was coming around to saying that while I had thought that South Carolina did not accept the State's argument on the dangerousness prong of Simmons, Kelly does cast that into some light. Certainly, this whole little saga leaves us with the -- I think should leave the Court with some confidence that it's time to decide this case, the whole aspect of it."

We should keep in mind, though, the nature of the South Carolina statute, in which it is especially difficult, I agree, to draw a line. This is a very open-ended statute, in which there is no limitation on the nonstatutory evidence that the jury may consider as weighing on the death side of the question. Once a statutory aggravator is found, in this case the entire penalty phase showing by the State consists of Wesley Shafer's prior convictions for criminal sexual conduct and burglary, his failure as a, quote, high-risk probationer, who is incapable of rehabilitation, according to the State's claims and evidence, who is prone to angry outbursts of explosive behavior even in the highly restrictive confines of the Union County jail, and who exhibits lack of remorse and lack of insight about his prior behavior. Now, this is a classic showing of future dangerousness. This is exactly why --"

He'll be a danger to other inmates in the prison whether he's going to be paroled or not, so don't you have to establish that what has been argued is future dangerousness to the general public?"

    {
      "speaker": "BRUCK",
      "speech": "No. In fact, this is an argument which has almost run its course in the entire Nation. By our count there are 37 States that have a policy, statute, rule or court decision on this issue. 35 of them tell the jury the law about parole release, which in most cases is no parole release. The only States in which Simmons has any application at all, and I include South Carolina here, although the State supreme court says it has almost none, are Pennsylvania and South Carolina, and Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania supreme court is divided 4 to 3 on whether to give a Simmons instruction in every case, and there is an arguable distinction in Pennsylvania that does not apply in South Carolina, a way of distinguishing the two States, which is that in Pennsylvania aggravation is limited. This Court knows the statute from Blystone v. Pennsylvania. Only designated statutory aggravating factors may be considered as reasons to impose the death penalty, and future dangerousness is not one of them, so in theory there is nowhere for the jury to give aggravating weight to the likely dangerous behavior of the defendant. Nevertheless, when the argument is made, the State supreme court has required that a Simmons instruction be given. That is the entire roster of States that don't just tell the jury what's going to happen if they spare this man's life, so as I say, this is an issue, a debate which is really to all intents and purposes virtually over, except in South Carolina. Now, part of -- I think part of the proof that -- and it does not depend on the jury's questions, but the jury's questions really remind us that we really have encountered a pretty serious problem here. The jury, why did they ask? Why would they have asked about parole, if not for the fact, having found an aggravating circumstance and turned to their sentencing responsibility, they were worried about whether he was going to get out or not because he was dangerous. Parole is relevant because of future dangerousness, and that is probably what was happening. The prosecutor's evidence, his case of dangerousness, did resonate with this jury, which is entirely to be expected. As I was getting ready to say, if -- if an actual formal argument or statutory allegation were required to trigger the rule in Simmons, then it would be entirely all right for the prosecution to do everything they could through evidence --"

For three separate reasons, we submit the South Carolina trial judge in 1998 did not violate due process or the mandates of this Court in Simmons in failing to specifically instruct the jury that the petitioner was parole-ineligible."

With respect to the second issue, we submit that while the South Carolina supreme court did not expressly decide future dangerousness as additional sustaining grounds, Simmons did not apply in this situation because future dangerousness was neither presented by the evidence nor argued in this particular situation by the prosecutor from Union County. Particularly, this Court determined that when the State argues future dangerousness, it urges the jury to sentence an individual to death so that he will no longer be a threat to society. That was not the presentation that was made in this particular case by the prosecution. In fact, at the time, prior to the determination of the sentencing instructions, the trial judge conceded that future dangerousness had not been presented in this case. The prosecutor, recognizing the ability in Simmons that it was their option to not argue future dangerousness, which would not bring the parole issue before the jury, chose not to do that, and expressly stated to the court that it was not going to do that."

It was a victims' impact statement in a phrase as to what exact had -- exactly had occurred at the time. They testified about what occurred with them, and we think that that was fair comment. It was not comment upon future dangerousness. Similarly, we submit that the presentation of the evidence that was presented in the penalty phase of the trial concerning his prior records, that does not go to future dangerousness. That goes simply to the character of this defendant. There's nothing that was utilized about those records to show that he, in fact, would have a propensity to commit the crime in the future.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "Pennsylvania would be directly affected by it. The cases we cite in Pennsylvania look to whether an argument of future dangerousness is given. They've determined arguments or evidence of future dangerousness are not given when they have an aggravating factor, if the defendant has a prior history of violent crimes, when his prior record is presented. They look, in the same way we submit the South Carolina supreme court has been looking, as to whether in fact future dangerousness is there. In fact, I believe the Pennsylvania supreme court says future dangerousness has to be specifically pointed out to the jury for that argument to in fact come in, so Pennsylvania would be also directly affected by whether that future dangerousness --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Your opponent tells us that South Carolina and Pennsylvania are the only two States who are sort of the rear guard against giving the Simmons instruction. Just so you have a fair opportunity, would you tell what is the State's interest that's really served by refusing to give the instruction that most States seem to think pretty ordinary?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "Well, I think the State interest is basically that the supreme court of South Carolina wants the jurors to focus on the particular characteristics of the defendant and the particular circumstances of the crime, and not be concerned with potential collateral matters such as potential release which may divert the attentions to some speculative issue which may not in fact ever occur, that in fact the life in prison that they would get with the jury sentence, whether it's parole-eligible or not, may, in fact, under the unique characteristics of this defendant, be as much as a life sentence whether there's parole eligibility or not, that he would serve the entire time in prison. Again, addressing one of the questions about the existence of pardon, pardon exists in South Carolina. It's not in the hands of the Governor. It's in the hands of the South Carolina Department of Probation and Parole. They make that determination, so that also does exist as soon as a conviction is entered on any inmate in South Carolina."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "I suppose that a State could game the system, couldn't it, by providing for parole eligibility even when there is a life imprisonment sentence but appointing a parole commission that is so tough that it never gives parole. Then the jury would be instructed that unless you condemn this person to death, there's a possibility that he'll be paroled, although in fact the possibility's not very realistic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "I think that's the State interest that is concerned about going into those collateral matters, that in fact those issues may weigh upon the jurors' decision but may not, in fact, be what exactly happens, because the parole board may be such that it would never parole. There may be a parole board that always paroles, but again there's -- they're elected every 4 years, essentially, in South Carolina and that may change every 4 years, so we can't predict how that situation would arise any more than pardon, any more than a change of law. We submit that the instructions that were given in this case adequately complied with South Carolina law. Further, if -- we also submit that in fact what occurred in this case should be seen to satisfy Simmons because, as I said, the jury was instructed on three occasions that life imprisonment in fact means until death of the offender, that life imprisonment in fact means incarceration until the death of the offender. That is not the --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But when a jury asks -- I mean, obviously this jury thought that was ambiguous because they asked the judge, in effect, what does it mean --"

      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "They --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And the judge did read the statute up to that point, life imprisonment means until death of the offender, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "That's correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And just didn't go on with the rest of the statute, which would have made it plain what that meant."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "Well, we take the position that it was plain that life imprisonment means until the death of the offender in fact means imprisonment until the death of the offender. Reasonable juries we think should understand that, and --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But when the judge couples that with a statement, now, don't you worry about parole, that's none of your business, the implication is that there is such a thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "Well, consistent with South Carolina law they said that parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration, but that followed the language that life imprisonment means until the death of the offender. We think a juror should have understood that to mean, in fact, that he will be in prison forever."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But if that's the case it would be just harmless to give me -- it would be harmless to give them the additional sentence, if you're reading is correct. Why not read the other sentence and remove any doubt?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "Because under South Carolina law they were required under State v. Southerland to limit the way that answer was made, and the judge was complying with the South Carolina law mandate on that, but also the jury did not appear to be confused because, consistent with this Court's opinion in Weeks v. Angelone, they're presumed to follow their oath and instructions, and they did not come back and ask a further question after they received that information. The defense counsel was not prevented from making his argument that the defendant, in fact, would serve life in prison, in jail. In fact, it's clear that with the information the defense counsel made, they stated, and it's set forth at page 39 and 40 of our brief, that the question is, will the State execute him, or will he just die in prison? We ask that he be able to spend his natural life there. Life in prison until death. Wesley Shafer is going to prison and staying there."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But is not the case that the defense attorney asked if he could read the rest of the statute, including, starting with no person sentenced to life in prison is eligible for parole? He was not -- he wanted to read that, and he was not allowed to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "That's correct. He asked that that be read as part of the instruction, and he was not authorized to have that happen. The judge made a determination that that shouldn't be presented, because --"

    {
      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "No, I don't recall that occurring within this particular record. It may have, but my understanding was, what he was seeking to do was to in fact have the judge make that instruction at the time -- at the outset of the case, that that language be given. Now, if the judge made that instruction --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Can you check the record and tell us if that's the case? Not right now, you have no time left, but advise us subsequently?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZELENKA",
      "speech": "Yes, I will. I know that there was an earlier motion in limine made by the prosecution that he not be able to say that there -- the defendant be in prison for the rest of his life. That was removed, based upon the way the instructions ended up coming and, in fact, the defense counsel at page 198 said, when they say give him life, he's not going home, a child spend the rest of his life in prison, send a 19-year-old to prison for the rest of his life, was the argument that he made. We submit that due process in this particular case was satisfied. There was no false dilemma presented by either the facts or circumstances, or the law as defined in this particular case, and we would request that the conviction and death sentence of Wesley Shafer be affirmed."

    {
      "speaker": "BRUCK",
      "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. Justice O'Connor asked whether the prosecutor or judges had the power to give this instruction whether Simmons is seen to require it or not. In the record of this case that you have here, there is an excerpt from a subsequent case tried by the same trial judge, Judge Hayes, State v. Robertson, which was added to this record in the lower court, in which the same argument by the same prosecutors in an adjoining county was made in which Judge Hayes ruled that he would give the instruction and stated, this has bothered me ever since the Shafer case, so until the Shafer decision from the State supreme court, this was an area of considerable discretion and, in fact, most prosecutors didn't make an issue of it and the instruction was very often given. But now, the South Carolina supreme court has made quite clear that except in very rare cases involving a recidivist statute that's almost never invoked, the life-without-parole section of the statute will never be given unless this Court rules otherwise under the Simmons case. The last thing I want to say is that the near-unanimity of the States on this issue really does demonstrate, I think, a paradigmatic example of a due process violation, where the considered judgments of the American people on this claim, as expressed through their courts and legislatures, is already quite, quite clear. Now, I had thought that Simmons was also clear as to what the Due Process Clause required, but clearly in South Carolina it is not clear enough, so I would hope that this Court will decide all of the issues that are presented by this record whether the South Carolina supreme court reached them or not. I think there's no need for another analysis such as went on in the Kelly case."

      "speech": "Mr. Bruck, do you know the answer to the question that was asked about -- I was under the impression that defense counsel had asked to be allowed to say this, or was told he couldn't say it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCK",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I was under that impression, too, and I was just looking through the joint appendix right now. I recall Mr. Banks, defense counsel, saying that he wanted to read that to the jury, but I can't put my finger on it right now. If I may, I will file a letter with the Clerk giving the citation if, in fact, my recollection is correct. And for those reasons we hope that the Court will take up all of the issues presented by this case and will reverse the death sentence imposed."
