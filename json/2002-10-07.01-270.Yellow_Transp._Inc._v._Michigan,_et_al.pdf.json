      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is a narrow one, but it has considerable practical importance for the continuing flow of interstate commerce. In 1991, Congress enacted a statute that was designed to ease the burdens that State registration fees impose on trucks that travel interstate. To help accomplish that purpose, the statute provides that a State's registration fee may not exceed the fee that the State collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991. The question here before the Court is whether that Federal standard precludes a State from now imposing a fee on a category of trucks when the State waived the fee as to that category of trucks and therefore did not actually collect or charge it as of the controlling date."

It's my -- our understanding that there were trucks that were not benefitting from the reciprocity policy and therefore they would have paid fees. So I think -- I think that the answer, although not reflected in the record, is that some trucks paid fees and some did not."

    {
      "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
      "speech": "Well, we think that the inquiry that's posed by the statute is how were trucks of a particular type treated. And for example, imagine if a State had in place a sliding scale of fees as to different types of trucks at $10 for red trucks, $5 for white trucks, and nothing for blue trucks. The statute refers to in -- in terms -- it says that the State's fee must equal the fee not to exceed $10 per vehicle that the State collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991. Well, what in that -- in that circumstance, what is the fee that the State charged when there are these different categories of trucks? We think it has to be understood to mean the fee that the State charged to trucks of that type, and so, as I say, in 1991 in Michigan trucks of a particular type, trucks that were base-plated in the State of Illinois, were not subject to fees. We, therefore, think that under the plain language of the statute, the same policy has to apply to trucks in that category now."

And therefore, Yellow Transportation, the petitioner here, whose trucks were base-plated in -- in Illinois did not pay fees. It is true, Justice O'Connor, that in -- towards the end of 1991, prior to November 15th, the State announced a change for the 1992 registration year, and Yellow, being a diligent taxpayer, actually paid for 1992 prior to November 15th."

And so the license plates here for Yellow trucks, it is sort of undisputed, were provided by Illinois. So there is no question that within the understanding of -- of the Michigan scheme in 1991, the Yellow trucks were based in Illinois and therefore benefitted from the reciprocity policy in place in -- in Michigan."

I -- I mean the category -- the rule that the State applied in 1991 -- the State had in place a system of rules that applied, different -- as we know, different fees to different types of trucks. Let me give you an example. Imagine that the State had a scheme in place in which it charged $10 for red trucks, $5 for white trucks, nothing for blue trucks, as I suggested before. What is the -- what is the fee that the State applied? You have to say the fee the State applied to who and look at the rule that the State would have applied in 1991. And that means identifying the type of truck in the sense of how would the rule categorize it. And Congress has frozen in place, we believe, the rules that governed fee levels at the time.

So in the intervening years, the State could have done whatever -- whatever it wished. We think that Congress has frozen the fee levels in place. Now, whether those fee levels were established by reciprocity rule or by unilateral State law or by administrative fiat, it wouldn't matter. The State had in place in 1991 a policy that said trucks of a certain character, trucks in this instance license plated in a -- in Illinois, were not subject to fees. Fees were not demanded from those trucks. They weren't collected. They weren't charged. Those trucks did not have to pay a fee to entitle them to operate on the State's roads as of the relevant period.

That is a characteristic this truck has, which is relevant under our rule, because our rule says under our existing reciprocity policy, we will not impose a fee on a truck that has its license plate issued by Illinois. Therefore, this truck is not subject to a fee. If such a truck comes along in 1995, after the statute goes into effect -- and I should say the statute here is the refreshing acronym, ISTEA, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. When the ISTEA statute went into effect, this same -- same truck goes into the State of Michigan. It has characteristics which waive the fee to -- as to it, had this truck been there in 1991, those same characteristics make the State waive the fee as to it now, because Congress has -- has used the term the State may not charge fees that it was not charging in 1991. Again, the precise language is the State's fee must equal the fee that the State collected or charged."

And if -- it is our view that the -- that the statutory language is -- is unambiguous, but if we are wrong about that and if there is any opportunity to find any sort of -- any wiggle room for the State in the statute, there is no doubt that the statute does not unambiguously require that reciprocity -- requires States to -- to change their reciprocity rules because the State -- the -- the statute refers, as I say, only to the fee that was charged. It certainly doesn't say that States may change rules, particular types of rules. And that being the case, Chevron deference is mandatory. Here, in fact, agency deference should be at its height. The agency here was expressly delegated by Congress the responsibility for promulgating interpretations of the ISTEA legislation. It conducted notice and comment rulemaking. It received dozens of comments from all interested parties, including the State of Michigan. It issued regulations. It issued formal interpretations of the statute. It published a closely reasoned explanation for its conclusion. And in those circumstances, I think every member of the Court has recognized that deference under Chevron principles is at its height, and because I think it -- it simply cannot be said that the statutory language is clearly inconsistent with the approach taken by the agency, the agency's approach must be dispositive. And here, what the agency found, unambiguously and expressly, dealing precisely with the question at issue before the Court now, is that if States had reciprocity policies in place in 1991, they may not amend, change, rescind, modify those policies in such a way --"

A number of States indicated that they wanted to change their reciprocity rules, and the commission then held a second administrative proceeding --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
      "speech": "Well, there is actually some question as to whether there were formal reciprocity agreements in place. There is no question Michigan had a policy of providing fee waivers to trucks that were based in States that in Michigan view provided equivalent waivers to trucks that were based in Michigan. Applying that policy in 1991, Michigan was of the view that Illinois provided such a waiver for Michigan trucks, and therefore, Michigan, under its policy announced by its public service commission, provided equivalent waiver for trucks that were based in Illinois. That was unquestionably the rule that was in place in Michigan at the relevant time, and because of that, we think, that was the fee that was collected or charged. To identify the fee that was collected or charged or can now be collected or charged from a particular truck that comes from the State, one has to look at the rule that was in place then and say, what was the fee that would have been applied then to this truck? Under that approach, Michigan cannot now change its -- its way of implementing reciprocity policies and therefore charge trucks that would not have been charged at that time. If there are no further questions now, Your Honor, I'll reserve the balance of my time."

      "speaker": "SCHLICK",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress assigned responsibility for implementing the single State registration system to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The ICC determined that when States apply the statutory fee cap, they must consider the reciprocal fee reductions and reciprocal fee waivers that were in place as of November 15th, 1991. That interpretation serves the central purpose of the fee cap provision, which was to grandfather the fees that were in place as of 1991, but only those fees. The Michigan Supreme Court's generic fee rule, on the other hand, would convert Congress's grandfather provision into a provision that would allow new fees. The ICC's interpretation ensures that the capped registration fee is equal to the fee that the State actually collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991. Congress did not set the cap at the amount that the States could have charged. If Congress had wanted to do that, the obvious thing to have done would have been to set the cap at $10, which is the amount that the ICC allowed all carriers to charge as of November 15th, 1991."

The conference report on ISTEA makes clear that there were two purposes in -- in Congress's mind when it drafted the statute. One was ensuring that -- ensuring benefit to carriers, ensuring that the overall costs of the -- of the State registration requirements were minimized. The second was preserving existing State revenues. Michigan's approach, on the other hand, would allow dramatic increases in the fee amounts, in this case an increase from 0 to $10 per truck, that would overwhelm the administrative savings that Congress intended to ensure through the single State approach. That -- that also would be a very odd policy to allow those increases since Congress would, in fact, have been authorizing increases that the States themselves chose not to implement as of 1991."

If Yellow Transportation had come to the State of Michigan and said, we'd like to add an additional truck to -- to our registration for this year, effective immediately, Michigan would have -- it would have charged and Yellow would have paid under the old reciprocity arrangement, under which the fact that the truck was base- plated, had a license plate for Illinois would have been dispositive. However, simultaneously, Michigan -- Michigan was -- was demanding and Yellow paid fees under the 1992 reciprocity approach where the fact that the -- the truck had a license plate from Illinois would not be relevant and the fact that Yellow was headquartered in Kansas would be relevant. The ICC did not determine in its American Trucking Associations proceeding, which -- which is the relevant one on this question, whether the -- whether that sort of -- of conflict would be resolved in favor of the old rule or the new rule.

There have not been problems with implementing this system, and the Department of Transportation has before it a request for declaratory ruling filed by Michigan, that was mooted by the Michigan Supreme Court's decision which adopted this generic view rule that moots out all these questions. And that proceeding could be reopened if this Court were to remand to the Michigan Supreme Court. But the -- the specific significance of the date on which Yellow made payment has not been addressed by the ICC or by the Department of Transportation. The -- the fee system here -- the actual fee rule of the ICC has been in place for almost 9 years now. There have not been serious problems of administration. It's a mechanical process where States simply fill out the -- carriers fill out a chart which has the applicable State, the number of trucks in the State. It's a matter of multiplication and then adding some -- the fee for -- for each State. As I was explaining, the Michigan situation is unique and should be left to be resolved by the Michigan courts and by the Department of Transportation. The ICC --"

We believe it is not present in the -- in this case at this point. This case was litigated on that point throughout the Michigan courts up until the Michigan Supreme Court decision. Michigan had in place a system called base- plating where we imposed fees based on the State in which the vehicle was licensed. In early 1991, the system changed from that base-plating system to a system that all the other States used based on the principal place of business of the truck carrier."

And Yellow Freight Company, at that time Yellow Transportation -- their trucks were licensed in Illinois, a State with which Michigan has reciprocity, but its principal place of business of the parent company is Kansas, a State with which Michigan does not have reciprocity. And so when Michigan made this change during 1991, we then switched over and imposed fees for Yellow Freight for the registration year of 1992. But those fees, as normal industry and State practice, were sent out in September of 1991 for the next registration year. And Yellow Freight paid them in October of 1991. Again, that's typical industry practice. They're assessed and paid in advance of the registration year. The statute took effect here in December of 1991. The statutory language that we're dealing with talks about a fee that such State collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991. Our argument on the -- the way it was litigated through the State courts is that Michigan charged Yellow Freight before November 15th, 1991 and we collected from Yellow Freight prior to 19 -- prior to November 15th, 1991."

It didn't involve this question of whether reciprocity was relevant or irrelevant. The Michigan -- pardon me. The Michigan Supreme Court decided it on a -- a different basis than the other State court opinions had. And that raised the question which this Court granted certiorari. In its briefs, Yellow Transportation has implied that we've somehow waived that issue. We have not. We did not brief it in this Court because this Court limited the grant of certiorari to the issue that the supreme court did decide. So we -- we believe that the case should be affirmed on the basis that the Supreme Court of Michigan decided it. If it is not affirmed, however, we agree with the United States that the case should be remanded to the Michigan Supreme Court for consideration of this other issue which is still viable. So turning now to our principal argument in defense of the Michigan Supreme Court's decision, the statute required the ICC to implement a fee system, to adopt a fee for the States, a fee system for a fee not to exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991. Beginning with the statutory language, under Chevron, if the intent of Congress is clear, that's the end of the matter. The precise question that needs to be addressed here is what did Congress intend. How do you determine the fee? We believe that Congress's intent is clear. Under the language of this statute --"

What the agency has done here is add language to the statute. They have imposed the requirement in the statute that you look at reciprocity agreements. There is nothing in the statute about looking at reciprocity agreements. There's nothing in the statute about looking at particular carriers or how particular carriers are treated.

When Michigan passed its statute in 1989 formalizing the $10 fee, the public service commission terminated those contracts and contacted every State with which it had reciprocity to verify this. This whole question of reciprocity is somewhat uncertain. Many States are not sure with whom they have reciprocity because various State --"

For purposes of this case, at the time we had the base-plating system, but now it's -- if -- if we ultimately lose on that other point and we are stuck with the base-plating method and could not -- and the Michigan court rules against us and we are stuck with the base-plating method, that could cause a problem for Michigan. Let me -- let me just close by saying that we believe that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision is faithful to the text, results in a consistent and a coherent interpretation of the Federal statute, that is consistent with the congressional intent, and we believe it should be affirmed. If it is not affirmed, we urge the Court to remand the case back to the Michigan Supreme Court for consideration of the other issues that were not considered by it. If there are no further questions."

      "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A couple of quick points. First, we think that the key issue in the case has been identified by questions from a number of members of the Court. Something has to be read into the statute. Now, we think what we would read into the statute is clearly the correct thing to read into it, but even if we are not absolutely right about that, petitioner should prevail because given the agency's determination here, the -- the tie goes to this side of the table and we think that that should be dispositive on that issue in the case. Second, there's been some discussion about issues that are other issues in the case and -- and the proper disposition as to them. We think that there is no question about the existence of reciprocity agreements or policies that would require remand, in response to Justice Ginsburg's question. I think Mr. Casey has candidly acknowledged that there was clearly a reciprocity policy in place in Michigan, whether identified reciprocity agreement or simply unilateral policy. There was no question about the nature of that policy. There has been no dispute throughout the entire course of this litigation about whether there was such a policy and whether it was consistently enforced. And therefore, there -- I think there is no subject there to be considered further on remand. The question of whether Michigan's prospective change in its policy for the 1992 registration year and whether Yellow's diligence in paying that early should somehow affect the proper outcome here and require Yellow to pay in the future --"

I guess I would take a little bit of issue with what Mr. Schlick said. The -- the ICC we think expressly addressed that point in its declaratory order when States, including Michigan, said --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but it really hasn't been fully fleshed out here, that particular angle. I -- I think it would be perfectly consistent to agree with your basic position and still feel that was open on remand, as -- as the Solicitor General said."

      "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
      "speech": "Well, our view is that if that is -- if there's to be further litigation on that point, the proper forum for that is the administrative proceeding that -- that Mr. Schlick also mentioned. There is actually pending before the Department of Transportation a proceeding initiated by Michigan which takes issue with the ATA's -- with the -- the ICC's determination on that point and asks for reconsideration by the agency. We think that that is the appropriate place to consider that where the agency can exercise its expertise. We then appeal to the D.C. Circuit if there's to be some -- some question about it. So that -- that's what we would suggest is the appropriate --"

You are saying that we should, at the same time, strike at an issue that the Michigan Supreme Court didn't reach."

      "speaker": "ROTHFELD",

Our suggestion is that the more appropriate place for it to be subject to further litigation, if there is to be further litigation, is in this agency proceeding with an appeal to the Federal court. But -- but you are correct that it was not expressly addressed by the Michigan Supreme Court in this -- in this case. One final point quickly in response to Justice Stevens' question about whether the State terminated reciprocity agreements or -- or not, or simply changed its policy. We think it doesn't matter how you look at it. Either way, the State clearly changed the rule that it was applying. It had a clearly articulated rule consistently applied that trucks based in certain places would not be subject to fees. It is now changing that rule and it's therefore trying to collect and charge fees as to those trucks that it did not charge before or collect before, and we think that is clearly precluded by the statutory language and is certainly decided by the ICC adversely to Michigan. If there are no further questions, Mr. Justice --"
