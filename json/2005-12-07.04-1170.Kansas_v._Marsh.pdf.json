Yet, this Court has consistently held that all that is required by the eighth amendment is for States to afford an opportunity to jurors to consider all mitigating evidence relevant to determination of a sentence other than death. The Kansas statute, it is undisputed in this case, allowed the respondent to introduce all such evidence and that the jurors, under Kansas law, are specifically instructed to consider all such mitigating evidence on an individualized basis."

We -- we generally regard mitigation evidence as favoring life, aggravation evidence as favoring death. We've got a case in which the -- the assumption is that they are evenly balanced. The -- the pans of the scale are exactly even on that. Kansas says in that case the jury shall return the verdict of death. If we are going to demand, as we have said that we're going to demand, that the determination -- that the death penalty determination be one of what we have called reasoned moral judgment, then what has to be supplied in order to make the Kansas provision consistent with reasoned moral justice, it seems to me, is a presumption in favor of death. Other things being equal, there is a presumption in favor of death. And my question is, am I correct in saying that in order to hold your way, we have to hold that the eighth amendment -- is consistent with the eighth amendment to presume the appropriateness of death, other things being equal?"

But I'll make the assumption there could be such a case. Second, I will assume that our case law leaves this open, a matter that can be argued. But suppose that we do make that assumption for the moment. Then what I'm thinking of is this made-up case is the case of the following. We have aggravating factors and break them down into molecules on a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here, there is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the juror who is very conscientious ends up with the same number of molecules of equal weight on this scale. And in our made-up instance, Kansas says, if that's the situation, you must say death. Now, if that's the case, how would you reconcile that with a view of the eighth amendment that says if you're going to sentence someone to death, there has to be something special about his case that means it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case because, after all, for every molecule of specialness that warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation that doesn't? So that's where I am, trying to get the cases out of it and trying to take very seriously the hypothetical that is before us."

First of all, the State follows the guided discretion standard of this Court, as laid out in Furman and its progeny, to a very narrow definition of what capital murder is. In fact, the Kansas death penalty statute is one of the most narrow in the Nation. And then past that point to the sentencing jury, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of eight specific aggravating factors exist with jury unanimity. And then past that point, Kansas has complied with this Court's requirement under the eighth amendment for a juror to consider and give effect to all mitigating evidence relevant to a sentence other than death and that instruction is specifically pointed out in your appendix, pages 23 through 28.

Arizona, and this Court rejected that very argument in that case. As you may recall, the Arizona law was that there was a responsibility for the defendant to demonstrate that mitigating factors were sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. The Arizona Supreme Court had decided that that meant that the mitigating factors must outweigh the aggravating factors. And this Court accepted that case because of a conflict between the ninth circuit which held, as the Kansas Supreme Court did, in Adamson v. Ricketts, that that was an unconstitutional violation of the eighth amendment.

It is consistent with the Walton case in that this Court said a mandatory death penalty is not unconstitutional, as long as the State differentiates between those convicted of the same crime and who are sentenced to life and those who are convicted of the same crime and sentenced to death. Kansas clearly does that in the requirement that the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one of at least eight specific statutory aggravating factors exist in the case. But Kansas goes further. Unlike in Walton v. Arizona, the burden remains on the State to also prove that the mitigating evidence proffered by the defendant who has the lowest threshold allowed by law, and all that is required by this Court -- that is relevancy -- that all of that evidence does not outweigh --"

The majority didn't specifically address that, but they also analyzed the case, much as Justice Kennedy just did, in saying that really what we're talking about is whether the State eventually at some point, once it has met the requirement of the individualized sentencing requirements of this Court, can say that death is appropriate. And the answer in this Court's jurisprudence has been clearly yes once we are able to set aside this defendant from other defendants convicted of the same crime."

The argument of the respondent is that the constitutional savings doctrine and severability arguments are independent and adequate, and by their very nature, they are dependent rather than independent. The Kansas Supreme Court engaged in a -- and I quote from the decision -- a full reexamination of the eighth amendment jurisprudence in coming to the conclusion in paragraph 25 of the syllabus, which is the law of the case in Kansas under Kansas law, that the Kansas death penalty statute is unconstitutional on its face. That was the first such holding in Kansas jurisprudence history finding that determination. Previously, 3 years earlier, the court had found the death penalty statute constitutional as construed, and as this Court knows, you will not accept jurisdiction of a State court's interpretation or construction of a State law. So, therefore, this is the first opportunity that the State has had and I would say the last."

However, it is our position, as Justice Ginsburg alluded to, that the State has no death penalty and it would take a complete reenactment of the death penalty for the State to have one. And that is borne out in case law. There is no uncertainty as it relates to the ability of the State to seek appeal in charging death once there is no death statute that is available. The references in Kansas law to KSA section 22-3602(b) are a very settled area of the law. The respondent argues that subsection (1) of that statute would allow us an opportunity to preserve this issue below. However, that only relates to the State being able to appeal charging documents, and the definitions of those documents are very specific in Kansas law. Furthermore, subsection (3) states that a prosecutor can reserve an issue, but case law is very clear, and that is only if the Kansas Supreme Court sees that issue as important for the administration of justice, the uniform administration of justice, in the State, and has interpreted that to mean only where guidance of the supreme court is necessary. It is not a method for moving for rehearing. The Kansas Supreme Court rejects that. We moved for reconsideration and reconsideration was not granted. If this Court embarks, as the respondent asks it to, it will put in jeopardy 12 capital murder cases and prevent 12 capital murder cases from being pursued in Kansas. It will effectively strike down the laws of seven other States that have functionally identical statutes as Kansas. And furthermore, it would effectively call into question the laws of five other States that do not even require any weighing mechanism whatsoever. This Court has never gone further and required a specific mechanism of weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances and has relegated that duty, as it should, to the States as long as the juror has the opportunity to make the reasoned moral decision based on the consideration of all mitigating evidence relevant to a decision other than death that relates to the character, the background of the defendant, or the circumstances of the offense. And if you would look in your joint appendix on pages 25 and 26, you will see the instructions that the State of Kansas gave in this case, and it is undisputed that the respondent's presentation of mitigating evidence was presented to the jury in full, and additionally, the jury was specifically instructed to consider and give weight -- I'm sorry. It's pages 24 and 25 -- specifically instructed to give weight to all of that evidence. Pages 24 and 25. I am referring to instruction number 4. And you will see the delineation beginning on page 25 of all the mitigating evidence that was admitted as relevant in this case. And I would also say that Kansas continues to bear a greater burden in its consideration -- for the juror's consideration in that the juror is instructed on paragraph 2 of instruction 4 that mercy in and of itself is sufficient -- is sufficient -- to outweigh the aggravating evidence presented by the State.

Their arguments rest on an erroneous assumption about the way the statute operates and the real issues that its operation raises. Under the Kansas formula, prosecutors can and do urge jurors not to persevere in their decision- making if they are undecided regarding the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In other words, if the decision is too hard to make, the sentence must be death. The formula --"

This is a subjective, qualitative determination that the jury makes, and whatever capital sentencing statute a State chooses, States are free to choose whatever structure they see fit to determine whether death is an appropriate sentence. However, States are not free to enact a statute that doesn't ensure a reliable determination that death is an appropriate sentence, and that's what we're dealing with here. It's a qualitative judgment and one can imagine, very easily I think, a scenario where jurors are deliberating.

It must be allowed to consider and give effect to those mitigating circumstances. And when a jury cannot decide between aggravating and mitigating circumstances, when that jury is, nevertheless, required under this -- that situation to impose a sentence of death, the sentence of death has been imposed without the jury having made the requisite individualized sentencing decision under the eighth amendment at the selection stage."

That's how the statute was construed in Kleypas. I would like to address the jurisdictional issue for a few moments, unless there are any further questions from the Court on the equipoise issue, which I'd be happy to answer. But one of the things I want to discuss today is the jurisdictional issue on the adequate and independent State law ground, which this Court asked the parties to brief. I feel that the State misstates the issue there as well because in the Kansas Supreme Court, the State conceded the Federal unconstitutionality of the Kansas equipoise formula, as decided by the court in the Kleypas case 4 years ago, and defended in this case only on the contested State law ground of severability and bypassed raising a Federal question in a motion for a rehearing, which again relied solely on State law severability grounds."

And Justice Rehnquist said as much for the Court in the Court's decision in Illinois v.

And if you look at the provenance of that decision, that's the only case where the Court actually considered a question for the first time in -- in this Court. And what happened in that case is that the Federal issue that was presented to this Court was actually discussed at oral argument. It wasn't raised by either of the parties in their briefs in the State court, but it was discussed at oral argument. And the Court decided a first amendment issue on the basis of that discussion at oral argument. And so this Court took jurisdiction and stated that as long as it's been passed upon, it's not necessary that it was pressed upon. And the decision, which the Court relied on in that case is, if I'm remembering it correctly, was a decision involving a Federal question which was raised too late to comply with the procedural requirements in State court. And so it's really not the case that this Court routinely takes cases where the issue was not pressed by the parties in the State courts. And that's the situation we have in this case."

If you had an -- a -- a case that's litigated entirely on State law grounds and in the State supreme court opinion, they announce we are sua sponte deciding this on the basis of the Federal Constitution and you, State, lose, your argument is that State is just out of luck. They can't seek review of that decision?"

What happened here was that the court merely reiterated a holding from 4 years ago, and the State law severability decision, which was the issue in contest in this case and the issue that was decided in this case, the matter of State law, and it was sufficient to support the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court. And really, what -- what the State is trying to do here is to -- I mean, these issues were decided in the Kleypas case, and if we were here on the Kleypas case, there wouldn't be any argument as to whether the Kansas Supreme Court's decision rested on an adequate and independent State law ground because the Federal issue was clearly decided and it was interwoven with the State law determination.

And just as Justice Souter and the Chief Justice's hypotheticals, as it relates to this case, were articulated, it is actually true that in this case the State was not aware that this issue would be raised again and only conceded -- and waiver is truly not an issue because a lower court did not rely upon it. And we have some confusion between the terms here. It only conceded that Kleypas, a decision by the Kansas Supreme Court, was the law of the case in another case subsequently reaching the Kansas Supreme Court. And the Kansas Supreme Court, on its own motion, engaged in a full reconsideration and the respondent in their brief argues that the primary reliance of the court was not on eighth amendment jurisprudence but other grounds. There is no requirement for jurisdiction under 28-1257 that the primary reliance be on a Federal issue. There is a requirement to deny jurisdiction that there be an independent and adequate State ground on which the decision would rest regardless of the outcome of the Federal issue. Clearly that's not the case here."

And the Kansas court in this case found it unconstitutional on its face. And there is a significant difference, and the court raised the issue again. I would like to point out to the Court that there are five ways that a juror can, after their reasoned moral decision, give effect to the belief that the mitigating evidence does not warrant the death penalty. The juror can state that they have a reasonable doubt as to whether the State has met its burden of proving that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors. The juror can simply delay. Kansas law has a defect -- default for life in its sentence or in its structure, and I would encourage you to read on page 28 of your appendix instruction number 12 in which the jury is told that if, after a reasonable time, you are unable to make a decision -- in other words, in a doubtful case -- the judge is required by law to dismiss the jury and sentence the defendant to life. And so there is a default for life, and that is another way that a juror can give effect to their reasoned moral decision that death is not appropriate. The juror can give effect to their reasoned moral decision that is not appropriate by determining that the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors. And the juror under instruction number 5 --"

And that's in Kansas law. I would state this in closing, and that is that the Kansas legislature reenacted the death penalty for the first time since this Court struck it down in Furman in the spring of 1994. And in doing so, it gave great deference to this Court's role as final arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution. And if you read the instructions and the law that is provided to you in this case, you will see this Court's words mirrored back to you in the scheme of the Kansas law as it relates to the death penalty.
