    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Alaska's Megan's Law makes available to members of the public who seek it certain truthful information about convicted sex offenders. The State makes this information available to help protect against the risk that the convicted sex offender will offend again. It says that in the law. Sex offenses are crimes of opportunity, and the purpose of making the information available is to allow the members of the public to take steps to reduce those opportunities."

Just assume hypothetically that you had to go to the police station four times a year. Would that change the case?"

    "speech": "No, it wouldn't, Your Honor. That's the case in -- in about 14 States that -- that a quarterly verification has to be in person. It is not the case in Alaska. And simply going to the police station four times a year, which is reserved only for the most serious sex offenses, the aggravated offenses -- in all other cases it's just annually -- doesn't rise to the level of a burden that is at all tantamount to what we think of as punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause."

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, for life, again only for aggravated; for 15 years for other sex offenses. And yes, that is one of their arguments, that they can't get out of it. But this Court's cases haven't drawn that line. The question is whether the burdens are pursuant to a legitimate regulatory objective, or whether they're punitive. For example, in cases like Kansas against Hendricks, couldn't get out of that, and yet that didn't make it a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. Flemming against Nestor. You couldn't avoid the sanction there, and yet it did not rise to the level of punishment."

It was an individualized determination required because the depravation there, actual confinement, was far more severe than the depravation at issue here.

We -- as Your Honor mentioned -- we do that all the time in -- in today's society. So it must be something else that makes this punishment. Now, what the Ninth Circuit's -- Ninth Circuit thought was that it was publishing it on the Internet, that that made it punishment. But that's simply the most -- most efficient and most economical way of making information available. It also is passive. It's not displayed to people who have no interest in the information, and in that sense is far less invasive. The publication on the Internet will -- yes, it may cause adverse consequences when members of the community learn this public fact about someone's past. But the State is certainly free to weigh the convicted sex offender's interest in keeping that public fact from being widely known against the interest of those in the position of, say, Megan Kanka's parents."

    "speech": "Well, there are countless analogues in the regulatory regime where people have to file quarterly reports.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

There's nothing burdensome about that. It must be in their argument the use that that information is put to."

  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, it's called the intent effects test. You'd first see what the intent is, and that is so critical, and nearly controlling because the same sanction can be punitive or civil depending on the purpose. Even confinement can be civil if the purpose is protective. So that's why purpose is so controlling. Now, once you determined that there's a regulatory purpose, as every court has -- not just every Federal court -- every court to look at these laws has determined they have a valid civil regulatory purpose -- then the one challenging that determination carries the heavy burden of establishing, by the clearest proof, with unmistakable evidence, that the effect is so punitive that the purported purpose must, in fact, be a charade. And --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In addition, on that page, what the viewer will see -- you don't see on the page with the face any disclaimer, any statement that the State is not branding this person as dangerous. The State is simply making a statement that there was a conviction in the past."

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It conveys simply the truthful, objective information that this individual was convicted of this crime, and the public is free to take appropriate action if they think that's -- that's appropriate under the circumstances. It is different from the historic shaming penalties because of the purpose. And again, purpose is the nearly controlling factor. The purpose of the shaming penalties was not to inform. Everybody in the colonial village knew the circumstances of the offense. The purpose was to shame. Here, the purpose is to inform."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Roberts, on that point you said this is truthful information, and it is. My question is, isn't -- it's not the whole truth because the successful rehabilitation in one case is not known. It's not known in the other case that a judge determined this -- this person had been cured to the extent that he could have the custody of a -- a minor child. That information is not known. So the -- the public is getting only the bad, and not the good. Its judgment is being skewed. And that's why it has a punitive flavor."

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speech": "There's no provision for that under Alaska's laws. I am aware of situations where -- where they have a more active notification, where the offenders have taken steps to say, well, here's my side of the story, but there's no provision for that on the Internet."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Suppose they had the same statute, but instead of it -- applying it to people who were convicted, they applied it to people who had been arrested, or alternatively, they applied it to people whom a policeman said he had gotten suspicious information about that he believed was accurate, no arrest -- now, suppose it's exactly the same, but they just do -- they apply it not in that way. What part of the Constitution, if any, would that violate?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it's rational in the sense that a -- a reasonable person would think that these -- it's a way of stopping these, you know, criminals. They're suspicious. They're -- they're -- suspicious people against whom there are suspicions are more likely to commit crimes than people who are not suspected."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Certainly not the Ex Post Facto Clause because in Seling against Young, the Court said you look at the law on its face, not as applied.

I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time, Your Honor."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I suppose that the public in theory has access to it anyway because convictions are a matter of public record, and presumably any citizen who wanted to dig deep enough could find out who had been convicted of what. What this scheme involves is getting a big megaphone, in effect, making it more readily available. Is that what we're talking about here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "I don't agree with the characterization of this as a megaphone. What I -- what I would characterize it instead of saying it is the least intrusive, most passive way to provide information that is already available to citizens, and can be obtained by citizens, but to make it more accessible to them because the people have decided that they want this information."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speech": "And most -- most of those do not involve -- involve shame or ridicule. This does."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, the -- that is a separate question. I'm -- what I'm saying is that the burden of registration or of keeping information current is a minimally intrusive burden. Now with respect to the question of shame, that arises, to the extent that it exists at all, from the conviction of violating a sex offense. There is due process in connection with that -- that -- to the extent that process is due -- and we'll get to that I know in the subsequent case, but --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but precisely, but that -- that shows that there's an added burden here that was added by the State after the conviction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Yes, but that -- that is true of many regulatory measures. You can lose your right to practice in the securities field -- and that's been held -- because of a conviction or to practice banking or the right to vote. There are other consequences. This Court has repeatedly said --"

The fact that this -- what the -- this --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But, General Olson, there's a -- a difference in those -- those restrictions that affect one part of one's life. I can't practice a particular profession, but I can go out and get a job. I -- I'm not affected in where I live. My neighbors know that I've committed a crime, but they don't -- the same reaction -- the notion that I am being labeled not a convicted offender -- which I am -- but a sex offender, a current status -- a current status with no opportunity to get out."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, the -- well, the fact of registration and disclosure relates to the conviction of a sex offense. The public in 50 States and the legislature and Congress have determined in response to the requests of the people -- as Mr. Roberts said, the test, according to this Court's jurisprudence, is the intent. The intent here is not to punish. The intent is to respond to citizens who have --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I think it's -- it's easy for a legislature to say that, and in part, it's right. But in part, it seems to me that there are many indicia of punishment here as well. That's why you just don't rest when the legislature says it's regulatory. You must go beyond that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Yes. This Court has said that only -- you would go beyond that only if the evidence was the clearest proof, unmistakable evidence that the intent or effect was punitive as opposed to regulatory. In this case, there is no affirmative restraint on motion. There is no confinement. There is no restriction on travel or employment or recreation, no obligation to submit to searches, intrusive supervision or questioning."
  },

Each is a one-time event, as it were, or a one-time status and each is over. What this is doing is, in effect, imposing a status of public shame for a period of 10 years, or whatever it is, or a period of life in -- in the case of certain offenses. And that is not merely the consequence of the conviction for the crime which was defined, is over, and done with. This is something new."

First of all, the sanction attaches automatically and inescapably solely on a basis of a prior conviction, without any determination of present dangerousness at all.

It wasn't their intent to punish. It was their intent to inform so that the thing won't happen again. That's not a punitive intent. And therefore, your claims about how bad this is may be right. And suppose I accept them. Suppose I think they're right. Should I not, nonetheless, wait until somebody raises a substantive due process claim? That way you can decide if the problem with the statute is overly broad, if the problem is that some people should have it applied to them and others shouldn't.

And we -- we respectfully disagree that this is intended to be purely a regulatory measure.

I mean, it doesn't happen automatically that Hendricks was going to be put in jail. There had to have been a jury trial, or trial by a judge with a preponderance beyond a reasonable doubt, and he's allowed an annual review. He can petition at any time. The secretary, at his own discretion, can remove that restriction. So the duration of that is solely limited and -- and looks to the purpose to protect the people from those -- the public from those people that are dangerous. None of those protections are here.

See, if it applies -- if the argument -- the question people are asking you -- I'm simply repeating it -- is, on your argument why isn't that just as much an ex post facto law? What has it got to do with the matter that it's overly broad, et cetera, which sounds to me like a substantive due process argument, not an ex post facto argument? That's the same question. But I would like you to focus right on it."

When we look to whether or not the statute imposes a punishment, I think it's important that we look to whether or not it -- it's -- fits with the umbrella of things which have historically considered to be punishment. And that's one of our starting points, and that's why I keep going back to the concept of probation and parole because historically there's no dispute that probation is a depravation of liberty. Not -- it's not like going to jail, but it's a depravation of liberty. And -- and it's been considered as punishment, and that's what this thing does to people. Now, if it was a perfectly-tailored -- such that it could weed out the dangerous from the non-dangerous -- well, we would invite that because my clients wouldn't be here today. My client has been determined, you know, to be not dangerous by a superior court family judge. But would it still be punishment? I think we'd have to look at the -- a little bit closer at it. But, you know, if there's a closer nexus between the public purpose and there -- there is a weeding out, maybe it wouldn't be punishment because maybe it's -- it's escapable, it -- it's --"

What's wrong about warning the public about who may be dangerous? Let the public make -- you know, the later -- later determination."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What is irrational or unconstitutional about warning the public about a category of people who may be dangerous as to whom -- as the entire category of whom, there's more likely to be danger than -- than with respect to other people? Where is it written that you can only warn the public about those whom you have -- are sure are dangerous?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Part of the problem with the statute, it's not just a warning of the public. I mean, it -- it's -- there are really various components. It's not just a notification statute. I mean, you know, the public right now has access to -- through another statute that we have -- to offender information. All they've got to do is request. And this is an unnecessary statute in -- in one sense. Does it broadcast it on the Internet? No. But the same information is available, and it's information that's available not just going to a courthouse, but you can actually request the State for that information. And -- and for some people, the information may be limited. There are some restrictions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm -- I'm not sure if it helps you or hurts you. It -- it indicates that -- that the most distressing and damaging fact that you have -- that you have the conviction is available to the public anyway. And this is just a regulatory scheme to -- to make that information more clear as to how many people are in the community have suffered that conviction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "What I was going to say is that the information as to serious offenses that are beyond 10 years is limited. There's some sense of limitation, some sense of it's been a long time. So that information is limited to those people that have a need to know, like for example, the day care providers and the teachers and -- and schools who want to know --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but I take it under the registration form we're talking about, that the date of the conviction is there, and the -- the citizen can make up his or her own mind as to whether the conviction was so long ago that they're no longer worried about it."

    "speaker": "THOMPSON",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What -- what if the State simply decided we're going to put on the Internet, the same way that Alaska does here, the names of all the people who had criminal convictions of any sort without any more information in -- in the last 5 years? Now, if they applied that to people who were convicted after they passed it, would that be ex post facto?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "I don't know that it would. It would probably have the same stigmatizing effect. I mean, I just -- I want to share with you the State has already done that in the State of Alaska. You can get information as to anyone in the State of Alaska by a click of a mouse by going on the Internet, if their convictions were in the State of Alaska. That information is already available."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If it had the same stigmatizing effect, why would your answer be different? Why -- why would it not be ex post facto in that case, whereas it is in this? I'm not sure what line you're drawing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Well, the stigmatizing effect here is that these people are being currently labeled as -- as sex offenders."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No. I -- I realize that, but you said in answer to the Chief Justice's question that there would be the same -- in your judgment, there would be the same stigmatizing effect if they put every criminal conviction on -- on the Internet. And if -- if the stigmatizing effect would be the same and the information would be just as readily available, why would your answer be different, that that would not be ex post facto whereas this is? That would not be punitive. This is punitive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Well, perhaps it would, but you know, our analysis of this ex post facto argument is really a composite of a variety of components of the statute and not simply the public notification provision."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So you would say even just the requirement that they register, even if it's just circulated to law enforcement people, that's impermissibly retroactive as well. So there can be -- is there any scheme for keeping track of ex-offenders that would pass the ex post facto test in your judgment, or is it just they've served their time, they've done whatever, parole is given to them, and that's it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "You know, if -- if the requirements of the individual subject to the registration requirements alone were not as onerous as here where they have to report on every 90 days all kinds of personal information, and if they don't, then they're going to be -- go -- go to jail, it may be a closer call. I mean, there was the -- the history of the felony registrations, but they've never really been approved by this Court as somehow being a proper regulatory measure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "On the other hand, I don't know of any precedent -- perhaps you can tell us if there is -- from this Court saying that a measure with a declared regulatory purpose is, nonetheless, impermissibly retroactive. I don't know of any case that so holds."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm sorry. One -- one thing that makes it more difficult perhaps than it might be to see your side of the argument -- go back to the Chief Justice's question. What if they put every criminal conviction on the Internet? Well, there's one difference between the situation that would obtain then and the situation that -- that you're objecting to here. That is, that there is not the same high recidivism rate for crimes generally that there is, apparently undisputedly, for sex crimes in the State of Alaska. And therefore, when you earlier made the argument that there is something very -- something less than credible in the State's claim that it's merely trying to inform the public when, in fact, it makes no differentiation between current dangerousness and un­ current dangerousness, the answer is there is -- or an answer is -- there is a very high recidivism rate, and that high recidivism rate does support the claim that there is something that -- that it is credible to say that by publishing this information, we are simply trying to inform people of a probability of dangerousness, leaving them to do what they want. What is -- is there any -- do you have any response to this claim that the high recidivism rate itself supports the argument that, in fact, this is nothing but a safety information kind of measure, whereas broadcasting all criminal convictions would not be justified as having a good fit between the object and what the State was doing? Do you have any response to that?"

    "speaker": "THOMPSON",

That's -- that's awfully burdensome to require someone not just to come into the police station or fill out a written form, but to require someone -- as a direct consequence of a prior conviction, to require someone to come and -- and be subject every 90 days to a judicial scrutiny as to whether or not you're still dangerous, that seems to be a pretty big disability."

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think it is very important to place the various points that have been touched on this morning in the proper legal framework. The question, Justice Kennedy, is not whether it's burdensome to require someone to fill out a form and verify it. The question is, is that so punitive that you don't believe the legislature when it says that we're doing this to prevent future harm? The question, Justice Ginsburg, is not whether it might be a better system if it included other information, or whether that would be too burdensome for the State. The question is, does the failure to put on ameliorative information convince you that the legislature was simply not telling the truth when it said we're doing this to prevent future harm? And the question is not whether you should have an individualized determination or a group determination. It is, is the group determination so irrational that you think the legislature was not really interested in preventing future harm, it was just doing this to punish? In fact, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this Court has never found a law with a civil regulatory purpose to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause."

  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I think it only makes sense if you view it as impeaching the intent because, as Chief Justice Warren pointed out in Trop v. Dulles, the evident purpose is controlling because the same sanction can be civil or criminal. $10,000 civil penalty is not criminal. A $10,000 fine is. You don't look at the perspective of the individual because --"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You're not saying -- you're saying if it's -- it wouldn't violate the Ex Post Facto Clause in your view. It might violate some other clause like the substantive due process."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "But again, with respect to both the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, the question is whether there's a rational connection between the sanction and the legislative purpose. Now, if it is too extreme, it may cause you to doubt that connection. For example, it may be -- the legislature may say we think safe crackers present a risk of recidivism, so we're going to cut off their hands. There may be a rational connection there, but it's too excessive given the purpose. There's no way in which this law can be regarded as too excessive. It simply makes available information that is already a matter of public record, and publicly available because criminal trials under our system have to be public. Thank you, Your Honor."
