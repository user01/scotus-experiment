      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In cases involving safety exigencies, an officer's actions should be judged against a single objective standard of reasonableness, that is, whether the facts and circumstances known to the officers at the time of entry would warrant a reasonable person in believing that immediate intervention is needed to preserve the peace and protect others from harm. When officers have reason to believe that violence is imminent or ongoing, they meet that standard. In this case, the Brigham City officers responded to a complaint at 3:00 a.m. and, upon arriving, witnessed a violent and tumultuous struggle between four adults and a teenager. The officers -- when the juvenile threw a punch is when the officers acted and thereby prevented injury. This is exactly what we would expect officers to do."

      "speech": "Yes, it was justified. At that time what they heard from the curb side and then from the front was the same kind of violence going on. They heard that from -- from the time they arrived all the way. They -- they heard the thumping, the shouting, someone saying, get off me, stop, stop. And so what these officers were doing, in the course of that, is investigating that -- that, and it led them to the backyard. Now --"

      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "speech": "It's our position that they could have, though that's a much closer case. In this case, the officers acted in a very guarded manner. I mean, they -- they proceeded and they investigated step by step and, in fact, did not enter until a punch was thrown and there was --"

Even though a telephonic warrant would certainly be a more speedy process of getting a warrant, it's not speedy enough where punches are being thrown.

In this situation, I believe that officers could have entered prior to the punch being thrown. What they witnessed is -- is this violent struggle between four adults and a teenager. They had no idea whether or not they were trying to molest the -- the teenager or whether the teenager was an intruder or what happened. But they could tell that it was violent.

      "speech": "No, but if -- if the -- if the complaint were -- were simply a complaint of noise, and they got to the -- the gate, the back fence, and they could hear all the racket inside and there didn't seem to be any practical way to get people to come to the fence to talk to them, wouldn't they have had the right to go through the gate and at least go up to the door and bang on the door?"

If the noise is the cause of their being there and if the noise is so loud at 3:00 in the morning that it's still continuing and nobody can hear the knock on the door -- they knock on the door several times and shout -- would they not have the right to go in then to quell the noise?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",

      "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
      "speech": "So if you're going to rely on the safety and the -- safety and the danger of harm, how serious does the harm have to be? And I use the word harm as defining the -- the threshold for this kind of entry. What if a father was spanking his child, for example?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "speech": "No. Spanking of a child would not. There's no indication under most circumstances of an intent to injure or abuse. Now, of course, if there are circumstances that would suggest abuse, then officers could go in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Doesn't yelling so loudly you can't hear police knock at the door at 3:00 in the morning suggest that violence is at least imminent or may well be associated with what they're hearing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "speech": "It certainly approaches that, but again, what we would maintain is there probably has to be more than simple shouting. If -- if it's accompanied by threats or a show of force or violence, then certainly they could go in."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Is there, in addition to the safety rationale which you're -- justification, which you're arguing here -- is there a justification to go in to stop an ongoing felony whether safety is involved or not?"

      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "speech": "Yes."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "speech": "Well, it's a crime ongoing, in progress. So there certainly could be made an argument. Now, whether or not there's an exigency, I think that's doubtful because police could secure the scene and secure a warrant and then execute that warrant."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Well, I mean, but if that's the case, you have a much easier argument. Wasn't there an assault here? There was clearly an assault."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "speech": "Yes, and certainly where officers have reason to believe that there's an ongoing assault, officers can enter. Now, one of the problems with the Utah Supreme Court's holding in this case --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "In connection with the answer you just gave, it doesn't matter then? If it's an ongoing crime, they can go in? It doesn't matter whether it would be a misdemeanor or a felony? It doesn't matter how grave the crime is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "speech": "Well, this Court in Welsh indicated that minor offenses -- you couldn't rely on the exigent circumstances exception, or at least it is what it suggested. But certainly an assault, under Utah law, is a class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 6 months in jail, and that's certainly of sufficient gravity to justify officers entering."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Any kind of assault. I gather it's an assault if you're just sort of a couple of guys pushing each other back and forth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "speech": "Well, under Utah law, an assault is defined as unlawful force or violence so as to -- with an intent to do bodily injury. Now, pushing -- there's not that there. Now, one of the chief problems or primary problems with the Utah court's decision in this case is it creates a complicated and confusing bifurcated standard that forces officers unrealistically to choose between roles, to choose whether or not they are going to enter and act as caretakers or enter and act as law enforcement officials. Well, the reality -- first of all, it's -- it's very difficult for officers to try to make those kind of judgments in the heat of the moment, and this is precisely the kind of a -- the kind of case where that would be impossible to achieve because officers in this case are acting clearly under both roles. They're stopping crime and they are also protecting others from harm. We want officers to rescue people from harm when they have a reasonable basis to do it, not wait until you have to call an EMT. That's what Mincey provides. And if there are no further questions, I would reserve the remainder of my time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
      "speech": "Let me just ask this one question, if I may, if you have -- did the other side preserve the right to challenge this entry under the Utah constitution?"

      "speaker": "MCNULTY",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: The Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to stand by and be a spectator to escalating violence in the home when such an officer has an objectively reasonable basis to believe, given the totality of the circumstances, that prompt action is necessary to prevent imminent harm."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "So if there were no punch in this case, would they have had a sufficient basis? 3:00 in the morning, loud shouting. Can they conclude, based on their experience, that's likely to escalate into violence and enter on that basis?"
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCNULTY",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, if there's a loud noise alone, certainly the neighborhood shouldn't have to be a hostage to that noise, and the police officers may be acting reasonably to do what is necessary to end that noise. But it's going to --"

      "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
      "speech": "So then it doesn't matter what's being said."

      "speaker": "MCNULTY",

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Well, no. You -- you don't want to say that. The noise alone wouldn't justify going in without knocking as would the -- a scene of a violent event occurring. Certainly you'd have to knock on the door. Now, if they didn't hear you and the only way to get their attention to stop the noise is to go in, fine, but wouldn't you have to knock on the door real hard before you went in to stop the noise?"

      "speaker": "MCNULTY",

So the knock is -- is normally the appropriate course, but in certain circumstances, the knock may either be futile, it could be dangerous, depending upon what was happening, and it certainly could waste some time if it was a dire emergency. The -- under the Fourth Amendment, a police officer may enter a residence without a warrant when a reasonable officer could conclude, given again all the circumstances, that an impending threat to life or safety justifies immediate intervention and the scope of the intrusion is reasonable in relation to the nature of the emergency. Whether the officer was subjectively motivated to enforce the law or render aid has no relevance in a constitutional inquiry. Volatile situations involving violence in the home can escalate in -- in seconds, and the on-the-scene, split-second judgment about exactly when the police officers should intervene is precisely what the totality of the circumstances test has long addressed and resolves the balance of the Fourth Amendment values. And this Court's recent decision in Georgia v. Randolph contains a clear expression of concern for the need for the police to take prompt action to prevent harm in domestic violence cases. In this case --"

So I am wondering why you are emphasizing the prevent somebody from being hurt instead of they're disturbing the peace and the police have a right to protect the neighborhood. It seems to me that that's an easier argument to make."

The case contains a punch that did some harm to another person in a kitchen setting where there is a strong possibility of escalating violence. It's the additional facts of that violence that was a potential there, added to the noise and the evidence of underage drinking, that made the totality of the circumstances objectively reasonable for the officers to --"

And so he's there just at the time where the -- in the scene the one guy says, and now I'm going to kill you with this knife, and he says, ah, and he goes in. Now, subjectively we know that he has no basis for fearing violence, but a reasonable officer on the scene, hearing somebody say I'm going to kill you with this knife, would have a basis for entering.

And here again is the -- a situation where there was mounting evidence, and the court in Utah wanted to make the motivation of the officer a significant factor in determining whether or not the officer could enter. Specifically, the court looked to the motive or intent of the officer to render aid as one way to analyze the situation. And the government argued that those distinctions -- or the distinction between rendering aid or entering for a law enforcement purpose is really a -- an unnecessary distinction because the officer, as the counsel for the State has argued, is acting in a split-second situation, seeking -- thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."

Under the facts of this case, neither one of those situations apply. Under exigent circumstances, there has to be probable cause to enter, and there has to be a warrant to enter. And if neither one of those -- actually under exigent circumstances, there has to be probable cause and there has to be the requirement that there be imminent danger basically to evidence or to the person.

If you can't hear the policeman from the door, who's coming to check about a 3:00 a.m. noisy party, you don't hear his knock on the door, can the policeman not open the door and shout, police? Is that an unreasonable search and seizure. And then if you don't hear that, can he take two steps into the house? He's -- he's not looking under the carpets. He's not looking in the desk drawers. He's just shouting police so that he can bring to the attention of the people there the fact that there's been a complaint from the neighbors and you have to knock off the noise.

And ironically, the -- the testimony of the officer, which I guess there was a dispute about whether that was there or not because it's not specifically in the findings that the trial judge made or the two appellate courts ruled on -- but if the officer entered the home and shortly after that, I mean, he opened the door, according to his testimony, and announced, basically raised his voice, and they heard him, why cannot he have done that outside the home?

So the officers -- unlike some situations where they're called out and they wander on a situation, the officers in this case had personal knowledge of what was going on.

But further, the two appellate courts that heard this matter before, did rule on the exigent circumstances because that's what the Petitioners in this Court had brought before the appellate courts, and they found that in both the Utah Court of Appeals and the Utah Supreme Court, that the exigent circumstances weren't sufficient enough."

It wasn't serious enough to enter the home without the warrant, and I think that's the pivot point. Where is that line on the exigent circumstances? And our position would be that that line -- that it's got to be serious, it's got to be imminent, it's got to be an ongoing situation, something where somebody is either going to get seriously injured, evidence is going to be destroyed, somebody is going to flee."

      "speech": "I would say that they would, Justice Alito, and this is why. You know, all that they were saying was they were trying to get the -- the juvenile to calm down. They were trying to get him to settle down. This was a situation where the officer testified that -- at the suppression hearing, that there was alcohol involved, that there was a minor. Those types of situations don't demonstrate the fact that this was an ongoing violent situation. Again -- and then further, the officers were called out for a party. They weren't called out for a fight in progress or -- or some type of physical altercation. They were called out because somebody had a loud disturbance going on. And those facts in my mind's eye don't rise to the level and would show the officer -- especially when the officer is standing outside the home watching this event, that there's nothing that -- that would rise to the level of entering the home under the exigent circumstances."

And it -- then it would appear that you're correct in the fact that the Utah Supreme Court is concerned upon that issue. But the fact is that it seems to have been briefed under the Fourth Amendment, has come up under the Fourth Amendment issues, and so that's what we're -- we're looking at. And even though a State, obviously, can give more protections to its citizens under a State constitution, the Fourth Amendment is still a -- if you will, a baseline requirement, and it still applies to Federal criminal courts."

What we have, Your Honors, is a situation where under the exigent circumstances, it did not rise to the level which would require the -- the officers to enter the home without getting a warrant. And in the alternative, if they look at emergency aid, to enter the home under the emergency aid doctrine, which would be the equivalent in our opinion to a special needs assessment, then we have to look at probable cause. We have to look at their intent to enter because there's no probable cause to enter if they're performing that caretaking role to protect people. Obviously, the ultimate concern in -- in any type of situation is somebody's sanctity of their home. It becomes a weighing situation where trial courts are -- are being charged to weigh the evidence, weigh the credibility of the people who testify, and then also take into account the constitutional protections which the parties are awarded. And we believe that based upon the facts and the evidence that were -- was presented, that the three different Utah courts that heard this matter were appropriate in their -- in their suppression decisions.

Also intoxication is a class C misdemeanor, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor is a class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 6 months in jail. So that's -- that's what -- but the officers -- and again, this case isn't about what they were ultimately charged with. It's whether or not they had a reasonable basis to believe that immediate intervention was necessary."

      "speech": "Well, the court created two different tests. The Utah court created two different tests. And under the one test, it examined whether or not the officers were primarily motivated by a desire to arrest or search for evidence. Now, the court, the Utah Supreme Court, concluded that they did -- that they were -- their motives were primarily law enforcement motives because they did not render aid. And this Court has repeatedly held that an officer's subjective motives play no part in the objective reasonableness test, and it should not do so here. Justice Ginsburg, you indicated that there was no -- no suggestion of domestic violence. The Utah Supreme Court actually acknowledged that where violence is seen in a home between adults and, for example, a younger person, that there would be reason to believe that domestic violence is possibly present. And that's what -- now, the court refused to look at that because there was no finding that the inhabitants or the -- those involved were actually cohabitants. Of course, this Court has never required that officers have a certainty of the situation, only a reasonable belief, and they clearly have that. And in any event, whether or not it's domestic violence or some other type of violence, it's something that I believe this Court in Mincey recognized, that officers can and -- and probably should -- maybe they didn't go that far, but it would be our position that officers should intervene in the face of violence, and that's what the officers did here."
