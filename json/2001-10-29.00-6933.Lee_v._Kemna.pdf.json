I would like to begin by discussing whether Lee's failure to comply with two Missouri rules governing motions for continuance is an adequate State law ground to bar consideration of Lee's Federal due process claim based on the State trial court's denial of a brief continuance. In the circumstances in which his motion for a continuance was made, the answer is no. Under this Court's existing precedents, Missouri rules 24.09 and 24.10 are not adequate to bar review of Lee's due process claim because application of the rules in -- in this case was arbitrary and serves no legitimate State interest where Lee lacked a reasonable opportunity to comply with the letter of the rules under the circumstances, where Lee supplied --"

These witnesses were under subpoenas, and rule 26.03 of the Missouri rules states that when a witness doesn't -- isn't there for a criminal trial, he's under subpoena, he's subject to arrest. There's no special procedural rule that governs how that has to happen.

It is appropriate in Missouri to bring facts that are outside of the record in a rule 29.15 post-conviction motion, and they were brought up in the rule 29.15 post-conviction motion. There's no mystery here about why the State trial court judge denied the motion, and he denied it on the merits. He did not deny it because the application was defective. The prosecutor didn't object to the application, either the request for a continuance or the form in which the request was made. Had the trial court or the prosecutor signaled some question -- and again, bear in mind the emergency way that this came up -- had signaled some question, he could have cured it. And in a way, you have a kind of a reverse sandbagging where error is left embedded in the record and it isn't until the direct appeal 2 years later that anyone suggests there was something procedurally defective about the motion."

They had mysteriously disappeared. He had no idea why they left or where they had gone. And he was covering all of his bases by asking the trial court for arrest warrants, if necessary. It may never have come to that because the girlfriend wasn't even given enough time to get to the relative's house to see if they were there. And just returning also to the circumstances in which this exchange took place, the trial court had created a real sense of rush and urgency in this trial. I've quoted several instances in the opening brief. It's footnote 9 where the State trial court had indicated to counsel that he wanted to move this case along. Just before the lunch recess, in fact, he said, I want this courtroom cleared by 2:00 p.m. And that's trial transcript page 570. I want this courtroom cleared by 2:00 p.m."

But when counsel was before the judge and is explaining the situation that has occurred, the atmospherics that had arisen where the trial court judge is pressuring them to move along factor into how the colloquy went, especially given that this is an unexpected situation. It's not that different from what happened in Osborne v. Ohio, although I think that case is less compelling than ours because there was no emergency situation. But in Osborne v. Ohio, Ohio had a rule requiring that jury -- that objections to jury instructions be made right before they're delivered. Counsel didn't object to the lack of an instruction on lewdness, but this Court said that the pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment on First Amendment grounds was sufficient and --"

This Court takes a functional approach to looking both to whether or not a litigant has a reasonable opportunity to preserve his claim and also to whether anything would be gained whether all of the purposes served by the rules have been fulfilled, such that there's some adequate State interest in enforcing a procedural default. The purpose of these rules is to permit the trial court to pass on the merits of a motion for a continuance. The trial court denied this motion on the merits, and we quarrel with the basis for the trial court's denial. We think it was as arbitrary as arbitrary can be. But there's no mystery here was to why the trial court ultimately denied that request and it wasn't because of any procedural defect in that motion."

Maybe you can argue with this -- that what the appellate court was saying that at least under 24.10, there was an insufficient showing, and that's exactly what the trial judge found. The trial judge didn't cite 24.10. He doesn't say I'm ruling against you because you're inadequate of showing under 24.10. But it's clearly implicit in his ruling."

Other cases in which this Court has found that procedural rules were applied with the phrase being pointless severity or whether there were arid rituals of meaningless form where technical niceties were not observed, but nonetheless counsel could substantially comply with the showings required by the rules, cases like Douglas v. Alabama where you didn't repeat a futile objection, cases like Staub v. City of Baxley where counsel challenged on First Amendment grounds an entire ordinance and didn't signal out particular -- particular provisions to -- to attack because it was clear what the -- what the lawyer was challenging. Wright v. Georgia and NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Flowers where the claims weren't grouped exactly right in the -- in the State court appeal, but this Court, nonetheless, found that no purpose would be served by finding a default in those cases. All of those suggest -- and -- and also the fact, of course, that the defendant did not have a reasonable opportunity to comply with the letter of the rules, but nonetheless substantially complied with the rules. All of those suggest there should be no default, and in the alternative, even if there was one, that there should be a finding of cause and prejudice.

And he didn't do that. And I am also supposing that if he had done anything like that, counsel would have said, gosh, judge, please give me a piece of paper and let me write this out.

Settle, which is cited in our brief, which was a case that determined that a showing -- where the 24.10 showing was not made, either by affidavit, but also by substance, that the motion -- that the denial of the motion could be affirmed on that basis alone."

Now, maybe since -- and it was written in an amicus brief that favors your side -- maybe you approve of that standard. And I'd like to know, A, do you or not? And if you do approve of that standard, but I come to the conclusion here that that trial judge did not have fair notice that the Missouri rules would apply in these circumstances where he was suddenly surprised by the loss of witnesses and nobody in the courtroom said a word about 9 or 10. And nobody said anything about 9 ever, and the appellate court went and applied it for the first time on its own. That's a big question, but it has two parts, and I'd like an answer.

It's important to note that regularly applied does not mean precisely applied to these exact circumstances in a published case prior to the defendant's trial, but rather regularly -- regularly enforced. And so, I believe that the standard you articulate is a good one, and this rule meets it because, A, it's published, and B, there were an -- an unbroken string of precedents both before defendant's trial and since that time, and not one of them excuses a default under 24.09 or 24.10, reaches the merits of a request for a continuance, and finds that the denial was error."

So, he didn't have time to prepare anything in writing in advance. Second, he's in the courtroom talking to the judge and he knows full well that everyone in that courtroom knows every single thing about what rule 9 and rule 10 require. There was no missing fact. The judge knew it. The prosecuting attorney knew it, and he knew it. And third, there is no Missouri case that says that we're going to require a useless act in the circumstance where the lawyer has suddenly been surprised by his loss of witnesses and everything is going on orally in front of the judge anyway. Now, those are the three that I think cut against you, and so I'd like your reply."

But leave aside the writing requirement, which may or may not have operated with any purpose in this situation -- I believe that it did.

Now, if I come to the conclusion that any one reasonable person in that courtroom would have thought that was -- the lawyer was saying that in the circumstances, I could hold against you.

That seems inconsistent with your answer that you're not seeking to the form. Here is -- is a man on trial for a very serious offense. The lawyer is faced with the absence of the only witnesses he has. He's got to do his best. Should he be thinking about scribbling anything on a piece of paper?

    {
      "speaker": "WILSON",
      "speech": "Well, the -- no. The -- the precise circumstances of this petitioner's case have not arisen in a published case in Missouri. That's correct. But there is -- it was clear that in the midst trial and even in some exigency, the courts of appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court had held 24.09 and 24.10 to require a writing and a sufficient showing in the past. And -- so, if this counsel -- as soon as this colloquy was concluded and the motion had been denied, they turned immediately to the -- to the petitioner's counsel's motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all of the evidence. He made that motion orally, but because he knew that in order to preserve his right to appeal any of the points therein, he asked the judge, and the judge gave him permission, to file the writing later. The same is true with this rule. Because anybody who had read the cases applying 24.09 and 24.10 would know that you are forfeiting your right to appellate review of a denial if you have not put the sufficient showing before the judge and done so in writing."

Your Honors, 2 -- 2 months after this -- after the denial of the continuance occurred, they appeared before this very same trial judge to hear the motion for a new trial. No explanation was given to that judge. No better or further showing was provided. Even the simplest fact like the -- like that they were available and able to testify the very next day in Kansas City was not offered to this trial judge. There was no due process claim before this trial judge either at trial or on the motion for new trial, and he had no facts to believe that he had done anything other than what was fundamentally fair under that circumstance on the circumstances as they had been presented to him in the context of the motion for a continuance.

      "speech": "Just a few quick points. With respect to the proffer and somebody being willing to put their credibility on the line, the defendant actually took the stand during the -- the colloquy on the continuance. He was sworn, which actually you would think is a superior form of proof to an affidavit, and there he was subject to cross-examination by the prosecutor, if there had been any questions. She didn't have any other than to clarify that the witnesses had been under subpoena, which they had been. And -- and so, I -- I think that the -- that whole like of inquiry about whether somebody is willing to sort of swear to facts in support of the motion sort of falls by the wayside because he was on the stand. In addition, in terms of what -- what all the players in the sea knew about -- about these witnesses, there's a rule. It's rule 25.05 of the Missouri rules that requires a notice of an alibi to be given. Apparently one was given because the prosecutor came prepared in her opening statement to address briefly the fact that there was an alibi defense that she expected to be presented. And in addition, the detectives interviewed these witnesses while they were in Kansas City and took statements from them, and if there was any question later, as the record developed further in Federal court, about whether these witnesses really would have said what -- what they said they were going to say, the State had whatever notes or statements that was taken from the interviews that were done with these witnesses."
