      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The principal issue here today is fundamental to the functioning of our civil jury system, but it is one which the courts of appeals have disagreed about for decades. That issue is whether a trial court which sets aside a jury verdict in a civil case as against the weight of the evidence is entitled to very substantial deference by an appellate court. We submit that the trial court is entitled to such substantial deference. Indeed, we submit that the standard is whether any reasonable judge could have concluded that the verdict was against the weight of, the great weight of the evidence. We submit that the D.C. Circuit below applied the strict scrutiny standard, which boils down in practice to whether there was sufficient evidence for the question to go to the jury. We submit this was error. It's inconsistent with what a trial court does."

I don't know why the same standard of review has to apply to both of those situations when the Seventh Amendment treats them differently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REISCHEL",
      "speech": "Well, the -- there is one minor difference, and that is, the court has to look to whether the trial court applied the proper standard. That is, when he sets side a verdict that's contrary to the weight of the evidence, the question is, can a rational judge have made that decision? That is, was it clearly contrary to the weight of the evidence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

There could be other cases in which the matter is not particularly one that's suited to a jury. I mean, it turns -- he gives a new trial because of something to do with a document and its admissibility or something like that. Would you at least say that where it's a matter that the juries are entrusted with the decision, a trial judge should be particularly careful of granting a new trial contrary to the jury? I mean, what I'm wondering at is -- what I'm wondering about is if it perhaps is the same standard, but in applying that same standard you should pay particular attention when you overturn a jury verdict because, judge, the jury has responsibilities to decide things that you don't have."

Suppose this Court said, well, in a sense it's the same standard, but what searching inquiry means is, it means, after all, here you are upholding the jury, not going against the jury, and if you were going against the jury there are many reasons why you should be very careful. Does that satisfy you?"

    {

      "speech": "I think the words have had real consequences in appellate review. I think if one looks to what the D.C. Circuit and other circuits following the Lindh decision actually do is, it boils down to was there evidence to support the jury verdict? If there was, they say that it was an abuse of discretion to set it aside, but it's Hornbook law that a court can set aside a jury verdict even if there's substantial evidence to support it if the court makes an independent determination, without drawing inferences for the verdict, an independent determination that it's contrary to the great weight of the evidence."

You look at a person testifying, and are they lying, are they sweating, are they nervous, all of that. The other kind of credibility finding is, is what they're -- does what they're saying make sense, and to the extent that there's a credibility determination involved here, the question went to the credibility of the financial expert because the financial expert, Dr. Morris, based his financial projections on data that wasn't rooted in, and was contrary to, what the industry expert, DiRenzo, said."

Yes, I suppose that's right, but I wouldn't consider that a credibility determination. I'd consider that a determination of whether there was substantial evidence on the record. If there's something on the record that is utterly incoherent and makes no sense, that's not evidence. It's not adequate evidence, and a court of appeals can evaluate that. I thought that when we're talking about credibility we're talking about the eyeballing the witnesses. I don't believe this fellow, he's shifty- eyed, or whatever."

I thought the judges exercised their determination to turn over a jury verdict based on maybe a whole range of things that occur at trial, including a judge might feel, I gave instructions that would pass muster with the court of appeals, so they're reversal-proof, but the jury didn't understand a damn word I was saying. Or a judge might say, I excluded certain evidence that was favorable to the defendant. That, too, could survive appellate review, but on thinking it over I should have admitted the evidence and, either way, the court of appeals wouldn't touch me. Those kinds of considerations don't go to credibility of witnesses."

One, he made a finding that he excluded evidence he should not have and disabled the jury in performing its function, and the most important evidence that he excluded was the October 15 invitation to be heard. The harm here was that Tri County Industries said they were harmed because they hadn't been heard, but then they turn around and spurn an invitation to be heard, and the judge excluded that evidence, and he did so in part because of his ruling that all these issues had been resolved earlier, and then when he thought about it said, that wasn't -- that isn't right, and it probably confused the jury. But --"

Of course he can take into account these other things, but these other things are evaluable by the court of appeals just as readily as they're evaluable by the trial judge. A court of appeals can say, well, this stuff was excluded. It could have been let in, and if it had been let in, then it would be different. This instruction to the jury was confusing, you can tell that from the cold record, and if that's so, I don't know why you should give any special deference to the trial jury."

The key witness here for purposes of future earnings was Dr. Morris, Dr. Morris who came on as a Ph.D. and said, I've read a ton of things and I'm an expert in this field, and I can do all these mathematical things, but when he was cross-examined said, yes, but I based all of my industry stuff on -- all my prices on the Apex report by DiRenzo, and what DiRenzo's report said was that prices were being driven down so that they barely covered costs."

The judge took the position that a million dollars of damages, which would have been a 5- percent return on investment, was about right because there was a -- well, I assume because there was a differential for transportation costs, but to project 49- percent return each of 7 years in a declining industry where the last person failed is not a reasonable projection, and the judge said, this is pro forma. It has nothing to do with reality. He said, at page JA-79, how do you explain this in light of the fact that prices are being driven down to costs? How do you explain, he said in his decision --"

I mean, Gasperini concerned New York's attempt to get a handle on excessive damages, and it did it -- instead of having a substantive cap it had a procedural way of doing it. Gasperini said, New York gave it to a court of appeals. You can't do that in a Federal system because courts of appeals can't always see juries."

Long Island, whether there has been -- there must be an upper limit, and whether that has been surpassed is not a question of fact with respect to which reasonable men may differ, but a question of law. As I read Gasperini, what the Court was saying was -- and this was about excessive damages -- that trial courts can weigh things and examine things, but appellate courts must take the facts as given unless it's beyond the point where reasonable men can disagree. Here, I don't think there's a question, and I think that drives us to the standard that we propose, which is whether a reasonable judge could have come to this conclusion. If a reasonable judge couldn't have, then there's room to disagree."

Here, I take it it's the former, because the judge said, remittitur, or if you won't take the remittitur, a new trial, and I thought there was a legal standard to govern remittitur. That is, a trial judge is supposed to set it at the maximum amount that a reasonable jury could award on the basis of the evidence presented. Isn't that the standard?"

That's correct, and the judge thought, on the basis of the only competent market evidence there could have only been a very modest gain and not the sort of 49 percent per year gain that the jury awarded, much less the 124 percent per year gain that the financial expert projected. But the court did say several different things. Two rulings, the rulings on mitigation, which was a ruling that if, as Tri County testified, that they thought they were going to be $2 million a year in profits -- $2 million a year in profits from this new entity that they were going to set up -- is it reasonable for them to do absolutely nothing? They didn't respond to a letter inquiry about what their position was. They didn't pay a $50 fine, which said on its face if you don't pay this your license is going to be suspended. They didn't show up at a hearing, and they said --"

Then I thought to myself naively, where he grants a motion, the court of appeals has to see if he invaded, say, the credibility province of the jury, and where he denies it they don't have to do that job, so obviously it has to be more searching, and that stopped right there. All right, now, what's the response to that naive argument?"

Circuit understands, and it says that when a trial court sets aside a jury verdict, the appellate court's normal allegiance to the trial court falls away, and its allegiance is to the jury, and that drives them to the point, which they did in this case, of saying, if there's enough evidence to go to the jury, that's the end of the inquiry."

Here are two ways of looking at the problem, and after I've stated the two ways I'm going to ask you whether there is anything other than a verbal difference between them. One way of looking at the problem of trying to derive a standard would be this way. There is only one standard for the appellate court to apply, and it's an abuse of discretion standard. When applying an abuse of discretion standard to a denial of a new trial, it's fairly easy, because we place great weight on the jury verdict itself. We place great respect on the jury verdict. But when applying the abuse standard to a jury verdict -- I'm sorry, to an appellate -- to a trial court decision that grants a new trial, that vacates the verdict, we have to look very carefully at the facts and the record for the simple reason that we do have great respect for the jury verdict. In each case, we're applying the same standard, abuse of discretion, but in the two cases we have to look to different kinds, or at least to different degrees of factual data. That's one way of looking at it. Another way of looking at it is to say, when a trial court in effect denies a new trial, we say, well, abuse of discretion. That's all we look at. But when a trial court grants the new trial we engage in reviewing it in a more searching inquiry because, in fact, we have great respect for the jury verdict. Is there any difference, except a verbal difference, between those two ways of looking at what an appellate court does when it reviews a trial court's decision?"

Tri County responds that it is improper now to assess the relative strength of the parties showings, and then they go on to say that it was error for the court to take it away from the jury. This is a directed verdict standard. It's the wrong standard. It negates what the trial court is doing, and an appellate -- the standard should be whether a reasonable judge could have come to the conclusion that this was contrary to the great weight of the evidence, and we believe that was clearly so here for two reasons, one because it was clearly unreasonable for a company that was going to get $2 million a year to do nothing whatsoever to protect that investment and because the forecast evidence of financial gain was so out of line with the market evidence that Tri County produced."

That is, no rational jury could have reached the verdict that this jury did, and that is not involved here, I take it. What we're talking about is the grant of a new trial by the trial judge, and by hypothesis, a rational jury could have reached a verdict but still have it set aside because it's against the great weight of the evidence, and the standard now we're talking, we want to find out, when the trial judge grants a motion for a new trial that way, what standard should the court of appeals apply?"

If you're going to conduct a more -- look, if the plaintiff had the judgment, any inquiry regarding the setting aside of that judgment which is going to be more searching is going to make it more likely that that setting aside will be held to be improper, so it will inevitably favor the plaintiff whose jury verdict has been set aside."

But there is one feature of this, we go back for the Seventh Amendment to how things were at common law, and at common law, as I understand it, the appellate bench had no role at all in any of this, that it was the trial court, it could be the poll court at Westminster, but here it's kind of an irony that the appellate court that shouldn't have been in it at all is exercising muscle vis-a-vis the trial court that at common law had the only word on whether there be a new trial."

    {
      "speaker": "EMIG",
      "speech": "Well, I think you had a say to the extent if an error of law was committed that could always be appealed, but at the same time, the modern courts have allowed if the judge makes an error to have that decision set aside and a new trial, or the original jury verdict reinstated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But the discretion on setting aside a verdict as against the weight of the evidence was entirely, as I understand it, in the hands of the trial bench. Just, not any errors of law made, no errors in the charge, no errors, no reversible errors in the admission of evidence, but against the weight of the evidence was trial court business and not appellate business."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMIG",
      "speech": "Well, I guess that depends on whether the en banc court was looked on as operating in an appellate capacity in reviewing the facts."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, Mr. Emig, you didn't give us any assistance by discussing that common law in your brief, but I have scratched around and I think there was a -- you know, I dissented in Gasperini because I thought that there was no review at common law, but what the situation as I understand it was, was that there was no review when the district judge, when the trial judge refused to set aside the trial, but that there was review in the situation we have here, when the trial judge did set aside. There are several cases in which the appellate court looked into whether that was proper or not, so I'm -- you know, I'm -- now, where does that leave me? If I thought we were wrong in Gasperini, and there were several on this who joined me, in allowing appellate review at all -- we allowed appellate review there on the basis of abuse of discretion. I guess to be consistent we should have an even stricter standard when there's review in the situation where the jury verdict is ignored, so I guess there should be something beyond abuse of discretion, or should -- I don't know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMIG",
      "speech": "Well, I -- my position in this, Your Honor, is that it was not set aside, the jury verdict, because it was against the great weight of the evidence, that there was no evidence in this case of damages."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "You want to reargue your case. Now, why did you take it as an assumption that if you lose on this issue it's going to go right back to the D.C. Circuit, if you lose on the issue which is in front of us, which is not the issue that either of you apparently wants to argue, and that's the issue about whether -- it says, did Gasperini make unlawful the throw-away line that the D.C. Circuit threw in. Now, maybe we shouldn't be hearing that, but we're hearing it, so my question concerns that, and I've looked at Wright and Miller, and as I look at their standards for new trial it strikes me that I understand very well your uncertainties, because what it says is, there are all kinds of verbal formulations all over the place, and you say the D.C. Circuit has adjusted to this over 30 years, and I expect other circuits have adjusted over similar periods of time to different verbal formulations, and if we start fooling around with those in this case, there is no matter so close to the heart of the trial bar, and suddenly we will discover different circuits doing different things in light of what we say. So if we say you're right on these words, searching inquiry, some other circuit is going to take that as a signal that they're wrong and, therefore, if we allow the D.C. Circuit to do what it did for 30 years, some other circuit will be unable to do what it has done for 30 years, so what do we do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMIG",
      "speech": "I think the one thing that can be done is simply to look at the opinion itself from the district court granting the new trial and, if you feel only an abuse of discretion standard is applicable and should not be applied more strictly, does that opinion, in and of itself, constitute an abuse of discretion."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    {
      "speaker": "EMIG",
      "speech": "Then I think in that situation my position is, it's entirely unclear in terms of what they meant and how it was applied."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But I thought one of your arguments in answer to the petitioner was, petitioner, you knew all along that the D.C. Circuit is applying a stricter standard when it's reviewing grants than when it reviews denial. You knew it, and you didn't tell the D.C. Circuit when you were before that court, so it's too late. If you knew that they were going to apply a stricter standard to grants than denials, you should have told them, D.C. Circuit, don't do what you're doing for 30 years. You didn't tell them that, so you effectively forfeited the point. You made that argument in your brief to us."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMIG",
      "speech": "I think when we included it in our brief we were simply asking the Court to pay close attention to the facts of the case. If D.C. thought that that entailed a stricter abuse of discretion review, that should have been brought up at that point and it could have been resolved one way or the other by the court of appeals, but they had their opportunity and all of a sudden it becomes a problem now, when the decision comes, and there's this verbal formulation of a more searching inquiry. But the fact of the matter is, the D.C. Circuit only says, abuse of discretion, and I think that under those circumstances that was the correct standard to apply, and that they were certainly entitled to review the record more carefully because a jury verdict had been set aside."
