It's a very loose situation. But what I was talk -- referring to before was the fact that reservation boundaries are not just property boundaries, they're also jurisdictional boundaries, especially nowadays where we have allotted reservations such as this one, and so they can move the reservation boundary without necessarily applying anything as to property rights on either side of that --"

We don't view this as an either/or situation where you either have State sovereignty or you have Federal sovereignty. There's always going to be shared sovereignty within Indian country, and as a matter of fact here, there's numerous examples of this kind of shared sovereignty or special beneficial rights that tribes own in sovereign lands without defeating State title. I think a wonderful example is the usual and accustomed fishing right that many tribes have in the Northwest and there they have the right to fish at these places, occupy these places, it's a special right in submerged lands but it does not defeat State sovereignty over those lands. And so certainly there's a number of examples where we have this beneficial interest in a tribe that does not necessarily imply anything as far as a State's sovereign right to regulate itself."

Wouldn't that have been -- I mean wouldn't anyone looking at the Act say gee, if they're not going to take timber and minerals except by agreement they're not going to take anything else either. Apparently the only thing they intend to take, if they can get an agreement, is timber and minerals. They don't intend to take anything else and we may safely assume that they won't except by agreement. Wouldn't that be a fair interpretation of the significance of the 1899 Act."

Isn't that probably what it meant by the word?"

      "speaker": "STRACK",
      "speech": "Looking at the 1889 Act as a whole, Justice Souter, I don't think I would agree that statement because of this omission of the submerged lands to my mind raises a question as to whether Congress recognized that inclusion. And if we look back at the 1888 report, it does not mention submerged lands per se. It does not mention of bed of the lake. It mentions the fact that the reservation embraces these navigable waters."

I mean, can't you acknowledge that when Congress was speaking about the reservation it was talking about the reservation that President Grant had created, but that Congress knew that that reservation was not legally effective to create it because it needed ratification which had not occurred. But nevertheless Congress, out of an abundance of goodwill to the Indians, was not willing to go back on the 1873 executive order without the express consent of the Indians, but that still doesn't amount to any effective action by Congress creating the reservation. I mean, your basic point is that the 1873 executive order doesn't do anything without Congressional ratification, which never occurred. So does it make any difference whether Congress in the 1889 Act viewed the 1873 order which it knew was ineffective absent ratification as including the submerged lands or not? What difference does it make?"

It may have an interest in submerged lands, but not sufficient to defeat State title. And here, all of the rights vested in the tribe came as a result of the 1887 agreement which provided that these lands would be held as Indian land which is simply a restatement of this principle of aboriginal occupation. There was no additional rights vested in the tribe as the result of the 1889 agreement."

Then in 1889 we have the second agreement which was only a cession agreement specifically limited to purchase of lands by the 1889 Act and in the agreement there was no additional rights of conveyance. There's no language of conveyance in the 1889 agreement itself. It's simply a quit claim to the northern portion of the reservation. So whatever rights the tribe holds in the southern third of the lake and the remainder of the reservation are necessarily going to be founded in the language of the 1887 Act which defines the tribe's rights. And under Montana, where we simply have a continued right of aboriginal occupation, that type of conveyance to a tribe would not normally carry with it an interest in a lake bed that would be sufficient to defeat State title."

For example, they could reserve an exclusive fishing right. They could reserve a fishing right in common with other people. But I think the point I want to make is that because of this presumption against defeat of State title that we should always assume that Congress would try to accommodate tribal rights and State interest in public ownership of these lands to the extent possible. And here where all we have is a simple right of use, that would probably not be sufficient. Again, I think it's worth pointing out that in neither of these agreements is there a fishing right provided to the tribe expressly, which is very unusual for a northwestern tribe. I think that admission by itself is very telling in the legislative history leading up to the 1889 Act and the 1889 agreement, again we see numerous references to this tribe as a farming tribe, not as a fishing tribe."

And again, we see that in the Alaska case, none of these lands will ever be passed to the future State."

I don't know that it would make a difference if the tribe had not aboriginally occupied the territory or not. Certainly what it looks for is that affirmative grant in that language which says that no party's land shall ever pass to the future State. I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time."

But he said the navigable waters has nothing to do with the submerged land, that it's, maybe they gave him the navigable waters but that's not the submerged land underneath the navigable waters. I think that was his answer. I'd like you to respond to that because all the documents you rely upon refer to navigable waters, as none of them says anything about submerged land."

Not only did they provide Congress with the plat, they provided Cong -- or the Senate with another map that showed the acreage and actually the acreage is right over the top of the lake and this is at 135 of the record, and Coeur d'Alene reservation is written right through the lake and in the text that they talk about of that '88 question and answer which is the third of these items, they use the word embrace both for the acreage and for the navigable waters."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Givens, I don't think there's a big dispute about the extent of the reservation. I mean that isn't really what the dispute's about. The dispute is whether, when you describe the boundaries of the reservation, it means that the Indians have aboriginal occupation rights or whether it means the extraordinary thing that when we create a new State, the land under navigable waters will not go to the new State, and how do you get that out of simply the description of the boundaries of the reservation?"

      "speaker": "GIVENS",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, now, I don't see that it shows that at all because as I understand it, that map was there at the time of the negotiations between General Simpson and a tribal chief whose name I forget and General Simpson started out with the proposition in those negotiations that in fact both the Indians and the whites would have the use of the lake and that led to an immediate disagreement. The one thing it does seem to show is that General Simpson did not understand that a line across the lake necessarily conveyed either an exclusive right to navigate, let alone land underneath the water."

      "speaker": "GIVENS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "That may be, because you would get it by the agreement and the agreement in fact had not been ratified by the time of statehood. I mean, I know what he said but its significance for this case, it seems to be equivocal."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "All right, so you're assuming that Indian lands in the Idaho Statehood Act referred to lands as defined by the 19 -- by the 1873 executive order and I don't -- I don't know why we necessarily should make that assumption."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIVENS",
      "speech": "Well, one reason to make that assumption, Your Honor, is the 1887 agreement had a very unusual clause in it, the reports from the negotiators explained it was so unusual that the tribe insisted that the provision be put in that the land could never be sold or otherwise disposed of without the consent of the tribe, any part of the reservation."

In 1891 when Congress ratified this statute it ratified understandings that had been reached between United States negotiators and it is unthinkable that Congress under the equal footing doctrine would have conveyed the submerged lands to all of the lake while simultaneously negotiating to ratify an agreement that would convey the southern third to the tribe."

      "speech": "As the executive had defined it, Justice Scalia, and that's the key point here. The State has conceded that the executive order reservation is what it is and those boundaries that were defined in the geological survey had angles drawn in the lake itself, it's simply not tenable to suggest that when the lines are bent and a point is drawn in the lake and that the line crosses the lake that the lands underneath those navigable waters are not also included."

We've been very clear on that in Alaska and Alaska repeated that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "In Alaska, however, and the reason why this is closer to Alaska than it is to Utah and to Montana is that the line actually was drawn on the submerged lands as it was in Alaska where the line was drawn out in the coastal waterway area. In Montana the reservation simply crossed a river, lines crossed the river and there was no survey in Montana that this Court discusses that would show acreage as being included. In fact, Montana is distinguishable there because the rights that were given by the treaty of 1868 only were residential rights."

    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",

If I could direct the court's attention to two maps, the first is on page 135 of the joint appendix and in -- that map was given to Congress in response to the Senate resolution asking specifically does the reservation include the navigable waters."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but that's -- I just looked at that because it was decided and I can't find a word there, of course they get the navigable waters. That's why I wanted to ask and Mr. Strack said that the fact that they are given navigable waters means that they can go and fish on the lake, it doesn't mean they have a right to the submerged lands, that's what I took him as saying. Now, that, therefore that to me is an important question to me that I'm asking. What reason is there for thinking that if they gave them 42 documents, a hundred documents, a million documents, say you have navigable waters, what reason is there for thinking that that includes submerged lands?"

That map which is set out at page 202 of the joint appendix --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Let me try it once more because I was thinking my answer when I asked it would be nobody has ever doubted that if you give navigable lands to the Indian tribe you're giving them the submerged land, I mean nobody has ever tried to drive a wedge between navigable waters and submerged land, but that wasn't the answer I got. I got the answer yes, they're totally different. So this case has been around for some time and I guess by now you've thought of what's the response to that and that's what I'm trying to get."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "The submerged lands were important to the tribe for a number of different reasons. Unlike the Crow tribe in Montana, this tribe depended on water resources and they recognized the value of submerged lands even before the 1873 executive order when they made an agreement with a man named Post to convey the river channels which can be nothing but submerged lands for the purpose of Post building a mill on that site. This tribe harvested water potatoes, it built fishing weirs that were affixed to the submerged lands of the lake and the associated waterways and the executive knew that. When they negotiated for the land, Chief Seltice insisted that the line be drawn in such a way that the tribe would understand what was theirs. And General Simpson in his response on page 183 of the joint appendix says quite clearly after this agreement when the line is redrawn you shall have the lower part of the lake. That could not be clearer that the executive understood that the submerged lands south of where the line was to be drawn were to be owned by the tribe. So the question then becomes this is in a sense an amalgam of Alaska and Utah lands because had this occurred before statehood this would have been a conveyance case and the question would have been what did Congress intend by the conveyance. And I would direct the court to the 1987 agreement which we have set forth in the --"

      "speech": "It is proprietary in the sense of ownership, Justice Souter. The fact that the State may have some regulatory interest even over the southern third of the lake under even our theory because under the Mescalero Apache Indian case the State might still have a regulatory role, given a range of factors that would be involved in even if the tribe owns the southern third. But the important point is that we do know that it included submerged lands because the Post, the Frederick Post patent expressly included river channels which is submerged lands when they drew the Harrison cession in 1894. At first they started it, it meandered to the coast but because the town of Harrison wanted to build docks and wharfs, they redraw the line at a right angle in the middle of the lake so that the town of Harrison could build out that wharfage on to the submerged lands of the lake. So in this case the boundary lines are quite clear that the parties understood submerged lands were at issue and they drew the lines accordingly."

      "speech": "Mr. Frederick, can I come back to this pollution thing? Part of Lake Coeur d'Alene has, I understand, is badly polluted from mine tailings, some such thing; is that stuff on the portion that's at issue here or is it on another portion?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "It's throughout the lake, although the principal portion of the polluted part is on the northern part of the lake. The southern part at least I'm reliably informed, and this is matter that's outside of the record, is not as polluted, although it is subject to pollution problems and issues. I would like to just make a couple of points in conclusion and that is the Idaho issue in terms of submerged lands is also implicated by the 1888 railroad statute which Congress passed and that passage which came after the Senate resolution asking about the navigable waters included a right of way that crossed across Lake Coeur d'Alene to a point on the lake itself and requires that the secretary provide compensation to the tribe for that easement and it further provided that no rights for the railroad shall accrue unless and until they obtained the consent of the tribe. So read together and this court's cases makes very clear two overarching propositions, that these Indian statutes should be read as a series and that doubts should be construed in favor of the tribe suggest that Congress did understand that the submerged lands were at stake, that the tribe had control over those submerged lands and that the United States would not take them without the consent of the tribe. If there are no further questions."

    {
      "speaker": "STRACK",
      "speech": "On this question of whether or not there's a difference between beds and navigable waters, I think the court has made that very clear in the Alaska decision where the court looked to purposes that required ownership of the beds themselves; for example, the need to own the bed to preserve the oil deposits."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "We've just heard about wharfs, about harvesting potatoes, about grants for the mill, does that indicate the sort of purposes that we thought were important in Alaska?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRACK",
      "speech": "Looking back at the 1889 Act I don't think any of those purposes are evident on the face of the 1889 Act. If there was a purpose and the only purpose they have identified is fishing, and that itself does not require ownership of the beds of the navigable waters themselves unless they're fishing methods for some reason required ownership of the bed like a fishing weir, but we don't see any evidence that they were doing that in 1889. So again I think we need to look at the purposes here and see whether or not those require ownership of navigable waters, ownership of the beds of navigable waters as opposed to the waters themselves. I'd like to go back too to the question practical effect because I think it obviously is a concern here. And I think it's important to note that all of the lands along the shore of the lake are owned by non-Indians and that's been true since 1910 when the reservation was allotted. Those lands, those people have riparian rights which they look to the State to protect and define. Many of those people have encroachments on the lake and that's where our ownership of the beds comes into play because we regulate those encroachments so that they do not go out far enough to impair navigation and other uses of the lake. So all of these people along the lake, now their riparian rights are called into question because the State no longer owns the beds of the lake according to the decree and so we don't know what the effect of that would be. On the issue of pollution it works both ways, so the tribe has an interest in protecting the lake from pollution and the State has an equal interest, if not more so, because we own the remainder of the lake, and when you split a system like this in two it becomes very hard to regulate that in a consistent manner. For example --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "As far as encroachments on the lake, doesn't the Corps of Engineers have authority no matter whether the tribe owns the submerged lands or the State of Idaho? Doesn't the Corps get to say what can encroach out in the navigable water?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRACK",
      "speech": "Justice O'Connor, for the most part the Corps is not involved in these kinds of encroachments unless there's dredging and filling."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Do you dispute the fact that the Corps does have jurisdiction to determine what encroachments are authorized in navigable water?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRACK",
      "speech": "Where there's a fail interest involved, Justice O'Connor they certainly could come in and preempt, but it's my experience that we regulate all those encroachments and I'm not aware of the Corps ever being involved in those kinds of decisions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "If the State perhaps regulates more stringently then the Corps would care to, that's quite possible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRACK",
      "speech": "That is quite possible because of the statute that we have in place protecting the lake as a public resource for recreation and other public uses. And so when we have a split system like this, especially on issues such as fisheries, if the tribe was to introduce new species of fish that was not genetically compatible with the fisheries that we have in the remainder of the lake, we could have some real problems there. So there's tremendous practical effects that result not only from tribal ownership but tribal ownership of a small portion of the greater lake. On the issue of -- Mr. Givens mentioned the acreage that included in the report, the acreage that included navigable waters but it's also important to look at the acreage of the cession that was reported. According to the United States' exit report at page 237 the acreage that was ceded in 1889 was 243,000 acres and that included 37,000 acres of the lake. But the House report 1109 reported that acreage as 185,000 acres. That's found at page 315 of the joint appendix. So obviously Congress did not view this cession as including the lake bed itself. They did not view themselves as having purchased that from the lake."
