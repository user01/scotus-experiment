It is ambiguous because it has two reasonable readings with very different claim scopes, even after all of the interpretive tools are applied. Such ambiguous claims defeat the public notice function which is at the heart of Section 112, and they increase litigation. They cause more claim construction disputes, and they cause more reversals of district court claim construction rulings. Taken all together, ambiguous claims and the Federal circuit's test allowing ambiguous claims defeats the very purpose of Section 112 and the patent system, namely, to encourage and promote innovation by others after the first patent issues."

      "speaker": "VANDENBERG",
      "speech": "Your Honor, we would submit that the disagreements between the judges and, in fact, between Biosig itself went to the scope of the claim, namely, does the scope of the claim cover all ways of achieving the desired result no matter how the electrodes are spaced. That's one possible reading. The other possible reading is that the claims cover only a special spacing of the electrodes to achieve the desired result. And why that matters is if you think of the inventor in 1994 who invents a new material for electrodes, and this new material achieves the desired result of detecting equal muscle signals on the left and right side, regardless of the spacing of the electrode. So it doesn't matter where you put the electrodes, as long as you can touch them, this new material achieved the ­­ the desired goal. That inventor would not know in 1994 if they infringed or not, because if the claims had the interpretation that the majority eventually gave them, namely, that the spaced relationship has this functional limitation and it must be the result of this trial­and­error balancing, there'd be no infringement. But if spaced relationship meant any spacing, then there would be infringement. So that is the exact type of zone of uncertainty that United Carbon warned against and which deters the innovation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "But it can't mean any spacing, because anyone skilled in the art would know the hand has to cover it. So you're basically talking about a fairly narrow range between one side of the hand and the other and not too close together but they don't ­­ don't work. And that seems to me that someone skilled in the art can just try a couple of things and see where ­­ where the trial and error. Trial and error makes ­­ could mean a very difficult thing, like Edison discovering what works in a light bulb. But here you've got a very limited range and someone skilled in the art will just, well, let's try it, you know, close to the middle, let's try it to so far apart. But it's not any spaced relationship."

    {
      "speaker": "VANDENBERG",

So I agree that under each interpretation it makes sense that the electrodes have to be touchable by a single hand, and they can't be touching each other or there'd simply be a single electrode."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",

    {
      "speaker": "VANDENBERG",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, the purpose of the patent is it would cover possibly, again, all techniques for achieving the desired function. So again, going back to the invention of the new material, if the inventor comes up with a specific way of achieving the result, and here they came up with trial and error spacing, they didn't describe that in the patent. That didn't ­­ that wasn't described by the inventor until 15 years later. But nevertheless, let's say they had this specific way of achieving it. They very well could have drafted the claim intentionally the way they did to have a broader coverage so that they cover all possible ways of achieving that desired result. Patent attorneys are trained to try to draft the claims, you know, some claims as broadly as possible. So that reading by the concurrence was a very plausible reading of this claim. Reading the claim, it has any spaced relationship as long as, as the Chief Justice indicated, I can touch them and they're not touching each other. But that's it. There's no other restriction on what \"spaced relationship\" means. That's a very reasonable interpretation and that was the interpretation that Biosig asserted at the Markman claim construction in this case."

Maybe it has something to do with the spacing electrodes, but maybe not. And the further problem is that the specification here did not describe any technique for achieving the desired result. If one reads the specification, you read it and it says various things and it says, whereby the muscle signals are detected as being equal on both hands, on both electrodes. Well, in reality, the ­­ the electrical signals on my left and right palms are unequal. Somehow, however, the electrodes detect them as if they're being equal. The patent doesn't say how.

Sometimes there is later prosecution history in a related patent. That type of prosecution history shouldn't be used to sort of ex post facto cure an initial indefiniteness. But putting aside that rare instance, yes, the prosecution history and the specification are part of the interpretive tools that are available and would be used. I think it's important to remember here that there is no legitimate need or excuse for ambiguity in patent claims. Once the applicant has satisfied paragraph one and its strict requirements for describing the invention, it is easy to claim the invention particularly and distinctly. The only reason that there are so many ambiguous claims out there today is that patent attorneys are trained to deliberately include ambiguous claims.

That wasn't described, the trial and error spacing, until 15 years later, and that the patent specification has no concrete examples of embodiments inside the claim or outside the claim. So we ask that the Court reaffirm its precedents in United Carbon, General Electric and Eibel Process. Eibel Process upheld a claim that had vague sounding language. The language was \"high elevation,\" \"substantial elevation,\" but it was upheld because that patent specification concretely described the invention, its theory of operation, concrete examples that came inside the claim scope, concrete examples that fell outside.

The first thing it did was it looked to the claim language, the written specification, the diagrams, all the traditional tools of patent interpretation. It said there is definiteness here because there are bounds to the spaced relationship. It isn't just anything, it has to be greater than zero, it has to be less than the width of a hand. It's implicit in the ­­ actually explicit in the statements of the patent. Then it said that the functional limitation, which is the whereby clause in the patent, sheds additional light. That's where the concurrence got off the train and the concurrence said: I don't think we need to reach that issue. Nautilus has turned that approach on its head. Nautilus says that the fact that the concurrence didn't think it was necessary to reach the functional limitation, in fact said that it's not before us for procedural reasons, Nautilus reads that as if the concurrence was somehow disavowing or disclaiming the majority's approach.

That ­­ that is the key here, is that there's a strong economic incentive. The patent attorney and the inventor are in the best position to avoid the ambiguity that Congress prohibits and therefore, the problem is, the Federal Circuit has blessed ambiguity with its test. And in order to stop all of the problems that the amici have pointed out that are caused by ambiguous claims, we submit this Court needs to be clear and go back to United Carbon and General Electric and to the statutory text and be clear that ambiguity is simply not permitted. In terms of how the Federal Circuit ruled here, and we point to the majority's opinion at petition appendix 15(a), the court, the majority, definitely applied the insolubly ambiguous test. They said, \"Because the term was amenable to construction, indefiniteness here would require a showing that a person of ordinary skill would find spaced relationship to be insolubly ambiguous.\" And therefore, if the Court rejects that test, we submit, at the very least, the Court cannot affirm the judgment below on that basis.
