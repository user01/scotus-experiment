      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Flast against Cohen, this Court recognized narrow circumstances in which a taxpayer could satisfy the requirements of Article III in challenging a congressional exercise of its spending and taxing authority. This court in doing so rejected the suggestion of Justice Douglas that it allow all taxpayers to sue in all manner of claims, as well as the slightly more modest suggestion of Justices Stewart and Fortas that the Court allow taxpayer standing for all establishment clause challenges. This Court's subsequent cases such as Valley Forge have made clear just how narrow the rule of Flast is. In order for a taxpayer to satisfy the requirements of Article III, the taxpayer must challenge a congressional exercise of the taxing and spending authority, and assert that the act of spending itself is what gives rise to the establishment clause violation. The court of appeals in the decision below substantially expanded the scope of taxpayer standing and in doing so, the court adopted a doctrine that I think can fairly be only understood as an exception to, not an application of normal principles of Article III standing. The court did so on the rationale that there is much that the executive branch can do to violate the establishment cause, but there is much that all three branches of Government could conceivably do to violate the establishment clause, and that has never been thought a sufficient reason to extend taxpayer standing to all Government action, nor has it been thought a sufficient reason to relax the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III."

And what I would say is if you have a challenge where the problem is that it's the very act of money going to the third party conference organizers that's the problem, then it really is a spending case, and I think the taxpayer standing would logically lie. But if it's really, what the concern here is the primary conduct of what was done at the conferences, and not the fact that there's spending on the conferences at all, then I think it's more -- it is a case there would not be taxpayer standing."

I think the way to understand Kendrick is as follows: You have a decision that says you can - - you can challenge congressional spending, not Executive Branch action. That naturally poses the question what about an as-applied challenge to a spending statute? Surely, I mean, because spending is something only the Congress does, and disbursement is a ministerial act that only the Executive does, what do you do when there's an intervening ministerial act of disbursement?

      "speech": "Well, Justice Ginsburg, two things. One, in Bowen, there was -- there is certainly always a degree of discretion. But it is worth noting that in Bowen as in Flast, the statute itself on its face made clear that money was to go to outside entities that were religious. In Bowen it did so in express terms by four times referring to religious organizations. In Flast it did so by saying money was going to go, or in-kind aid, rather, was to going to go to private schools. And that was at a time when this Court roughly contemporaneously, in Lemon v Kurtzman that 93 percent of the private schools were religious. The both of those, the gravamen of what's the complaint, that money is being spent by Congress on religious entities, was not within the discretion of the Executive Branch. And again, the way I would understand Kendrick is simply reconciling Valley Forge and Flast and Cohen to preserve, not broad challenges to Executive Branch action, which would have overruled Valley Forge, but rather to simply preserve the notion that you can bring an as-applied challenge to a spending statute."

Because whether it is spent by the Executive under an Executive program, which you have said can violate the establishment clause as well as a congressional program. So why isn't that the line to draw based on Flast, that it's money from the Treasury that makes the difference?"

And the reason that they do that is because the establishment clause is an important joint part of the religion clauses; and there'd be no other way to bring such a challenge. And sometimes it's that simple principle, and when we depart from that principle, say by giving property away instead of giving money away, you don't have the standing. So we have a pretty clear, simple rule. That rule applies whether it's Congress or the President acting under congressional authority, et cetera, which I think is close to what the other side - -"

He said bestowal of Government largesse outside the Government. The second point I would make is I still don't understand where in just being upset you satisfy the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III, and even though Flast is probably the outer limit of what's an Article III injury under normal principles, there is at least what Judge Leventhal in Public Citizen against Simon called conceptual directness between the injury to the taxpayer and the injury that comes when tax money is spent outside the Government to a religious entity. He differentiated that from what happens when you have general Executive Branch activity that's unlawful, where he said there's no similar arrow between the action and taxpayers as a class. It's a classic injury that's inflicted on everybody. It's a generalized grievance, which has never been said to satisfy Article III."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
      "speech": "So in fact, you have - - just help me with one point here. I mean, I see that deciding what's incidental and what isn't incidental will be difficult. I guess many of these cases would end up being decided on the merits, there is no violation on the merits, or maybe sometimes there is. But I'd started thinking of the question of standing by thinking that there are strong feelings when the Government spends money in favor of one religion and not another. After all, they led to the 30 Years War. We see that in other places in the world today. People feel strongly. And if, in fact, they have that terribly strong feeling and can't make any challenge because the feelings are shared by many, then there are no cases in the courts at all, and the Government can do what it wants without challenge. So in Flast, they carved out an exception, and the exception was where the taxing and spending clauses were involved, because Madison and others said this is aimed at \"Government shall not tax and spend\". So that was my theory. And all we're saying is where there's a big taxing and spending and it isn't incidental, there's standing. Now we're worried about the merits. Simple and clear. To which the response was, which has me a little worried frankly, was that, well, that was Justice Stewart's position, or roughly speaking. But the Court rejected that quite clearly, and if you look at later cases, they reject it too. And therefore, whatever you might think of it, it isn't the law. And I'm not free to think whatever, I have to think exactly in accordance with what the cases say. So what is your response? I'd like you to focus on that."

      "speaker": "PINCUS",

And what he said here is he was just explaining his reason why he believed that Flast was distinguishable from Frothingham, and notes specifically that taxpayers have a clear stake because of the threepence comment. Justice Fortas did say, did have a broader theory, although he -- in addition, that the court did not adopt -- but he also said, recognizing very similar language to Justice Stewart, what the Court's opinion held.

And it seems to me that's quite intrusive from the standpoint of standing purposes. I'm not sure that this makes a standard that distinguishes the case from Flast or brings it within those -- within those cases."

There is a passage in Valley Forge that refers to executive action, but the Court in Kendrick when it talked about Valley Forge said, in characterizing that case, said executive action pursuant to the property clause. And we think those things are tied together and there's a reason why. In the appropriations context, there always is congressional action with respect to the very money that's at issue because there has to be a congressional appropriation. That's not true in the property context. Congress doesn't have to say, pass a statute to say, here are the 58 property sites that we want the executive to get rid of."

But I think what's important here, and the Court's colloquy in the first part of the argument showed me this -- but the Government's position, the idea that it's only grants to third parties -- - the Government could hire a corps of chaplains and send them out to civilians and to the populace at large and that couldn't be challenged, because all it is is executive pay; and the Idea that there's some difference between a Bowen v. Kendrick situation, where the executive had tremendous discretion in terms of where it was going to give the money, and the situation here, which is the exercise of Precisely the same executive discretion, makes no sense. The injury is the same. The conduct that's -- that's the core of the violation is the same. It's an Executive Branch decision to use funds in a way that's impermissible under the establishment clause, and we've been drawing the lines that the Government has been trying to draw just makes no sense, and to leave out, to insulate from any taxpayer challenge really huge swaths of conduct that is really at the very core of what Madison was concerned about. So our submission is that that really makes no sense. There's no basis in history, for example, for the Government's claim that Executive Branch decisions are somehow different and insulated with respect to spending. It's the spending of the same threepence, and if history indicates anything it's that concerns about establishment were focused just as much on the King as on the Parliament in terms of the history that the framers understood. And for the idea that the executive would be given free rein to exercise discretion with respect to spending and there would be no concern about the types of injuries that gave rise to Flast we think is just not right. If the Court has no further questions, thank you."

    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal. First of all, I think it's important to emphasize that if this Court recognizes that there is not taxpayer standing, that does not mean that there won't be lawsuits, that there won't be directly injured plaintiffs that can bring claims. Doremus and Schemp prove that point. But even more broadly, any time the establishment clause injury takes the form of alleged coercive conduct the individuals who are coerced Are going to have standing to bring the suit. The second point to make clear is it's just not an accurate description of this Court's cases to say that the spending of appropriated funds by the executive is enough to give rise to taxpayer standing. The property distribution plan at issue in Valley Forge took a tremendous amount of appropriated funds to run. Nobody thought that was a basis for taxpayer standing. The Bibles that were purchased and the salaries of the teachers in Doremus presumably cost at least a threepence. But that was not found enough. Now, I think in trying to understand the Court's cases you really have to focus on this word \"incidental.\" And I think that the colloquy in the second half of the argument shows that you can't look at incidental as being minimal. It doesn't mean that. It doesn't mean minimal. It doesn't mean incremental. It is trying to distinguish an incidental expenditure of funds when -- as to something where the expenditure of funds is central or vital to the establishment clause violation. In the context of money going to third party religious entities, nobody would say that the spending is incidental. It's the whole violation. In the context of Bible reading or anything else the Executive Branch does, the fact that money went to fund the Executive Branch to violate the establishment clause is the least of the problems. The problem is the primary conduct of the Executive Branch in violating the establishment clause, but that's not a spending injury. The funding that goes into that is incidental. I think that's the way to make sense of this Court's cases. It's important to emphasize what's at issue here. It's not a general challenge to the Faith-Based Office. It's not a challenge to the name of the office. It is a challenge to the particular offices and the assertion that the Executive Branch officials at the conferences spent too much time talking about faith-based groups and not enough talking about community-based groups. If that isn't intrusive on the Executive Branch, I don't know what is. The last point I would leave you with is that if something has to go in this area, if you have to choose between the logic of Flast and the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III, I think it's an easy choice. You don't abandon the basic requirements of Article III that distinguish the Judiciary from the political branches of Government. I think the Seventh Circuit, with all due respect, lost sight of that. Its decision should be reversed. Thank you."
