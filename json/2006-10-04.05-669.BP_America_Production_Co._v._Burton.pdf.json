    "speech": "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Section 2415(a) established a limitations period for every action for money damages by the Government which is founded on any contract. That provision, by its terms, applies to every contract action, every adversary adjudication seeking monetary compensation for breach, whether pursued before a court or an agency. The contention that every action encompasses only civil actions or judicial actions is incorrect for three reasons. First, it is inconsistent with the broad language that Congress used. It is inconsistent with the statutory structure, in that it renders another provision, the exception for administrative offset, totally superfluous. It also creates an irrationality in the hierarchy of the Government's claims. Finally, it robs Section 2415(a) of its intended effect. Turning to the text, Congress and agencies regularly use the term \"action\" to refer to adversary adjudications before administrative agencies and before the judiciary. The term --"

Doesn't the statute, in effect, say, \"We don't mean, by 'action,' what we would possibly -- what possibly might be included as an administrative proceeding\"? If they had wanted an administrative proceeding to be a subset of the actions for money damages, wouldn't it have been sensible for Congress to say in -- to refer, instead of to \"administrative proceedings,\" to \"administrative actions\"?"

But counterclaims and offsets typically aren't brought by complaint; they're brought in the answer, they're submitted in the answer. Therefore, whether it's denominated an \"order,\" an \"answer,\" or something else, doesn't control whether or not 2415 applies. 2415 applies to any action for money damages founded on a contract, however you might denominate the initial filing which commences the proceedings.

And sometimes in 28 U.S.C. there are provisions that apply to both. The Federal Tort Claims Act, for example, is in 28 U.S.C., and it has a provision for administrative adjustment of claims. People must file their claims before an agency first, and then the agency can do administrative adjustment. That's entirely separate from the attorney general's ability to compromise the claim once it's filed in court. Section -- title 5 also contains things that apply to courts and agencies -- the right to judicial review of agency actions, the waiver of immunity that's necessary for those -- in addition to standards that govern judicial review of agency actions.

And the one the Government, in the administrative context, would be most interested in would be subsection C. When the Government just doesn't know the facts, or the Government reasonably couldn't know the facts, it gets an exception, just tolling, until it reasonably could have known of the fact. And that's just as applicable in an action before an agency as it would be in an action before a court. In addition, the Government's contrary construction renders an entire provision superfluous.

Administrative offsets for the Government to try and avoid paying money, those must be brought within 10 years, under the administrative offset provision that was enacted together with the exception in (i). However, offensive administrative actions to extract money may be brought in perpetuity, forever.

And the Government's construction here is inconsistent with the ordinary hierarchy which allows the Government to avoid making payment on more favorable terms; then the Government gets to go in and forcibly extract money from private individuals. Finally, the Government's construction also undermines the intended effect of the statute. The effect of statute -- the purpose of statutes of limitations -- and this one, in particular -- is to provide repose -- to allow the individual to know that he will no longer confront Government claims, to dispose of his documents, and also to encourage the Government to be diligent in pursuing its claims.

    "speech": "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The presumption is that the Government is not bound by a statute of limitations. And, when read as a whole, Section 2415(a) does not overcome that presumption, but instead makes clear that it applies only to suits in court. There are several reasons for that. First, the ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms refer to suits in court. Second, the statute expressly distinguishes between administrative proceedings and actions. Third the statute's located in the judicial code. Fourth, the committee reports, for those who are inclined to consider them, strongly support the statute's ordinary meaning. And, fifth, even if some administrative proceedings were governed by Section 2415(a), these would not, because they do not involve a complaint. Now, on the first of those points, the term \"action\" ordinarily refers to the pursuit of a right in court, which just is why, just 7 years ago, in West v. Gibson, every member of this Court agreed that the term \"action\" often refers only to suits in court, and not to administrative proceedings."

  {
    "speaker": "JOSEFFER",
    "speech": "Well, the structure of the law here is that in those instances where Congress does authorize administrative recovery, it ordinarily provides a context-specific administrative limitations period, such as in the Contract Disputes Act, which governs almost all of the contract claims the Government can pursue administratively. Congress specifically enacted a 6-year limitations period for the submission of a claim to a contracting officer. In this unique context, however, Congress had very good reasons for not applying a limitations period until it prospectively enacted a partial one in 1996. The reason is that what Congress found here, in context of mineral leasing, based on the findings of an independent commission, was that the companies were historically on an honors system and had abused that by underpaying royalties of up to half a billion dollars annually. So, what Congress directed the agency to do is to audit all current and past lease accounts. One of the committee reports said to focus on old accounts, because this was a Congress that was not concerned with repose, but with getting some of those vast underpayments back from the companies. Now, when we fast-forward to 1996 --"

And that works, because, when Congress authorizes administrative recovery, it almost always provides a specific -- context-specific administrative limitations period. Also, when Congress was telling the agency to focus on old accounts, it certainly wasn't thinking that a statute of limitations applied to that, and the agency, in that contemporary context, did not understand that there was a limitations period, either, because the orders that issued in the aftermath of the 1982 Act went back 7, 8, 9, sometimes more, years than that."

    "speech": "No, the OLC opinion was limited, by both its terms and its reasoning, to administrative offsets, not to administrative adjudications. And if I could explain that, an administrative offset occurs in the situation -- this is what OLC was looking at -- where the Government, by statute, owed retirement benefits to a person, and, because it thought that person owed it money, what the Government did was to unilaterally reduce the retirement benefits. What OLC opined is that that is a -- nothing more than a prejudgment attachment. And OLC thought that if the Government is time-barred from obtaining a judgment, it should be time-barred from obtaining a prejudgment attachment. An administrative adjudication is significantly different, because it does provide an actual judgment. So, there are a couple of important points from that. First is that the dispute between OLC and the Comptroller General was limited by its terms to administrative offsets, although, Justice Stevens, the Comptroller General did opine beyond that, that the statute specifically applies only to suits in court. But the actual dispute was as to administrative offsets. So, when Congress addressed that specific dispute, as Justice Alito pointed out, it resolved only that specific dispute."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

I mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which you're urging here, which is that this statute applies only to judicial proceedings. I mean, that's the point. Whether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position taken by the Justice Department was that this statute relates to administrative proceedings."

    "speaker": "JOSEFFER",
    "speech": "No, the position of OLC was limited to administrative offsets, and it did not -- the important thing is, OLC opinion did not interpret the statutory term \"action,\" or, frankly, any other statutory term. Instead, it had a theory, which was probably wrong, that administrative offsets are unique because they are prejudgment attachment devices. That's the dispute that went to Congress, and that's the dispute that Congress actually resolved. And, in any event, going forward --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "No, but I thought your -- in answer to Justice Scalia, you said what was essential to the -- to OLC's position was that the offset is like a prejudgment attachment, and, in effect, it's an attachment without process. If that's the case, then timing should have nothing to do with it. Conversely, as Justice Scalia said, if timing does have something to do with it, timing presumably derives from this provision; this provision, therefore, must have been assumed to apply to administrative proceedings. So, either there's no time question with respect to the offsets, or, if there is a time question with respect to the offsets, it implies an OLC position that this provision applies to administrative proceedings."

And, going forward, it is not surplusage, because the issue still arises. If the Government could pursue its suit only in court, it would be time-barred from pursuing a suit in court. The question would then still arise, under the OLC opinion, unless it had been overruled, whether the Government could, nonetheless, obtain a prejudgment attachment, even though it cannot obtain judgment. That's all that Congress was looking at there. And, as this Court's recognized in cases like O'Gilvie and Vonn, when Congress amends a statue to resolve a specific dispute, oftentimes its amendments should be read as doing no more than that. We -- I agree, though, that terms -- to get back to the beginning of this discussion -- terms do not always have their ordinary meanings, but they presumptively do, especially when a statute must be strictly construed. And here, the context confirms that \"action\" does have its ordinary meaning, for several reasons. First, the ordinary meanings of the other key statutory terms, such as \"right of action,\" \"complaint,\" and \"defendant,\" as Justice Ginsberg pointed out, all ordinarily refer to aspects of suits in court. A \"right of action\" is the right to bring a suit in court; a \"defendant\" is the person defending in court ordinarily; and a \"complaint\" is the document that initiates proceedings by stating a claim that's seeking relief in a civil action, which is a suit in court. Especially when those terms are used together, this Court recognized, in Unexcelled Chemical, that a reference to commencing a action by filing a complaint ordinarily refers to filing a suit in court, not a pleading before an administrative agency. The statute then goes on to expressly juxtapose an action against an administrative proceeding by saying that the time to file an action does not run until after the administrative proceedings have concluded, which certainly gives weight to the point that the action is -- an administrative proceeding is not an action."

I think the reason is that -- I mean, historically, administrative -- obviously, court suits have been around a lot longer than administrative adjudications. And, as Congress has authorized administrative adjudications, it's dealt with them on a case-by-case basis. And every time that it enacted a context-specific administrative adjudications period since 1966 -- in theory, it could have just done an across-the-board one for all agency adjudications, but, instead, it's chosen to deal with the context-specific; in part, because of the great variety of administrative procedure. I mean, as this case illustrates, a statute of limitations that governs a complaint in an action is just not going to work in a lot of administrative contexts. Here, there's no complaint.

As a -- but as a result, the notion that we're going to pull auditing resources off of today to do a frolicking detour into 50 years ago, there's a reason that's never happened. In addition, the farther we try to go back, the greater the proof problems, because oftentimes only the companies have the information that shows what royalties they would owe, and if they lawfully destroy those records after 6 years, it makes it even harder for us to try to go back, because of proof problems."

  {
    "speaker": "JOSEFFER",
    "speech": "-- certainly can. But there's no -- and, as a practical matter -- I mean, because the Government bears the initial burden of going forward, if the company destroys the sources of proof, that's, on balance, going to be in its favor. But, in addition, there's not a strict congruence between the 6-year periods, because, first, the companies only have to keep records for 6 years, but, in some circumstances, the Secretary can require they be kept for longer. In addition, sometimes the statute of limitations, because of tolling, is much longer than 6 years; and so, the lawful destruction of records would still leave absence-of-proof issues in situations where the statute might, because of tolling, be much longer. So, there's not a strict congruence. There is also no indication that Congress enacted the 6-year records-retention policy because it was thinking about a 6-year limitations period. There's never been any linkage between the two. If I could briefly cover, then, also -- I mean, in addition to all the textual points, this is also located in the judicial code. And, although it's true that a couple stray provisions in the judicial code apply to administrative proceedings, they say that expressly. Every time the word \"action\" is used in the judicial code -- and Petitioners identified no examples -- every time the word \"action\" is used in the judicial code, it refers to a suit in court, and only a suit in court. When a provision of the judicial code applies to something else, it will say so. For example, 28 U.S. Code 2462, which is a statute of limitations for penalty proceedings, refers to an \"action, suit, or proceeding.\" The Federal Tort Claims Act is very clear that what it's talking about is submitting something to an agency. So, if Congress was going to legislate against the backdrop of a strict construction canon with terms that ordinarily refer to suits in court, and put the provision in the judicial code, I mean, that just is a totally irrational way of expressing intent, especially clear -- especially a clear intent, when it's trying to govern administrative proceedings. The committee reports also strongly confirm that, because they not only say that the statute defines the time limitation for bringing an action in the U.S. courts, and not only use court terminology from front to back, they also say, like the statute, that they're aware of the administrative proceedings, but what they're saying is that the time to bring an action in the courts does not expire until after the conclusion of those proceedings. The committee has explained that the reason for that provision was the great number and variety of administrative proceedings. So, in other words, Congress was saying, \"There's a great variety of administrative procedure. We're just not going to deal with that here. We're taking it off the table by saying this limitations period does not expire until a year after those administrative proceedings, whatever they might be, have expired.\" There's also some relevance in the fact that this legislation was proposed by the Justice Department as part of an overall package of reforms that would govern the civil litigation that the Department was handling in the courts. It was then referred to the Judiciary Committees, not to the House Government Reform Committees that might consider administrative procedure matters, and, as I mentioned before, was enacted as part of the judicial code. From start to finish, this legislation has never had anything to do with anything other than court suits, which is why Congress has expressly provided for context-specific administrative systems -- limitations periods -- which make sense in the context of the relevant administrative procedures."

And it seems to me, the best that Petitioners can do is to say that some of the statutory terms, in isolation, are ambiguous. But that -- all that means, as I said, is that, under the strict construction canon, we would prevail. And even if the statute governs some administrative proceedings, but not others, it would not govern these, for the reason I gave earlier, which is that there's no complaint here. We talked, before, about the ways in which an order is not a complaint. It's another important point, though, that in order not only -- it is -- not only does it not begin the proceedings, it normally ends them, because appeals are only taken about a quarter of the time. And in some limited circumstances there's not even a right of appeal, if the Assistant Secretary issued the order. So --"

And, finally, one thing I should also emphasize is that what we have in this context is a comprehensive administrative scheme. Petitioners like to say that, \"Well, we could just as easily be in court.\" There's a reason that no administrative royalty proceeding has ever been brought by the Government in a court. And that's, first, that Congress directed the agency to establish a comprehensive auditing and collection system, and then gave the agency administrative authority to enforce its administrative orders. The only way the agency could administer thousands of leases with something like $9 billion in royalties every year is to do this in an efficient administrative manner. Congress has not only authorized that, and ratified it, it has strengthened that scheme and told the agency, as I said, in 1982, to go back and look at old leases, precisely because Congress knew that is a standalone administrative scheme, and it's never provided the administrative limitations period for the standalone administrative scheme.

I wanted to start with the ordinary meaning of the term \"action.\" I was somewhat bemused by the Government's insistence that had -- the term \"action\" in West versus Gibson was construed -- it must mean an action before a court, and has that as its ordinary meaning. The Solicitor General's own position in West versus Gibson, on page 25 and -6 of its brief was, \"Section 1981(a) does not, however, define the term 'action' as being limited to judicial proceedings. The statutory language, read in context, suggests that no such limitation was intended.\" Page 6 of the Government's reply, \"The term 'action,' in Section 1981, can reasonably be construed as encompassing both administrative and judicial proceedings.\" The term \"action\" is a term that's used for adversary adjudicative proceedings, whether those are in court or before an agency. It is not limited to administrative agency proceedings, as the Government itself recognized in West versus Gibson. There are more general terms here. There's also \"complaint,\" there's also \"defendant.\" There's a number of those. But those general terms are also the terms of adversary adjudication. And Congress uses them, as far back as 1921, for adversary adjudications before agencies."

And there is always, in an adversary adjudication, some document that functions like a complaint, that provides the defendant the notice of what the claims are against it, and to which failure to respond will result in default. We believe that the most likely thing to be the complaint here is, the thing that provided us with notice, is that -- \"Boys, you've got to respond; otherwise, you're in trouble\" -- was the order to pay. And Congress came to that same conclusion when it enacted -- when it enacted FOGRSFA and established a 7-year statute of limitations provision. But if we lose 2 years of the claim, and only get 1 because it is the agency letter, in the Court's view, well, that's fine, but there's some document here that started these agency proceedings, and it is that document which is a complaint."

But we will get that to you, or the Government will get it to you, as soon as possible. The actual agency letter, in this case, isn't in the administrative record. And it turns out that we haven't been able to find it, and the Government hasn't been able to find it. And so, it's a letter.

It would be that, for all claims going forward from September of 1996, the Government has 7 years, but, for the prior 200 years, those claims persist in perpetuity. When Section 2415(a) itself was enacted, Congress avoided precisely that result by deeming all prior claims to have accrued on the date the statute of limitations was enacted.

And there is a clause at the front of 2415 that says \"except as otherwise provided by Congress.\" And so, Congress often takes exceptions. And when it modified the Mineral Leasing Act of 1996, that was an exception to the 2415 regime. So, Congress knows how to conduct specialized situations and take things outside of 2415 when it needs to. But it enacted Section 2415 as a catchall for all of those situations where Congress hadn't managed to anticipate the circumstances. And the Government's premise of the whole provision is that Congress botched it. Congress provided a catchall that catches judicial actions, but leaves the Government free, in perpetuity, to persist -- to proceed on precisely the same claims for precisely the same relief, plus interest. And, because interest is calculated at a relatively high rate, that makes those old claims much, much more valuable than the relatively more recent claims. And it seems implausible to think that Congress enacted a catchall limitations period with a loophole so large that it deprives the statute of limitations period of effect almost entirely. Finally, I'd like to say, one moment about the statute -- the canon of strict construction. And that is that it doesn't always require the court to narrow otherwise broad statutory language, particularly where doing so would have the effect of rendering another provision -- here, subsection (i) is superfluous -- introducing anomalies into the statutory structure and depriving the statute of its intended effect, as the Bowers case we cite in our reply brief on page 16 makes clear. And Bowers case was virtually on point. It was the case where the -- it was a statute of limitations that could have applied to administrative agency actions, or it could not have. And the Court declined to accept a narrowing construction proffered by the Government under statute of strict construction because it would have rendered one of the provisions -- one for consent proceedings -- superfluous, because it would have resulted in anomaly, and because it would have undermined the premise of repose which undergirded the statute of limitations in that case. Precisely the same things are true here. And, for those reasons, the Court should reach precisely the same result. If there are no further questions, thank you very much."
