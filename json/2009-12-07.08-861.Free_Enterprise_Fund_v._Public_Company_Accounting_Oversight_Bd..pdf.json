    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The board is unique among Federal regulatory agencies in that the President can neither appoint nor remove its members, nor does he have any ability to designate the chairman or review the work product, so he is stripped of the traditional means of control that he has over the traditional independent agencies. On the other side of the balancing test, Congress provided no reason for stripping him of these traditional means of control."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Why do you call it an independent regulatory agency? I mean, Congress wanted it to be independent of the profession. That much is clear. It didn't want it to be independent of the SEC, so why are you characterizing it as an independent regulatory agency?"
  },

    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, by making it public, it made it free of the accounting profession. So then the next question is: Why didn't they have the same relationship between this agency and the President that the FCC and SEC have? And, in those instances, the President can appoint and remove the members. Now, why didn't they do that here?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",

    "speech": "What happened to the Petitioners here? I think, if you were challenging what happened to the Petitioners here, certainly it would be a question of how you would have to do that.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Well, the provision they point to, 7217(d)(1), says it can relieve the board of responsibility, but there is nothing in the statute that gives the SEC to conduct the board's statutory duties. For example, it couldn't say, we will now collect the fees that are going to the board, we will now conduct the registration that’s going to the board."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, why -- why isn't this simply relieving the board of responsibility, saying, you no longer have responsibility for -- for investigation and inspection in these areas?"
  },

    "speaker": "CARVIN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "They could do that, couldn't they?"

    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "No, it can't. But even if it could, my major point is it can’t --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, let's talk about whether it can't or not. Why can't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "All right. If you turn to 39 and 40a of the board's appendix, at the back of the red brief, the board's brief, it walks you through the statutes we have been talking about. And at the bottom of 39a, that's 7217(d)(1), and that’s where it says it can relieve the board of responsibilities. And I have two points on that. One is there’s nothing in here that gives the SEC the power to assume the responsibility. It simply says the board need not comply with that obligation. My second point is: This doesn't stop the board from doing something. If I relieve my associate of the responsibility to give me a brief tomorrow, I haven't told him he can't do it. If I want to impose a limitation on him, if I want to say stop, I have to enclose a limitation. And if you will turn to the very next page --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Don't -- don't you think that's what it means, though, realistically?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "You know, Your Honor, I think that would be --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "When you no longer have responsibility to perform a government -- governmental act, you no longer have authority to perform it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "If you viewed it in isolation, that would be an arguable principle. But if you turn to the next page, 40a, you see a very specific provision in the statute that talks about how they can impose limitations on the board. And this is when they want to censure -- impose limitations upon the activities, functions, and operations of the board. And what do they need to do? They have to have a hearing that the board has violated or is unable to comply with any provision of this Act or without reasonable justification or excuse. So Congress has established very serious barriers to the SEC even limiting the board's responsibilities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",

    "speaker": "CARVIN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "And the commission can't change the sanctions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",

  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Well, sanctions of course are done with order. They get to review the sanctions after the board has done it. I'm talk about the prosecutorial, investigative techniques --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "So as far as -- if the company was ever certain it was right and that the Accounting Board was out of control, completely wrong, the company would just say: I'm not complying --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Well, I don't think there ever would be a dispute about whether or not they would have access to their documents and their testimony, because it's written right in the statute --"
  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "It says you don’t -- you can get it even without a subpoena?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "-- or is it all confidential?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "I think there are certain confidentiality restrictions as part of their investigative and inspection thing. It's -- it’s the normal kind of inspection, where you go through the investigation and they would review the various documents. And my -- but my basic point is that that is a very serious burden on American citizens. That is something that is totally outside the SEC's control."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "The -- the burden of time of compliance?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "I'm sorry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "The burden is because it's difficult and expensive to comply?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "That would be one. Number two -- and I think probably more important -- since the SEC doesn't review it, this board was created to make sure that there was no more Enrons. So let's look at it from the other perspective. Let's say the board was negligent or sloppy in ferreting out the kind of auditing standards and abuses that the statute was enacted to do. The SEC would have no way of knowing that, no way of --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "No -- but I'm -- I’m talking about the harm to your client and to the -- those similarly situated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "There’s the cost of compliance. What other harms or dangers or risks are inherent in the power of the board unmonitored, unchecked by the SEC, to investigate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "You’re right, Your Honor. The burden here is the burden that Mr. Olson suffered in Morrison v. Olson. He was never indicted. There was never any sanctions subject to review. But he was subject to a burdensome investigation and that is the burden that affects American citizens that is beyond the review of the SEC."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "But I've got one thing on my list. I'm looking to what they control, can't control -- the commission. And so far I've written that in your view the commission can investigate people without subpoenas, and the commission can do nothing about it, okay? That's one."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Now, what's two?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Well, I think that that is the main point."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Okay. So we only have one on our list."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",

  },

    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "If I might elaborate slightly, Justice Breyer, I think it's important to understand that they have the ability to inspect foreign auditing firms, and the Cato Institute filed a brief that described the adverse reaction of the 27 countries where they are currently exercising this inspection power abroad. That is totally beyond the control of the President, obviously, as well as the SEC, to say how these -- how these inspections and investigations are going. The --"

I'm delegating to you the responsibility to do X, Y, and Z according to these rules of conduct."

    "speech": "What's the difference between that and this scheme?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "In your hypothetical, the principal has exactly the same powers as the subordinate. Here the subordinate has statutory duties and responsibilities totally distinct from what the SEC can do. In addition to inspections, they can --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Well -- let's break down each part of your argument, please. You are suggesting that Congress doesn't have the power to determine that a particular principal or agent of the government doesn't have certain responsibilities?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "No, obviously they do. And what I’m -- you were asking for -- I'm now trying to describe the relationship between the SEC and the board, and the one difference between the normal employer- employee relationship is that the board has statutory authority wholly distinct from the principal. Number two, if that subordinate didn't do things the way the principal wanted in the employment situation, the principal could fire the subordinate. When can the SEC fire the board in these circumstances? Only when they have committed gross abuses and after notice and opportunity for a hearing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "And if you have a statute that says each Department -- Commerce, Justice -- the Attorney General of the United States or the secretary shall appoint an inspector general who will in fact inspect and find ethics violations and that office -- he cannot be removed from that office without cause. In your view, that's all -- and it would be unconstitutional."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "No, no. In the Interior Department, those are of course the President's alter egos --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Yes. Well, why? What's the difference?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Well, two differences. One is the -- the Secretary of the Interior is the President's alter ego, and so, therefore, the President --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "So you are saying that the -- the chairman of the SEC does not under the Constitution have the authority or the SEC does not have the authority to appoint individuals who cannot be removed without cause?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Well, I think there is two points."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Or -- or you might be saying they do not have the authority to appoint inferior officers of the United States. I don't know why they wouldn't have that authority if the Secretary of the Interior has that authority."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Well, because Freytag made it clear that there’s a difference between an independent agency, like the Tax Court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "What's an independent agency?"
  },

  },
  {

The same would be true if he called him up and said, fire the chairman of the PCAOB. And if that is so, then the President has no ability to remove somebody exercising a very important executive function, and unless we are going to rewrite what has been generally understood as the independence of -- of independent agencies, then there is a fundamental difference between the President's ability to fire an inferior officer at the Justice Department and fire an inferior officer at the independent agency."

And this scheme, besides, embodies precisely the evil that was condemned by every member of the Court in Freytag and in Edmond, which is it creates an unaccountable system where a multi-member commission beyond the President's political oversight and control is making appointments.

Because the President exercises such extraordinary control over the chairman and therefore is able to control the SEC staff, Congress, in the statute, took away that traditional enforcement mechanism. All of the SEC staff you were referring to earlier, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg, are the chairman's alter egos. And since they are the chairman's alter egos, they are completely constitutional. And Congress, again, took away the chairman's powers, which was a way of limiting the President's ability to control the board. And I think they -- but our basic observation --"

    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "No, because we believe they are principal officers for three reasons under Edmond: They run their own shop; the commission has no control over the officers on the board, since it can only remove them in these extraordinarily narrow situations; and as we have discussed at length before, it can only review part of its work product, whereas the appeals court judges in Edmond, all of their work product was subject to review. And I think the removal provision is particularly important here. The board can pursue policies that the SEC absolutely abhors and thinks are completely counterproductive, but under this extraordinarily narrow removal provision --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Isn't that a highly unlikely scenario? I mean, this thing won't work unless these two are working in harmony."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Well, it would work perfectly if the board was an independent, autonomous entity that was not subject to the plenary control of the SEC, and that's exactly how the Senate report described it. No, the New York Stock Exchange works perfectly fine even though the SEC has oversight responsibility over the New York Stock Exchange directly analogous to the oversight responsibility it has over the board. And so, no, it would work perfectly fine if you followed the congressional scheme, which was an agency with its own autonomy and power. And since it is an agency that has its own revenue sources, its own statutory authority, it has to be an agency composed of principal officers. Elsewise very powerful agencies, including the CIA, for example, would be considered inferior officers simply because in an organizational chain they report to some others. And I would argue, to get back to my original point, Justice Scalia, that that would absolutely confound the accountability that the Framers insisted upon, that either the President and the Senate or a direct lieutenant of the President make the kinds of appointments of inferior officers and that the important officers go through the advice and consent process. If there are no further questions, I’d like to reserve the remainder of my time."

Members of Congress thought that the SEC had been resource-strapped and wanted to create something with its own separate funding stream, which it was able to do by declaring this a kind of quasi-governmental agency. Second, it wanted to get the board outside of the normal civil service laws, because it wanted to attract people that it thought it could not attract on normal civil service salaries. And third, I think history and tradition have a great role in -- in the question that you are answering, because what -- the history and tradition of SEC regulation of the financial industry in general is -- is -- in -- in some part through the SROs, the self-regulatory organizations. So --"

So, this was a way to -- to have both. And it was also, I think --"

And further, as I said before, that the SEC can reach further back into the process and say, not only do we have this kind of veto authority over any sanction that comes out of an investigation or over any report that comes out of an inspection, but we can also change the way those inspections and investigations are conducted in the first place."

    "speech": "What is -- I'm sorry. What is the removal authority of the SEC with respect to board officers?"

    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Let's assume that that's correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So you need to rely on Morrison to make the limitations on what the SEC can do with respect to the board constitutional."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "I think --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "And you need to rely on Humphrey's Executor to make the limitations on what the President can tell the SEC constitutional."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, removal is just a tool. Removal is not the ultimate constitutional question. The ultimate constitutional question is the level of presidential control, and the presidential control here is exactly the same with respect to the board's activities as it is with respect to the SEC staff's activities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Oh, no, no, because you have got an extra layer there. Let's say, I mean, that you have to have two violations of the for-cause provision. You have got to have -- you have to meet the requirement in two places. When the SEC wants to remove the board member, they can only do that for cause. And if they decide, well, there isn't cause, I'm not going to do it, then the President under your theory has to remove the SEC commissioners, all of them, not just -- not just the chairman, and he can only do that for cause. So you have got \"for cause\" squared, and that's -- that's a significant limitation that Humphrey's Executor didn't recognize and Morrison didn't recognize."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "But that for-cause provision is surrounded by a panoply of other control mechanisms."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, let's just talk -- a practical example. The board says I want to get the documents of company X. The SEC thinks they shouldn't do that. Okay? Can they remove them for that situation -- in that situation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Well, they can pass a rule that says no, you can't get the -- the documents of company X, and then when the board members go ahead and try to get the documents of company X --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "I think that they effectively can. They would have to do it by -- I think that the easiest, quickest, most legally secure way would be to -- to do it by -- by promulgating a rule that says you can't do this. And then --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "The easiest way to do it is to pick up the phone, not by promulgating a rule."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "I said the most legally secure way to do it would be to do it that way. I think that the fact that they have that formal mechanism means that they could pick up the phone and accomplish the exact same thing, because --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Can the President pick up the phone and fire the SEC commissioners?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "The President can pick up the phone and fire the SEC commissioners for cause, however \"cause\" has been defined."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "He thinks -- he thinks they -- the board should be getting the documents from the other company, and the SEC thinks they can't. So the SEC tells the board, don't go after that company, and because they do that the President fires the SEC. Does that work under your theory?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "So now the SEC has given the board one order and the President doesn't like the order that the SEC has given to the board?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Again, the President has the same level of control over the SEC as he has with respect to anything else. That's just Humphrey's Executor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I'm not worried if it's the same. I'm worried if it's enough."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Well, but that's Humphrey's Executor. Humphrey's Executor said it was enough."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Right. And then --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "And the question is whether this goes any further."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It goes further because you’ve got to rely on the SEC to get to the board. So there you’ve got to rely on Perkins and Morrison."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "You always have to rely on the SEC to do anything, to supervise anybody in its field of operations, whether it's the SEC's own staff or whether it's the board members, who stand in essentially the same relationship to the SEC commissioners as the own SEC staff does."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, do you dispute the proposition that the more layers of for-cause removal you add, the -- the less control the President has? Suppose there were five layers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Justice Alito, I think it all depends. I mean, we are not saying that a double for-cause provision is always constitutional, just as we are not saying that a single for-cause provision is always constitutional. The question is, in what context does that for-cause provision operate? And where it operates in a context like this one, where it is surrounded by a panoply of alternative and -- and equally effective control mechanisms, it simply should not matter that there's another for-cause provision."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Well, what do -- what do you say in response to their formal argument that heads of departments are those people whom the President has at-will control over, like the Secretary of Defense, and Freytag is support for that. And these aren't those people, so the SEC’s members must be inferior officers, and the Constitution says nothing about and implicitly forbids inferior officers from appointing other inferior officers beneath them. All right, that's a formal argument, but I got that out of their briefs, and I want to know what you respond to it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Scalia, who doesn't much like Humphrey's Executor, nevertheless wrote a brilliant opinion in Freytag saying that in fact independent agencies were departments, and -- and -- and so that commissioners of the SEC would be principal officers, their appointees would be inferior officers, if -- if those appointees were subject to the direction and supervision of the principals in exactly the way Justice Scalia said was necessary in the Edmond case. He is --"
  },

    "speech": "I think that -- if I understand the question correctly, I think that the -- the implication about --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "I mean, if there is a removal power implied, why isn't it removal for all purposes? How -- why can it be limited to just for cause? What authority do we have to do that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Well, I think that the understanding about the SEC commissioners is that the SEC commissioners were, essentially, the same as the FTC commissioners, which, under -- which, under Humphrey's, were removable only for cause, and as I believe --"
  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "But that's because the statute required it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Yes, but -- you’re exactly right, and it's a -- it's a perplexity of this law, but for many, many decades, everybody has assumed that the SEC commissioners are subject to the same for-cause removal provision, and the government has not contested that in this case, nor has Mr. Carvin."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "General Kagan, the government argues here that the head of department is all of the commissioners. Elsewhere, it is the chairman of the SEC who -- who appoints inferior officers. Now, which is it? Are all those appointments by the chairman invalid?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "No, they're not, because all those appointments are made subject to the approval of the commission."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, that's something quite different. He makes the appointments. They can overturn it, but the appointment must be made by the head of the department, and the appointments are not made by the commissioners. They are made by the chairman."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Well, I think practice in this regard has changed in different administrations, but if you look at the amicus brief that was filed by the former chairmen of the SEC, they make clear that in fact the commission has ultimate authority over each and every appointment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "What do they have to say about the theory that the SEC commissioners can be removed by the President?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that nobody has contested that question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "And you are not contesting it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "And we are not contesting the question that the SEC commissioners, themselves, are removed by the President for cause under, I would say, a very broad for-cause provision, in the way that Bowsher suggested, not something that’s niggling and technical."

    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The SEC has pervasive authority over every aspect of the board's operations. Board rules and sanctions have no effect, except as the SEC allows, and can be changed by the SEC at any time. Board inspections and investigations are subject to plenary SEC control. Not only are they conducted under rules that the SEC must approve, but the SEC can threaten or actually rescind the board's enforcement authority any time it thinks that's appropriate in the public interest. It controls the board's budget and salaries, and it can reassign matters to --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Independent of the congressional appropriations process, not independent of the SEC. Section 7219 is clear as water that the SEC controls the board budget, and the SEC in fact has used that control to regulate down to the level of the board members' salaries. In addition, the SEC can impose rules requiring getting -- requiring the board, for example, to get SEC pre-approval for particular steps or particular actions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Do you know any other agency composed of inferior officers that has the power to acquire its own budget, as this board does, by simply assessing a tax upon the people that it regulates?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "In fact, this board doesn't have that power, because it can only do so as the SEC allows. Here, as in all other contexts, it is the will of the SEC that controls."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "The SEC can overturn it, but it's up to the board -- the board can do it. Do you know of any parallel situation where there is a, supposedly, agency composed of inferior officers who have the power to tax the public unless it's overturned by somebody else?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Well, there’s a bunch of other similar entities, such as the SIPC and the like, that assess fees, and many of their officers are appointed by department heads, rather than the -- than the President. And so, yes, I think that's actually not an uncommon feature, but the most -- but the most critical aspect of this is, here, as in every other context, it is the judgment and the decision of the SEC that controls. The board can propose, but it's the SEC that decides."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, the board can act, and the SEC can, I suppose, retroactively veto their actions, but the SEC doesn't propose what actions the board takes, actions that can have significant, devastating consequences for the regulated bodies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Well, precisely the opposite. With respect to rules, the board's rules are ineffective --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I'm not talking about rules. Agencies in the government do not act only in implementing a particular rule. They have authority to regulate. And the board here, for example, can tell a particular entity: You have to turn over these documents. They don't have to have a rule that says, this company must turn over the documents."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "And the SEC staff can do precisely the same thing. In fact, right now they can issue subpoenas without asking the commission for consent. And the -- and the answer is, if you don't like it, you go to the principal officer, and you say, rescind the board's authority -- threaten to rescind the board's authority; this is out of line. And the SEC has broad authority in the public interest to rescind the -- the board's authority to enforce the action, enforce the law in any respect."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "But you can say the same -- you can say the same thing about Congress. I mean, this is not the kind of control that an executive officer normally is supposed to have over inferior officers; when they do something, you can take away their authority. Congress can do that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Well, Congress would have to do that by legislation, subject to veto by the President, and in fact this is precisely the type of control that powerful executives regularly exercise. If they don't like the way an inferior is doing something, they can take away that authority, and they can take away their salary as well, which is so close to being fired that I can't see any light between them, frankly, Your Honor. So the board -- the SEC controls whether -- what the scope of the board's authority is and its salaries --"

Having read this enlightening opinion of Justice Scalia in Freytag, which is enlightening to me if I've read it correctly, I would say that the question -- there are two separate questions. One question is: What is a department? And this might well fit within that. And the second question, which is separate but mixed up in the cases, but not his, is: When is it constitutional for Congress to limit the President in his ability to dismiss a -- an officer of the United States or -- inferior or superior -- for cause? And -- and what's -- if you can answer it, what are the justifications here for imposing that requirement?"

  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Right. And the answer to that is that these are the standard limitations -- the standard removal provisions that exist throughout the financial area where the SEC has a subordinate entity under its control, and Congress presumed that because the SEC's -- the SEC's control was so pervasive, it didn't need to go back and revisit those standard removal provisions, because -- precisely because -- the SEC has power to rescind the board's enforcement authority, establish rules requiring it to obey commands, disobedience of which would be grounds for removal, to withdraw the salaries. The control is so pervasive that these removal provisions did not have to be reconsidered. And from the board's perspective, they're just another means of control, one that actually taints them, as Shurtleff points out, with having committed misconduct. Thank you, Your Honor."

Well, the New York Stock Exchange has exactly the same relationship as the -- with the SEC as does the board, and no one would argue, I don't think, that he has any power -- the President, that is -- to direct and supervise the New York Stock Exchange. In response to your question, Justice Alito, he couldn't complain about the excessive salary of Mr. Grasso at the New York Stock Exchange. I’d also like to knock down this myth --"

    "speech": "You could have exactly the same relationship between the SEC and this agency, which I think is not under the wing of the SEC now. The only difference is, instead of having the commissioners appoint them and remove them, you'd have the President appoint them and remove them."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, I would have -- Judge Kavanaugh has suggested there are two ways to cure this problem: One, have the President appoint and remove; and the other thing, make it truly subordinate to the SEC. Now, I've heard the argument on the other side, both from the government -- well, it's an issue with the government -- the Solicitor General and the board, that the agency, the board, is completely subordinate to the SEC. Well, if Congress -- Congress could fix this problem by saying: The board is subordinate to the SEC."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "So why have they created any independence if they really wanted them to be subordinate? And I really want to deal with that. This notion that they could pass rules to govern the investigative activities of the board is a myth. The attorney general in Morrison had the ability to promulgate rules for prosecution, but he couldn't tell Alexia Morrison how to proceed in that individual case. He couldn't say: Anything she does with respect to Mr. Olsen, I need to pre-approve. Why? Because the independent counsel, under that statute, had the prosecutorial authority. Under this statute, the board has the prosecutorial authority, and everyone knows you can't govern the kind of manifold decisions that prosecutors need to make through some kind of bulky notice-and-comment rulemaking. And that is why it is utterly mythical to pretend that they have this power. Justice Scalia, we assume that people exercise the powers they have, removal and the like. We don't assume that they exercise powers that they don't have simply because they can theoretically get it. What if the statute said the SEC --"

    "speech": "That they have powers they don't have simply because they can reach out and get it. So let's assume the statute here said the SEC could transfer the board's powers to the Treasury instead of the SEC. Would we assume -- would we analyze this case as if the Treasury was conducting the board's powers simply because the SEC had the theoretical ability to transfer it? This Court has emphasized countless times that you analyze separation of powers cases with respect to the practical consequences, as Mistretta said it; as Plaut said it, with respect to bright lines and high walls; and as Airport Authority said it, with great skepticism of Congress's subtle encroachments. You don't create fictional realities which allow severe usurpations of executive authority on the basis of fictional --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, we know exactly what the SEC and the Solicitor General think about the interrelationship of the Constitution and the statute, because they have expressed it in briefs from the district court on up. I am saying that even if you bend over backwards to give them this power under the statute, what you can't do is pretend that they have exercised this power under the statute. The first might be a doctrine of statutory construction. The second is deciding separation of powers cases on the basis of a fictional world that doesn't really exist. And I would suggest that that would give Congress an extraordinary blueprint for using the board as a model for each and every executive department. What would stop them from tomorrow; from transferring the Transportation and Labor and Energy Departments to a private corporation like the board, and creating some bipartisan commission that’s going to oversee this board with these fictional hypothetical realities? If this Court endorses this scheme, they have literally offered no limiting principle why that couldn't be applied to each and every executive function. To the contrary, they have emphasized that there is no constitutional distinction between alter egos and these independent commissions, and they have sought to justify this scheme on the basis of cases involving core executive functions, Perkins and Morrison. So, again --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Well, I don't think you can sever that provision from the statute, because I don't -- I think you’d be rewriting the statute and re-striking the balance that Congress did. Moreover, of course, it wouldn't solve the Appointments Clause problem because, again, these are principal officers not appointed by the President, and even if they are inferior officers, the SEC is not a department. So --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Well, no. It is a very serious -- yes, it is on my view absolutely dispositive of why the statute is no good. I'm saying merely fixing that will not fix the entire statute, because in addition to removal problems, we have very serious appointment problems under the appointments clause --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "May I ask one -- one narrow question? If we assume that the members of the board are inferior officers, and if we -- do -- would you agree that if the board had unrestricted power to discharge them at will, the statute would be constitutional?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Your -- I'm -- I'm to assume that the Appointments Clause problem -- if they are inferior officers, again, I have an Appointments Clause problem, because they are appointed by somebody who is not department head, i.e., the SEC commissioner. Do you want me to take that out and assume that that's okay as well?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CARVIN",
    "speech": "Okay. So, if we are looking at it strictly from a separation of powers perspective, it is true that eliminating the for-cause removal provision goes a long way towards fixing the problem, but it doesn't go all the way and for one reason, which is we think the SEC imposes -- is at the outermost limits of constitutional acceptability. And so, unless the President has the same control over the officers that he has over the SEC, it would not be good."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
