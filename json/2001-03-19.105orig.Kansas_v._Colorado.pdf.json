      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court: The parties are here on exceptions to the third report in this case. After the Court determined that the State of Colorado had violated the Arkansas River Compact in 1995, the case was returned to the Special Master for further proceedings. Subsequently, the Special Master determined that Colorado had violated the Arkansas River Compact in every year from the inception of their compact to the date of filing of this case in 1985. He further determined that, since the filing of the lawsuit, that Colorado has continued to violate the compact in every year through 1996, except for 1987. Colorado does not challenge those determinations. Each of those determinations is in the unit of acre feet. Altogether, for the period 1950 through 1994, the period at issue here for the remedy, he determined that approximately 420,000 acre feet of water had been depleted from the Arkansas River by Colorado and its water users in violation of the compact. That amount of water is about 125,000 times the size of this courtroom, or a column the size of this courtroom extending upward about 1,000 miles. He has determined that the proper remedy for these losses, which are both past and future, because of the lingering effects of the violations by Colorado, should be compensated in money rather than in water. At the end of trial, Kansas had determined that its losses were $62 million. Colorado's corresponding number was $9 million. The Special Master recognized losses that we calculate to be approximately $57 million. However, the Special Master was persuaded by Colorado not to accord Kansas full compensation for its losses. He reduced it further by denying part of the prejudgment interest that had been quantified by Kansas at trial."

You're going to get to that, whether we compute the losses to the farmers of Kansas from the failure to have more water delivered."

      "speaker": "DRAPER",
      "speech": "Yes. There's no dispute at this point in the case, Your Honor, that the compensation should be paid in money. That, as Your Honor alludes to, was quantified by Kansas in large part by assessing the injuries suffered by the water users in Kansas, mostly irrigating farmers. The approach was taken to assess the losses in value suffered by the water users in Kansas because we had no ready market for water to which we could turn for the value of an acre foot of water in 1950, 1951 and so on. If we had that, that would have been the most direct way to do it."

It just -- what I vision, and I want the answer to this, and I'll exaggerate it, but hoards of lawyers in State Attorneys Generals offices combing through the files of ancient documents looking for violations, primarily to receive for the State Treasury vast amounts of money coming out of compound interest. I mean, you see, that's the horror. Now, what prevents that from happening, once we get into the habit of awarding prejudgment interest?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DRAPER",
      "speech": "The Court has stated that the determination of prejudgment interest is subject to the Court's discretion. It is also subject to consideration, again, of the time that has passed, and we are looking here at not simply any claim that could be found in the cellar of a courthouse. This is the claim of the State of Colorado against the State of Kansas, or, I'm sorry, the State of Kansas against the State of Colorado, and it is Colorado, along with Kansas, who are the signatory parties to this compact, and the compact itself, in article 7(a), equates the State with its water users. If I could turn your attention to that particular provision. It is in the topside brief, the blue brief, in the appendix at page A-11. Beginning at the bottom of A-10, article 7(a) of the Arkansas River Compact says, each State shall be subject to the terms of this compact. Where the name of the State or the term, State, is used in this compact, these shall be construed to include any person or entity of any nature whatsoever using, claiming, or in any manner asserting any right to the use of the waters of the Arkansas River under the authority of that State. We believe that this equates the water users in both States with the States themselves both in terms of the actions in Colorado by Colorado water users constituting the actual violation by the State of Colorado and, on the other side of the State line, the losses suffered by the individual farmers in Kansas, being the losses that the State of Kansas, as State, is entitled to claim for breach of the obligation that Colorado had to the State of Kansas. In further support of that point, I would point to a second provision of the compact. It's in the same appendix at page A-5, and this is in the famous provision -- at least famous to those of us who have been working on this case -- 4(d). This is the provision that makes explicit the obligation of Colorado, and it's the proviso in the last five lines of Article 4(d) that is important. It reads, provided that the waters of the Arkansas River, as defined in Article 3, shall not be materially depleted in usable quantity or availability for use to the water users in Colorado and Kansas under this compact by future development or construction. We believe that it is not the proper characterization of this case that it is going to be -- that is a problem for the individuals, either as taxpayers in Colorado or the water users in Kansas, but that these are State obligations, and they need to be settled between States on fair, compensatory rules that are normally applied in contract situations, because, as we know, compacts are contracts between the compacting States."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Indeed. The two dates, or the findings with respect to the two dates struck me as being at least possibly in tension. I'm not suggesting that Kansas would have been obligated to file suit, of course, in 1969, the year that it first knew or should have known, but it also seems the case that there was rather a long gap between that time and the time that Kansas actually did institute suit, and yet the Master found no undue delay. Now, all of this may be relevant if we determine that interest should run and try to come up with some determination about how to take the point at which it begins to run. Is there some tension between the knew or should have known in '69, and the no undue delay for a lawsuit that wasn't filed for 17 years?"

    {
      "speaker": "DRAPER",

We believe that the way that the Special Master has applied the lack of knowledge in the two areas, one area being where there was unreasonable delay, and the other area being whether prejudgment interest should be awarded, is inconsistent.

That was the whole reason for the common law rule, and if that's the reason, then you're asking us to adopt a new rule here. How could Colorado have known about prejudgment interest in an interstate compact dispute?"

It has faced trenchant criticism, to use the words of this Court, in the 1995 case, City of Milwaukee, and we believe that this is, as the Court has pointed out, essentially a contract dispute. One must keep in mind that it is sovereign States who are the contracting parties, but the guiding principles --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So shouldn't that, Mr. Draper, mean that there should be some modification? You say the common law rule has been abandoned in many States because it's illogical, the distinction between liquidated and unliquidated damages. On the other hand, as Justice O'Connor's starting questions indicated, we are dealing here with a peculiar animal, a suit between two States, so why do you insist that you take the, what would be the rule for an ordinary contract in the State that's abandoned the liquidated-nonliquidated and take that over, jot and tittle, to the interstate suit?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DRAPER",

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but that -- doesn't that sort of beg the question? If we start with the assumption that there is some discretion over the matter of interest, why couldn't we resolve the tension between the findings with respect to those two dates with a rule like this, that interest will be awardable from the time at which the violation either was or should have been known, and from the time after that at which suit was instituted, to avoid the problem of allowing a State, as apparently Kansas did here, to sit on its rights from 1969 to whatever it was, 1977?"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I know that, but why shouldn't he have? I mean, it just seems odd whether the delay -- call the delay undue or not, the fact is there was a 17 or 18-year delay from the time at which Kansas could have brought this lawsuit. Why should Kansas be rewarded with interest for that delay, even if it was not undue?"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "When you get to the second point, and I don't mean to spoil your order, but will you sort of take up where we left off on the problem that we -- some of us seem to be having in finding that there was knowledge, or should have been knowledge in '69.

Your Honor, first of all, the Master's finding with respect to knowledge here related to Colorado's knowledge, and not Kansas' knowledge, and Colorado had knowledge that there was the prospect of some violation because it had complaints within its own State borders with respect to groundwater pumping depletion, depleting stream flow and, as you may recall, that is the basis for liability here, that Colorado had allowed its citizens to pump groundwater which reduced the State line flow."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Let's assume, just -- and I think we've got your point, but assume for the sake of argument that Kansas would have been under the same duty to know that Colorado was, and that '69 is the date. The case as it comes to us, I take it, is a case in which there is no question about Kansas being thrown out of court for suing too late, but it may well be that, by waiting so long to sue, Kansas should not be entitled to the same running and compounding of interest that it would have been entitled to if it had sued more promptly after the 1969 date. Why shouldn't we take that possibility into consideration in fashioning the rule as to when the interest starts to run?"

      "speaker": "MINEAR",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, but couldn't they have brought a suit in equity to stop depletion, and if they had done that, the damages wouldn't be running, we wouldn't have the interest question."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "MINEAR",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I agree with all of the points that are being made here, and the United States wishes to emphasize the principle that a rigid rule one way or another with regard to prejudgment interest is what ought to be avoided here. We do think these factors are relevant in considering what is the appropriate level of prejudgment interest."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, why not do the simplest thing? They're States. They can say what they want in the compact. Just say, the traditional common law, no interest on, no prejudgment interest on unliquidated damages, or whatever, applies, we assume it in the contract, compact, unless they work it out and say to the contrary."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MINEAR",
      "speech": "Your Honor, because I think that doesn't adequately address the common law rule, which I think we should look to the Restatement of Contracts in stating the rule in a compact case. That's the closest analogy to the contract situation, and in the Restatement of Contracts, since 1932 the rule has been that, where damages are a fixed sum of money, or a performance that has a fixed value, prejudgment interest does apply, but in those cases, in all other cases prejudgment interest is applied under a rule of reasonableness, based on the aspects, the circumstances of the particular case. So our position really simply suggests that the Restatement rule is what ought to be applied here. Both States would have been on knowledge of that principle as a background principle in this case. I would like to address the Eleventh Amendment issue, because I think that also merits this Court's concern. The Master properly determined, in accordance with this Court's decision in Texas v. New Mexico, that Kansas is entitled to money damages as a basis for Colorado's compact violations, as a remedy for the compact violations, and he calculated those damages by determining the value of the water that Kansas was entitled to but did not receive and, in making that determination, he evaluated the cost to Kansas farmers, which was reflected in two matters, increased groundwater pumping costs, and also lost crop production. Colorado has challenged that aspect of the award on the basis that it violates the Eleventh Amendment, and we disagree. Our view is, the Master's determination of damages here was simply by reference to what the water was worth to the Kansas users, not to provide any sort of compensation for the Kansas users themselves."

    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Let's assume they don't. Let's assume they don't. Let's assume it would violate the Eleventh Amendment for these farmers who are deprived of the water to sue Colorado. Why does it make any sense to allow Kansas to sue on their behalf, and then turn around and give them the money?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MINEAR",
      "speech": "Because Kansas is not suing on their behalf. Kansas is suing for the performance that was due to it under the compact. Kansas is asserting, in essence, its own claim, which was for delivery of a usable quantity of water, usable water at the State line, and --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Why shouldn't the measure of damages, then, relate to what Kansas as a State lost? It did, in part, lost income taxes and that kind of thing. I mean, why would the measure be specifically what each farmer would have lost in terms of dollars?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MINEAR",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, the reason why is, we have to determine what was the value of the water at the State line, and as you pointed out before, there is no market for the water like there would be a market for so many bushels of wheat."
    },

Here, money is being used as a substitute for water, and we thought it appropriate to weigh in on that question with respect to the position that the Master has taken, and our position is very simply, simply that we have to look to what the value of the water was at the State line."

      "speaker": "ROBBINS",
      "speech": "Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I did not take the time to read the entire article, Your Honor. The -- later in the compact, in the enforcement provision, the two States address the manner in which they are going to determine when usable flows might be depleted by setting up an interstate agency called the Arkansas River Compact Administration, and the Arkansas River Compact Administration is charged with investigating concerns about material depletions to usable flow. There was no contemplation in this compact that Colorado -- I want to draw a distinction between other compacts that States have entered into, the Colorado River Compact, where the obligation to deliver water is set out at 75 million acre feet over 10 years by the Upper Basin, the Rio Grande Compact, where there is a table of relationship located right in the compact, where each signatory understands what it must do each year to comply with the compact. In the case of the Arkansas River Compact, there was no obligation on the part of Colorado to deliver a particular quantum of water in any year. Rather, both States sought to have the opportunity to continue to develop unused waters, and both States agreed that they would be vigilant, working through the interstate agency, to investigate when and if a violation or an under delivery was occurring. Now, no investigation was requested. Under the compact, under Article 7(h) -- 8(h), I'm sorry, until 1985. Prior to that time, both States cooperated together and worked together on the operation of the river. Neither State expressed an understanding that there was any way in which the river was being depleted by activities in Colorado or in Kansas. Remember, if you look again at Article 4(d), it applies to both States, not just Colorado, so what we need to do here is understand what the deal was, and the deal wasn't that Colorado was automatically guaranteeing that it was going to deliver a certain amount of water every year, which would be what would be assumed by the argument which Kansas has made, and therefore failing to deliver some amount over a 40-year period, we automatically should owe them significant damages, when, in fact, the concept here was that both States would work to allow full development of the system, and both States would be responsible to ensure that if overdevelopment occurred in one or the other State that affected usable flows, an investigation would be undertaken and appropriate enforcement undertaken. So in our view, at a minimum, on prejudgment interest, until 1985 Colorado knew no more than Kansas. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Colorado did. The Master --"

      "speaker": "ROBBINS",

We argued that that report should have given the States notice of the existence of a potential problem under the compact, and this Court found, different than the master's first report to you, that the evidence was vague and conflicting. It is our view that in fairness, if it was too vague and conflicting to find that Kansas should have known in 1969 and brought suit at that time if it was concerned, or, better, referred it to the compact administration, that in fairness Colorado should be held to no higher standard of knowing that it was in fact depleting usable flows."

The parties never discussed anything to do with damages in this case.

I mean, the -- but the -- my thought was, and this might be totally wrong, that it isn't that the -- you know, the fact that something was done in the Middle Ages is not, whoever Holmes said, a reason for following it, so let's start with the Restatement rule. Why shouldn't that be the rule? I think it should be the rule in normal civil cases. If there's something different about this one, it must stem from the fact that in a very old case what we're talking about are two groups of taxpayers, neither of whom was around at the time, shifting money between each other and stirring up a lot of trouble between their States. Now, is there a basis for distinguishing that and if so, what, and why?"

You merely made the statement in that case, this Court, that damages would be appropriate, and would be appropriate in certain circumstances in interstate litigation. The proper measure of damages in our view are those damages which represent damages to the sovereign and quasi sovereign damages which would be damages to the general economy. We do not agree, and strongly disagree, that summing the individual damages -- and I want to make a point here. We disagree with the United States. What the Master did was not use damages to farmers as a measure of the value of water. You will see in his report that he specifically found that he was relying upon the specific damages to those farmers."

We do not disagree that damages to the general economy are part of the sovereign and quasi sovereign damages that the State of Kansas suffered. In addition, he identified and found the amount of lost tax revenues that the State suffered, which in our view is also an appropriate damage."

I gather what you're considering loss to the general economy is the farmers had less money, and therefore didn't buy as many luxury goods at the grocery stores. I don't know why you should take into account the latter, the secondary effect of this taking of water, and not take into account the former, the more immediate effect of it."

Minnesota, you set out a fairly bright line between what a State could, in fact, recover in the way of damages and what it could not. In this case, as the record, as the briefs made clear, if you calculate the specific amount of damage that each individual suffered, and if you award prejudgment interest on the rate at that, that that individual would have enjoyed or paid if he had had the money, or obtained if he'd had the money, and you add all that up, and simply say, that is the amount of money that the State of Kansas is entitled to, and then, reading Texas v. New Mexico, you say a State can decide in the public interest, which is the term used in Texas v. New Mexico, they can return that money to the individuals, you have simply permitted, in the context of trying to determine damages, a back door to avoid North Dakota v. Minnesota."

All compacts tie the interest of the State and the interest of the water users together. There was no more an argument within this country whether or not water users could say, my interest is independent of the State's interest, because that was the whole issue in the Hinderlider case. What -- 10 years later, when this compact was entered into, the history was that the States had been before you several times. The last time it involved water users in Kansas suing water users in Colorado, Colorado petitioning for this Court's protection to stop the inter -- the fight between the individual ditch companies and individuals in the two States. I believe Article 7(a) was placed in the compact for the purpose of making certain that all of the people in the Arkansas basin who were going to be bound by it understood on the face of the compact that they would be bound thereby, if for no other reason --"

In other words, if they're bound by it I suppose either they get a benefit or the State may legitimately measure a benefit by reference to their interests. You want to have it one -- you don't want to have it -- you want to have the benefits but not the burden."

What we do not want to do is see damages paid to the State of Kansas that represent individual damages impermissible under the Eleventh Amendment from being brought against the State, summed up, and paid to the State of Kansas. In my view, the way in which this case has unfolded, there is a significant risk, if one assumes that allowing a State to distribute any damages it receives in the public interest, that a State can simply, by clever pleading, fail to announce that it is seeking the damages of the individuals. That was not --"
