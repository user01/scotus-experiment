      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. In 1988, the Government of British Columbia created Powerex to perform a variety of public functions including the marketing of surplus hydropower generated by development of the Province's natural resources pursuant to bilateral agreements with the United States. The Ninth Circuit, however, denied Powerex its rightful status as an organ of a foreign State entitled to remove this case from State court to Federal court. Before addressing the appellate jurisdiction issue, I'd like to highlight briefly the two key errors by the Ninth Circuit in rejecting Powerex's organ status. First, the court articulated the wrong test for determining an entity's status as an organ of a foreign State. The factors the Ninth Circuit found dispositive are inconsistent with the FSIA; and second, the court overlooked crucial evidence of Powerex's public functions that are the best indication of its sovereign status. The British Columbia Government receives and distributes the proceeds from Powerex's operations, supervises Powerex through BC Hydro, subjects Powerex to provincial laws not applicable to private companies and grants Powerex special benefits including exemption from taxation."

But the point that is important here is that even apart from that, when the court had jurisdiction pursuant to the removal provisions, it did not lose subject matter jurisdiction by finding the immunity claims upon the part of the Federal and foreign sovereigns.

But the statute also says that if you're a defendant in a diversity suit, you have a right to trial in federal court.

So at root, the case is about the kind of comity and dignity that the courts of the United States will accord to foreign sovereigns.

This Court has held that the courts of appeals have authority to decide whether a remand order was, in fact, one within the authority of 1447(c). In fact, just this term in Osborn, the district court remanded the case on the basis of 1447(c) for purported lack of subject matter jurisdiction."

Our argument is that as a categorical matter, the basis of remand in this case was not one within the scope of 1447(c). That although the District Court termed the sovereign immunity of the defendant's jurisdictional, it was not jurisdictional in the relevant sense. And this Court held precisely that in the Oliver American trading case. There, a case removed by Mexico was dismissed by the district court on the basis of its immunity and the district court certified that holding as a jurisdictional decision immediately appealable to this Court. Yet this Court looked beyond that label attached by the district court and held that sovereign immunity is not jurisdictional in the relevant sense because it does not limit the authority of the Federal courts qua Federal courts but rather is a general rule that would preclude suit in State court as well. Likewise, under 1447(c) it is not a basis to remand that the defendant is immune. When Congress authorized sovereign defendants to remove cases to Federal court to vindicate their immunity, it did not intend that when the district court upheld that immunity, it would be remanded to State court which would be free to disregard the Federal court's decision."

And I suppose that that needs to be interpreted in pari materia with (c) so that the remands would not be subject to review. It seems to me the same situation here.

It had of course been the rule since this Court's decision in St. Paul Mercury Indemnity, that post-removal events did not defeat the removal court's jurisdiction; and in the statute it was made explicit that 1447(c) authorized remand only when the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction. And when Congress amended the language in 1998 to make clear that non-jurisdictional defects in removal had to be raised immediately or were forfeited, it at the same time -- and added the language, or changed the language in the second sentence that raises problems for our argument; at the same time, it added 1447(e) to provide, as I said, a particular authority to remand based on post-removal events that would have been unnecessary if, as Respondents urge, 1447(c) was intended to confer general authority to remand on the basis of post-removal events."

But what is significant is that had Congress intended by the amendment of 1447(c) to authorize for the first time remand on the basis of post-removal events, 1447(e) would have been unnecessary; and yet, the legislative history, the 1447(e), makes clear that Congress believed that in the absence of that provision, the Court would have been limited to two alternatives.

The first most narrow and simple reason to vacate the decision below for lack of jurisdiction, is to follow this Court's precedents which accept the district court's remand order for what it is and what it says it is, a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 1447(c), unremovable under 1447(d). That is a simple direct route to that result. There is a second approach suggested by a lot of the briefing and some of the argument Your Honors have heard this morning. And I want to lay it out briefly for the Court. And it is that, as the law professor amici have suggested, there is some amount of confusion in the lower courts, I might say with due respect, evasion of 1447(d) in the lower courts, by judge-made exceptions to 1447(d), created by some but not all of the courts of appeal. And the Court could clear out some of this underbrush, mooting many of the issues that Mr. Frederick and the that Solicitor General have raised. Thermtron after Carnegie Mellon, addressing the question Justice Kennedy raised in his concurring opinion, in Things Remembered versus Petrarca, Thermtron does not say what many of the lower courts think it does. Thermtron does not say what my adversaries say it does, because Thermtron has been partially overruled by Carnegie Mellon. The notion that the only proper remand is a 1447(c) remand is ancient history after Carnegie Mellon, and therefore the notion that the only remand covered by 1447(d) is a remand under 1447(c) is also ancient history. Congress has given us a simple and strong message, which is when we're disputing the forum, when the parties in a case are legitimately and in good faith disputing forum, State court versus Federal court, Congress has said take one shot at it, let an Article III judge determine whether the forum is State court or Federal court, and move on to the merits."

The textual difference is that 1447(d) speaks to remands, and so to the extent the district court remanded the matter to State court the remand is untouchable on appeal or by mandamus because of 1447(d). And if the foreign -- if the foreign relations body, lobby, doesn't like that, if the State Department doesn't like, that they can go to the Capitol and get that fixed quite easily. There are half a dozen exceptions to 1447(d) for class actions, for Native Americans, for civil rights cases, and they can get their own exceptions. So to the extent what the trial court did was remand, it is untouchable. That is my textual answer. It's a remand, i.e. Waco, in which the court says the remand is untouchable, the dismissal of the unnecessary or indispensable party is reviewable. So what I would say is, although the remand is untouchable, the denial of immunity -- and that's why I kept saying collateral order; I apologize if that confused you, Justice Alito.

You will have a litigant here next year saying that the difference between a removal and a remand is a unanimous jury verdict or a 9 to 3 jury verdict, and that's really important. Now, I would just briefly like to go back to Justice Ginsburg's question about a jury because I don't think she got the full answer. Let me give it to you, Justice Ginsburg. The jury issue is virtually -- I would say not virtually. The jury issue is out of this case based on my adversary's reply brief. I will tell why you. We did ask for a jury trial in our case and we were upset about the whole notion of this case being removed on a cross-claim we were not involved in -- we never sued Powerex -- losing our right to a jury trial on this important case. Mr. Frederick's reply brief says at footnote 4, page 3 -- or footnote 3, page 4; I apologize -- that our right to jury trial is not threatened here and that under certain lower court decisions, which he is correct they do exist -- I'm not sure they're unanimous -- Our right to jury trial would survive even though he would have a right to a bench trial under his theory. Well, there is no right to a jury trial on the cross claim against Mr. Frederick's client. The cross claim in the California court, which got this whole ball of wax rolling, is a cross claim for equitable indemnification and declaratory relief, equitable claims as to which there is no right to a jury trial. So I think we are all now in agreement on a jury trial. We are arguing someone else's case. Some day a litigant will appear in this Court and present the issue of jury trial - -"

      "speaker": "SIMON",
      "speech": "There is, and that's the issue that I think Congress has clearly and definitively said, the State courts have pretty good judges, pretty good juries, pretty good systems and certiorari procedures to this Court. In Kircher, the Court's opinion says, \"the State courts are perfectly competent to resolve these issues.\" The cost of this case being frozen for 3 or 4 years while we debated these issues -- and these issues are very difficult. I would say, we don't only have a backup position, we have a backup backup position. Because we think, number one, the court should be taken at its word. We think, number two, the court had no subject matter jurisdiction. Removing jurisdiction is not subject matter jurisdiction. If you look at the book, Chapter 89, Section 1441, et cetera, it's titled Removal of Cases From State Courts. You won't find the word \"subject matter jurisdiction\" in there anywhere. A removal petition removes a case from the State court to the Federal court, where if it's a foreign sovereign immunities case, the Federal court decides if it has subject matter jurisdiction. That's what 1330 says in haec verba. It's what this Court's decision in Verlinden versus Central Bank of Nigeria says in haec verba. Verlinden says every court that gets a foreign sovereign immunities case must determine at the outset whether it has subject matter jurisdiction by determining if the foreign sovereign is immune. Which means that Judge Whaley was correct when he decided that by concluding he had an immune party in front of him, he had no jurisdiction. And it was equally correct for Bonneville, when he determined that United States versus Myers says the same thing, so that he had no subject matter jurisdiction. And in addition, there was a derivative jurisdiction doctrine. This notion of \"removal jurisdiction\" quote unquote, it's a term we all use. The Court used it in Kircher. I use it. Other people use it. But if you start getting serious about your words, it's meaningless in this context. We have subject matter jurisdiction and it is conferred in the area of 1330, 1331, 1332. It is not conferred in 1441, 1442, or 1443. It's simply not there. So my backup argument is, he was right on every point. And my backup argument beyond that is again, please, reread Carnegie Mellon. Put it next to Thermtron and look at what the lower courts have done. They have found excuse after excuse to take appeals in cases that have no business being in the courts of appeals. They don't have immunity issues. They don't have foreign sovereign issues. They don't have anything."

And I didn't want to suggest that Justice Scalia's concurring opinion was the opinion of the Court. The opinion of the Court wrestles with what I thought was Justice Alito's question. What do you do if the trial judge says he has no subject matter jurisdiction and he has not simply made a garden variety jurisdictional error but he has missed what the issue is? It's really failure to state a claim. It's really something else. And we of course have the Steele case which says jurisdiction has many meanings and we often get confused about them. And the Court answered the question by saying, only when the trial court is patently wrong, patently wrong not about the jurisdictional question but as to whether it is even a jurisdictional question, only when the court is patently wrong do we second guess the court.

The question of whether a foreign entity, and it's more complicated often in the real world, Justice Breyer, as your question's identified not simply with questions but with the kinds of entities that foreign governments create to advance public purposes. The intent of Congress was not to have those kinds of entities tested in State court to determine whether or not they enjoyed the privileges and procedural protections of the FSIA. And it is not simply a question of whether or not an elderly judge might choose to recognize China or Formosa, but rather the kinds of instrumentalities that were created by those governments to advance public purposes, to serve as separate political entities, and who would be performing the kinds of acts that might lead them into litigation, and - -"
