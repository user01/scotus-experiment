      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As this Court recognized in Peugh v. United States, the United States Sentencing Guidelines remain uniquely central to Federal sentencing even where the district court ultimately chooses to sentence outside the Guidelines. Because of the strong anchoring effect of the Guidelines, as also recognized in Peugh, the natural effect of an erroneously high Guideline range is to skew a defendant's sentence higher than it would have been under the correct range. Yet when the district court has elected to sentence within what it believes to be the correct range, it is typically very difficult to determine what the district court would have done had it been presented with the correct lower range."

In this case, I have a difficulty understanding what difference the ­­ the Criminal History Category would make. But I'll give you another example of overlapping Guidelines: a defendant who's never committed a crime and a defendant who has committed a crime. I would be more inclined to say that an inference from the facts is that a defendant who's never been committed of a crime, that the judge might take that into consideration, even in an overlapping Guideline case, and send it back. Because we don't know how much mercy that judge might have shown.

No. Well, it might have been the window washer, but there is no jury that couldn't find that it was raining. Same thing here. Case after case, this Court has said: We assume, we presume ­­ or they don't even use those words ­­ the Guidelines influence the sentence. That's what they meant by the word \"anchor.\" If you look at the reality, whether they depart or don't ­­ whatever you call it now. There's some special word ­­ you can find evidence after ­­ of course, the Guidelines affect the sentence. Maybe there's an unusual case, and they don't. The reason the judge doesn't say anything is because in Rita we said that if you say nothing, Judge, then the appellate courts are to assume it was reasonable. And therefore, the judge now says nothing. He just applies the Guideline. So we'd have to overcome about five cases in terms of what we said if we are going to rebut the common sense notion that of course using the wrong Guideline had an effect on the sentence. If it's an unusual case, i.e. if it's the window washer, let the government show it was the window washer. But the normal case, pitter­patter means rain, and the normal case is that the judge, when he uses the Guidelines, or even when he uses them as a basis and says I'm departing, that that made a difference."

On the statistics, I believe they're collected in footnote 14 of Petitioner's brief, and there are something like 4,500 procedural sentencing appeals; about 2,400 of those are Sentencing Guidelines appeals, and about 20 percent of those, or about 480, are reversed. We haven't been able to ascertain how many of those are plain­error cases versus harmless­error cases, but it's a substantial number across the judicial districts every year. In terms of the cost, Petitioner's position is that it's less costly than remand for a retrial. We don't dispute that, but we do think it's not costless. The en banc Third Circuit, in a recent procedural sentencing error case, it reached ­­ explained it's not costless at all.

And once we work that out, the answer will be obvious, because I'm not going to disagree with your interpretation of Olano or 52. But I am going to disagree about what you think the effect of failing to apply the right Guideline is in the mine run of cases.

Don't blow up the Rule 52 framework this Court has applied in a number of cases and create, I think, two major problems. One is the anomaly I mentioned with Puckett, earlier. You're going to have courts saying, Well, the Supreme Court in Puckett said one kind of sentencing error doesn't get a presumption to the usual one, but it's a different kind of sentencing error in Molina­Martinez, gets a different kind of treatment.

      "speech": "Right. Well, I think that maybe that's true, Your Honor. I ­­ I guess I would just say that I think these are all factors. And that if we're looking at case­specific determination here, I think the court of appeals could reasonably conclude, kind of balancing those four facts I mentioned, that the defendant had shown a possibility, no doubt, of a low sentence. I think it's a close case, but not a reasonable probability. The last point I wanted to make, Your Honor, was just that we mentioned the courts' of appeals experience in this point. And I think it's useful to look at what happened in the Third Circuit in terms of whether this kind of presumption could be confined to the Sentencing Guidelines. In 2001, the Third Circuit, a decision called Adams, first announced it was going to presume prejudice for the denial of allocution, denial of a defendant's right to allocute at sentencing. A few months later, it adopted ­­ relied on Adams to find a presumption of prejudice for Sentencing Guidelines errors. The next year it applied those precedents to find a presumption of prejudice for constructive amendments to indictments. And in 2005, when Booker came down from this Court, it then applied those precedents to find a presumption of prejudice for Booker error for sentencing under mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. I think it's going to be very difficult to confine this. Mr. Crooks makes the point in his reply brief that the courts of appeals have been relatively restrained in finding errors. One can debate that, but I think the point is that this Court endorses the presumption of prejudice for the first time. I think it's highly unlikely it's going to stay just in the Guidelines context, just because of the anchoring effect that the Court recognized in Peugh. And if there are no questions, we'd ask that the judgment be affirmed."

      "speech": "With respect to Justice Kennedy's question about the burden on the district courts of resentencings, we would point out that several lower courts in opinions we cited in the brief have pointed out that a resentencing is not all that burdensome, especially in light of the benefits of assuring that defendants are not serving more prison time than the district court wanted them to do. I did also want to address the government's point about ­­ the government touched on the issue of overlapping ranges versus ranges that don't overlap. And we just wanted to point out that the effect of the Guidelines is the same, regardless of whether the correct and incorrect ranges overlap or not. It's simply that the degree of the error, the amount of excess imprisonment that is produced, will be different. It will be lower in the case of an overlapping range. But as this Court said in Glover v. United States, any extra amount of imprisonment affects substantial rights. Finally, I just wanted to say that the courts of appeals have overwhelmingly recognized, whether you call it a presumption or not, that it is warranted to find that a change in the Guideline range affected a defendant's substantial rights because of the extreme likelihood that a Guideline­range error will skew the sentence. And the lower courts have found, in their experience, that it's necessary to make that inference because of the great difficulty in the typical case of showing a case­specific effect of the type that the government is arguing for here. And these two factors mean that this inference or presumption, whatever it's termed, is necessary to avoid, in many cases, the injustice of excess imprisonment. And it will not blow up Rule 52(b), as the government warns. It's a modest tweak to one prong of the rule that will help the rule serve its basic purpose of fairness. And for these reasons, we ask that the Court reverse the judgment below and remand for further proceeding."
