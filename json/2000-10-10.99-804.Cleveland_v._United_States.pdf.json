Now, let me ask you this. Here, I take it the State did more than just issue a license. It issued a license with an ongoing substantial revenue component for the State. It wasn't just a one-time payment of a license fee and then you have this forever. It contemplates, does it not, the payment of substantial amounts of money to the State thereafter, and does that distinguish it, or make it somehow more of a property interest than otherwise might be the case?"

State licensing schemes, of course, are designed, drafted, implemented by State and local officials. Those are the officials that are in the best position to interpret them, to decide whether they've been violated in a particular case. This case, in fact, arose during the early years of the Louisiana video poker scheme, and State and local officials can decide the appropriate sanction, if there is misconduct. Now, the Government argues that this license is special because the State has a substantial economic stake in the -- in video poker operations. We would respond, since when has the existence of a property right depended on something as amorphous as whether there's a substantial economic stake, or the reach of a criminal statute? That's not an appropriate test for defining criminal liability. There would be a whole host of questions that would be raised under the Government's theory. How much is substantial? Is it a dollar amount that counts? Should it be the percentage? Does it matter what other revenues the licensing authority has, so that it might have a different situation if the license was issued by a poor rural county as opposed to a wealthy, suburban county."

So that was then reaffirmed -- the basic holding was reaffirmed in Carpenter, and I think it was a premise of Neder, the Neder decision in 1999 as well, as we've explained in our brief, and we've also covered the background of the 1909 amendment in our brief, the commission report, which there's really no suggestion that Congress was attempting to create a new basis of liability."

Even today, just acquiring someone's services is not enough. You have to have a scheme to deprive another of honest services, but Congress in 1988 did not otherwise change the McNally ruling, even though it was fully aware of it."

The State's expectation of receiving revenue simply does not mean that when the State issues a license it parts with property. To go back to the College Savings Bank case, I think that makes it clear that even business in the sense of -- the Court said business in the sense of the activity of doing business and making a profit is not property, so the State's mere expectation of obtaining revenue after a license is issued."

      "speaker": "MOGIN",

We think the Government's theory of liability in this case is contrary to traditional law, is not supported by any established concept of property, and of course the Government is doing this in a criminal case. Civil RICO plaintiffs, of course, could take advantage of the theory if it were endorsed by the Court, and the very novelty of the theory makes an inadequate basis for injecting Federal law into the area of State laws, local licensing, so for that reason we submit the petitioner's conviction should be reversed.

A video poker license represents the State's right to a stream of payments from an enormously lucrative business, a business that the State has absolute power to conduct itself. Instead of conducting the business itself, the State franchises that opportunity to private individuals while asserting control over every aspect of the business and retaining a right to a large share of the revenues.

This case, I suggest the best way to look at it is to start from the premise that the State is to be treated as any property owner under the mail fraud statute. It is to be no less and no more protected than a private individual similarly situated, and to understand how the State loses property, you have to compare the State to a similarly situated private individual. Now, the two analogies that most readily show how the State loses an intangible property right are a private franchise business, which has the right to exercise franchises and grant franchises to private parties, and has a contract right not to be defrauded in choosing the franchisees that it chooses."

In other words, the only basis upon which I can see any fraud here, if we start with the assumptions that I made, that there's no claim that they were minimizing business or skimping on the percentage or whatnot, the only basis to say that there has been -- that the State has been defrauded of something is to say that the property right must be some kind of metaphysical entity that somehow goes beyond the right to receive the fees, and the right to receive the percentage, and I don't know why we should take that step and recognize some kind of a metaphysical property right in addition to these quite easily defined property interests."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DREEBEN",
      "speech": "Well, it's not a metaphysical property right. It is an intangible property right, and under this Court's decision in Carpenter v. United States, intangible property rights are just as protected as tangible ones. Now, the way that an intangible property right is identified is by looking at the legal scheme that creates those rights, and Louisiana created a legal scheme under which it has the exclusive right to determine who may engage in the video poker business."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Okay, but as I understand it, then, the -- what I was sort of disparaging as the metaphysical right is basically the State's regulatory interest.

It could have said, you, the State, shall select someone who will choose all these State franchise holders who will do the video poker business and it could have sold that interest, could have said, a private party can take over the role of deciding who gets a license and collect all the money and give some of the money back to the State, but it did not do that.

      "speaker": "DREEBEN",
      "speech": "He did, but a jury that found guilt on those instructions necessarily found that the object of the scheme was to make false statements to the State to obtain the license and, indeed, the charged mailings were the mailings of the license to the defendants."

    {
      "speaker": "DREEBEN",
      "speech": "In theory. In theory, Justice Ginsburg. I would also say that under the property prong of mail fraud individual prosecutors have discretion on what level of case they are going to bring, and the competing obligations and case loads of Federal prosecutors tend to send those cases to the wayside, but there are small cases brought even where the State is defrauded of a relatively small amount of property. And one of the reasons why that is is because frauds against the State often involve State actors in collusion with the private parties, and the Federal Government there serves a very valuable role in coming in and being able to prosecute when the States themselves seem to be less able to do so, and this case itself had a corruption component in it involving charges against State Senators, which the jury ended up rejecting, but there was a reason why the Federal Government was involved in this case in the beginning."

      "speaker": "MOGIN",
      "speech": "The key distinction is that there this Court was able to find prior law that recognized confidential business information as property. The Ruckelshaus case in this Court, a case from -- the International News case I believe it is, a treatise was cited in the opinion. There was substantial prior law indicating that confidential business information was protected as property under the civil law, so the Court was not required to announce a new theory of property in that case."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "May I ask this, Mr. Mogin. The right to exclude is mentioned over and over again in property cases as one of the bundles of rights that's a property right, and so forth. I know the Government doesn't press this to the extreme it would go, but why isn't -- why couldn't one view the video poker industry as an industry that is controlled by the State and they have the right to exclude newcomers, oldcomers, and that's just an old- fashioned property right?"

      "speaker": "MOGIN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOGIN",
      "speech": "Yes, but I don't think that from that one could conclude that every right to exclude is a property right, because here you have the breadth of it, that the licensing and approvals and permits and certifications and registrations that the Government issues is truly extraordinary. It's never been thought that those are property rights that the Government is exercising, and property law has been formed -- is based a lot on history and tradition, and not merely on characteristics. There's no one characteristic, such as the right to exclude, that can be focused on and is the be-all and end-all of whether there's a property right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, of course, in this case or in any regulatory case, as distinct from the case of private ownership or private property, there are two capacities, I suppose, on the part of the supposed property owner, and one is a regulatory capacity and one is arguably a proprietary one, and I suppose -- I mean, wouldn't it be your argument that the right to exclude would have to be classified on the regulatory side rather than the property side? So in other words, the right to exclude is here, but the reason it isn't property in the case of the Government is that the Government holds it in a different capacity as regulator, which is a capacity that the private property owner doesn't have."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOGIN",
      "speech": "I think that's exactly right, and that's why the Government prohibits all types of things, excludes people from all types of activities. The mere fact that the Government is excluding something does not mean it's exercising a property right. One has to look at the nature of the decision and see whether the Government is acting in a regulatory or proprietary capacity. As we cite in our briefs, the courts have always viewed licensing decisions and revocation decisions as regulatory rather than proprietary."
