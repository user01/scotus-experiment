For decades, in fact, it has been a bedrock rule under Teague and Griffith that State prisoners are entitled to the benefit of decisions from this Court that come down before finality, and that rule has delivered fairness and clarity to an area that that this Court has acknowledged previously lacked it. There's no compelling reason to chart a new course now. There's no doubt that AEDPA changed Federal habeas law in many important ways, but it did not change habeas law with respect to retroactivity, for under this Court's Teague jurisprudence, States already had comity, as opposed to other areas.

First, with -- with the GVR request, if he'd had counsel that would have advised him to seek cert, he may well have done it, and this Court may well have GVR'ed, but realize that this Court isn't bound to do that. This Court has discretionary jurisdiction, and I don't think this Court wants to take on the responsibility of deciding every single case that falls into a twilight zone situation. You're going to have cases, like this one very well would have in light of what the Pennsylvania -- the State filed in its own supreme court, wrapped up in procedural arguments, harmless error allegations, perhaps alternative State grounds. And this Court often has decided that habeas is the better place to work that out, not GVR. Now, it may well have GVR'ed, but I don't think the Court wants to take on that responsibility."

Then the writing judge or other people look through it and see if in fact it really does affect it, and if it does, we GVR.

After Melendez-Diaz, there was a case called Geyer that came out of the California courts, that this Court did -- held for Melendez-Diaz but did not GVR, in part because I think the State was making harmless error allegations there.

And this Court has never held either that you have to seek cert in this Court in order to exhaust State remedies, nor to take a -- to take a claim back to State collateral review that you've already taken up through the State direct review system. So if we had an exhaustion case in the future, maybe somebody would make that argument. But that's not what's before you today. What's before you today is the hypothetical that -- that Mr. Greene actually did seek cert and for some reason this didn't GVR, or he did seek review in the Pennsylvania courts and they refused to hear it. And under the State's position, even then you would bar him from getting the reliance on Gray, because Gray came down after the Pennsylvania Supreme - - I'm sorry -- the Pennsylvania Superior Court decision."

You're absolutely right that the State, faced with really no alternative but to try to argue waiver, did argue waiver in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which did dismiss the case. But, of course, the order doesn't say why it dismissed the case. And we litigated that very issue in the lower courts, and the Third Circuit squarely held that Mr. Greene had, in fact, preserved this claim in the Pennsylvania courts, and on top of that, the Pennsylvania Superior Court had reached it and resolved -- understood him to be raising a Gray-type argument and resolved it by citing a Pennsylvania case that had previously held that just putting an X in place of -- in place of the defendant's name was good enough to satisfy Bruton."

It said that -- I think I'm going to get this quote right -- that the structure of the statute compelled the conclusion that for facts you leave the window. Well, the structure of this statute as to law compels the opposite conclusion."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "Because the statute says adjudication resulted in a decision. And the decision, the only decision, is the Pennsylvania Superior Court, because there was a non-decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Resulted -- that is -- in a decision that was. It didn't say \"is.\" I mean, you would have a much stronger argument if it had read \"resulted in a decision that is contrary.\" But when it says \"was,\" that sounds like at the time of the adjudication."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "speech": "Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I can get this point across. I'm not saying \"is,\" because then there would be no -- there would be no retroactivity cutoff whatsoever. I agree that the statute says \"was,\" but it's was as of when? We say \"was\" as of the time of finality. The State wants to read into the statute \"was\" as of the time the decision was made. And so, that's the question you have. And if you look to the structure of the statute, you'll see lots of clues that Congress didn't intend to change the previous clear retroactivity cutoff at Teague. And, of course, that's the barrier the State has to overcome here, a clear and specific change in law. If you look at the limitations provision, it references finality. If you look at various provisions of the statute that reference retroactivity law, they reference new rules in retroactivity. And this Court has held in Tyler v. Cain that Teague is what Congress had in mind when it did that. So --"

Horn says that Teague and AEDPA are two different analyses that each case must undergo, that you start with, okay, what does Teague say, but you then look at what AEDPA says, and that each can serve as an independent bar. So, if that's the case, how do you get around AEDPA's requirement of a past-looking statute being one that involves the adjudication and whether at its time it was contrary to Supreme Court precedent?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "speech": "Justice Sotomayor, we think Horn is another structural component of the statute that shows why we win. And let me explain why. Again, we don't disagree it's a backward-looking statute, but backward-looking to finality. Now, what Horn held -- Horn rejected a form of the very same argument that the State is making today, which is 2254(d) changes retroactivity law to establish the cutoff at the time of the State court decision, not as of finality. This Court rejected that argument and said, no, Teague and 2254(d) are distinct. And we think the best way to understand them as distinct is to understand that 2254(d) deals with the standard of review, and Teague still continues to control finality. Now, in light of Horn -- I'm sorry -- retroactivity. Now, in light of Horn on the books, if the State were right that what 2254(d) is actually trying to do is also do retroactivity work and prevent the State courts from, as it put in its brief, being \"blind-sided,\" then Teague would serve -- no longer serve any purpose, and Horn would have had to come out the other way, because once you say 2254(d) is actually concerned with setting a cutoff at the time of the last State court decision for retroactivity purposes, you don't need Teague anymore. So, Horn would have had to come out the other way if the State is right. Now, let me go back to one other structural feature of the statute that -- that shows that Congress had in mind that Teague would continue, and that's the one I referenced earlier with respect to retroactivity. Keep in mind the State's argument would bar not just somebody like Greene from relying on a new case like Gray, but it would also -- the implication would be it would bar him from relying on a new case like Roper v. Simmons, Graham v. Florida, or other cases that alter -- that say the Constitution can no longer cover or punish substantive conduct in a certain way.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "speech": "It's not different -- under the State's view of AEDPA, Justice Kennedy. Remember, the State's view of AEDPA is that if a decision comes down after the latest State court's decision on the merits, then the defendant cannot seek relief based on it. And on page 38 of the red brief, in footnote 12, they try to deal with this problem, but not in a satisfactory way. And it's not an abstract problem. If I give this Court a few citations -- if you'll permit me to give you three citations of cases working through the lower courts right now that raise Roper, Graham, and Atkins claims that the lower courts -- the only way they have reached them is by saying that Teague still has a role to play with respect to 2254(d). And the three citations, if I can give them very quickly, are Arroyo, 362 F. Supp. 2d 869; Holladay, 331 F.3d 1169; and Simms 2011 Westlaw 1161696. Again, that's another structural feature of the statute that the State simply can't get around with its -- with its view. Now, some of the lower courts haven't quite focused on this, and, in fact, it's because for many, many years after AEDPA was passed, States didn't even make the argument that you have before you today. All the way through Smith v. Spisak, which came to this court just a couple of years ago, the State of Ohio, for example, was not even making this argument, which is quite odd if you step back for a moment and realize that the State's position today is that the plain text of AEDPA is so clear there's no possible way you could read it in any other direction. So --"

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "Mr. Fisher, what about the -- well, the purpose of AEDPA was to require the Federal courts to respect the State courts' decision. And there's only been one decision in this picture, and that decision was the Pennsylvania Superior Court. And we are not giving much respect to that decision, which did not have the benefit of Gray, if we're going to say, no, we have to look at that decision as though Gray were already on the books."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "speech": "So, Justice Ginsburg, let me answer that question by starting, if I may, before AEDPA, because before AEDPA, under Caspari and Teague, there's no doubt whatsoever that that's what a Federal habeas corpus court would have done, is say the cutoff is finality. Because, remember, finality doesn't exist in a vacuum. It exists against the Griffith rule. And so, what Federal courts had always asked is, did the defendant not get credit for a case that he's entitled to under Griffith? And so, the question is: Did AEDPA change that rule? And, Justice Ginsburg, you asked about the purpose or spirit of AEDPA. We think what the spirit of AEDPA is, is to give States deference and to give them comity where they otherwise didn't have it at the time. And so, it changed the standard of review, it changed the statute of limitations, but it didn't need to change Teague. It didn't need to change retroactivity because, as this Court had explained in Teague itself, in Justice Kennedy's long opinion in Wright v. West concurring, the very purpose of Teague was to give States the comity that -- of not foisting new law upon them. And so, you do end up, of course, in this situation, which is -- I think we called it earlier the twilight zone or perfect storm situation. But this is something that this Court saw coming under Teague and long ago, even though even under those cases this Court said the purpose of retroactivity law is not to hold the States responsible for something new. And so, the question is why did we have this twilight zone under Teague and why should it continue today? And the answer again is because Teague doesn't exist in a vacuum; it works in tandem with Griffith. Remember, what Griffith said is that it violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication for a defendant to not get the credit for a decision that this Court announces before his State conviction becomes final. And so, Teague is necessary as the other side of the coin to make Griffith work. And to undo all of that and to go back to an unsettled state of retroactivity law, whether it's -- whether it's Linkletter or something else, is going to really cause problems. Let me give you one other image that the States' situation --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "speech": "Here's why, Justice Ginsburg: Take the typical case, and maybe you'll put in your mind, for example, the Martinez oral argument you had last week. A typical case works its way through the State courts. There's going to be an appeal as of right in the State intermediate court, where all of the claims the defendant brings can be addressed. Then what might happen quite often is the State Supreme Court is going to hear, like this Court does, maybe one or two of those claims and address them on the merits. Then he's going to go into State collateral review and bring an IAC claim, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and maybe whatever other claim he couldn't have brought earlier. Under the State's rule, you have three different retroactivity cutoffs for different claims that are brought and adjudicated at the different part of that regime. You have a retroactivity cutoff at the intermediate court for certain claims, a retroactivity cutoff at the Pennsylvania -- I'm sorry -- the State Supreme Court for the -- for certain other claims, and a retroactivity cutoff at finality for certain other claims.

So, it's obviously always going to be somewhat unfair and somewhat arbitrary that it applies to some and not to others. So, what is the problem here? What -- the reading of the statute on the other side says: I'll tell you who it applies to or who it doesn't apply to. It doesn't apply to people where the last State court decision was made before the Supreme Court made its decision. That's it.

And many State supreme courts might take the view that, well, hey, if the State supreme court -- if the U.S. Supreme Court has just decided this issue and we don't have any new law to make here, this isn't worth our time.

And, again, you have the problem, if you're going to rely on somebody to bring the case up to this Court and say that's the only way that he can get benefit of the new decision, I think this Court -- I know it's counterintuitive, but you're going to have to take a hard look, not just at fairness and equity, but at this Court's right to counsel jurisprudence and ask yourself whether somebody under the Halbert test who has a right to have a decision on the merits of that claim and that's the only time it can be litigated, therefore has to have the right to counsel because he couldn't otherwise navigate the process."

As to those relatively few States that hypothetically might not, the defendant goes to Federal court, and because this is a Teague exception -- and they are exceptions because they are exceptional -- he has a number of existing habeas doctrines to rely on: cause and prejudice, actual innocence, inadequate State grounds. And he is quite likely in the Teague exception case to be able to get through the default of not having had an adjudication in State court, and he'll have not only review in Federal court, but he'll have de novo review in Federal court, because there was no ruling on the merits. So, not only will he have Federal court review, but it won't be deferential review in that circumstance. If the State did allow the review of the Teague exception, then he will have deferential review. And, in fact, this question has been debate by the Court before. It came up at oral argument in Whorton v. Bockting. One of the amicus briefs in that case actually addressed the question empirically, looked at one of the most recent candidates for first Teague exception status, which was the mental retardation rule of Atkins v. Virginia and, in an appendix to the brief, found that no State had barred review of the Atkins claim even though it was not even officially declared yet to be a Teague exception. We think that's what would happen with Teague exceptions. Of course, this case doesn't concern a Teague exception. And so, really the only question here is whether a ruling in favor of the State would inadvertently determine that question for future purposes. I think our argument is adequate at least to show that the question remains live and it can be safely left for another day."

And I think that would be an appropriate application of the doctrine. I think, as Justice Kagan stated earlier or suggested by her question, Pinholster really does resolve this claim, even in addition to the language of the case. Petitioner argues that facts and law are different. And they might be to some extent, but actually law is the easier question for the issue that's presented here. And Pinholster did not simply tell us that new facts couldn't be considered, but the premise of the decision was that since new law couldn't be decided, neither could new facts.

      "speech": "Well, I'm talking more generally about the idea that Pinholster automatically applies to this situation. It applies to facts; therefore, it applies to law. The distinction in that context between law and facts, the general context, strikes me as one that supports his argument that they're at least not tied at the hip and have to be treated the same way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EISENBERG",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I think that Pinholster was somewhat more specific than that. It stated that -- the statute was backwards-looking in its entirety, certainly with no exceptions for law. After all, (d)(1) is about law. It doesn't mention the word \"facts\" or \"evidence\"; it mentions only the word \"law.\" And the Court had to move from that to its decision about facts. Number two, in Pinholster, the Court specifically stated that it was relying on prior precedents. And it used the word \"precedent\" to describe the prior decisions for the proposition that our cases \"emphasize that review under 2254(d)(1) focuses on what a state court knew and did.\" State court decisions are measured against this Court's precedent as of the time the State court renders its decision. That was the jumping-off point, so to speak, for the Court's extension of the principle in effect that we're debating today to the area of new facts. And I don't think there's any way to reconcile that holding with the Petitioner's argument or with the language of the statute. Now, the Petitioner argues that this is necessary in order to give the defendant his rights under Griffith v. Kentucky. But, as I think the Chief Justice's questions illustrate, he had those rights. He was entitled to seek review on direct appeal as long as it lasted of whatever new rules came out before the point of finality. He was entitled to seek discretionary review in the State supreme court. He was entitled to seek discretionary review in this Court. Had he done so, I think --"

But if the State court, as it did here, decides not to grant review, then, of course, the defendant is free to come to this Court.

In those cases, the defendant, for purposes of 2254, wouldn't be barred because there is no merits determination. But Teague might still bar him if the new rule on which he seeks review is one that came down after the point of finality. Teague is not a guarantee of rights to the defendant. Griffith was the guarantee of rights to the defendant, and the defendant received his Griffith rights. Teague is a bar to review. AEDPA is a bar to review.

      "speech": "Your Honor, I'm not sure I agree with that factually. In the Spisak case, for example, I don't know that it was necessary for the State to make that argument. The State thought it had a strong argument on the merits. That's exactly what happened in Horn v. Banks, as well, Your Honor, which is a case that actually supports our position. In that case, the State court applied on collateral review the rule of Mills v. Maryland. Now, this Court later held in that same case that Mills was a new rule that would be Teague-barred, but the State didn't know that at that time, and the State had a well-established body of law applying Mills and thought -- the State thought it could easily dispose of the claim on the merits of the Mills issue. So, it did so. The case came to Federal habeas corpus review. It wouldn't have been barred, review on the merits would not have been barred by 2254 because the State collateral review court applied Mills and made a merits determination. So, the defendant would have been entitled to merits review under the deferential standard. The problem is Mills was a new rule, and so the independent bar of Teague comes into play. The Third Circuit refused to apply that independent bar; that's why this Court reversed in Horn v. Banks. And so, it neatly illustrates another example of a situation where Teague actually does survive despite 2254. There are other doctrines that -- based on this Court's case law, that have been overshadowed to an even greater extent than Teague was. Abuse of the writ, the Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes concerning evidentiary hearings. Certainly, Congress had the right to do that, and, in fact, these issues were addressed to some degree even in the Court's seminal deference case in Williams v. Taylor. In Williams v. Taylor for example, it was Justice Stevens's position in dissent, arguing in dissent, that the statute really only embodied Teague. When the statute said clearly established, all that Congress meant to do was to codify Teague. He said it was perfectly clear that that was the case. And he argued, particularly in footnote 12 of his dissenting portion of his opinion in Williams v. Taylor, just as Petitioner argues today, that the fact that Congress in other portions of AEDPA, particularly in section 2244, used language talking about finality of judgment and talking about retroactivity -- the fact that Congress did that in 2244 meant that it was thinking about Teague and that it really meant to extend the Teague rule throughout the entire statute, that Teague really flavored the entire statute. The Court necessarily rejected that argument. And, in fact, in reference to another prior case of this Court, Wright v. West, that had been argued by Justice Stevens in his dissent, Justice O'Connor speaking for the Court said Congress need not mention a prior decision of this Court by name in a statute's text in order to adopt a rule. Now, I think that's clearly what Congress did, and I think that the Court clearly recognized in Williams v. Taylor that the deference rule, 2254, constituted a new rule which sat side by side with Teague and operated in different ways, even if in some cases, many cases that would mean you never had to get to the Teague bar, because the 2254 bar came into play first or more easily. If there are no further questions, I'll rely on my brief. Thank you."

      "speech": "Thank you. Let me make three points, starting with the most important, which is the Teague exceptions we've been talking about. Now, the State, in its brief in footnote 12 and today, says actual innocence, cause and prejudice, or something, would let you get around the problem that I've raised. But that doesn't work, because all those doctrines do is allow you to bring the case forward. They just allow you to get out from under a situation where you haven't preserved a claim previously. But this case is all about a situation where the defendant does everything he is supposed to do, everything he can do, but it just so happens that this Court's decision has come down after the last State court decision on the merits, and the State on collateral review has refused -- if it's been given a chance -- to remedy that. The three cases I cited to you -- at least one of them involves a situation where the defendant did go back to the State -- and I believe it's the Graham case -- and said apply this to me. The State of Virginia said, no, you're barred from State collateral review. So, all those doctrines do is allow the defendant to get in the door. Once he's in the door, he still has to satisfy 2254(d)(1), which says that no claim shall be granted -- no -- habeas relief shall not be granted on any claim unless the language we've been talking about today. So, the only way out of the problem that we,ve phrased is to say that Teague decides what is clearly established law, not the language of the statute itself, under the State's reading of the statute. The second thing is, as to this Court's GVR practice, I don't think there is much doubt, in all fairness --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "speech": "Well, not if the State says that you're barred in its own -- remember, that will get you out from the problem of being able to get in the door, because what would happen in that situation is the State would say this is waived because he didn't make it earlier. And then you'd go to the Teague -- you'd go to the exceptions in AEDPA for new claims and whether actual innocence applies, et cetera. All those are merely gateways to the question of whether the defendant gets relief, which is controlled by 2254(d)."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "speech": "I think it -- I think it would satisfy one of the Teague exceptions. That's what the lower courts have all held. If it wouldn't, certainly the hypothetical that Justice Breyer gave about the First Amendment would satisfy the Teague exception, and you have the exactly the same problem."

      "speech": "And it's such an important opinion, you know, for all the reasons in Teague, that what they did is to time-bar and they wouldn't hear it. Okay, so you hear it. And the claim is that they made a mistake. That State court that wouldn't hear it made a mistake in not hearing it and deciding it for me. Okay? So, now we have a State court thing to review."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "speech": "No, but that wouldn't be a decision on the merits, Justice Breyer. The decision on the merits would have been earlier in the proceedings, when you argued I can't be executed because I was 17 when I committed the crime, and a State would have rejected that before Roper, and then you end up, after Roper, a State saying we won't hear this on collateral review because we've already heard it once. And then we have the situation we have today, and the only way out of that situation is to understand that Teague continues to control what is clearly established law. And it's not just a problem. Again, it goes back to the structure of the whole statute, because the question this Court is supposed to be asking itself is, is there clear and specific language in the new statute to think that Congress wanted to dispense with Teague? And this is very clear indication that, no, that's not what Congress had in mind. That's not what Congress had in mind. And so, this is a case not just about habeas law but also this Court's relationship with Congress, about whether Congress clearly had the kind of intent that's necessary."
