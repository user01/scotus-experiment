      "speaker": "KILBERG",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Washington State's divorce revocation law strikes at the very heart of ERISA's comprehensive regulatory scheme for employee benefit plans. It does so by purporting to revoke ERISA plan beneficiary designations upon divorce. We submit that the Washington statute is preempted by ERISA on two independent grounds. First, because it relates to an ERISA plan within the meaning of ERISA's express preemption provision, section 514(a) and second, because it conflicts with ERISA's other provisions. Turning first to section 514, this Court has made clear that a State law relates to an employee benefit plan if it mandates employee benefit structures or their administration or binds plan administrators to particular choices. Washington's divorce revocation statute has precisely that forbidden effect. As applied by the courts below, the statute invalidates the beneficiary determination and benefit payment scheme provided for by the terms of the ERISA plans here and instead mandates payment according to a different State-imposed scheme. Moreover, the determination of beneficiary status, and the payment of plan benefits, lie at the very heart of ERISA's concerns. Indeed, the determination whether particular alleged beneficiaries are entitled to obtain plan benefits is so crucial to the entire Federal scheme created by ERISA that such benefits claims are deemed to arise under Federal law under this Court's decision in Metropolitan Life v. Taylor even if they purport to raise only State law claims."

It is in a handful of States that you have divorce revocation rules, and they vary among themselves, so there is that burden that plaintiffs would have to deal with.

It also conflicts with ERISA's definition of beneficiary as the person designated by the participant or under the terms of the plan. If one looks to the participant's designation and the terms of the plan, petitioner here is the proper beneficiary, not respondent. With respect to the pension plan, the Washington statute also conflicts with ERISA's antialienation provision, which prohibits the assignment or alienation of plan benefits.

Washington, like a number of States, as a number of the questions have reflected, recognizes the unsurprising proposition and, Justice Scalia, it is recognized by an increasing number of States very rapidly, that when two people divorce they try to give each other less money, not more. Particularly relevant here, the designation of one spouse as a death beneficiary, whether in a will, and there are will statutes in 49 out of the 50 States, or in some other asset, is premised on the idea that at the time of death the couple will still be married. Applied to this case, and I think it very important that we talk about the facts of this case, the statute rests on the idea that when petitioner sought and received a divorce from David Egelhoff, and after they entered a very detailed divorce decree, to the level of, he got the tan area rug and she got the Exercycle, that he did not walk out of the courthouse thinking, oh, and I want her to get the pension and the life insurance, too."

It says so, and there's no doubt that that was the parties' intent. And second, there is a declaration uncontradicted in the record that she basically went around telling people that David would roll over in his grave at the notion that she was going to get this money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
      "speech": "With respect, in terms of just what the parties understood would happen to the money, and in particular, Justice Scalia, what Donna's expectation was, he got the pension benefits. The death benefit is the entirety of the pension benefit, and she could not have an expectation that she would ever get the money, because she knows that he could change it the next day. Moreover, this is a community property State. They had to divide up the marital property, which included the value of the pension at the time of divorce, and she had to get equivalent assets at the time of divorce. This is nothing more than a double recovery in the purest sense."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, maybe it is, but I guess the point that I don't seem to grasp is why it makes a dime's worth of difference. We've got a statute. If the statute means what they say it does, you lose. If it doesn't, maybe you win, but the particular expectations of the parties in a particular divorce, even if there's an evidentiary basis for it, seems to me irrelevant."

The first is that I'm trying to explain to you the rationale and why it is so rational that Washington did what it did, and second, it goes to the question now speaking to the statute, what the standard is for finding a conflict and finding preemption, and that is that in this area, from cases like Hisquidero on, there must be a clear and manifest conflict. And now let me turn directly to the notion of whether or not there is a conflict."

Chief Justice Rehnquist -- so if I could continue for the moment to focus on the practicalities of what happens to an ERISA plan, turn to the specific alleged conflicts with the statute in just a moment. Chief Justice Rehnquist, you asked how this worked in operation, and I'd like to refer to you -- refer you to the respondent's lodging for a moment.

The two documents I'm going to take you now are in the record of the case. Tab 3 is the designation form, and it says that David designated Donna R. Egelhoff, wife. The reason I point to it is that when the administrator receives a claim for death benefits it's common ground that he or she pulls out the designation form. Before paying the benefits, he or she must get the death certificate. We have to be sure that the person is dead. That's common sense. On the death certificate it explains that David Egelhoff died, and on line 14 -- or, excuse me, in cell 14, three lines down, it explains that he was divorced, and that is the sum total of the administrative burden that is put on ERISA plan administrators.

Justice Scalia, you pointed out that it may well be that there would be preemption even if there was no additional burden. This is -- Congress said, this is how it's going to work. Washington can't say anything different. Justice Souter, earlier you inquired similarly whether or not there might not be conflict preemption, because the statute mandates that you have to pay the benefits to the named beneficiary.

Washington law at the time of divorce does not say, if you divorce you are no longer a beneficiary, the money instead goes to the children. It instead says that the designation is ineffective and it is up to the terms of the plan to determine who gets the money, and that's exactly what the children were here.

Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Boggs explained that there are a class of people that ERISA is intended to protect, participants and beneficiaries. Our position is, is that before the death of David, and before the administrator looked at the alternate beneficiary provisions, the children were protected by ERISA. They were in the class of people who could bring an action and say, look, you're misadministering plan assets, just as much as Donna could. They are within the class of people that ERISA intended to protect, and so if you are going to call them not beneficiaries, they are excluded from the rest of the statute entirely and they receive none of the protections.

ERISA plans pay benefits out under the spousal annuity. ERISA plans pay ERISA benefits out under the QDRO provisions. It is many times not the case that they pay it out directly to the person whose name is on it. In fact, the plan here reserves the right to determine that the individual named is incompetent, and not to pay them then, either."

There's the hypothetical, for example, that someone's from Oregon, someone from Washington, someone from Texas. The plan operates in a multi-State arena. There are two important points. The first is that there is the safe harbor both under the text of ERISA and under this plan -- under this statute, that says, if you have any doubt, don't pay. You don't have to go to court. Just don't do it. Just send a letter to the people who want the money and say to them, come back to us when you have figured it out or a court has told you what to do.

Congress provided that there are certain people, participants and their beneficiaries, when it's a spousal annuity, who have an expectation that they are going to live off pension benefits, and it specified when an alienation would occur. This is not a situation where the money is taken away from the participant or anyone else who has a mandated right to it and give -- and let me take you to the definition. The alienation definition is not reprinted in the appendix to any brief -- I apologize -- but I will simply read it to you. Well, the statute is, and that is at the appendix to petitioner's brief at page 4, and it simply says, not very helpfully, each pension plan shall provide the benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated. Justice Kennedy's opinion in Boggs looks to the IRS's definition and I will read it to you. This for the record is at 26 C.F.R. section 1.401A-(13)(c)(i) -- (ii). The terms, assignment and alienation, include any direct or indirect arrangement, whether revocable or irrevocable whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary a right or interest enforceable against a plan in or to any or all of the plan benefit payment."

      "speech": "Remember, the second wife, community property law, took it. She -- the community property law is what gave it to her. So what I'm focusing on, though, is that this does not take it from somebody and give it to somebody else. Now, there was the question put before, well, should this have been a QDRO, and there is the negative inference suggested by petitioner that Congress occupied this field, that really these sorts of things are supposed to be done by QDRO's, and I will explain to you why that's not so. Washington law doesn't intend to say that the kids will get the money. That's the whole point, that the plan will decide who gets the money. Washington law wants David, after the divorce, to decide who will get it. Say there's a third wife. David -- say he's a serial marrier. If there's a third wife, David wants to be able to name her. If there's a QDRO, he can't. If the divorce decree said, the money goes to the kids, he's out of luck. That's a registered decree under Washington State law. All Washington is trying to do here is say, look, when you divorce, the intent is that the spouse, your ex-spouse isn't going to get the money. Go fix the problem some other way, and it says to the plans, or any other nonprobate asset, you don't want to comply, say you're not going to comply. You have any doubts, don't comply. And it says to the participant himself, if you don't want this to be the rule, just say so, either in the divorce decree or even in your designation. There really is nothing going on here that Congress didn't want to happen. There's nobody -- unlike Boggs, where we had the actual spouse who was going to get the spousal annuity, or we had the pension benefits after death in the hands at least of the estate of the pensioner, none of that applies here. We're in a situation where Congress left it up to anybody to name a designee, and unless there's some real practical problem for the ERISA plan, unless something's -- it's just not workable, I could understand a reason to preempt it. But when you're going to take away simultaneous death, slayer statutes -- in the footnote in which they address the issue in their reply brief, petitioner says, Justice Scalia, that it preempts state law definitions of what it is to die, who's a spouse, what's a child, common law issues frequently regulated by the States. I should make one final point, and that is that there is at the very least one alternative narrow holding that I don't understand the answer to for this Court, and that is that we sued petitioner under a provision of State law that lets us just sue her, and if the problem is the practical administration of this rule, that it will cause a burden for ERISA plans, the rule at the least ought to be that that's not preempted. It's a State law conversion suit. We can go after her for the money."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It seems to me, and maybe you have an answer to it, that the manner in which this State law differs from laws that say who a wife is, who a child is and so forth, is that this is a State law that is directed explicitly to the manner in which a contract, an ERISA contract in particular, should be interpreted. It is directed precisely to the intent of the parties to an agreement, and it says this is what they shall be deemed to intend. It operates directly and explicitly upon the agreement itself."

The second is that I do think in these ERISA cases we get the unfortunate sense that this statute is about ERISA plans, and it's not. There's a separate statute, of course, that deals with every form of will. This statute deals with every conceivable form of nonprobate asset. It's really important under State law. Most of the money that is held by individuals now is either in your home or in a life insurance plan or in a pension, whether qualified or not, and you get the situation that you have here, and that is that Donna Egelhoff already got equivalent assets. She's going to come along and recover again. The children are going to be completely out of luck for no sensible purpose at all. If there are no further questions --"

The last point that Mr. Goldstein made, which suggests broader preemption than I think the statute entails, ERISA preempts State law only insofar as it relates to an employee benefit plan. No one is suggesting that the State statute is preempted with regard to other nonprobate assets. Mr. Goldstein also mentioned that they had sued, the respondents here had sued petitioner, not the plan. Well, that is true. That, of course, was true in Boggs as well and, as the Court said in the Boggs decision, there, as here, the premise of the lawsuit is based on a displacement of ERISA provisions and plan provisions. A point with regard to the contingent beneficiary notion. If Mr. Goldstein is correct, and respondents are beneficiaries under ERISA because they have a contingent right, then their only cause of action would be under section 502(a) of ERISA. That would be their exclusive right, and they would have had to sue the plan under those provisions rather than the petitioner under the State statute. With regard to the QDRO point, Qualified Domestic Relations Order point, the fact is that a QDRO could have been fashioned that provided that the spouse had given up any interest that she might have as a beneficiary. The fact here is, that wasn't done. That provision is a relatively easy one to effect. It wasn't done, and that's the reason that respondents must lose. Unless the Court has any questions for me --"
