It is in a handful of States that you have divorce revocation rules, and they vary among themselves, so there is that burden that plaintiffs would have to deal with.

The death benefit is the entirety of the pension benefit, and she could not have an expectation that she would ever get the money, because she knows that he could change it the next day. Moreover, this is a community property State.

One is married or divorced and the second is, there is, in fact, a surviving spouse, so -- Now, a number of the questions have focused on whether or not there is a conflict with the terms of ERISA.  Justice Scalia, you pointed out that it may well be that there would be preemption even if there was no additional burden.  This is -- Congress said, this is how it's going to work.

And number 2, would you comment on what I speculated when I read that last phrase, who are or may become entitled.

    "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",

Our position is, is that before the death of David, and before the administrator looked at the alternate beneficiary say -- use more limited language than or may become, it could have.  It could have said --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It seems to me what you're arguing is that it does not pose a conflict with the plan if you require the plan to pay out to a contingent beneficiary instead of to the main beneficiary. I mean, the mere fact that it's somebody who was ERISA plans pay benefits out under the spousal annuity.  ERISA plans pay ERISA benefits out under the QDRO provisions.  It is many times not the case that they pay it out directly to the person whose name is on it.  In fact, the plan here reserves the right to determine that the individual named is incompetent, and not to pay them then, either."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

The Attorney General of Washington in her brief at footnote 6 has explained under this statute, you don't have to say, Revised Code 1107010 doesn't apply, Alabama Code, da-da-da.  It is, you just say, divorce revocation statutes don't apply. An earlier question also said, and --"

I'm not representing to you that the same rationale would save all of them. you have any doubt, don't pay.  You don't have to go to court.  Just don't do it.  Just send a letter to the people who want the money and say to them, come back to us when you have figured it out or a court has told you what to do. And so in terms of getting to the practicalities, Justice Ginsburg, of how is this going to work for administrators --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Doesn't that conflict with ERISA?  I mean, isn't he supposed to pay out the money promptly to the person entitled to it, and you're saying it doesn't conflict with ERISA to tell him to sit on his hands until litigation terminates 2 years hence?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, it is frequently the case, in fact, that ERISA plans have some doubt.  The Court discussed probably the most obvious cases, slayer Does the statute take care of the situation when the beneficiary is incompetent, or a child, or something like that?  Does it provide paying to a conservator, or is that done as a matter of State law?"

    "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",

There are normal probate areas that they have limited themselves, and if I could just mention one point --"
  },

This is not a situation where the money is taken away from the participant or anyone else who has a mandated right to it and give -- and let me take you to the definition.  The alienation definition is not reprinted in the appendix to any brief -- I apologize -- but I will simply read it to you.  Well, the statute is, and that is at the appendix to petitioner's brief at page 4, and it simply says, not very helpfully, each pension plan shall provide the benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated. Justice Kennedy's opinion in Boggs looks to the IRS's definition and I will read it to you.  This for the record is at 26 C.F.R. section 1.401A-(13)(c)(i) -- (ii). The terms, assignment and alienation, include any direct alienation.  That's our point, and that's the difference from the hypothetical you asked.  If there was a divorce decree that said, look -- if the divorce decree here said, Donna Egelhoff is going to get 100 percent of David's pension, if that is not, Justice O'Connor, registered as a QDRO that's an alienation.  You can't do it. Now, the petitioner --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Excuse me, that is an alienation? Why is that an alienation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But David is not alienating himself. He's not taking it from himself and giving it to Donna.  I thought you agreed with me that that's what alienate means.  It means you can't transfer it to someone else, not that operation of law can't take it away from you and community property law."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes.  Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
    "speech": "Remember, the second wife, community property law, took it.  She -- the community property law is what gave it to her.  So what I'm focusing on, though, is that this does not take it from somebody and give it to somebody else. Now, there was the question put before, well, should this have been a QDRO, and there is the negative inference suggested by petitioner that Congress occupied this field, that really these sorts of things are supposed to be done by QDRO's, and I will explain to you why that's not so. Washington law doesn't intend to say that the kids will get the money.  That's the whole point, that the plan will decide who gets the money.  Washington law wants problem some other way, and it says to the plans, or any other nonprobate asset, you don't want to comply, say you're not going to comply.  You have any doubts, don't comply.  And it says to the participant himself, if you don't want this to be the rule, just say so, either in the divorce decree or even in your designation. There really is nothing going on here that Congress didn't want to happen.  There's nobody -- unlike Boggs, where we had the actual spouse who was going to get the spousal annuity, or we had the pension benefits after death in the hands at least of the estate of the pensioner, none of that applies here. We're in a situation where Congress left it up to anybody to name a designee, and unless there's some real practical problem for the ERISA plan, unless something's -- it's just not workable, I could understand that I don't understand the answer to for this Court, and that is that we sued petitioner under a provision of State law that lets us just sue her, and if the problem is the practical administration of this rule, that it will cause a burden for ERISA plans, the rule at the least ought to be that that's not preempted.  It's a State law conversion suit.  We can go after her for the money."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It seems to me, and maybe you have an answer to it, that the manner in which this State law differs from laws that say who a wife is, who a child is and so forth, is that this is a State law that is directed explicitly to the manner in which a contract, an ERISA contract in particular, should be interpreted.  It is directed precisely to the intent of the parties to an agreement, and it says this is what they shall be deemed to intend.  It operates directly and explicitly upon the This statute deals with every conceivable form of nonprobate asset.  It's really important under State law. Most of the money that is held by individuals now is either in your home or in a life insurance plan or in a pension, whether qualified or not, and you get the situation that you have here, and that is that Donna Egelhoff already got equivalent assets.  She's going to come along and recover again.  The children are going to be completely out of luck for no sensible purpose at all. If there are no further questions --"

    "speaker": "KILBERG",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points.  The last point that Mr. as here, the premise of the lawsuit is based on a displacement of ERISA provisions and plan provisions. A point with regard to the contingent beneficiary notion.  If Mr. Goldstein is correct, and respondents are beneficiaries under ERISA because they have a contingent right, then their only cause of action would be under section 502(a) of ERISA.  That would be their exclusive right, and they would have had to sue the plan under those provisions rather than the petitioner under the State statute. With regard to the QDRO point, Qualified Domestic Relations Order point, the fact is that a QDRO could have been fashioned that provided that the spouse had given up any interest that she might have as a beneficiary.  The fact here is, that wasn't done.  That"
