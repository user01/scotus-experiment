Treat it as, district judge, your wrong, you should not have dismissed, we have to review and reverse at least that much to say, you should not have dismissed the case, you should have stayed it. So I could see if you're right about that, that the proper result here is always stay, never dismiss, then seems to me, Justice Ginsburg, is going to be whether you treat form or substance in this context as the most important, because it's pretty clear to me that while the judge did, in fact, formally dismiss the action, what was both required under section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act and what we asked for him to do was to stay this. This is the plaintiff's choice of forum. There's no reason the case couldn't have stayed there.  We can respond directly to the Chief Justice's and Justice O'Connor's concerns about judicial administration by retaining the case under those circumstances, and we can fulfill the overall purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act appellate review standards by insisting that matters, when all doubts are -- you know, when you can resolve all doubts in favor of making sure they go to arbitration, rather than go through what we are today,"

I understand your form and substance argument here, but if we follow the embedded-independent distinction we've got a form and substance problem, too, and it seems to me that if we follow the embedded-independent distinction we are in effect going to be leaving it up to a matter of pleading in a great many instances as to what the appealability may be, and let me just throw out the and there are embedded proceedings, and it has specific rules about how appeals ought to be followed in that course. So to be sure, there may be some potential for manipulation by the parties, but I don't know of much evidence to reflect that that's any kind of a problem, and Congress essentially bought into that distinction in 1988 when it adopted the statute in the form that it did."

I mean, if that's what they meant by final, you know, final decision, they should have said something else.  It's a very strange word to use to convey embedded versus Whether it should be extended beyond that to a new class of claims that will interfere with the implementation of the goals of arbitration is the issue before this Court.

Do you think there are -- let's assume you're dead right, that the arbitration clause does not have to specify the costs in detail and so forth.  Now, are there cases, and I'm wondering in -- take care of this one -- in which an arbitration clause could be so one-sided that it's not enforceable? This clause, as I read it, preserves the company's right to judicial remedy.  It says the arbitration clause shall not interfere with their right to use the judicial process to secure relief, but it does interfere with the other side's right.  Now, I don't know whether that's sufficiently one-sided to raise a question or not, but are there clauses that are so one-sided that the table. With respect -- I mean, is it possible to have an arbitration clause that says in order to get entry into arbitration you -- you know, the plaintiff would have to file a million dollars, I think obviously a clause like that would be unenforceable under those circumstances because it would interfere with the ultimate enforcement of the statutory right, and that is one of the conditions of allowing arbitration of general statutory claims, and I don't have any problem with that. The problem is that if you have a clause like the one we have in this case, which is silent on these issues, the clear presumption, then, must be that you would favor arbitration.  You would not assume all of the costs are going to be extreme or excessive."

She chose, on a motion to reconsider, to throw some materials from the American Arbitration Association over the transom to try to make some kind of a showing. consumers would fall in that same boat.  They're going to not go to an arbitration if they're gong to face the possibility, which they never face in court -- in court, they don't have to pay the judge. Arbitrators sometimes charge a lot of money per hour of their time, so unless the contract says, or unless the court reads into the contract that the seller in this case, or the finance company, the employer in that case, pays at least for the judge, then this would be an unconscionable arrangement.  You can't require the consumer or the employee to pay the judge, and that has to be clear."

I don't see why the -- that party should have to go to arbitration if they can make a persuasive showing to the court."

    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "I don't disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice.  I think that you have either of two ways to try to prove up your case, either through makes much more sense for the court to entertain these issues after an arbitration rather than before an arbitration -- is that we may find out at the end of the day, if the plaintiff prevails, that all of those costs go back to her, and so she's really out of pocket nothing except for the marginal costs during the pendency of the proceedings."

The Eleventh Circuit, as I understand it, said we're not going to address that issue because we've already decided she has to have security that she's not going to have to pay for the arbitrator under any circumstances."

Let's see what the arbitrator does.  We're not going to tell you one way or the other. silence, that there's going to be a problem with going to arbitration. This Court has said consistently for 15 years, in interpreting the relationship between the Federal Arbitration Act and Federal statutes, that we presume they should go to arbitration and, if there are gaps, we assume that the arbitrator will provide for them and we know, as this case comes to the Court at this point based on both what was in the record below and what the amici briefs have shown, is that this does not need to be an expensive enterprise.

I don't know whether it would necessarily be applied as broadly as the language seems to suggest, but what I do know is that the problems inherent in that kind of a rule, which has not been tested particularly, are such that it's completely premature for this Court to go down that path.  Where this Court ought to focus is, what was before the district judge when that court decided to send it to arbitration, and what was before that judge at that time was, silence, which you construe favorably to arbitration and therefore send the matter to arbitration with no further judicial review."

Very importantly, the Federal Arbitration Act did not divest the district courts of discretion to dismiss cases, as the district judge did here, as opposed to staying a case.  Therefore, the district court had that discretion, exercised the discretion and, as Justice Ginsburg observed, I think once the decision was made to dismiss with prejudice there was nothing else left for the Court to do, and that satisfied the classic standard of finality that made it subject to immediate appellate review."

Section 3 was designed to ensure that there would be no further pursuit of the merits of the action, that that would be the end of the litigation of the action in that court until the arbitration concluded.

There was not even an indication that somebody who went forward with an arbitration would have to bear costs. She'd have to be -- have to know that, and have confidence that in going forward there would be a reasonable -- there'd be an expectation of an allocation that is fair, whatever that means. We submit that that kind of uncertainty creates a disincentive to go forward and enforce the rights under the Truth-in-Lending Act that this Court in Mitsubishi and in Gilmer made clear is the basis either to decline to enforce the agreement altogether or, as was asked about the Cole decision -- if I may address it for a moment. We understand there's a split in the circuits as be assured that they're not going to bear costs beyond those that would be -- they would ordinarily expect if they went forward in court. That is the forum that they chose.

I believe -- I want to give effect to this agreement.  I believe that's the intention of the parties.  But I am also concerned about the potential imposition of excessive costs. In Alabama there's a customer usage provision, and I want to establish, before I send this off to arbitration, or have a initial conference with the arbitrator to determine at no expense to the parties what cost is going to be assessed, and how it's going to be allocated, and at that point go forward and arbitrate. That would satisfy us. But it's got to be done at the outset, not at the end, because at that point you bear the costs, you're stuck with them, or, as in the case of Ms. Randolph, tossed out this arbitration, which would allow your client -- as I understand the posture now, your client can go into court with a Truth-in-Lending Act suit and is freed from the yoke of arbitration, is that correct?"

So it's either the district court does it as the Cole court endorsed at the outset, or, instead, the parties are directed to do it.

Circuit. That's clear, and it is also clear that there was issue about the cost presented to the district court, and about their being excessive, and the record was developed.  Whether it was sufficient on the costs in that case or not to satisfy the court, I think we may have a difference of opinion, but I think it's fair to say that the issue of costs was raised early, and it was raised several times.  It was not a last-minute concern, and it was raised to the court of appeals in the same fashion. And if I might add, if I can turn for just a a case as a class action it's exempt from arbitration. That is not the position that we've taken here. The position is likewise, the agreement was silent on class actions.  The district court viewed it as silence meant it's excluded.  That's the end of the discussion, even though the district court expressed some sympathy for Ms. Randolph's concerns about aggregating small consumer claims in the absence of that, the parties being left with no recourse, and I submit that once again the district court could have and should have been able to say to the parties, I see also that Ms. Randolph has styled this case as a class action. I believe that the Truth-in-Lending Act, while the language of the statute itself contemplates class actions, but more importantly, Congress made it clear, echoing the views of the Federal Reserve Board, that there agreements. But that I'm going to send this to arbitration, but I want you to understand that I regard -- the district court says this, I regard class action to be an option, either left to the arbitrator to determine whether to certify the class, or for the district court itself to determine whether to certify the class, and then, upon review at the end, to satisfy itself that the interests of absent class members have been adequately protected. I think the district court viewed its role in a way that was much too passive for the circumstances of the Federal Arbitration Act, but we do not take the position, and I want to be very clear about it, that we do not take the position that all TILA claims should be exempt from arbitration, or even all TILA class actions should be exempt from arbitration, nor that the district court was Mastrobuono. We also recognize, however, that there's a strong policy favoring the enforcement of appropriate arbitration agreements, and all we are saying here is that either there has to be, as the Eleventh Circuit did, a conclusion that the agreement is not enforceable, or the district courts could have some discretion to ensure that the parties put in place at the outset, not at the end of the arbitration process, but at the outset, mechanisms to ensure that these kinds of protections --"

I don't think anybody going in anticipated any of those costs, and certainly no one is in a position to give a guarantee that any process of dispute resolution is going to be cost-free or have cost constraints and, indeed, the plaintiff never asked the district court for any of the specifics that counsel has identified in the context of this particular case.
