      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The central flaw in the jurisdictional and the enforceability of holdings in the court of appeals in this case is the manifest hostility that court demonstrated towards arbitration.

It said everything else is dismissed, and I take it that would mean then that the statute of limitations might run before the case ever got back, or something like that, and isn't there a real difference between the entry of a stay order pending the arbitration versus a dismissal?"

What I see that as telling me is, don't move forward. It's not stay versus dismissal, but it's stay versus letting the case continue. Why should a district judge who says, there's nothing to come back to me, this is not a case where some issues are to be referred to other -- to the arbitral forum, and then there are other issues that I'll decide after the arbitration. Why isn't it perfectly proper for a district judge to say, there's nothing here for me to decide, everything is for the arbitrator?"

This is the plaintiff consumer suing rather than an action to order arbitration, but it seems to me even if you're right that the district judge should have stayed, what in fact happened was the district judge dismissed, total, case gone, and that seems to me as final a judgment as there could be. You could argue, he shouldn't have done that."

Treat it as, district judge, your wrong, you should not have dismissed, we have to review and reverse at least that much to say, you should not have dismissed the case, you should have stayed it. So I could see if you're right about that, that the proper result here is always stay, never dismiss, then the court of appeals says, this judge was wrong in dismissing, we certainly have to review that, that's as final as it could be, and on the merits of that decision to dismiss, just as we would do with a summary judgment, we say, district judge, you're wrong, you had no authority to dismiss, you should have stayed. I don't know that courts of appeals treat dismissals that are wrong as if the judge had not dismissed."

This is the plaintiff's choice of forum. There's no reason the case couldn't have stayed there. We can respond directly to the Chief Justice's and Justice O'Connor's concerns about judicial administration by retaining the case under those circumstances, and we can fulfill the overall purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act appellate review standards by insisting that matters, when all doubts are -- you know, when you can resolve all doubts in favor of making sure they go to arbitration, rather than go through what we are today, which is having adjudicated this issue at three different levels of the Federal court system over 5 years, tens of thousands of dollars, and we're no closer today to resolving the merits of this dispute over the $15 charge and whether that's a finance charge or not --"

I understand your form and substance argument here, but if we follow the embedded-independent distinction we've got a form and substance problem, too, and it seems to me that if we follow the embedded-independent distinction we are in effect going to be leaving it up to a matter of pleading in a great many instances as to what the appealability may be, and let me just throw out the suggestion that we might be better off to let district judges, in effect, make the form-substance distinction and decide the appealability question than leave it to parties who are pleading to make that distinction for us."

They clearly recognize there are independent proceedings and there are embedded proceedings, and it has specific rules about how appeals ought to be followed in that course. So to be sure, there may be some potential for manipulation by the parties, but I don't know of much evidence to reflect that that's any kind of a problem, and Congress essentially bought into that distinction in 1988 when it adopted the statute in the form that it did."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, it did set forth specific rules, but it certainly didn't adopt the embedded- nonembedded criterion as a test for anything else, and the word it used for appealability was a classic word that has nothing to do with embedded versus nonembedded. I mean, if that's what they meant by final, you know, final decision, they should have said something else. It's a very strange word to use to convey embedded versus nonembedded."

At the end of the day what we know is that the final decision language in section 16(a)(3) covers the classic situation involving an independent proceeding. Whether it should be extended beyond that to a new class of claims that will interfere with the implementation of the goals of arbitration is the issue before this Court. I find it difficult to get passionate about this because I believe Justice Souter is right, at the end of the day what really matters is that we have a rule.

Now, are there cases, and I'm wondering in -- take care of this one -- in which an arbitration clause could be so one-sided that it's not enforceable? This clause, as I read it, preserves the company's right to judicial remedy. It says the arbitration clause shall not interfere with their right to use the judicial process to secure relief, but it does interfere with the other side's right. Now, I don't know whether that's sufficiently one-sided to raise a question or not, but are there clauses that are so one-sided that it might not be enforceable?"

If they did argue it below, they -- clearly that was rejected because the district court analyzed and dealt with all of the unconscionability issues, so I don't think that issue's on the table. With respect -- I mean, is it possible to have an arbitration clause that says in order to get entry into arbitration you -- you know, the plaintiff would have to file a million dollars, I think obviously a clause like that would be unenforceable under those circumstances because it would interfere with the ultimate enforcement of the statutory right, and that is one of the conditions of allowing arbitration of general statutory claims, and I don't have any problem with that. The problem is that if you have a clause like the one we have in this case, which is silent on these issues, the clear presumption, then, must be that you would favor arbitration. You would not assume all of the costs are going to be extreme or excessive."

They're going to not go to an arbitration if they're gong to face the possibility, which they never face in court -- in court, they don't have to pay the judge. Arbitrators sometimes charge a lot of money per hour of their time, so unless the contract says, or unless the court reads into the contract that the seller in this case, or the finance company, the employer in that case, pays at least for the judge, then this would be an unconscionable arrangement.

I think that you have either of two ways to try to prove up your case, either through discovery, which she had a full and fair opportunity to do, and didn't present any evidence with respect to that, or, assuming that there's going to be doubts -- and I think all doubts, again, ought to be resolved in favor of pushing toward arbitration in order to ascertain this. Remember, if you read the American Arbitration Association's amicus brief it says that they consistently waive their filing fees, they often reduce arbitrator's fees, and we know -- and it's the reason why I think it makes much more sense for the court to entertain these issues after an arbitration rather than before an arbitration -- is that we may find out at the end of the day, if the plaintiff prevails, that all of those costs go back to her, and so she's really out of pocket nothing except for the marginal costs during the pendency of the proceedings."

They have raised a class action issue. We have responded to the class action issue. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in a recent decision in Johnson, which we filed a supplemental brief on, has exhaustively analyzed the class action issue, and the bottom line is there is nothing in TILA that is any more pro-class action than there was in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which this Court held in Gilmer did not prevent enforceability of the arbitration clause in that context and, indeed, TILA has provisions that clearly envision providing significant opportunities for plaintiffs to recover in these kinds of cases.

Let's see what the arbitrator does. We're not going to tell you one way or the other. The securities industry said, we pay for the judge, and so that was out of the case. When Gilmer came to this Court it was presented with a situation where the employee was not going to have to pay the cost of the arbitrator because the party seeking arbitration, the securities industry, said, what -- don't worry about that.

Circuit's opinion is overbroad. I don't know whether it would necessarily be applied as broadly as the language seems to suggest, but what I do know is that the problems inherent in that kind of a rule, which has not been tested particularly, are such that it's completely premature for this Court to go down that path. Where this Court ought to focus is, what was before the district judge when that court decided to send it to arbitration, and what was before that judge at that time was, silence, which you construe favorably to arbitration and therefore send the matter to arbitration with no further judicial review."

Very importantly, the Federal Arbitration Act did not divest the district courts of discretion to dismiss cases, as the district judge did here, as opposed to staying a case. Therefore, the district court had that discretion, exercised the discretion and, as Justice Ginsburg observed, I think once the decision was made to dismiss with prejudice there was nothing else left for the Court to do, and that satisfied the classic standard of finality that made it subject to immediate appellate review."

You must stay, because section 3 says must stay."

Section 3 was designed to ensure that there would be no further pursuit of the merits of the action, that that would be the end of the litigation of the action in that court until the arbitration concluded.

      "speech": "No, I don't think it would be, but that might be in the eye of the arbitrator, the result that is awarded, and we won't know that unless it's determined or ascertainable at the beginning. We don't take the position that the costs have to be set forth specifically in the arbitration agreement, but that they be ascertainable, and in fact the American Arbitration Association last year adopted new rules pursuant to a consumer protocol which set forth the provision that a maximum of $125 must be borne by the consumer and the rest would be borne by the company for smaller claims. That is a -- had this agreement simply said, we will follow that kind of rule, or refer to it an outside source of that kind of rule, that would have been fine. But complete silence. It was even silent as to whether there were costs. There was not even an indication that somebody who went forward with an arbitration would have to bear costs. She'd have to be -- have to know that, and have confidence that in going forward there would be a reasonable -- there'd be an expectation of an allocation that is fair, whatever that means. We submit that that kind of uncertainty creates a disincentive to go forward and enforce the rights under the Truth-in-Lending Act that this Court in Mitsubishi and in Gilmer made clear is the basis either to decline to enforce the agreement altogether or, as was asked about the Cole decision -- if I may address it for a moment. We understand there's a split in the circuits as to whether, under section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act, there is any authority that the district courts have to insert provisions into an agreement to have it conform with the law as they view it. Whether or not that authority exists, ultimately the outcome ought to be that the district court should tell the parties, I won't permit this to go forward unless you spell out costs or give the party against whom the arbitration agreement is being enforced the opportunity to be assured that they're not going to bear costs beyond those that would be -- they would ordinarily expect if they went forward in court. That is the forum that they chose. If the -- if judicial and arbitral forums are to be comparable, you can't impose on one party costs well in excess, or create the risk that they would bear those costs --"

I believe -- I want to give effect to this agreement. I believe that's the intention of the parties. But I am also concerned about the potential imposition of excessive costs. In Alabama there's a customer usage provision, and I want to establish, before I send this off to arbitration, or have a initial conference with the arbitrator to determine at no expense to the parties what cost is going to be assessed, and how it's going to be allocated, and at that point go forward and arbitrate. That would satisfy us. But it's got to be done at the outset, not at the end, because at that point you bear the costs, you're stuck with them, or, as in the case of Ms. Randolph, you're so deterred by the possibility of excessive costs that you won't go forward, and that's the prospective waiver of the TILA claims that this Court has expressed concern if it were to arise."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And no --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SELLERS",
      "speech": "No, I didn't present the options in the way I've just presented to the Court today, but I think that it's reasonable to infer that if the district court regarded itself as lacking authority to pencil in anything as the Cole court allowed in the D.C. Circuit. That's clear, and it is also clear that there was issue about the cost presented to the district court, and about their being excessive, and the record was developed. Whether it was sufficient on the costs in that case or not to satisfy the court, I think we may have a difference of opinion, but I think it's fair to say that the issue of costs was raised early, and it was raised several times. It was not a last-minute concern, and it was raised to the court of appeals in the same fashion. And if I might add, if I can turn for just a moment to the class action issue, which I understand was not decided by the court of appeals, because it apparently didn't feel it needed to reach the issue, but I think at least I want to make clear that much the same kind of approach we advanced here could be taken with respect to the class action issue. Ms. Randolph has taken the position here that, not that class actions under Truth-in-Lending Act are always exempt from arbitration. Any time a lawyer styles a case as a class action it's exempt from arbitration. That is not the position that we've taken here. The position is likewise, the agreement was silent on class actions. The district court viewed it as silence meant it's excluded. That's the end of the discussion, even though the district court expressed some sympathy for Ms. Randolph's concerns about aggregating small consumer claims in the absence of that, the parties being left with no recourse, and I submit that once again the district court could have and should have been able to say to the parties, I see also that Ms. Randolph has styled this case as a class action. I believe that the Truth-in-Lending Act, while the language of the statute itself contemplates class actions, but more importantly, Congress made it clear, echoing the views of the Federal Reserve Board, that there was great importance attached to the enforcement of the statute through class actions. And the district judge could have said and should have said, I think that the view -- I don't know whether you intend to include class actions here, although Green Tree had already made its position clear by opposing class certification, that it presumably didn't want it and may very well have hoped that it would never see another class action again and these kinds of boiler plate agreements. But that I'm going to send this to arbitration, but I want you to understand that I regard -- the district court says this, I regard class action to be an option, either left to the arbitrator to determine whether to certify the class, or for the district court itself to determine whether to certify the class, and then, upon review at the end, to satisfy itself that the interests of absent class members have been adequately protected. I think the district court viewed its role in a way that was much too passive for the circumstances of the Federal Arbitration Act, but we do not take the position, and I want to be very clear about it, that we do not take the position that all TILA claims should be exempt from arbitration, or even all TILA class actions should be exempt from arbitration, nor that the district court was without recourse to have the parties put in place some assurances about cost, or to actually insert a provision about cost, as the Cole court seems to have contemplated."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, why should the district court do that? I mean, if you're right, why not say, we construe the contract against the drafter, the drafter didn't put it in, so the contract is no good?"

We also recognize, however, that there's a strong policy favoring the enforcement of appropriate arbitration agreements, and all we are saying here is that either there has to be, as the Eleventh Circuit did, a conclusion that the agreement is not enforceable, or the district courts could have some discretion to ensure that the parties put in place at the outset, not at the end of the arbitration process, but at the outset, mechanisms to ensure that these kinds of protections --"

The other questions, of course, are also State law questions, but they basically are questions of State law that are made Federal because of the policy of the arbitration act, contrary to hostility by the State law."

We are in a situation now where we have litigated this issue in three different jurisdictions and levels of this court. I don't think anybody going in anticipated any of those costs, and certainly no one is in a position to give a guarantee that any process of dispute resolution is going to be cost-free or have cost constraints and, indeed, the plaintiff never asked the district court for any of the specifics that counsel has identified in the context of this particular case. What she said is, plaintiff does not have the resources to arbitrate, notwithstanding her agreement. Therefore, plaintiff's only option is to forego any claims against this company.

The Chief Justice is absolutely right. You read 17(a) and 18(a) and it says, presume everything adverse to the lender in this case, and only then can you come to the conclusion that this arbitration clause should be enforced.
