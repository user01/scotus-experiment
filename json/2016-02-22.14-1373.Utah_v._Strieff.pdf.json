      "speech": "And ­­ and I was actually just going to turn to that, Justice Kennedy. I think when this Court has mentioned flagrancy in cases, not only those cases listing the Brown factors, but also cases like Leon and Herring, what it has been concerned about in part is the notion that once you establish an attenuation principle, what I would say is a common­sense principle here that generally an arrest warrant should be a superseding cause of the discovery of the evidence, you might have an officer exploiting that rule precisely in order to get evidence in searches incident to arrests. So I think the way you could think about flagrancy is: Did this officer have the purpose ­­ and it could either be a purpose objectively understood from all of the facts or it could be a subjective purpose ­­ to exploit this attenuation exception precisely in order to search incident to arrest. I don't think the facts here remotely get there. I ­­ I don't really think even Respondent has argued that. This was a legitimate investigation. The officer may have made a mistake about the quantum of suspicion necessary, but if you had a case where an officer truly, either objectively or subjectively, is going out, just pulling random people over because he now knows about this attenuation rule established in this case, I think that's the sort of flagrancy consideration in cases like Leon and Herring this Court has left as a safety valve."

And it also has some support in doctrines like inevitable discovery, which does ask, you know, what were you going to do, in effect? In more recent cases, the Court has moved towards an objective test. So I think the way the Court could formulate the flagrancy safety valve in this case is to say does this stop appear objectively designed to exploit the ability to search, incident to arrest on a warrant. And it could look at all the circumstances. It could look at the fact that this wasn't incident to any legitimate investigation. It could look to the fact that the officer pulled over several people and searched them for warrants in the same incident. I think it could have that safety valve, which would have the effect of preserving cases like this one, where an officer is acting in good faith, and someone is found with very serious evidence on them of drug trafficking or a firearm.

This is a fairly straightforward case that is going on every day in this country where officers are looking at houses, watching houses that maybe, might have drug trafficking going on.

The temporal proximity works with us, obviously. It was ­­ it was contemporaneous. It was immediate. It was inherent.

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
      "speech": "So we now have a new rule. We've taken running warrants for traffic stops that we've thought were legitimate because they had to do with highway safety. Now we're saying to police officers, run warrants on any name you get because all you have to do is wave the flag of safety."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREEN",
      "speech": "No, Your Honor. That's not what we're saying. We're saying that there is a safety rationale for the warrant check. But beyond that, there's also the important flagrancy safety valve that we've talked about here. And with respect to this particular warrant check on page 101 of the Appendix to our petition, there is actually a finding from the district court that the reason that this officer stopped this particular defendant was on suspicion of drug possession or distribution. It wasn't for something else. So that finding is here. And more broadly, this rule, as we've noted in our papers, is, in fact, the majority rule among the courts that have addressed this issue throughout the country. In the United States, and ­­ excuse me, in the Seventh Circuit, the case of United States v. Green was decided in 1997, almost 20 years ago. And that, of course, involves States with a large number of metropolitan areas, Chicago and Milwaukee and Indianapolis. And there's no evidence in this record or before this Court that these sort of random stops in order to check for warrants is happening in those jurisdictions. So I think the actual practice and the way it bears out, and has borne out in ­­ in areas where this has been adopted undermines that particular argument. Second, Your Honor, with respect to the question of whether a subjective purpose should come in, responding to Justice Kennedy's question to this ­­ to this inquiry. I think if this Court were to do that, it would become an outlier of sorts in the case ­­ in this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. And I think, with respect, if ­­ if it remains an objective inquiry and consistent with the rest of this Court's cases, that objective inquiry will capture the flagrant cases. We've cited four cases from four different State courts in our reply brief, in footnote 1 of our reply brief. That's Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey. And Oregon, where the courts that have applied this rule have undertaken the flagrancy inquiry and have, in fact, suppressed evidence because the initial stop was flagrant. Finally, a third point, the ­­ as we've noted in our briefs, Your Honor, the ­­ the Respondent here has abandoned the Utah Supreme Court's rule that an intervening circumstance must, in fact, be something attributable to the defendant's own free will. We think that's appropriate based on that concession that it would ­­ that this Court should ­­ should reverse the judgment of the Utah Supreme Court, and leaves the question, of course, of what rule to adopt instead. And we think, Your Honor, this ­­ this intervening circumstance here, this arrest on a preexisting warrant that arises from probable cause based on facts completely unrelated to the circumstances and the facts of this stop, is exactly like what happened in Johnson v. Louisiana, which is the case that this Court pointed to in Brown v. Illinois. Where ­­ where it adopted and said the intervening circumstance is critical to the attenuation inquiry. It's a straightforward application of that particular test. If there are no further questions."
