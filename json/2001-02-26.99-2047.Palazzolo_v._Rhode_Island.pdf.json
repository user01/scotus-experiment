      "speaker": "BURLING",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: According to local land use regulations there are two uses to which Mr. Palazzolo's property can be put, residential and a beach club. In 1983 Mr. Palazzolo applied to fill all 18 acres of his property which would have made the property suitable for either use. When that was denied, he applied for a lesser scaled-back permit application to fill 11 and a half acres for a beach club."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So far as the '83 denial, it seems to me that was the skimpiest kind of showing, I don't see any zoning authority accepting a proposal to just fill the marsh without any further specified use. I don't really count that very heavily in your favor. So far as the beach club is concerned, that's a bit different. Do you read the opinion by Judge Israel and then the opinion by Judge Williams and the opinion by the Supreme Court of Rhode Island as, particularly the latter, as proceeding on the assumption that the one lot with the residence on the high ground would be the only permitted development? Can we take the case on that assumption."

Now, this beach club, which by the way was unpaved and did have very minimal structures, Mr. Palazzolo believed that that would have less of an environmental impact than having structures with sanitation facilities and things of that nature. We know quite clearly what uses he could and could not do with the property. At trial, for example, it was brought out that no residential structures of any kind would meet the public purpose requirement of CRMC."

That would be allowed. There was some initial testimony at trial regarding other wetland uses, excuse me, other upland uses perhaps, but later on at trial that became clear that any other upland on this property could only be reached by filling wetland to access it. And at trial the CRMC executive director made it quite clear that there were no residential structures could meet the compelling public purpose. I think we're going in this case --"

      "speaker": "BURLING",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Twice in the brief in opposition they acknowledge that the CMRC would have approved a single home site, which would have netted greater proceeds i.e. $200,000 at less risk, they say that on page four, and again at say, page 19, they say specifically the Council would be happy to have petitioner situate a single home thus allowing petitioner to realize $200,000. So I, you know, I thought that was not in the case when we took it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURLING",

      "speaker": "BURLING",
      "speech": "Traditionally in Rhode Island one owning riparian property has always had the right to fill the wetland. Indeed, as our reply brief points out, this has been the law in Rhode Island for a century and a half. As the Supreme Court said below at pages A3 to A4, that as of the early 1960s there was not even a permit requirement to fill wetland."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURLING",
      "speech": "Not precisely, Your Honor, because if the State is able to prove that the particular application before it would cause a nuisance and by nuisance talking about a genuine nuisance not something decreed anew, not something that has always been unlawful."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURLING",
      "speech": "When talking about what is and what is not a nuisance, it is important not to simply say that the law of nuisance is coterminus with the police power, in this case it's not only that it was not a nuisance beforehand, but also that the State has not proven that the proposals by Mr. Palazzolo would indeed constitute a nuisance. It is not enough simply to say that we have new knowledge today and it is therefore a nuisance, the inquiry must be more searching than that."

      "speech": "Let me ask you a different question, would it be a predicate for the taking claim for a State to pass a statute saying all dwellings, all public accommodations must have modern plumbing with septic systems, would that -- and in the past that wasn't necessary, so it naturally reduces the value of the land because it makes it more difficult, more expensive to develop. Would that be a predicate for a taking claim?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURLING",
      "speech": "Probably not, but again, we must look at the individual circumstances of the case. Why are the septic systems being required? If it is to prevent a genuine health and safety risk then I would have to concur that that would be a regulation passed to protect public health and safety and it may rise to the level of a nuisance."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

All I'm getting at is, it sounds suspiciously to me as though that, at least, is what was involved or could have been involved whether it was stated or not when the State said, no, we're not going to let you build a beach club without any plumbing. And if the alternative was pollution by any plumbing system that went in because of runoff from the septic system or a beach club with no plumbing at all, and in effect modern outhouses, that seems to me a weak basis for a takings claim and if that's not we're concerned with I want you to explain it to me."

      "speaker": "BURLING",
      "speech": "That is correct, Your Honor. I don't think this case needs to turn on the 18-acre application, indeed it was not even part of the complaint. I think the key here is understanding that no filling of any wetland would be allowed for any reason that was lawful under the local zoning code. No structures of any kind would be permitted by Mr. Palazzolo to construct. So we know that he cannot use his wetland. For that reason, there is --"

      "speech": "The court never concluded that it was 20 acres, and it is probably less than that. But I can not be more specific than that. Since we know what uses can and cannot be made with the property, the primary question that is of concern to us is whether or not the existence of regulations in 1978 when Mr. Palazzolo acquired the property is sufficient to deny him the ability to challenge the, either the application of those regulations or challenge the impact of those regulations upon him if he contends that that is a regulatory taking. We certainly know that Shore Gardens, Incorporated had, from 1971 until the time it was dissolved in 1978, the right to apply for permits and the right to bring a takings claim if those permits were denied. To suggest that the State can deny a permit and refuse somebody even the right to seek just compensation because they acquired the property from a predecessor is contrary to what this Court had held earlier in Nollan which I don't need to repeat the entire cite, except this Court did say briefly, so long as the commission could not have deprived prior owners of the easement without compensating them, the prior owners must be understood to have transferred their full property rights in conveying the lot."

The taking was simply not in existence until that time because as we also pointed out in our brief, this Court has held in Preseault that the existence of a permitting requirement in and of itself does not generally take property. One expects that the Government in good faith will allow a permit to be granted or will at least consider that permit fairly. And one further expects that in the event that a permit is denied, at the time of denial a litigant has the right to seek a just compensation remedy if the litigant can prove that there has been a taking."

      "speaker": "BURLING",
      "speech": "There are two answers to that, Your Honor, a theoretical one and a practical one to this case. Theoretically, in defining what background principles, I would suggest that we go back as far in time as before there was an existence of pervasive regulation. But that rather theoretical issue is one that this Court does not need to fully address because as we pointed out in our brief and as I said previously, as of the early 1960s there was absolutely no requirement for a litigant to obtain a permit to fill wetland. We also know in the century and a half before that that there was a right, not only to fill wetland but to fill tidelands which are those lands that are under water all the time."

      "speaker": "BURLING",
      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. They existed in 1985 because the imposition of a permitting requirement that was adopted in 1971, as I said earlier, does not effect the background principles of property law. It does not change the title. It simply requires a landowner to go through more of a permitting process. It requires a landowner to be more careful about what that landowner is trying to do.

      "speech": "But that's a different question. The ultimate question of the taking, it seems to me is separate from the question of what background principles are supposed to apply to define how you calculate the taking, and I suppose that if the background principle of filling wetland cannot be tampered with in effect by new wetland regulation then the background principle of being able to build the property line cannot be tampered with by a setback requirement. I mean, is that correct, so far as calculating the basis for a taking."

It did not have to do with the ISDS system and that was based on testimony that was in the record about the fact that there are nitrates and things that wash into this pond and the wetland itself is the mechanism that filters those nitrates out.

And if Lucas is seen as a pure valuelessness case then that would appear to settle the question. But there's also discussion in Lucas about what Justice Scalia called the deprivation fraction, and that would appear to require a more complex analysis than was required in Lucas where you had the finding of valuelessness from the court below as opposed to the finding from the courts below here of value.

It's such a silly result. There is not in the first case, because he hasn't yet sold off the rest of the one square mile, but if he sells off the rest of the one square mile, and makes the very same application, gets the very same result, then there's been a taking.

I'd like to focus a moment on the ripeness issues that the Rhode Island Supreme Court raised. And the first has to do, they found obviously that this case was unripe on two grounds, and the first ground was that there had been no application for the 74-unit subdivision. And that to us makes perfect sense because in the Rhode Island courts, unlike in this Court, the petitioner presented that 74-unit subdivision as a proposal and not as a claim of value for determining the size of the taking. And so that is very likely responsive to the argument made to that court that this was a proposal, and even if it was not responsive to that, I would argue, even if they were asserting a proposition of Rhode Island ripeness law that we want in Rhode Island to have people when they come and apply for a use or come and make a takings claim for a particular use to have applied for that same use at some point.

Somebody can insist on applying for apartment buildings, amusement parks, everything in the world in a residential development and be told no, over and over and over again.

In every other case, you have a prior regulation and a subsequent acquisition. And I think the reason is because they were looking at what the agency was actually doing. Were they obstructing?

We assert that he only put his most heavily burdened property into the administrative process and there was and could be no inquiry as to what value there was. And that to us seems a recipe for the prospect of manufacturing takings, if you can isolate the portion of your property that is not valuable or that is not buildable and apply only as to that and not show the regulators or discuss with the regulators property that you can perfectly well build on, you put them in an impossible situation."

And one way the State lets you know that you can and gives its assent is by establishing a harbor line. And when it establishes that harbor line then you can build out to it. But always, always, always -- there's one other point, which is that you do have a common law right to wharf out or build out into the wetlands as against your neighbor, as against the rest of the world.

      "speech": "I think that's incorrect. At least, in our view, the record in this case strongly supports the assertion that filling of wetlands has been a very rare practice in this part of Rhode Island. Now it's true that it wasn't until comparatively recently that statutory permit requirements were imposed as a prerequisite to the fill of wetlands. But the record doesn't suggest that extensive filling of wetlands has occurred. Now, my understanding is that even as to the dry land in this area it is only a short distance above the water table, and therefore even to construct a house on dry beach land you need fill, but it's not fill of wetlands and it doesn't have the same environmental consequences as wetlands fill. And the point we'd like to stress is that the requirements imposed most recently by the CRMP and informally by its predecessors are generally applicable limitations on the ways in which wetlands properties can be used and they secure a reciprocity of advantage to landowners in the vicinity. So it's easy to say on the one hand that the Coastal Resources Management Plan hurts Mr. Palazzolo in one sense, in that it limits the use he can make of the wetlands portion of his property, but at the same time the fact that those prohibitions are imposed on his neighbors as well tends to benefit Mr. Palazzolo insofar as his tract also includes an uplands area, because presumably the prevention of filling by neighbors preserves the quality of the environmental resources in the area, most notably Winnapaug Pond and in practical effect the restrictions function as a sort of density restriction that is --"

And the explication in the body of the petition of that third question presented made it clear that Mr. Palazzolo was not claiming the wetlands portion are a -- constitute a separate parcel and the value of that is zero. Rather the basis of the takings claim as it came to the Court in the cert petition was that the parcel as a whole had a value of only $200,000 and that that value was so small in comparison to the purported 3 million dollar figure as to amount to a total deprivation of economically beneficial use. I think even if the point hadn't been weighed, there would be strong arguments for regarding this all as a single parcel. It was bought together, it was platted together, and the State's appraiser testified, and his testimony was credited by the trier of fact, that the presence of wetland areas even if they couldn't be separately developed would enhance the value of a home constructed on the uplands area, in the sense that a house constructed on a 20-acre parcel is going to be more valuable than a house constructed on a two-acre plot, because you have open space, you have a feeling of privacy and seclusion. I think it's also important to recognize that the original investment in this property was something less than $13,000, that is -- I say something less because SGI purchased a larger parcel for $13,000 and partly in 1959 and partly in 1969 sold portions of it for prices that aren't revealed in the record. So if Mr. Palazzolo or his predecessor, SGI, put in $13,000 and now has something worth $200,000 he's hardly had anything taken from him."

Petitioner's appraiser, in arriving at the 3 million dollar figure, looked at a nearby tract, presumably on uplands, and said that lot sold for $125,000 and he said the lots that could be constructed out of wetlands are -- could be made comparable to that. And if you sold 74 of them at $125,000 each, you would come up with a figure of a little over 9 million dollars. He deducted the expenses that he thought would be incurred in actually doing the fill and came up with a net of 3 million --"

Now obviously that price was paid in an environment where wetlands development in this region is subject to substantial restrictions. So in effect what the appraiser was determining was, if Mr. Palazzolo could develop his property to the hilt and everybody else around him remained subject to extensive restrictions on development, his property would dramatically appreciate in value. Even if we assume that the appraiser was correct in that hypothesis, it can't form the basis of a takings claim.

It may be that in some cases we're dealing simply with a large parcel and we're looking at that time devaluation of that parcel. Some cases it may be that we're dealing, as here, with a situation where some of the land is carved out and you're told you can use some of it but the vast majority of that you cannot.

They're talking about the valley from a nice view. What we are saying is that nice view has been taken by the State. And so the true value of what the upland is, if you do not add in this attribution is probably significantly less than that, indeed in the trial transcript, in the testimony of Thomas Andolfo at pages 662 to -- 682 to 683 is where this $200,000 value comes from, it talks about a few dollars being spent to improve the road, and then primarily the rest of the value will come from this attribution of the remaining area."

Home sites that are very small as the record reflects. And if there are 18 acres of developable property on site, then indeed that should be looked at separately. But that is something I do not think this Court needs to fully determine, what -- what the situation would be in that hypothetical, because in this case we know that Mr. Palazzolo can make no use of his wetland, and we know that his -- the value of the upland should not be enough to simply take this case out of a determination of whether there has been economically viable use."
