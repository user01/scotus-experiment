      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Lindh versus Murphy, this Court held that chapter 153 was non-retroactive to cases pending at the time of AEDPA's enactment. In the general run of habeas cases, this is determined by the filing date of the application for habeas relief. This case will resolve a split between the five circuits that apply this rule to capital cases and the Ninth Circuit which, instead, looks to the date the pre-application motion for counsel was filed in a capital case. We believe that the five circuits are correct. Neither chapter 153 nor Lindh versus Murphy identifies the commencement event that triggers the application of chapter 153. In light of this, we must determine Congress' intent, and the first place to look is to the express terms of chapter 153 and, of course, AEDPA's purposes to expedite habeas cases and to provide greater deferential review to State -- State criminal convictions. Chapter 153 by its terms can only apply to a merits petition. It repeatedly contains express language, such as that contained in 2244(d), which is found at petitioner's appendix 185, which concerns the statute of limitations provisions and provides that the statute of limitations applies to the application for habeas relief. Similarly, the standard of review in 2254(d) at petitioner's appendix 191 --"

Is -- is there anything in chapter 153 that tells us that, no, we didn't mean the -- the -- a commencement of a habeas proceeding based on the filing of an application? We meant something earlier, i.e., the motion for -- for a request for appointment of counsel. And the answer to that is no. Simply no. There is nothing in chapter 153 that has anything to do with the pre-application proceeding. Those provisions, as is demonstrated by their terms and also the habeas corpus rules concerning chapter 2254 cases -- those only can apply -- expressly apply to applications for habeas relief.

So really the statute of limitations is virtually a non-issue in this situation. This case did -- the -- the -- any delays or long periods of times that were granted or anything didn't have anything to do with this case. There is no harm in this case. The only issue is that now, once this case was in the district court and in the Ninth Circuit, should it be subject to the deferential standards of review that AEDPA imposed, and the answer to that is yes.

It went through the district court. The district court agreed. It went to the Ninth Circuit in 2001 -- this was a 1984 killing. In -- in 2001, it was reversed by the Ninth Circuit, which did -- because it did not believe it was an AEDPA case, refused to apply the deferential standard of review, refused to apply the precedents of this Court, instead looked at its own -- its own cases, and reversed it. And this is -- you know, this is the most important -- a capital conviction in California is the most important cases -- some of the most important cases that that State issues.

First, it simply cannot be, as the State suggests, that after this Court found in McFarland that a capital case is commenced by the filing of a motion for counsel, that Congress then passed a new statute, intending it to be interpreted consistent with the dissent in this case. Congress must be presumed to have been informed by this Court's majority ruling in McFarland. The McFarland Court ruled that -- that Congress had permitted a capital proceeding to be initiated by the filing of a motion for counsel. That ruling was only 2 years before Congress made major revisions to the habeas corpus law in AEDPA.

And I agree with Justice Ginsburg that when a case is begun, you get a number, you're put on a docket. That is your case, and that is consistent with what this Court decided in McFarland.

However, if one looks at McFarland -- the majority decision, as well as Justice O'Connor's concurrence and dissent -- one sees that this Court made it very clear to Congress that if they meant something like petition or application, which are pretty much used synonymously, that they better put those words in because, in fact, the majority in this -- in -- of this Court refused to read that kind of language into McFarland, and that's part of how McFarland got decided. So very shortly thereafter, Congress wrote a law completely revising or, you know, substantially revising habeas corpus.

It depends on what the context is, and nothing -- nothing says that just because you -- you think that the case for one purpose, for the McFarland purpose, begins with the -- with the initial filings, for -- for all purposes it has to begin there. And what impresses me about this case is that I don't see what is gained by extending the inapplicability of AEDPA earlier than the filing of the habeas petition because the purpose of -- of the non-retroactivity provision is certainly not to cause somebody to be frustrated in actions that he took in reliance upon the prior law. And -- and a -- a habeas applicant could be frustrated in events that occur after the filing of his habeas petition. But all of the events prior to that filing that were covered by McFarland, they aren't covered by AEDPA anyway. AEDPA could not possibly affect those earlier events.

And if they wanted to make sure that it -- this statute would be interpreted in a way so that anyone that was in Federal court and that had vast proceedings take place, but that had not filed a petition yet, all they had to do was put the word petition in.

However, even if this Court is not convinced that Congress' awareness of McFarland is dispositive as to the meaning of case pending, Garceau had a case pending pre-AEDPA under this Court's definitions of what constitutes a case. Prior to AEDPA, Garceau had begun the process of challenging a State conviction and death sentence in part by filing in the district court a pleading detailing two fully exhausted claims of Federal constitutional violations. Garceau sought and received counsel in order to raise claims and challenge a State conviction and death sentence. He filed a document detailing the two claims I just mentioned with their factual and legal foundation which were ripe for adjudication. The district court made a determination, after hearings, that these claims presented viable grounds for habeas corpus relief. Under Hohn, we believe Garceau had a case pending.

And I'd like to make one other point, which is that there are -- it is a finite number of cases that were in the pipeline. It's a very unusual situation. In fact, you had to be post-State court determination and in Federal court and somewhere along in -- in the process in Federal court in order to be in this sort of bubble area. And I think --"

What happened was lead counsel in State court was unavailable to go forward and neither counsel that -- there were two counsel that participated at one point or another in State court, but neither participated in the whole case and neither was lead counsel.

    {
      "speaker": "COFFIN",
      "speech": "Well, there were a number of reasons for that. The first is that in State court, they -- there was neither discovery nor any evidentiary hearing. There was no mechanism -- there was very little money and there was no mechanism by which counsel could pull together an entire petition. And the district court agreed with that by giving counsel funds in Federal court. However, the district court set forth a schedule by which funds would be -- would be given, and those funds -- you did some investigation, you got -- you satisfied the district court, you got more funds. The last funds were not -- were not given to counsel until, I believe, the end of May, which was only about 4 weeks before the petition was filed. So that's one reason. The other reason is that counsel had to make a determination, under this Court's precedent, whether or not it would be a mistake not to file a full petition, the best petition that could possibly be made and because it would be possible that it might not have been able to be amended. And so --"

But it strikes me that -- that there -- this is sort of a mixed bag, that actually, in agreeing with you, we would probably be -- be harming most capital defendants, that is to say, your client will win on this retroactivity point which will eventually vanish. It's a -- it's a temporary problem. But the effect of our holding that -- that the habeas action for purposes of AEDPA commences with the -- the initial request for counsel is that all -- all of the transactions -- I mean, if -- if that provision that all factual determinations by the State court must be deemed to be correct, that means that AEDPA would, in the future, apply to those -- to those determinations. Whereas, if we came out the other way, until the habeas application is -- is applied, the strictures of AEDPA don't -- are -- are not applicable. So, you know, it's a -- it's -- it's not a -- not a win-win game, but it is for your client, I suppose."

And the point of my question was going to be let's assume that post- and pre-AEDPA, the standard of frivolity changes. Let's assume that. Or non-frivolity. Would you say that there is an expectation that's legitimate and that exists if there's a filing of a statement of non-frivolous issues pre-AEDPA and then before the complaint is filed -- before the petition is filed, AEDPA comes into effect?

This Court recognized that requirement, or at least a -- the discretionary nature of the State grant in McFarland. This isn't something that automatically happens. It's something that has to be deserved, and the way the local rules in -- in California work are that they have to file the statement -- a specification of non- frivolous claims. It doesn't ask for habeas relief. In this case, it stated 2 out of ultimately 28 claims that were ultimately raised. It -- it doesn't -- it's not labeled a petition.

Imagine on January 1, before AEDPA is passed, they file a petition -- no, not a petition -- a petition for a lawyer. And there's stay applications. And everything under the sun is litigated on that stay application, as it often is in a capital case. On June 1, once the stay was granted, they file their official habeas petition. On December 1, AEDPA is enacted. Now, the question is whether AEDPA will govern future proceedings in the case. And what we've said is it doesn't govern those future proceedings if, in fact, that petition had been filed on June 1. Right?"

In this case, what happened was that they're required under our local rules to present the Specification of Non-frivolous Issues. They have to at least put in one or two of the claims that are ultimately going to be raised. They didn't file anything. What they filed was a conclusory statement that there were constitutional claims that would be made. And we objected to that rightfully because they didn't satisfy our local rules. And so, it was that -- that was the sum total of our litigation related to the State proceedings. It certainly doesn't create -- nothing occurred in this case that would affect in any way --"

Then the State came in and said, we want you to vacate the stay. And then, the district court asked the petitioner to file the non- frivolous issues, et cetera, and so there was a considerable argument about whether the stay should be vacated or not vacated, which I guess eventually the petitioner won."

      "speaker": "LEAN",
      "speech": "That's correct. And that is really demonstrated -- also another a twist on that is that an 848 appointment, by its very terms -- if you look at 848(q)(9), I believe is the provision, it talks about how a -- how the appointment of counsel survives the habeas proceeding. It goes on. The appointment continues on into clemency proceedings and competency proceedings and other things. So clearly this is sort of an independent track. There's an appointment of counsel. It includes that habeas corpus proceeding under chapter 153, and then it survives and may go on into other areas. It also would survive the dismissal of a petition. We've had experiences in the Ninth Circuit where the petition that ultimately ends up being filed is deficient. It gets dismissed out. They go back into State court and they've allowed them to continue with that appointment of counsel. And so it continues on. It clearly is a separate phenomenon."

      "speaker": "LEAN",
      "speech": "No. In my experience with the Ninth Circuit, they're very liberal in that situation. It occurs frequently.

They're not considered successive."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

But if -- if the State decided that it simply was going to be less complacent at the stage at which there is a request for stay and said, okay, we're going -- we're going to start contesting the non-frivolous character of these -- these claims that are being raised, number one, wouldn't the State be able to do that if it thought it was worthwhile to spend its time doing that? And number two, if it did that, wouldn't the ultimate standard of persuasion that AEDPA applies have an effect on -- on the argument that you would make as to what was or was non-frivolous at that stage?"

The question -- all we would be looking at at that phase is whether there's enough to justify the stay. The -- AEDPA goes to the issue of whether the -- you know, what the State court adjudication of the claim was and whether it was a -- involved a reasonable application of Supreme Court precedent and an entirely different analysis. I don't believe that there was, a) any intent to affect that, or any actual effect whatsoever from changing the deference that's ultimately applied to a merits petition to have any effect whatsoever on that initial inquiry that a -- that our courts in California require in order to satisfy the stay requirement, or the --"
