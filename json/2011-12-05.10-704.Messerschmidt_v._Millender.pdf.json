      "speaker": "COATES",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Malley v. Briggs and United States v. Leon, this Court set forth a very high standard for denying qualified immunity in the civil context or suppressing evidence in the criminal context under circumstances where a police officer has procured a warrant that is subsequently determined to be invalid. Specifically, the Court held that the initial magistrate's determination is -- is entitled to great deference, and that you'll go behind that only in cases where the officer falsified information or omitted exculpatory information, where the affidavit was bare-bones, or there was some indication that the judicial officer did not perform the function, and then a catch-all provision, where the warrant was so lacking in indicia of probable cause that no reasonable officer could even submit it for a magistrate's determination. And specifically in Malley, the Court said it had to be the actions of an officer that was plainly incompetent or knowingly violating the law. This case arises from a Ninth Circuit decision that we submit does not apply the Court's standards, under circumstances where the officer submitted, far from a bare-bones affidavit, but a highly detailed, factual affidavit that we submit provided probable cause for the search or at least, under the Court's qualified immunity jurisprudence, a reasonable officer could believe that the warrant had probable cause."

Even if the officer is in good faith, according to the test we've set forth, if he's so stupid that -- that he -- he executes a warrant that no reasonable officer could think was correct, he's -- he's in the pot, right?"
    },

      "speaker": "COATES",

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
      "speech": "All right. Then let's go to the other two ways that I think you're asking us to overrule our precedent. The first is the using subjective information that a police officer knows but hasn't disclosed in the warrant. I'm having a little bit of difficulty understanding how an entire warrant regime that presumes that the magistrate has all pertinent information -- and that's why you would be let off the hook -- how you can excuse a police officer when he doesn't place that information in front of the magistrate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COATES",
      "speech": "The way that has generally come up has not been in the validity of the warrant for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, but in terms of qualified immunity for the officer or exclusion of the evidence under -- or not -- or nonsuppression, rather, under the good faith exception. And it's whether the officer, in light of the totality of the circumstances, might not have recognized that the warrant was deficient if the warrant otherwise isn't -- isn't bare-bones. And I think we -- Leon itself in footnote 23 incorporates the Harlow standard of totality of circumstances."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",

All it says is that this defendant is a member of a gang, but when the police officer is questioned, he's asked whether this crime at issue had any connection to his gang relationship, and the answer was no. So, how is the request in the warrant to search for all gang-related indicia anything more than the general warrant that our Founding Fathers in part passed the Fourth Amendment against?"

It's a domestic assault by a gang member on his girlfriend with a sawed-off shotgun in public, right after police officers that were there to protect her had left. So, it's not gang-related in that sense. But I don't think that the gang membership is irrelevant to the investigation in this case. You know, as we note, and I think it's fairly recognized, gang members have means to procure and use weapons beyond that of ordinary people."
    },

      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

That's essentially your position, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COATES",
      "speech": "No, it isn't, because it's always a fact-specific inquiry. The Court's made that clear in Illinois v. Gates and for qualified immunity in Anderson v. Creighton. We're --"

      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

    {
      "speaker": "COATES",

    },

      "speech": "Well, it depends on the circumstances of the crime that you are investigating. Here we have an assault, we have a domestic assault with indications that the gentleman intends to continue it. And, indeed, that's why the warrant is for all weapons, because it would make little sense to say you can go and you can find a sawed-off shotgun --"

      "speech": "I'm -- I'm on to the part about all gang-related activity, when the crime has nothing to do with the -- with the gang. Let's -- let's stick to that. Then guns is another issue. But this said warrant to search for any and all gang-related items?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COATES",
      "speech": "Correct, Your Honor. But the point is that's to be used to possibly tie Mr. Bowen to any weapon that was found. It's identification information. If they found, for example, the sawed-off shotgun there and his gang colors with his gang moniker, that would certainly help to tie him to that shotgun."
    },

And then the statement that Justice Sotomayor said, well, that's later on in a deposition. So -- so, if I were the magistrate sitting there and I read the -- the affidavit, I might think I did have cause, at least it's close maybe, but -- to allow them to search for all the guns in the house. I might think they all belonged to him. And, anyway, I might think he thought that this could be used to -- other guns could be used to go after her again.

And I do have to say that we're sitting here looking at 11 judges and, like, 6 attorneys have looked at this, and they've never brought that out separately. And now we're saying that should have jumped out to the officers separately.

And the first paragraph, which Justice Kagan supposes doesn't raise a problem -- and I'll engage that assumption -- it provides not only for searches of all firearms, but it provides, and we think legitimately, for searches of any receipts or paperwork showing the purchase, ownership, or possession of the handguns being sought. And so, if -- and paperwork certainly includes photographs, because if you find photographs of an individual carrying a particular firearm, that's good evidence. And so, photographic evidence is within the scope of the first paragraph, not just the second. And so, it does raise the question of whether the second paragraph increases the scope. The other point I'd raise in this respect is that, in the second paragraph itself, the anchor sentence in some respects in the second paragraph is the second sentence, which discusses not gang-related indicia in particular but articles of personal property tending to establish the identity of persons in control of the premise or premises, writ large. And note -- and that provision has not been seen to have a -- have a problem associated with it thus far. The district court thought it was okay. The court of appeals, at page 27a of the petition appendix, seemed to assume it was okay. And that's understandable because there are a legion of cases that support those sorts of provisions --"

Because the point is that in order to find that officers are liable in this situation, the officers would have to be so sure that probable cause is lacking that only a grossly incompetent magistrate could sign off on the probable cause assessment. So, it used gross incompetence with respect to the magistrate, which illustrates the degree to which the standard is heightened in this context. And in terms of whether good faith principles come into play in the qualified immunity context, what the Court said in Malley is that the same standard for objective -- of reasonableness that governs in the good faith context for suppression purposes also governs in the qualified immunity context under 1983. And so, I think there is room to import into the qualified immunity context these principles of good faith, like, for example, Mr. Chief Justice, the question of whether the officers in question asked superiors for their assessment of whether there's probable cause. And in Sheppard, which was a suppression case, but in Sheppard, at page 9 -- 8 and 9 of the opinion, the Court specifically made reference to the fact that the officer in that case had asked for a probable cause assessment --"

      "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",

But then the Court later says: \"In Leon\" -- and this is at page -- this is at page 345: \"In Leon, we stated that 'our objective faith' -- 'good faith inquiry is confined to the objectively ascertainable question of whether a reasonably well-trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the magistrate's authorization.'

He hasn't killed the girl yet, and one gun's as good as another. And he might well take one of those other guns and kill her. So, there's probable cause to believe that the guns that are in the house, or at least one could reasonably think so, would be used for a crime. That was his response. Then, as to whether they're likely to be in the house, well, we know this: We know he has a sawed-off shotgun, and we know he is a member of a gang, which is defined as a group of people engaged in definable criminal activity, creating an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. So, well, people like that have guns. And when -- where they live, there may well be other guns.

First of all, generally speaking, of course, if you can't rely on the magistrate as a -- you know, as a blanket rule that you're not immune, it's hard to understand why the fact that the deputy district attorney signed off on it would have essentially the same effect that the Court rejected in Malley, when it said, you know, there will be a limited set of circumstances where even if -- even if a magistrate issues a warrant, the officer will be liable. So, I don't think that -- I mean, the district attorney and the -- and the superior are on the same crime-fighting team as the -- as the -- as Detective Messerschmidt in this case. Also, we really -- we have no information about what transpired in these conversations with the deputy district attorney. We don't know whether the D.A. said to Detective Messerschmidt: Oh, you know, you're good; this is totally fine. Or whether she said: You know, you're pushing the envelope here, but we might just find a magistrate who will go along with it, so -- you know, so, see what you can get. And the other point is, of course, relying on your superiors and on the D.A. is a double-edged sword in many cases, because that -- in fact, that can establish or go a long way towards establishing Monell liability, if you establish that there's a pattern of superiors and of deputy district attorneys --"

I think that may be a question of damages as to whether you could think, oh, well, perhaps the police might have gotten a valid warrant and so forth. But -- so, I think, sure, it's possible to imagine that the police could have gotten a valid, narrow warrant limited to -- limited to search for the sawed-off shotgun, and -- and certainly not the gang-related activity, but they didn't.

And yet, the cases that you cite to us as suggesting what a reasonable police officer should know really are not cases that involve these facts at all. They're cases that state very broad general propositions about Fourth Amendment law. So, how can you get from those cases to what you're saying a particular police officer in a particular set of circumstances ought to know?"

The first line of cases says if the police have reason or have probable cause to look for a specific object or specific -- even a specific kind of object, that doesn't give them probable cause to look for the whole generic class of objects that are somewhat similar. The leading case on this in the Ninth Circuit is the Spilotro decision, but there are many cases coming both before and after that stand for that proposition. The -- the principle has been applied in many contexts. For example, if you think that somebody is committing fraud for years 1998 and 1999 and there are billing records, you can't -- you don't have probable cause to look for fraud, you know, for the entire records, billing records from 1950 to the present. If you think that -- if you see somebody run over somebody else in a green Nissan Sentra, you don't have probable cause to search for all vehicles including a red Ford -- a red Ford Explorer. This is really that principle in the context of firearms. And it -- and Detective Messerschmidt had the information that the case involved a black sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip.

And this -- I think this really the -- this point, that they went into the Millenders' house, searched the house from top to bottom, and seized the Millenders' -- Mrs. Millender's lawfully owned weapon really shows that this case is in the heartland of what the Fourth Amendment is concerned about. I mean, this is exactly the kind of case that the Framers were concerned about when they abolished the general warrant. This is the sort of case --"

When -- especially when you combine that with all the other information that Detective Messerschmidt actually obtained from the printouts of the databases which are in the JA, which in fact say that he hadn't been at the 120th Street address for several months and that his most recent address was 97th Street, where he lived with -- where he stayed with, at least sometimes, Shelly Kelly and gave it out as his address. So, that -- that is in the respects why we think that this is materially misleading. Of course, we were not allowed to appeal that determination, so that really only half of the case in that respect was before the court of appeals and is before this Court. Thank you very much."

      "speech": "With respect to the -- the hypothetical that Justice Alito postulated in terms of finding other weapons there, and Respondents' counsel to say, well, we might go on the plain view doctrine, I think these are circumstances in which we note that you want to encourage officers, when they can, not to -- not rely on exceptions to the warrant requirement. And here, if anything, the officers in an abundance of caution attempted to get a warrant, contemplating those precise circumstances. I don't think they should incur liability for -- for going to that extra step and that extra precaution. And, again, a step back from whether there's actually probable cause, but whether a reasonable officer could even believe that might be the case for purposes of sending it to a magistrate. And I think, under those circumstances, you want to encourage officers to seek a magistrate's determination and not try and rely on on-the-scene exceptions to the warrant requirement to try and justify seizing weapons under those circumstances. With respect to Justice Scalia's concern about the probable cause to seize all guns as opposed to guns belonging to Bowen -- and I think the notion is that Bowen, being a resident and that being established for purposes of this contention at this point, still down at district court, but it was assumed for purposes of the Ninth Circuit that he was a resident, that as a resident, that he would have access to that firearm. And I think that this was bolstered by the fact -- again, his status as a gang member. We cite the Chicago Housing Authority v. Rose case, which talks about the manner in which gang members often store and use weapons at family members' homes. I mean, it's an unfortunate part of the -- of the gang culture. So, it's not unreasonable for an officer to think there might be probable cause at the very least to seize any weapon found there, even if ultimately facts developed that it is in fact not Bowen's weapon. And this also goes to the indicia of gang membership and why it's reasonable even to ask, because that may be one of the means by which we could tie a particular weapon to Bowen depending upon what's found during the search. This is a very high standard as established by this Court, which is essentially plainly incompetent or knowingly violating the law. And this is an officer that has not hidden the ball with respect to what transpired between Bowen and Kelly. He submitted it to his superiors to look at; he submitted it to an attorney. And while that's not dispositive, I think those are objective facts that a reasonable officer could say, I've done this, this, and this; there's no reason for me to believe that I'm violating the law in sending it to a magistrate."
