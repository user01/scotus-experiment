There's an exception to the act, the scope of which is in dispute today. The respondent asserts that all contracts of employment are excluded from the coverage of the act. That simply cannot be correct. The act does not say that it excludes all contracts of employment. Section 1 excludes only certain kinds of employment contracts, the contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce. Beginning nearly 50 years ago, 11 courts of appeals have read that text in a uniform, consistent manner, finding it to create a narrow exclusion applicable only to those workers who are actually engaged in the movement of people or goods across State lines, and we contend that that's the only interpretation consistent with the text of the statute."

      "speech": "And the indications were that at least then Secretary of Commerce Hoover thought employees shouldn't be covered at all, and he presented language to the Congress which approved it, and yet you want us to say that Congress did intend to include for arbitration contracts of employment over which the jurisdiction was most questionable, and yet exclude it for those where the jurisdiction of Congress was clearest at the time, which seems a little odd to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAGLE",
      "speech": "Well, there are several points in response, Your Honor. First, the letter from Secretary Hoover was a letter submitted to the committee in 1923, written on the day that it was entered, and there was no further explanation. I would also submit that we need to look to the language of the coverage provision, section 2 of the act, and contrast that with the language contained in section 1 of the act. I acknowledge that Commerce Clause authority over seamen and railroad employees would have been clear, but I would also point -- bring to the Court's attention, of course, the fact that there were statutory mechanisms in place, and also the single item that we know most clearly is that the seamen as a group, through their representative, Mr. Bruce, have specifically asked that they be carved out. While it may be somewhat difficult to determine exactly what Congress' motive was, they were responding to a request from a constituency group to be carved out."

Why would we not do the same for this section 1?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAGLE",
      "speech": "Well, in Allied-Bruce, which is one of the cases upon which we would principally rely, that was an interpretation of section 2, the coverage, and certainly was making it clear that the Court recognized that Congress was acting to the full with respect to its Commerce Clause power. Section 1 is an exclusion. It is to be narrowly construed. I would submit that there is a general policy that whenever we have a statute which clearly enunciates a public policy of broad scope that any exclusion to that should be narrowly construed."

They are specific groups in a list. They certainly have something in common, that being that they are transportation workers, and I would also submit that it's inappropriate to read a statute to eliminate the reference to seamen and railroad employees. If reading it as respondent contends, it's essentially an exclusion for all contracts of employment of all workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce, and that's, as Judge Edwards said in the Cole v.

But I'm not -- I'm not expressing a view on that. Whatever the right thing is, we have people there on the board to protect them.

That act referred initially to engaged in, but then on two separate occasions had what we characterize as a temporal limitation. It said, while engaged in. It specifically limited the scope to less than the full commerce power, as would have been expressed by the term, engaged in, and in Shanks and in Behrens, and in several other cases, this Court expressly noted that whether workers were covered by the amended FELA or not, turned upon whether the injury they suffered occurred while they were engaged in. It didn't focus on the type of work they generally performed. It -- for instance, in Behrens, I believe, the worker was working on an interstate -- intrastate traffic. His job often included interstate traffic. He would be engaged in commerce, but because at the time he was hit by the locomotive he was engaged in solely intrastate work, the Court said that, given the temporal limitation of FELA, it doesn't apply. So those cases support our position. Shanks in particular supports our position because Shanks goes to -- the FELA law was very complicated. There were many, many cases coming before this Court trying to decide who is and who is not covered by the various limitations. Shanks goes through and summarizes the Supreme Court jurisprudence of the time under FELA and makes very clear that engaged in is as broad as it gets, because it includes not just those narrowly working on the trains as they were going down the tracks, but everyone whose job is sufficiently related as to be practically a part of the interstate commerce. So at the time, in 1925, engaged in was a term of art. It was a term of art that reached to the full scope of Congress' commerce power. That is to complete the answer as to -- actually, it doesn't quite complete the answer, because there are still some words that we have to address.

That is language without limitation, and instead of saying, any other class of workers in transportation, which is essentially what petitioner's argument would have the Court read section 1 to mean, commerce was a defined term of art.

I really don't think that that's what's going on here. I mean, what you're really asking us to do is to change the language of section 1 in light of the fact that we now know that Congress could have gone further than it chose to go in that language. I don't know any other case where we've done that. You're not asking us to simply give that language its modern, more expansive meaning. You're asking us to say, you know, in light of the fact that we now know that it's not just employees engaged in interstate commerce who can be covered. Had Congress known that then, they would have written a different provision and so, Supreme Court, why don't you rewrite it for Congress, because they surely would have put it this way if they had known then what we know now. Do you know any case where we've done that?"

Involving, which had never been used before in a commerce relationship and has never been used since, could not have meant anything more than engaged in, because engaged in was as far as it got. So to the extent there has been a rewriting -- and I'm not contending there's been a rewriting. I'm contending there's been an application under the modern interpretation of the Commerce Clause. As this Court in Terminex said, you have to look to see what Congress is trying to achieve. What were the purposes? And when the Court read, involved in --"

If, in fact, engaged in interstate commerce is something narrower and is no longer symmetrical, tough luck. Congress can amend it. But we don't go around rewriting it in order to preserve symmetry."

The concept is the word that I'm trying to convey to the Court, and the concept is the concept of ensuring that no contracts of employment that might be covered under Congress' commerce power would be covered. One provision should not be read dynamically, as this Court did in Terminex, while the other is read statically. There's no indication that Congress intended that. Congress didn't use the word, transportation. It had enacted numerous statutes by 1925 that had limited the scope to transportation, or to common carriers, or to common carriers by railroad. It had that language readily available to it had it intended the carve-out, but there is no gap between the section 2 coverage and the section 1 exclusion and, therefore, just as in 1925, all workers' contracts of employment were excluded, any other class of workers, the broadest possible language, so, too, we urge the Court to construe the statute that way now.

I would note, as Justice Scalia had pointed out, that this would lead to the anomalous result that a CEO of a multinational corporation who has an arbitration provision in his or her employment contract, that it would not be enforceable pursuant to the FAA. I would note that in Prima Paint, at note 7, the Court made reference -- albeit it in dicta the Court made reference to certain kinds of employment contracts being excluded under section 1, which is consistent with our view that it was not intended to cover the entire range of that which was covered. Ultimately, I would suggest that as the court of appeals have consistently held, the narrow reading of section 1 is the only reason which is based on and consistent with the text, that makes use of the full text and conforms with the principles of statutory construction, so that we don't read words to be meaningless and that we do apply the canon of ejusdem generis. As this Court noted in Allied-Bruce, and particularly in Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion there, there's value in uniformity and stability of the case law which has developed. Since Gilmer, untold number of agreements to arbitrate employment claims have been entered into in reliance, and I would suggest that Congress is certainly well aware of this case law development, has had the opportunity to correct it if they thought the Court had gotten it wrong, and they have declined to do so.
