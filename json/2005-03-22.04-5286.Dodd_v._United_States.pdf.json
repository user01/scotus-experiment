Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court today is presented with two strikingly different interpretations of when the 1-year period of limitation found in paragraph 6(3) of 28 U.S.C., section 2255 begins to run. If paragraph 6(3) is read in a manner that is consistent with both Congress' use of verb tense and this Court's decision in Tyler v. Cain, then the Government's interpretation of when the 1-year period begins to run is absurd because it reduces paragraph 6(3) to a near nullity. This is so because, as even the Government admits, retroactivity decisions almost always come more than a year after a decision of this Court initially recognizing a right."

That's exactly what happened here. And the Ross case that litigated the question of the retroactivity of Richardson, that was a case brought under paragraph 6(1). Mr. Ross was within a year of when his judgment of conviction became final, and -- and the issue of retroactivity was -- was litigated straight and up in that case. And what it appears that Congress intended was that very circumstance to happen in all cases, that the retroactivity of decisions of this Court be litigated in cases brought within a year of finality, and then once those decisions were made, then litigants under paragraph 6(3) would have the opportunity to file when a court of appeals issued a retroactivity ruling.

And so if you interpret the made retroactivity -- made retroactively applicable language in paragraph 6(3) in the way that this Court read the language in paragraph 8(2), such that the retroactivity decision has to be made before a motion can be filed, it becomes very complicated to do that if the 1-year period begins to run within initial -­"

So it's already a very small class of cases, and the Government's view makes it an even smaller class of cases. But that doesn't mean the statute doesn't work. It just means it doesn't work for a lot of people who are excluded from it."

The problem with the Government's reading is that they say that they are narrowly constricting the statute, but the procedural mechanism that they set up allows for a vast number of cases that would never fall within the statute of limitations to be filed and requires the court to deal with each and every one of those cases in the first instance. Whereas, my reading of statute has the benefit of allowing a -- a test case to proceed. Given the fact that there are very few number of these rights that are made retroactively applicable, it -- it makes more sense in terms of judicial resources to allow there to be this situation where is -- there is a test case -­"

The more appropriate course of action would probably be to find the motion at that point untimely because it does not fall within any of the -- it -- if it is outside the initial year from finality but doesn't fall within any of the other exceptions stated in paragraph 6, then it -- it would be untimely and the court could dismiss it as such. I mean, by doing so, if the court dismisses it, it could well count as a first motion so that any motion filed thereafter would be a second or successive motion. And this would be -- preclude litigants from filing prematurely and burdening the courts with premature filings until it is clear they have a cause of action. I mean, what's strange about the Government's reading of the statute is that they believe Congress intended for a limitations period to begin to run before the litigant had any right to relief. No one has a right to relief in the collateral proceeding until the right at issue has been made retroactively applicable to collateral cases. And so that this kind of disjoinder of the statute of limitations and the cause of action creates this problem where people will be -- feel compelled to file protective motions."

People would be filing things all over the place. They'll be waiting. That -- it's a mess. This stops that. What's worrying them is that the second habeas person, given Tyler, could never file, not even in that -- you know, not even in that -- in that really unusual situation where we're going to make it a collateral review.

Well, maybe one answer to that is, so what. The reason that cannot be dismissed, I think, that way is this. As has been pointed out here, we do not under our rules often make a new rule retroactive, but when we do under the conditions which we impose for that, it's -- it's one humdinger of a rule."

And those kinds of cases are very possibly, at least if the Court has made it clear that they're narrowing the -- the Court is narrowing the conduct that was thought to be criminal in construing a criminal statute, those are the kinds of cases that are likely to arise most often. In those kinds of cases, that is likely to be the kind of the thing the Court was talking about in Tyler against Cain. With respect to the other class of cases, which would -- the only other class of retroactive cases would be those that come within the second -- what used to be called the second Teague exception for bedrock principles that have the primacy or centrality of Gideon against Wainwright. Now, the Court has suggested -- it has said that it may be doubted that any such rules remain to -- to be discovered. But if there were, I think a court of -- a case of that level of centrality and primacy and importance, I think that this Court and other courts could take steps to decide whatever pending section 2255 motions they have or whatever ones could be filed by someone who still has their 1 year to go from date of finality of conviction to decide those quite quickly because that would be -­"

And if they had just said the date on which the right was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, I think there might have been some inference that they were not -- they were trying to extend that beyond cases that are retroactive under Teague, or perhaps someone might have read that and said, you know, Teague is no longer applicable. Now Congress has a new standard that it's enacted here. And I think Congress wanted make clear -- the people who drafted this -- that that was not what they were trying to do. And by saying made retroactive -- if it has been newly recognized and made retroactive to cases on collateral review, what they were plainly referring to was this Court's jurisprudence under Teague so that no one would think this deadline is supposed to somehow open the door to cases that would otherwise be barred by Teague."

When the -- for that -- that period of time the finality that is so important to the criminal law is -- does -- is suspended to a certain degree. People can litigate the issue. After that, the criminal law can go back to its retributive, deterrent purposes which can only be achieved if finality is recognized. I think, in particular, when you're talking about section 2255 motions, frequently the relief, if there is any, is going to be a new trial. And there's a particular cost, as the Court has recognized, of trying to retry somebody many, many years after an initial conviction. Sometimes it means, in effect, it's just an acquittal because you can't find the witnesses or you can no longer prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. And I think, therefore, Congress said, all right, well if there's a new right, that's a sufficiently exceptional circumstance, that we can suspend that finality for a brief period, but 1 year and that's all. These things shouldn't come out 10 years later or 15 years later or 20 years later. And that was the purpose, I think a perfectly reasonable purpose that Congress intended to serve here.

I'd like to start with the last point that Mr. Feldman made saying that there is only possible date under which the limitation period can run and -- and cautioning the Court about rewriting that date. What the Government neglects to mention is that it's asking this Court to rewrite the if clause by changing Congress' use of verb tense from a past tense to -- to something that could happen in the future. They want this Court to read that language contrary to Tyler, contrary to the use of verb tense and allow a district court to make a retroactivity decision at some time in the future in every case in which a motion is filed under paragraph 6(3). The second point I'd like to make is that the -­ in situations such as this that involve these kinds of important rights, interests in finality are at an ebb. These are the types of rights where someone may well be innocent of the crime for which they are incarcerated, that involve important rights that go to the accuracy of the underlying adjudication. It seems to me in these circumstances, there is -- it is a situation where Congress' need or -- or the need of the courts to enforce finality to keep people in jail are at their lowest point. These are very special rights and Congress went to the trouble of drafting and enacting paragraph 6(3) and paragraph 8(2) to protect these rights. And -- and I think the Court should read them as broadly as possible in order to protect those rights. Justice Scalia asked a question about the difference between newly recognized and initially recognized. I wanted to go back to that for a minute. There are circumstances where a -- let me see if I can get this right -- where a -- a right may be newly recognized but not yet initially recognized. And I would -- I would point the Court's attention -- the decision in Penry. In Penry v. Lynaugh, this Court stated that if there was an Eighth Amendment bar to the execution of mentally retarded individuals, that would be a new right that would be retroactively applicable to collateral cases. But then the Court declined to initially recognize the Eighth Amendment right. It wasn't until Atkins was decided that the Eighth Amendment right was initially recognized. And so --"

It also, as we've discussed, promotes judicial efficiency by eliminating from it frivolous motions because litigants would not file until it was clear that they actually had a right to collateral relief.
