      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Until three weeks ago, a sex offender who moved to a foreign country was not subject to any Federal registration requirement in the United States unless and until he returned to the United States. Below, the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that it is a Federal crime for a sex offender who moves to a foreign country to fail to ­­ to report that move. The Tenth Circuit was wrong for three overarching reasons. First, SORNA's text does not include a requirement to unregister. Second, SORNA's statutory history reveals that if Congress wanted to include a requirement to unregister, it would have done so just as it did before SORNA's enactment. And finally, a requirement to unregister is unnecessary because all 56 jurisdictions require sex offenders to unregister. Failure to do so is a violation of the jurisdiction's law and not Federal law."

So in your hypothetical, Justice Ginsburg, that individual has to unregister in Kansas under State law, and when he gets to Illinois, that's the Federal requirement to tell Illinois ­­ to register, to update the registration in Illinois because that's the jurisdiction where he resides.

What Congress was concerned about were missing sex offenders not at initial registration but when ­­ when the sex offender crossed State lines. So ­­ so by ­­ by requiring registration when you get to the jurisdiction, that ­­ that was the aim because that's when offenders were going missing. Now, the ­­ the departure jurisdiction would be a relationship between ­­ very much a relationship between the State and its citizens. And that ­­ that's played out if you think of a State sex offender who could live in Kansas. And if he were to have a Federal requirement to unregister in Kansas, that's actually not enforceable under SORNA because the travel has to come after or before he's ­­ he can't register. So if Mr. Nichols were a State sex offender and ­­ he's only committed an offense when he leaves Kansas. And that doesn't ­­ and that's a problem if we're saying that there's a Federal requirement to unregister in ­­ in the departure jurisdiction. Now, that may work for Federal offenders, but I think the idea is that there are Federalism concerns underlying SORNA.

One, Kansas retains on its record an inaccurate ­­ inaccurate information about the presence of a sex offender, which can have a lot of adverse consequences for a lot of people.

But my point is just that even though Congress has now addressed intended international travel and is expecting this to be reported in advance, as the title of the new statute indicates, and therefore, we wouldn't have to have this debate about whether this is a jurisdiction in which he is currently residing when he says, I intend to fly to the Philippines in 21 days.

But we also take Petitioner's concession that SORNA permits him to comply with the requirement to keep his registration current by going to the office in Kansas. And it's the same form. There's no doubt that it's possible for him to report the change in residence there. The form says, what is your address? And it has location start date and location end date, and those can be reported in advance or after the fact. Our position is just that when SORNA gets around to saying what it means to keep your registration information current, you have to do that in at least one place within three business days. And so we think that that means he could do it in Kansas even the day after he moved. If you disagree with that, we still think it also must mean at least, as Justice Alito was explaining, that he has to do it ­­ he has to comply with it by doing it while there still is one jurisdiction.

On the guidelines ­­ this is actually a direct quote ­­ the ­­ the ­­ according to the Department of Justice, \"A jurisdiction may require that changes in registration information be reported by registrants on a more stringent basis than the SORNA minimum standards. For example, requiring that changes of residence be reported before the sex offender moves rather than within three business days following the move.\" I mean, that's our position. I don't ­­ there are other portions in ­­ in the guidelines that direct jurisdictions to do this. But that ­­ but ­­ but what the ­­ what the guidelines say right there is ­­ is exactly what we say, that it ­­ it is a more stringent requirement. A few other points on the word \"current.\" I think if you ­­ if you look in the ­­ in the ­­ there's a provision on in­person verifications where there is requirements for a current photograph. That word clearly doesn't mean a future. And I think that's important to understand, that when you're talking about current information, it's not future information. I think Justice Kagan mentioned that a few times. On 1621 ­­ 16921(b)(3), again, that's ­­ that's language directed towards the jurisdictions. That's not a requirement for the offender, and that's how the former jurisdiction would be informed of the change. And if there are no other questions."
