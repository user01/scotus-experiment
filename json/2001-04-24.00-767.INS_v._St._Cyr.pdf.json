In this case, there are questions both of jurisdiction and of the merits of whether the Attorney General reasonably construed the act to conclude that petitioner in this case, oh, excuse me, respondent in this case is ineligible for discretionary relief under the repeal of 1182(c). I do want to make sure that I'm able to address the merits question, but I did have a few things that I wanted to address with respect to habeas corpus and the constitutional question here. One recent decision of this Court which I think is instructive on the question of when, what sorts of claims Congress must make a judicial forum available to, is the Court's decision two terms ago in American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee v. Reno in which the Court concluded that a constitutional claim of selective enforcement was not a judicially cognizable defense to a final order of removal, and in our view, if Congress could provide under the immigration laws that that sort of claim does not give right to a personal right to have a final order of removal set aside, then it follows a fortiori that Congress is not required to provide a judicial forum for a failure by the Attorney General to grant discretionary relief from removal that is purely statutory in form and particularly here where the objection is a non-constitutional objection to the failure to grant discretionary relief."

So Congress knew when to provide and preserve habeas corpus by name in this statute. It did it for that limited category and did it in no other and 1252(b)(9), the Zipper clause says that unless that it's specifically provided for in 1252, the review is not available. And if there could be any doubt as I mentioned even before IIRIRA, Congress in AEDPA had repealed the provision of the prior judicial review provision in Section 1105a(a)(10) that said that, provided for custody review of aliens of their deportation orders, that that was specifically eliminated.

      "speech": "Some courts said it was 2241. Some said it was 1105(a). Some courts didn't explain it and there was really no reason to. In our view, probably the best way to look at it is that 1105(a) preserved general habeas jurisdiction but you could look at 1105(a) as a specific grant, but in either event, it was an expressexception to what otherwise would have been an exclusive court of appeals jurisdiction which the legislative history we set out in our brief of the 61 Act shows that Congress was aware that habeas corpus would have been precluded if the statute had been permitted toward - to be worded that way. I also want to just briefly just touch on the notion that there is an unconstitutional suspension of habeas corpus if the Act operates in the way that we describe. And we think that that is clearly not correct. As this Court said in Felker, first of all, habeas corpus is available only insofar as it's provided by law. The courts are not free at large to address that question and the Court also reiterated in Felker that Congress, that it's essentially up to Congress, at least in the first instance, to exercise the judgment as to what the scope of the writ should be. Beyond that, in this context we think that's especially so because Congress has plenary power over immigration and has to be able to balance the need for access to the courts against, in this situation, what Congress saw to be a critical need for expeditious removal of criminal aliens who have already had a chance to test their criminal convictions. And finally, this Court has also said that Congress, deference is owed to Congress with respect to what due process procedures are appropriate for people generally, and again, that's something where deference we think is especially appropriate in the immigration context. For all of these reasons, we think Congress's judgment as to what sorts of things should be subject to review and what should not is due extraordinary deference by this, by this Court. And, in particular, we do not believe that Congress is required to provide for judicial review of a power that it has granted in the discretion of the Attorney General. This is not worded as a personal right of the alien, much less a personal right that is so fundamental that an alien should have access to courts, must have access to courts, to litigate it. Congress should not be put to the choice or put in the all or nothing position of granting discretionary powers to the Attorney General only at the cost of buying into a system of judicial review. As this Court said in AADC v. Reno, there are a number of discretionary determinations the Attorney General makes all the time with respect to whether to institute proceedings in the first place, whether to drop them along the way, whether to perhaps not execute the order of removal at the end of the day. Those are all discretionary and surely Congress is not required to provide for judicial review of that. Congress could conclude that this should be regarded in the same way."

So, the general thrust of the INS's enforcement efforts has been that but I certainly can't represent that it would never decline to remove someone. And the fact that in Accardi again an unexplained decision, this power may well once have been exercised should not prevent Congress from revisiting the question, revisiting the question of how discretionary relief should be thought of in saying for these purposes, it is constitutionally equivalent to the sort of discretion to institute proceedings in the first place that was unreviewable in AADC v.

If I could turn to the merits question of whether the Attorney General reasonably determined that the repeal of 1182(c) does not provide a basis for relief in this case. First of all, Congress specifically addressed the temporal applicability of all of Title III- A of IIRIRA of which this repeal is a part in Section 309 of the act. In 309(a) Congress specified what it called a Title III-A effective date, which was six months after IIRIRA was enacted, the delay obviously being put in place to allow the Attorney General to set up the new procedures. And then Congress, in 309(c) specified what is the operative event for applying that effective date."

It follows for people like the petitioner here, excuse me, the respondent here, who was put in removal proceedings after the Title III-A effective date that Congress intended that the Title III-A provisions would be applied and Congress enacted them as a package. As I mentioned, it eliminated deportation and exclusion and replaced it with removal. It repealed specifically 1182(c) and replaced it with cancellation of removal and it provided a new system of judicial review."

All right. Then I thought there'd be, what's gone is the Attorney General's discretion to deal with a sympathetic case. I've thought of one. A man, 40, 45 years old, had several children, the bread-earner of the family when, in his youth, once stole a pair of tennis shoes in Massachusetts - an aggravated felony under this statute, I think. Another time, on another occasion he stole some fruit from a passing train. All right? Now, what would seem to be the fair thing is at least you give him a shot so that we he was 20 years old and was going to steal the fruit from the train, he would know that that might mean deportation. And so, if we're going to assume Congress would have wanted to do the fair thing, why wouldn't we assume that at least it would give these people a shot so that the second time they know the likely consequence. Hence, we would apply this so that it applies to people whose second felony, aggravated felony like stealing a pair of tennis shows, I say slightly sarcastically but it's within that, I think. So that they'd at least know when they did that what's going to happen. Well, that's what I call the basic"

Is there any answer to that which suggests that the application of the way you're doing it, and indeed, I mean, you know, you go pick up people who are 60 years old. They have families. In their youth, they committed a few indiscretions and without any hope of mercy through any kind of discretion, they're gone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",

We think the statutory specification of an effective date and what events that effective date attaches to couldn't be clearer from looking at Section 309 of the Act. Congress identified the commencement of proceedings as the operative event and that makes sense because what cancellation of removal as it's now called is something that is a forgiveness of a ground of removal. It's something that only arises after the removal proceedings have been brought. So, we think the statutory answer is clear. With respect to fairness, it depends. Congress is looking at fairness from a broader perspective. It was looking at fairness from the perspective of a large number of criminal aliens in this country who had not obeyed our laws and it wanted to do something about it and Congress also, and importantly, concluded, made the judgment that the Executive Branch was granting far too many applications for discretionary relief under 1182(c). What Congress did here spoke to the Attorney General. It did not speak to any supposed rights of individual aliens. It was responding to what it regarded as excessive, and even referred to as abuse of the power that was granted by the Attorney General and they wanted to take that away, and they wanted to take that away now. The only effective way they could do that was to stop now. It wouldn't have made any sense to grandfather in people who may have committed crimes 10 or 20 years ago if what they wanted to do was to stop the Executive Branch from granting too many applications. At the close of our reply brief, we had citations to a colloquy between Senator Abraham and Senator Hatch and if you read that colloquy, it responds directly to your point, Justice Breyer. We don't set it out at length. But, importantly, in IIRIRA Congress actually drew back a little bit on the disqualification for discretionary relief. Under AEDPA the disqualification under 1182(c) for criminal aliens was broader. In IIRIRA for a permanent resident alien, Congress confined it to aggravated felony."

    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "He was referring to any crime that might have been a long time ago. Well, that's the important thing. But even then, what Congress, what he explained is that Congress made them eligible for cancellation of removal. He didn't say that Congress had somehow carried forward 1182(c) relief, which, as we point out, was expressly repealed in Section 304(b) of IIRIRA, and it was repealed because it had been replaced with the provision for the cancellation of removal which Congress intended to be applied as part of a package dealing with the institution of removal proceedings and then the cancellation of removal proceedings. Congress did not intend a hybrid sort of thing where discretionary relief from inadmissibility could somehow be applied in the proceeding where that didn't even make sense. But beyond the statutory answer to the question that we think Congress supplied in Section 309, this change in the law is not retroactive within the meaning of this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence and there are a variety of ways in which that could be understood but they all point in the same direction. And I would like to identify them because they're different ways of coming at them. First of all, this Court has said in Lopez-Mendoza and most recently again in the AADC case that the enforcement of the immigration laws is inherently prospective. It looks to the question of whether aliens will be permitted to remain in the United States in the future, whereas the Court said in AADC, deportation is necessary in order to bring to an end an ongoing violation of the law. And the reason why this is so is that part of the justification for Congress's plenary power over immigration is as this Court said in the Harisiades case, that Congress has to take into account the contemporaneous policies with respect to aliens. It has to decide at any particular moment in time who that is an alien in this country should be permitted to remain and who should not. Removal is not punishment or regulation of past conduct. It is a determination of who should be permitted to stay in the United States in the future. Another point that can be made about 1182(c) and Congress's repeal of it is that it operates much like the repeal of the authority to grant injunctive relief. When the Attorney General grants, under the prior law, granted 1182(c) relief, it was essentially an injunction against carrying out an order of deportation. Well, this Court has made clear than when Congress most recently in Miller v. French that when Congress changes the authority for granting prospective relief, that that change in the authority for granting prospective relief has to be applied by the Courts at the time that it is applied, that it arises. Another point is that this statute speaks to the power of the Attorney General not to any rights of the alien. This provision has never been worded as a right of the alien. It is again an act of grace or like a pardon as this Court has said. And this Court has made clear in its retroactivity jurisprudence and in Kansas v. Hendricks, for example, even in considering the ex post facto clause, that a statute is not retroactive simply because it arises in a case that is based on antecedent conduct. You have to look to see whether it is punishment or a penalty for the past conduct or whether what's going on is simply regulating someone's current ability and in Kansas v. Hendricks it was a current ability to be at large. The statute, though, was triggered on the basis of prior conviction."

And the guilty plea may very well have been entered on the ground that whatever the immigration consequence may be, it was a consequence that it was at least subject to mitigation by the exercise of discretion and the alien may very well have said, my best shot is with discretion and therefore I'm going to enter the plea on that basis.

      "speaker": "GUTTENTAG",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to address first a few remaining issues on the jurisdictional question before I turn to retroactivity. Again, an analogy to the exercise of the pardon power is simply not applicable here because that deals with the exercise of discretion, not with the question of legal eligibility. We raise no claim regarding the exercise of discretion. Our claim is regarding the Attorney General's decision to exclude from eligibility an entire class of individuals based on the Attorney General's decision to apply the new statute retroactively. That question of whether the new statute applies retroactively is a pure question of law and is one that's governed by the Landgraf principles and they're for courts to decide. By the very nature of the inquiry, it's an inquiry that must be decided by a court because it turns to what Congress intended pursuant to the default rules that this Court enunciated. Secondly, the American Arab case, we think, doesn't speak to the question here because the American Arab case dealt with whether claims could be raised in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals or whether an issue had to await resolution until there was a final order of deportation. There is a final order. This is not about the fragmentation of procedures. This is a question about whether any court at any time will be able to review this claim. And as we've indicated in our briefs, we believe it's appropriate to construe the statute to allow review in the Court of Appeals of this pure question of law. That does not lead to delay of proceedings or delay of removal; it's a pure question of law that needs to be interpreted as to what the statute means."

    {
      "speaker": "GUTTENTAG",
      "speech": "Yes, I think it's an extremely narrow group of cases, Your Honor, and that's really what this Court's decisions during the finality era when the only review that was in habeas corpus established that during that period of time there was a very limited class of claims that were reviewable and they went to either constitutional claims or claims that the Attorney General had misconstrued the statute. When there's an error of law going to the construction of the statute, that's reviewable."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Can you narrow that further, which you may not want to do? But this particular claim I was thinking of is like a claim of no jurisdiction because it's saying there's a provision of the statute, a whole big section, that just doesn't apply because the time hasn't come yet for it to apply."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTTENTAG",
      "speech": "It certainly is analogous in the sense that the Attorney General has decided what issue he has jurisdiction over and he's decided that he has no power to even consider these claims for relief. So, in that sense, it certainly goes to the Attorney General's determination of what the statute means and what class of cases he has jurisdiction to consider discretion and in that respect it's certainly similar. I just want to note that the final order continues to be contingent on the adjudication of discretionary relief. It has been like that since 1917. It continues to be like that. The new cancellation provision is still the same. The regulation that I referred to earlier is at 212.3, I believe it is, and there is also a regulation at 1229 under the regulations implementing 1229(b) of the statute. One goes to the 1182(c) form of relief that we're asserting here. The other one goes to the existing cancellation of relief that's available for people whose convictions occur after the effective date but it continues to be the case that these applications for relief have to be adjudicated before a final order of deportation can be entered. And I want to go back to the Accardi case for another moment because it is the case that Accardi was decided by this Court in the term immediately following the Heikkila decision and in Heikkila the court went back and reviewed the entire sweep of decisions that this court had decided in relation to review of deportation orders during the time when the review was extremely limited and was limited to that that was available in habeas corpus and Heikkila reviewed all of that and it did it in detail and at the conclusion of that review, it said that the only scrutiny that was available was that which was required by the Constitution and the very next year this Court looked at the Accardi claim and in that context held that the claim raised there, a claim regarding discretionary relief, was reviewable and the dissent went back and cited the very same case that the court in Heikkila had said restricted review to the minimum, the Ecku case, and said that's the scope of review that we think is appropriate and habeas should not cover that claim and the Court rejected that and exercised jurisdiction over the claim. So, Heikkila and Accardi together, I think, establish that this claim is reviewable if it falls within that and it clearly does. The fact that Congress could --"

      "speaker": "GUTTENTAG",
      "speech": "Yes, it was, Your Honor. It was a decision of this Court and specifically rejecting the dissent's view of the scope of habeas corpus. It was a five to four decision. But in any event, it certainly demonstrates the profound constitutional question that would arise if this statute were construed to bar review of the claims that have historically been reviewed and there is a long series of courts of appeals decisions reviewing precisely the same kinds of legal eligibility claims. We cite those in our brief in footnote 10, I believe it is, so that it was not there was a unique circumstance where legal eligibility claims in relation to discretionary relief reached the courts. It's just that they didn't reach this Court until the Accardi case. Now, I do want to recognize Congress could --"

      "speaker": "GUTTENTAG",
      "speech": "Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor. I'm not aware of any where the court said that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the kind of claim that's presented here. Now, it is true that Congress could change the eligibility criteria and Congress could eliminate discretionary relief. We don't dispute that. It's our contention Congress hasn't done that and the availability of discretionary relief has to be based on what the statute says. And the statute has to be interpreted in light of this Court's decisions in Landgraf and other decisions as to whether the new statute eliminates relief retroactively or not. But that question is a legal question that the Court must decide. If Congress were to change the statute, that would be a different situation and in terms of the general principle of Chenery and administrative law, the Attorney General has not said I would adopt a general rule denying eligibility to everyone. He hasn't done that and there's no reason to believe that he would. Historically, fifty percent of the applicants received the relief if they were eligible."
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "GUTTENTAG",
      "speech": "That may be so, Your Honor, and that's what Congress did prospectively. We don't believe it did it retroactively and there's no reason to believe that the Attorney General, if he understood that he had the authority, would apply the new statute retroactively to bar relief to the most compelling cases. The very fact of applying this retroactively means that the kinds of individuals who are the most qualified for the relief are those who are rendered ineligible. A person, and this is, there are numerous examples set forth in one of the green briefs from the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, numerous individuals who committed offenses 20, 15, 10 years ago, minor offenses - theft of a car radio, a single drug offense for which a person received only probation, a theft offense."

    {
      "speaker": "GUTTENTAG",
      "speech": "They are now because Congress explicitly rendered them aggravated felonies by specific legislation specifically saying that this applies retroactively to old convictions. What Congress did not do, and we think it's a very different inquiry, it did not say that the eligibility for relief that that is eliminated retroactively. And in our view that's a significant distinction because Congress may and clearly did want to sweep a wide range of convictions into the new procedures. But it did not say that it wanted to eliminate relief particularly for those individuals whose offenses occurred so long ago."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTTENTAG",
      "speech": "Well, I would note that that occurred after the legislation was passed. So, to the extent that it says anything about it, and I don't know that it's relevant given that that colloquy occurred after the statute passed, but what's important is to look at what the statute indicates. And we believe you can work your way through the incredibly detailed and nuanced provisions in great detail and never find anything that says the eligibility for relief is repealed as to convictions that preceded this date. There is nothing there. The only thing that's there is an effective date that says that the new statute goes into effect on a certain date, including the repeal of section 1182(c). We recognize that and there's a provision that governs transitional rule cases and that says that those cases that are already in the pipeline shall continue to be governed by the old rules. But what this Court said repeatedly in both the Martin v. Hadix and in Lindh v. Murphy, and I'm reading from page 22 of our brief and quoting from the case, the only thing that's sufficient is an unambiguous directive or expressed command that the statute is to be applied retroactively. Language is so clear that it can sustain only one interpretation. There is no language in IIRIRA that can sustain only one interpretation to apply this retroactively. What the statute does is say that new cases will be governed by new rules. We understand that but it doesn't say that the eligibility for --"

And presumably it means the cases initiated after that time will be governed by new rules. But what Lindh said is that even when a new statute goes into effect, in even language, it says a new statute shall apply to new cases. And that's at best an inference to be drawn from the 309 language, because it doesn't say it directly. But even if that inference could be drawn, what this Court said in Lindh is that inference is not in, or cautioned that that inference in and of itself is not sufficient to infer a retroactive effect.

It doesn't mean that Congress doesn't have the power but it must do it explicitly. And, again, as I say, I don't think that there's anything in this statute, the various provisions, there is not a specific provision that says that even though the new definition of aggravated felony sweeps very broadly, we acknowledge that and we recognize that.

Look not to what the individual relied on in any sort of sense that we're talking about right now but rather whether it attaches new legal consequences. If it does that in the criminal context, it violates the ex post facto. If it does in the civil context, Congress has to be clear to achieve that effect and here because of the circumstances in which this applies it is particularly evident what the new legal consequences are."

      "speaker": "GUTTENTAG",
      "speech": "Right, that's certainly one of the elements. And it's not analogous to an injunction because this is not an ongoing prohibition against deportation. And that's, this is a one time negating the immigration consequences of a prior criminal conviction. That's what the waiver does. It is not on ongoing injunction against deportation and that also distinguishes this circumstance from the other cases that the government was speaking about that were discussed in AADC - prosecutorial discretion, an after the fact decision by the Attorney General not to actually implement the deportation or something like that. Those are discretionary acts and we recognize that. And those are not in the same category as this particular form of relief from deportation which has been in the statute since 1917 and upon which the final order of deportation is contingent. So, deferred action, and prosecutorial discretion, those other kinds of things are very different and that might be a unilateral hope but eligibility for a waiver of deportation is not. I believe that the question this Court faces is whether a pure question of law decided by the Attorney General that will determine whether deportation becomes mandatory for persons who committed offenses many, many years ago at a time when the eligibility for relief was in the law and their likelihood of receiving it was at least fifty-fifty, whether that pure question is reviewable in any court. The Attorney General has decided that he lacks all authority, not because he doesn't want to grant relief, not because he thinks it might not be appropriate in many, many cases but because the Attorney General determined that he lacks the statutory authority because Congress took it away from it. We believe that legal ruling is wrong and that there is nothing in the statute that manifests the clear and unambiguous intent that this Court has repeatedly held in the retroactivity context is mandatory to impose those kinds of drastic new legal consequences on long time legal permanent residents who have made their lives, who have established their families, and who have done nothing wrong but that one offense, one time in the past and ever since complied with the law and are now swept up in this change and subject to mandatory deportation."

      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Guttentag. Mr. Kneedler, you have one minute remaining. MR. KNEEDLER Yes, with respect to the cases that I would rely on for nonretroactivity, Justice Stevens, I would mention Kansas v. Hendricks where the Court said there was no ex post facto violation because the act wasn't retroactive even though it operated. One of the triggers was a prior conviction, but it looked to current and future of status. Also, the Cox case mentioned in Landgraf itself gives a description of some such cases. With respect to attaching new legal consequences, that has to be proximate legal consequences in the sense of the statute like Title VII itself imposing penalties on prior conduct. The immigration laws do not regulate and penalize prior conduct. They look to someone's current status and decide whether he shall remain in the United States. There's no pre-existing right to remain in the United States so a new ground of removal does not interfere with any pre-existing rights. In particular, there was no right to expect to be granted relief from deportation. So, even if a new ground, substantive ground, for removal would be retroactive, and this Court's opinions would refute that, certainly taking away a discretionary power in the Attorney General to grant relief in the future is in no way retroactive. We think this case comes down to a question of deference to the Attorney General under this Court's decision in Aguirre and Aguirre and Chevron and the Attorney General has reasonably construed the act not to allow discretionary relief. With respect to jurisdiction, Congress was not required to recognize this form of relief as the sort of fundamental personal right that habeas has to be available for."
