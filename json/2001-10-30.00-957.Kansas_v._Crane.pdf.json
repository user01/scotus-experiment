      "speaker": "STOVALL",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court: The Kansas Supreme Court has erroneously read this Court's decision in Kansas v. Hendricks as requiring a showing that a potentially sexually violent predator cannot control his behavior and that such a requirement has supplemented the two requisites for civil commitment that this Court has approved in and since the Addington case. Those two requirements, as you know, are mental illness and dangerousness. The volitional impairment that the Kansas Supreme Court has ruled was constitutionally required for civil commitment ignores the fact that psychological disorders, such as antisocial personality, can impair an individual in behavior, cognitive, perceptual, emotional, and even intellectual capacities. This Court has never indicated that there's anything constitutionally significant about a volitional impairment."

I don't think that what was done by the court below was totally off the wall in light of what was said in our prior cases. What if there is some element but perhaps not to that extent? How would you draw the line?"

      "speaker": "STOVALL",

      "speech": "I don't believe psychiatrists can tell us what it is that -- what kind of impairment Mr. Crane has. They're not -- the -- the literature will say that psychiatrists can't tell whether or not Justice Scalia was acting because he's hallucinating or because it's some other volitional impairment, if it's an irresistible impulse, if you will, whether it's emotional, perceptual, intellectual. They can't tell. They can't get in somebody's mind. And what they have to do then is simply rely on what the individual says. Mr. Crane told this -- the court below -- he told the experts below, rather. He didn't testify. He told the experts below that he could control his behavior. Mr. Hendricks had testimony that you refer to in the Hendricks decision that said he couldn't control his behavior. So, because the psychiatrist can't make a determination objectively, we're left with a potential predator telling us who applies -- who's eligible for this law and who isn't. The other point I would make to this Court is that Mr. Hendricks said I can't control my urge to molest children. But he could. He never molested little children in front of their parents, never in front of his wife, never in front of law enforcement --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But then, it seems to me, that we're back to square one. I -- one reading of Hendricks -- and tell me if this is wrong -- is that we want to find some measure of determining how dangerous this person is to society because that's in the statute. And because many criminals are -- have personality disorders and are dangerous to society, we want to narrow it somewhat. So, we -- so the Court added this volitional control aspect. Is that a fair reading of Hendricks?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STOVALL",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I don't believe it is because Mr. Hendricks, in particular, didn't suffer from a personality disorder. He had what is classified under the Kansas statute as an abnormality mentally and that was being pedophilia. The Kansas statute specifically says there are two kinds of impairment that we could look at. They're emotional as well as volitional."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "STOVALL",
      "speech": "Right. They have to have some sort of impairment in order to have the diagnosis of a personality disorder. That's part and parcel of a diagnosis of the DSM. But it would be our position it's not limited to volitional control, but could be that laundry list of emotional capacity -- emotional impairment, which is even what the Kansas statute contemplates for mental --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "-- the DSM that you're mentioning, if you look at the definition of personality disorder and they say pick three out of a list of seven, you could pick out habitually doesn't work, doesn't pay debts, is reckless, irritable. That's something -- I mean, it's considerably less than what is defined as an abnormality like pedophilia. There are a lot of ordinary people who would fit that description."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STOVALL",
      "speech": "What -- what I want to be able to do today, Your Honors, is to convince you that actually that's not true, that an antisocial personality disorder is a severe mental pathology that really does give us sociopaths and psychopaths that cannot conform to our rules. There are a lot of individuals in this country and certainly in our prisons that break the law, and they may suffer from antisocial personality traits, but that's entirely separate and distinct from having a full-blown diagnosis of an antisocial personality disorder."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, your statute itself, when you're talking about a sexually violent predator, you say mental abnormality or personality disorder, which makes the person likely to engage in repeat acts of sexual violence. So, that certainly qualifies the personality disorder. It's not any personality disorder that would do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STOVALL",
      "speech": "That's exactly right, Your Honor. The point is that it's a severe diagnosis, for one thing, and then secondly, it has to tie directly to the kind of dangerous behavior that we believe these individuals will commit if they don't have the treatment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And I take it what your -- what your statute is trying to get at is -- is something more than mere repetitive conduct, mere recidivism. Is that fair to say?"

      "speaker": "STOVALL",
      "speech": "Absolutely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And -- and is the element that distinguishes this kind of behavior from mere repetitiveness some element of lack of control, not necessarily volitional control, but some element of lack of control, perhaps lack of control resulting from delusion, perceptual difficulties and so on, but -- but some -- some aspect of the personality that -- that gives that individual a -- a lesser chance of controlling behavior in -- in a way that avoids committing crimes. Is that fair to say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STOVALL",
      "speech": "With a slight exception. It's the dangerousness, the risk of recidivism tied to a mental disorder. To get the diagnosis of a mental disorder, there will be an impairment that's part and parcel of that."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I guess what I'm -- I guess what I'm getting at is it -- it seems sensible to call somebody who is just an habitual offender at some dangerous crime or serious crime dangerous. And I take it that what the Kansas statute and other statutes like it is trying to get at, by speaking of mental disorder or personality disorder, is some extra element beyond the mere probability of doing an act which society has called dangerous. And I think -- I think --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STOVALL",
      "speech": "That's 100 percent accurate. That's exactly where we are, Your Honor. And we think that having that mental abnormality or mental disorder gets us away from just predicting who's going to be dangerous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But what is that -- what is that? That's exactly the issue. What is it that you -- how -- what form of words will you use to define what counts as a mental disorder that will distinguish the people whom you want to civilly commit from your mine-run recidivist criminal?"

      "speaker": "STOVALL",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but what -- that's the problem in the case. The problem is what counts as a mental disorder. And the Kansas court thought what counts as a mental disorder is a total inability to control behavior."

      "speech": "No, no. What is the definition of the word, mental disorder, that appears in the statute? If a person were to say every person who commits a crime, 15 times running, is a sociopath and thereby falls within DSM-IV, you're not going to permit that. You want to distinguish that sociopath from a person who is really mentally disordered and he isn't your mine-run criminal. All right. Give me the form of words that will do it."

While I acknowledge the expert said 75 percent suffers from that in the deposition, he wasn't -- he certainly didn't quote empirical studies to demonstrate that. I would suggest that probably 90-95 percent of the prison population suffer from antisocial personality traits, but that's different than a disorder. The antisocial personality disorder, psychopaths and sexual -- psychopaths and sociopaths with actual diagnosis -- and Ted Bundy is the best example of that. These are really serious individuals not 75 percent of the population."

In other words, let me put the question this way. Under -- under the rule you want us to adopt in which, as you put it, there is no third element, why aren't you free to go after, let's say, every second offender of a sexual crime at the time of release and say, this person is dangerous within -- sufficiently dangerous within the meaning of the statute to -- to commit here? Now, you're not claiming you can do that, but I want to know what it is that you have to prove that stands in the way of your being able to do that."

The -- the Sexual Predator Act is and should be available for individuals such as your hypothetical, individuals who, because of some psychosis or hallucinations, have in effect lost their ability to control their behavior as well, although perhaps through some better recognized form. There is -- there are specific subsections of the Kansas Sexual Predator Act that would pull those people in for a commitment proceeding even though they don't go forward -- forward with a trial or if they've been found not guilty by reason of insanity.

Louisiana. It seized upon this additional element which separated and distinguished Mr. Hendricks from the larger class of just garden variety recidivists. It held that given that limiting factor --"

      "speech": "The -- I think the exact language of the Kansas statute, or at least of Mr. Hendricks -- I'm sorry. The opinion of Mr. Hendricks was that he admitted that he was unable to control his behavior. The only way he himself could be sure he would never offend again was for him to die."

To show utter impossibility to control behavior would be very difficult. That's -- that's what it said. Now -- now, you equate that difficulty or if not impossibility to control behavior with volitional impairment. Why do you -- why do you equate that, as I think the Kansas Supreme Court did? They -- they seemed to say that if there's no volitional impairment, there cannot be this difficulty or impossibility of controlling behavior. But that doesn't seem to me to be true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONHAM",

      "speech": "That's right. In Hendricks it happened to be a volitional impairment. But why do you assert that that is the only reason for which one can say a person is unable to control his behavior? Why isn't delusion a reason why a person can't control his behavior? He doesn't know what he's confronted with."

      "speaker": "DONHAM",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I'm not trying to limit the -- what a psychiatrist or a psychologist might be able to say affects the ability of an individual to conform his behavior to society's requirements. I'm not standing here today as a psychiatrist or a psychologist. It's a murky subject at best, and even those who work in it disagree. The principal distinction that I take from the Hendricks decision is that Mr. Hendricks could not have been constitutionally involuntarily committed absent that additional element that set him apart from others who simply behave out of clear choice because they lack any respect or moral value."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I would have thought, really, that that is not what we limited it to in Hendricks, that a delusional lack of control would be entirely sufficient constitutionally as -- as it relates to a lack of control, that it could be volitional or delusional, that the Kansas court went too far in requiring only volitional as a constitutional standard."

      "speaker": "DONHAM",
      "speech": "Your Honor, to the first part of your question, the only available argument that we could have made, the only conceivable jury instruction that would have been consistent with the contradictory evidence at trial and this Court's opinion in Hendricks was a -- a demand for a jury instruction, requiring the jury to find that it was his mental abnormality or his personality disorder that made him be likely to re-offend because it interfered with his ability to control his behavior."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So, what are the words that you want there? That is, imagine I'm talking about the set of people who are very dangerous. Imagine I'm talking about the set of people who are very dangerous because of a mental problem. In defining mental problem, we could have one subset that has a cognitive disorder well beyond the normal person, including the normal prisoner. We could have a set of people who have an emotional disorder well beyond what the ordinary prisoner recidivist has, and we could be talking about what the Kansas Supreme Court thought it was talking about in this case, the set of people who arguably have a volitional disorder. In respect to that, it sounded to me, if that's the subject of this case, that the Kansas court used the word cannot control, whereas our Court used the word difficult, if not impossible, to control. The only argument here being if there is some difference between those two, and I would think there is. But how should we put that in your opinion? Would it satisfy you if we said this case is about volitional disorders, and there the Constitution permits us to take a dangerous person and commit him civilly if his ability to control his behavior is significantly, a lot, quite a lot less than the ordinary person, including the ordinary prisoner sentenced in a -- in a penitentiary? How do you want -- in other words, I'm looking for the proper standard. Cannot sounds too tough. Difficult, if not impossible, maybe that's all right. But that's caused confusion. So, what's your standard?"

      "speaker": "DONHAM",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I know the State has touted the -- the descriptive adjective adequate control. I'm not sure if I know how to answer that. I would think that if you perform the criminal act, your control was not adequate. And so, it would seem that what the medical personnel are going to have to end up testifying and what eventually will be a question for the jury to decide is whether or not, given the opportunity and the chance for success at committing a criminal act, this individual chose to do that as an exercise of his or her free will or whether or not some overriding mental condition compelled them to act or disabled their capacity to refrain from acting."

I mean, we didn't take this case to decide whether the jury instruction was right under the statute or not. You don't challenge the statute. You think the statute is fine. It's just a bad jury instruction that occurred?"

      "speaker": "DONHAM",

      "speaker": "DONHAM",

This Court in Hendricks reinforced the notion that the Kansas act is constitutional because there did exist, at least with Mr. Hendricks, an additional element that because of that, because of his mental illness, he was likely to offend. The State -- or the Kansas Supreme Court was presented simply the fact pattern in Mr. Crane's case, and -- and that fact pattern was essentially -- or at least the State's position was we don't have to prove any kind of additional element whatsoever."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, they have to prove the causality. You're saying they don't have to prove causality. I mean, the way the statute reads is: who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in repeat acts of sexual violence. It's not just that he's likely to -- to commit future acts of sexual violence, but it also must be shown that the reason he's likely to do it is because that is caused by a mental abnormality or personality disorder. I mean, it seems to me, the statute says exactly what you think it ought to say, and you're just -- you're now complaining about the jury instruction?"

      "speaker": "DONHAM",

What the State presented to the jury, through all four of its expert witnesses, is that Mr. Crane satisfied the definition of a sexually violent predator because of his prior repetitive history of criminal offenses. Their own expert, Dr. Mabugat, even testified on the stand that if -- that in satisfying this definition, if the jurors only take his current mental status, coupled with his instant offense for the aggravated sexual battery, he's not a sexually violent predator. Dr. Mabugat went on to testify --"

Wasn't that the basis of the holding? And you're saying the Kansas statute is not unconstitutional. I mean, the whole basis for the Kansas Supreme Court thinking that the jury instruction, which followed the statute, was unconstitutional was, of course, that the statute was unconstitutional.

No doubt an individual who has certain designs to commit an act may exercise at times some degree of control over his or her behavior. The -- the essential element in these involuntary commitment statutes that must be kept in mind is, number one, they're -- they're civil. They're not -- they're not criminal. Number two, it's to commit the person to a mental hospital for treatment of the mental disease or defect, and this mental disease or defect must be significant enough to warrant depriving this person of their liberty."

By taking the particular fact pattern of Mr. Crane for which the only available and the only reasonable qualifying mental defect would have been the inability to control behavior and saying that it's now required for all persons, what the Kansas Supreme Court did was effectively cut off, I think unfairly, the ability of the State to incapacitate people who have other type of significant mental disorders such as Justice Scalia has pointed out, the hallucinations, the psychoses.

It's a significant problem because were talking about depriving people of their liberty, and we're -- we're basing it on the testimony of people who don't fully understand their field of expertise at times, which is why this Court should set a high benchmark to preclude the inadvertent commitment of someone who really shouldn't have gone to a mental hospital. I'm particularly distressed over the use of an antisocial personality disorder in that it is -- it is given simply to someone who has a history of offenses. So, that history of offenses provides the basis for the diagnosis, and it provides the basis for the prediction of future dangerousness. In effect, the State seeks to involuntarily commit someone because they have a long prior criminal history. My time is almost up. If there are no more questions."
