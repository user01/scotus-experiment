This case arises in the energy system where five subsidiaries provide retail service in four different States, where FERC has found that Entergy's cost allocations generally can't affect its net revenues and where FERC has thus approved a tariff that gives Entergy authority to calculate the inter-company equalization payments that allocate costs with a FERC complaint as the sole remedy if the rates and allocations are believed to be unlawful.

And in fact, the Louisiana commission here brought a complaint for the period ending in August of 1997, and FERC denied relief on the ground that although the tariff didn't authorize it, it was just and -- nonetheless just and reasonable for Entergy to calculate equalization payments by including certain units that were in extended reserve status because FERC found that those units benefited Louisiana and the entire system."

And the point I was trying to make to Justice Ginsburg is it -- when that procedure is followed, all legitimate interests are protected because if FERC agrees and orders a refund, it will be -- it can then be flowed through by the Louisiana Commission to the retail ratepayers. Conversely, under their procedure in which they can disallow costs pending a FERC determination on the precise -- on the precise issue, you have exactly the -- the interference with commerce that the Federal Power Act was designed to prevent. You've got duplicative litigation of this issue. Here in -- could be in five different retail ratemaking bodies. And the effect can be a trapping of costs that we never get back because if FERC -- you know, they -- they trap the costs pending the FERC order. FERC then says -- reviews it and says what we did was fine, just and reasonable. Then obviously FERC doesn't do anything at the wholesale level. In the meantime, our costs have been trapped at the retail level, and we can't get the money back under the general rule barring retroactive ratemaking unless an exception were somehow made to that rule."

So in circumstances where a FERC tariff provides a choice to the -- to the retail utility, which was the situation in the Pike County case, then -- then the -- the State commission can find that it was imprudent to exercise the choice in one fashion or another. But the point here is there was no choice. The equalization payment bound the -- bound ELI unless and until it was found to be unlawful by -- by FERC. So this is a situation where under the filed rate doctrine and under this Court's decisions in MP&L and Nantahala, the -- the State commission was required to treat the resulting expense as a retail -- as a just and reasonable expense and pass it through to retail ratepayers unless and until FERC ordered otherwise. There's obviously a range of other issues that aren't -- aren't governed by FERC rate schedules at all, as to which State utility commissions can examine the reasonableness of the decisions of the -- of the retail body.

That's an issue exclusively for FERC because, as I pointed out before, if the rate is believed to be too high, under the tariff, the -- the only remedy the operating company would have would be to go to FERC and -- and complain, and the operating company has -- has no -- no right to refuse to make a payment on the ground that there's an allegation that the equalization formula was improperly implied. But as I -- as I just said, the filed rate doctrine clearly, you know, prohibited the order here, and even if it didn't apply, this is an issue that -- the issue of the -- the reasonableness of rates and the practices affecting rates is an issue that the Federal Power Act clearly allocates to FERC. So even if the tariff here didn't, you know, clearly preclude ELI from doing what the LPSC found a prudent company would have done, the -- the filed -- the Federal Power Act preempted the -- the State from addressing the issue. And the facts of this case sort of illustrate why States shouldn't get involved in -- in this because the decision that was made here sort of exemplifies the parochialism that the Commerce Clause and the Federal Power Act was designed to prevent. It was acknowledged by the Louisiana Public Service Commission that the -- the units in question, the out-of-state units in question, benefited Louisiana and the entire system, increased the efficiency of the entire system. But it said that was irrelevant. In fact, it said that was evidence of imprudence because the effect was to increase the costs that ELI incurred and thus to increase retail rates, and that's a -- the kind of parochialism that the Commerce Clause prevents and the Federal Power Act was designed to draw a bright line that would eliminate any need to even adjudicate questions whether the conduct violates the Federal --"

The facts of this case highlight the need for exclusive Federal regulation. The dispute in this case involves the correct allocation of costs incurred for the common benefit of five utilities in four different States.

They let -- got an unreasonable rate. That the commission's remedy -- the local commission -- is not to readjudicate that itself.

One of those things is a charge that the Louisiana company is to pay to a company in a different State to reflect the fact that that company in the different State has generators in reserve capacity that serve everybody, and among those generators are generators that were put in mothballs provided that they noted in the minutes of the joint company, et cetera that this is a mothballed generator available for reserve capacity if necessary. All right, and if I understand it correctly and I've said it correctly, then the cost at issue here is part of the 5, not part of the other 5."

And it wasn't as though ELI could say, well, we think you allocated too much to us. You're making us pay too much. The -- each unit is bound by what Entergy says.

Now, we all know you can go to court to enforce a wholesale tariff, and that's where most people go. In the case of a parent-subsidiary relationship, well, obviously the parent gets to tell the subsidiary what to do. That's true in everything. It's true of many cost allocations that we see. We see hundreds of millions of dollars of cost allocations coming into Louisiana based on Entergy's decisions under innumerable types of allocation schemes, including the Federal tariff. And ELI has an obligation, even though it's owned by a parent, to make sure the parent follows the terms of the tariff, just as the wholesale buyer of power --"

All right? And now we have -- now we have -- you go before the State commission and the company says, and it costs me $117 to send Mr. Smith to do that. And you want to say, I, of course, am forbidden from arguing to you, the State commission, that they violated the tariff. But I can tell you that this salesman, named Murphy, actually spent most of his time in a chicken restaurant, and therefore, what he did for that 117 fell outside the tariff. It didn't violate the tariff. It fell outside the tariff. And similarly, you want to say here that the cost of the generator in mothballs did not violate the tariff to include it, but rather fell outside the tariff because they never had the minutes, et cetera.

They were told in 16 U.S.C. 825m that if they found a violation of a tariff, they had to go to United States District Court. And there's nothing in the Federal Power Act.

If you're going to raise prudence, you raise it in the proceeding where the just and reasonable rate gets established. We admit they have that. Then you have the next question.

But going back to MP&L, this Court's decision affirmed the decision of the Mississippi Public Service Commission. It reversed the Mississippi Supreme Court. It affirmed the Mississippi Public Service Commission. In -- in that decision of the Mississippi Public Service Commission, 327 million will be incurred under the FERC tariff. They -- they had to actually estimate what would be incurred. Now, if you hand the utility the right to tell the State public service commission that, oh, it will be 500 million, do they have to pass it through? If this Court is going to give the sword of preemption to utilities, and basically, there's a test, you know. We've got concurrent jurisdiction. The test for concurrent jurisdiction or exclusive jurisdiction is unmistakable intent of Congress. Congress had it in there, pulled it out of the -- in the Senate report. The FERC can -- can hear violations. It was in the Senate version of the bill in 1935. If you look on page 6 of our brief, you'll find that the Senate pulled it out. The FERC had no -- no -- jurisdiction to hear tariff violation cases. It could go to court. That's 16 U.S.C., section 825m. In about 1980, the FERC said, well, you know what? We're going to infer the power to do that. And for the first time ever, because up until then, the FERC had been refusing to hear cases that were pending in State court, wouldn't even exercise primary jurisdiction. Now, obviously, if you have exclusive jurisdiction, there's no need for a primary jurisdiction doctrine. They wouldn't even exercise primary jurisdiction. They left it to the State courts, all the State courts. Now, if you leave it to the State courts, what is -- how can you possibly say a State ratemaking agency, which decides issues of Federal law, contracts, all the time, has to interpret allocations, has to decide if they're right -- how could the Federal Power Act have taken away their power when the Federal Power Act was passed --"
