      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1974, when it enacted the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, Congress conditioned Federal funding for educational institutions on the institution not having a policy or practice of releasing student records without consent. Congress did not phrase this condition in terms of individual rights. It did not, for example, follow the model of title IX, enacted 2 years earlier and also dealing with educational institutions, and say something like, no student at a school receiving Federal funds shall have his records released without his consent. Instead, Congress proceeded more indirectly. It said that no funds shall be made available to any institution having a policy or practice of releasing student records without consent. The statute is directed to the Secretary of Education. He's the one who makes Federal funds available, not to the institution receiving the funds, and certainly not to the individual student. This Court's cases establish that that is a distinction that makes a difference. In Cannon, for example, the Court said there would be far less reason --"

    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "In the implied right of action question there are two questions, did Congress intend to create a right, and did Congress intend to provide a judicial remedy? In the 1983 context, there are two questions, did Congress intend to create a right, and did Congress intend to preclude resort to the 1983 remedy, so that first question I think is the same under both categories of cases, and as the Court said in Cannon, if Congress phrases the statute as -- quote, as a prohibition on the disbursement of public funds, there's far less reason to think that they intended a private remedy. In addition, purpose speaks in terms of an institutional policy or practice, not individual instances of disclosures. Again, the contrast with a rights- creating provision like title IX is stark. Title IX says, no student shall be subject to discrimination, but FERPA doesn't look at what happens to individual students. It looks at institutional behavior, institutional policy or practice."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Well, first of all, the Court in Blessing said that you don't look at the whole act. You have to look at the particular provision that is relied upon to create the 1983 right. Second of all, we're 6 years before Maine v. Thiboutot when Congress passed this, so it's not as if they're using rights as some term of art under the established jurisprudence, and finally, I think Congress can use the term to refer to the opportunity of parents and students to participate in the administrative remedy, to the criteria that the Secretary of Education is to use in deciding whether to terminate funds, without thereby necessarily triggering coverage under section 1982."

The obligation is to the Secretary, not to the institution, and that is made clear when you look at what Congress said about enforcement. The Congress said, the Secretary shall enforce FERPA, and the Secretary shall deal with violations. Now, that deal-with-violations language should strike the Court as unusual and, in fact, nowhere else in the United States Code does Congress tell an agency to deal with violations. It has almost a colloquial tone to it. Mr. Secretary, FERPA is your problem, you deal with the violations. There's no suggestion that they would be dealt with by private actions brought in court and, in fact, that conclusion is reinforced when you look at subsection (g), which tells the Secretary, you set up an office to deal --"

Here, Congress said to the Secretary, you set up a complaint procedure, and if someone's got a problem with the release of their records you investigate it, you process the complaint, you review it, and you adjudicate it, and what has happened is that complaints have come in, and the Family Policy Compliance Office have gotten responses from the university, and voluntary compliance has ensured that the policy and practice of the institution complies with the Secretary's view."

The statute says the Secretary shall deal with violations, not the court. The Secretary says -- and the statute goes on to say, we're going to tell you how to deal with individual complainants. They don't go to court, either. They go to the office that's set up by the Secretary, and there they will find an informal, inexpensive procedure in which people can quickly find out what the school's answer is and, in a case in which it suggests that there's a policy or practice problem, secure voluntary problem."

The first thing, if you're a student subjected to that, what you would do is call the Family Policy Compliance Office and the Secretary, keep in mind, has the cudgel of terminating funding behind the most informal telephone call or correspondence.

The policy, or the focus on the Secretary -- this statute is directed to the Secretary. Don't make funds available, and it says, look at the policy or practice.

As a whole, we don't think it actually makes sense to do so under this statute. The Court may not decide that today because the only provision at issue is subsection (b), which does not refer to rights and focuses on policies or practices, but our position is that there are three mutually reinforcing features here, both in (a) and (b), that show there is not a right under 1983, and that is -- even under (a), the very beginning of the sentence, and the operative command is that no funds shall be distributed, or shall be distributed by the Secretary of Education, and that is distinctive, unique language that this Court recognized, suggested in Cannon, and held just last term in Sandoval.

I hate to confuse the Court, to my brief, at 1a, where subsection (a) is, and there has to be a policy of denying or effectively preventing the parents of students, plural, access to these records, so we think that makes clear that you have the same programmatic, system-wide rule here, and in fact the Secretary's position is that if you had one instance of a failure to allow someone access to records during nonpolicy or nonprogram-wide failure to allow access to records, that would not violate FERPA.

You have to give notice at the beginning of the year, and you have to give parents enough time to respond whether or not they want to opt out of that. Same thing under (b)(2)(A). If you as a university decide that you want to have a policy or practice of releasing things beyond what is already authorized under (b)(1), which includes other teachers, emergency situations, Federal officials, all kinds of situations, then you have to abide by (b)(2)(A), and you cannot have that policy or practice unless there is written consent from the students' parents."

Parents may have different decisions based on whether or not they think it will benefit the child."

They said, we are not going to charge every institution with inadvertent release, but to the extent, as under Monell, if there is requisite knowledge by the school that they have a policy or practice, they're intending to be releasing information, they are charged with getting the consent from the parents, and again I have to --"

None of the statutes where the Court has found a right has included that language, Wright, Wilde, or Blessing, none of them have the language the petitioner and the Solicitor General now urges. In fact, in footnote 12 of the Suter opinion the Court contrasted the language where they were not finding a right to a statute that, quote, said, no Federal payment may be made under this part, and they said, now, there's a specific requirement, so there's no formula. None of the courts have had this language that they're now urging. The Suter opinion refers to this type of language as being more specific, and it doesn't as a practical matter make any difference what these Spending Clause statutes do say. If you receive Federal funds, you have to abide by these conditions."

There are title VI, title IX, statutes that use the formula, no person shall, and under those statutes a right of action has been implied, and what I'm asking is, is there any statute with the language, no funds shall, where a right of action has been implied?"

      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",

I have to say in the title IX and title VI context, it was a broader inquiry of whether or not there was implied cause of action, but in Your Honor's opinion, in Suter, in footnote 12, it does refer to this type of statute and suggests that that is a direct requirement."

It's on page 361 of the opinion, and it's citing 42 U.S.C. 672(e) that says, quote, for example, no Federal payment may be made under this part, and then it goes on and it says that that is an example of more precise requirements as contrasted to the statute in Suter. If I may, there are four other provisions I'd like to speak to in addition to the language, unless there is. In addition, again on page 9a under (b)(2)(A), it's not just unless there is written consent. That consent has to have included a provision of a copy of what is intended to be released by the school to the parents. The parents have to be told why the information is being released, and the parents have to know to whom it is being released. That is exactly what the Court referenced in Blessing about Congress addressing the particular need of the individuals who they're according the rights to. They knew that parents were going to be able to need to know why the information was provided, exactly what it is, and to whom. Parents may think it's fine to release financial information, personal information about their household for a scholarship or an honorary award purpose, but not, for example, to a newspaper story about low income families in the school district. Third, the history of the -- before I go to the history, actually, I want to explain another provision of the statute which I think --"

There is a contractual relationship there, and there may very well be other remedies against a private school arising out of -- for example, here in Exhibit 1 at the trial, the handbook, Gonzaga promised to abide by FERPA and said, we will not release information without your consent. There could be a contractual action there. You can't have those kinds of actions against a school, public school. That's why Congress created section 1983. There was --"

Assuming all the language is ambiguous, et cetera, and I would like you to remove this image from my mind, the image that I have in my mind was an earlier case argued here in this Court, and as a result of the lawyer's argument in that case I focused on the language, educational record, and I realized it's a close question, perhaps, as to whether those words do include things like a gold star the third grade teacher might give out in class, or the statement, you're going to get a bad mark on your report card. I suddenly realized it's highly ambiguous, and the lawyer said that he had been cross-examining the school officials on this and related questions in the courtroom for several hours, I thought. I mean, at least for a time, and suddenly it occurred to me, how are they teaching or running the school district, and the image that came up in my courtroom was of private actions all over the place trying to bring into court school officials to interpret language which really doesn't explain itself. Therefore, a need for centralized administration, which of course would be harmful to some parents, but counterbalanced by the need for effective school administration, and those were the things in my mind, and that's the image it called up, and I want you to reply to that, because I think that's at the heart of this, at least the practical part."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I think I have at least five answers. I haven't counted them off. First of all, I think it's important to realize that that's one of the reasons you have the particularized examination in Blessing. We are not saying there's a right under every one of these provisions, but if you look at (b)(2)(A), unless there is the specific requirement, the history of it, and also if you compare it to the other release provisions that do not have this kind of right, they say you have to notify the parent, or you have to make the person who's getting it promise to destroy it when they're done with it. They don't have this right. So if you look at this particular right, then you step back and you realize what the Department of Education has been saying. Schools comply with this statute. It is clear and simple. You give them a copy, you ask the parents -- tell the parents why and to whom it is going. In the 28 years since this statute has been enacted, there has been no flood of litigation, despite the fact that the Second Circuit, I think 15 years ago, held that there was a section 1983 cause of action, the Fifth Circuit more than 10 years ago. There is no Federal court of appeals that has taken petitioner's position. I think in the past 5 or 6 years there have been at least two more circuits. People comply."

It answers countless numbers of phone calls and inquiries about this, but its own interpretation of its role I think is really illustrated by footnote 6 in our brief, which is on page 35. In 1987, when FPCO changed regulations, it explained that it wasn't going to require schools even to afford them access to education records information because they don't go out and investigate. What more accurately reflects their investigation is allowing schools to submit reports -- and this is quotes -- since its inception, FPCO has not conducted any on-site visits to resolve complaints. Rather, it has resolved complaints through correspondence and telephone calls with the affected parties, and that works in the vast majority of cases. In the limited number of cases that are brought under FERPA in the Federal courts, Federal and State courts since its enactment, this is the only reported case that anyone has located for punitive damages, and the only other case that had any damages was $1 of nominal damages that we've been able to --"

There was disagreement -- even as it stood, without any information from my client to say this was false, there was disagreement amongst the school officials about whether or not to issue this, and plaintiff's exhibit 28 has a chronology.

Two statutes enacted within 2 years of each other: title IX, no person shall be subject to discrimination; FERPA, no funds shall be made available to an institution that has a policy or practice described in the statute, and the Secretary shall deal with violations, and the Secretary shall do that at one place, because we're worried about multiple interpretations causing confusion. Now, that is two -- those are two very different ways of approaching a problem. Under this Court's precedents the former, the title IX model confers privately enforceable rights. The latter does not. Why would Congress proceed differently in dealing with educational institutions in those two different contexts? Because of the appreciation that the regulation of student records from kindergarten through graduate school directly implicated pedagogical concerns. It would have been a radical notion, even in 1974, for Congress to confer individual rights on every student from kindergarten to graduate school in a way that would directly implicate the day-to-day running of schools across the country, and there's no evidence to suggest that that's what Congress had in mind. The evidence is the opposite. It proceeded gingerly. It said, this is directed to the Secretary. It's directed to policies and practice. Who's going to deal with violations? Mr. Secretary, deal with violations, and do it in one place. Four months after FERPA was enacted, in response to what was called by the sponsors the perplexity and frustration it had caused -- four months -- they added the second sentence to subsection (g) on page 12a of the blue brief, and that said, don't do any of this, Mr. Secretary, in any of the regional offices. The reason? We're afraid of multiple interpretation. Well, multiple interpretations caused by regional offices, there's a slight problem there, are, after all, answerable to the Secretary. Individual private plaintiffs suing in State and Federal court around the country, any one of these 62 million students covered by the Federal funds requirement, that would give rise to multiple interpretations, and it is implausible to suppose --"
