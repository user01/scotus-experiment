      "speaker": "DREEBEN",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The postal inspectors in this case applied for a warrant to search respondent's property. The warrant that they obtained particularly described the place to be searched and the things to be seized. It was issued based on an affidavit that informed the magistrate judge that a videotape containing child pornography that respondent had ordered through the mail and had paid for in cash was going to be delivered to respondent's house and that the warrant would not be executed until the delivery had taken place. The Ninth Circuit held that the execution of this warrant, which occurred after the delivery that the postal inspectors represented would occur had in fact happened, violated the Particularity Clause of the Fourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit's opinion is wrong because the Particularity Clause of the Fourth Amendment addresses two specific topics: the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. It does not address the time of execution of a warrant, which the Ninth Circuit impermissibly read into the Fourth Amendment in violation of its text. The Ninth Circuit held, therefore, that because the warrant was not in accordance with the Particularity Clause, this search was equivalent to a warrantless search and that all fruits of the search had to be suppressed."

And if agents executed a warrant at a time at which there was no probable cause, for example, because they executed it before the delivery had taken place or they executed it after a time at which probable cause had become stale, the search would be unreasonable and the fruits of the search would probably have to be suppressed."

If, in fact, the warrant is executed at a time before the delivery takes place, then the warrant has failed to conform to the probable cause that supported it and the search would be unreasonable."

The magistrate must find that there is probable cause to believe that offense -- an offense has been committed, is being committed, or is about to be committed, and that the items that the warrant is going to request to be seized will be present at the location at the time of execution. And the magistrate in this case was easily able to make those determinations based on the warrant affidavit that was submitted to him. But there is an additional requirement of reasonableness, that officers may not execute a warrant, even if it was validly issued, if they become aware of facts that would tell a reasonable officer --"

      "speech": "I -- what I -- I'm making a separate point here, which is that officers have a continuing obligation to act reasonably in the execution of a warrant, and of course, they fulfill that in a variety of ways. They have to be reasonable in identifying the property that's -- that's specified in the warrant and that they go to search. They have to be reasonable in conducting the search of places within that property to see that they're looking for the things that are specified in the warrant and not going on a fishing expedition for things that are not. They have to be reasonable in deciding whether they decide to dispense with knock and announce, and they also have to be reasonable in deciding that the basis for probable cause that they used to support the issuance of the warrant has not become so stale that a reasonable officer would know that that warrant should not be executed."

      "speech": "Oh, I don't think it's a big change at all, Justice Kennedy, and I -- I think what I'm trying to make clear here is that there's an ongoing obligation of reasonableness. Certainly the Court does not have to get into that in this case to decide it --"

But unless every officer who -- who acts under the authority of the warrant is aware of the probable cause evidence and can make a judgment when that evidence either is stale or, in this case, has not yet ripened, then in fact there is no way for an officer to make that kind of what you're calling the reasonableness judgment in the execution of the warrant. He simply doesn't have the factual background for it, and that's where the timing -- we'll call it -- the timing clause comes in because at least an officer who may not know the probable cause behind it all -- at least an officer who has a warrant that says, you may search between times X and Y, or a warrant that says, upon the occurrence of event X and time Y, has a -- a rough and sound idea of when he can act. But if that's not in the warrant, the officer cannot make that judgment. He doesn't know the probable cause necessarily and he doesn't know the time."

The affiant who secured the warrant was the lead agent who was in charge of the search that was carried out. The search team had been briefed on the probable cause and the -- the contents of the affidavit and the -- the items that were to be searched for and when the search was to take place. All of those things were true. The district court also found that the affidavit, which does contain the triggering condition in two different places, was incorporated into the warrant. The search warrant itself refers to the attached affidavit. So the documents --"

This -- this was a controlled delivery in which postal inspectors were arranging themselves to make a delivery to the premises of the videotape in question. Everyone on the search warrant team knew that until that item had been received and taken inside the house, there would be no warrant execution. And in fact --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Well, but the facts of the triggering event are not always going to be so clean, and in many cases they're going to require an exercise of judgment by the officer. I mean, if the triggering event is a, you know, delivery of a bale of marijuana or something and they see a big box coming in, they're going to have say, well, is that what they're talking about or is -- you know, is that it. And the point is under the Fourth Amendment that those types of judgments are supposed to be made by the magistrate and not by the officers on the scene."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DREEBEN",
      "speech": "Well, I don't think that is the point of the Fourth Amendment. I think what the point of the Fourth Amendment is is that the magistrate judge makes a determination whether the facts that are submitted to him rise to the level of probable cause. And then the magistrate writes a warrant that's consistent with what the Fourth Amendment says in terms the Warrant Clause requires. Then the police officers have to be reasonable in executing it. That was really my only point at the outset of the colloquy that I had with Justice Kennedy and with Justice Souter. And the classic example that I think shows that certainly officers may use discretion in what they do in determining whether it's certain types of triggering conditions are met are wiretaps because wiretaps are issued on the basis that there is probable cause to believe that criminal conversations will occur in the future. The officers then have the responsibility to conduct appropriate electronic surveillance that acquires the criminal conversations but not other conversations that are not within the scope of the probable cause that they've obtained."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
      "speech": "Yes, but doesn't that simply -- isn't the analogy there that when a -- when a search warrant says you may -- you may pick up implements of drug traffic, all it covers is drug traffic. It doesn't cover coffee, tea, and -- and milk. In -- in the case of the electronic surveillance, they're supposed to record criminal conversations and -- but not others."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DREEBEN",

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
      "speech": "Well, he's saying two things. There is probable cause to believe that what we're calling the triggering event will occur, and there is probable -- and when that triggering event occurs, there will be probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime may be found and seized at such and such a place. There are two determinations."

This search warrant, which is at page 47a of the petition appendix, specifically refers to the attached affidavit.

Are they talking about crimes in an oblique way that pertain to the subject of the warrant, or are they really having innocent conversations?

This case is fundamentally different from that hypothetical because the measure of probable cause at the time the warrant is issued is very weak under Justice Scalia's hypothetical. One out of 17 is pushing the envelope. One out of 50, at least absent some extraordinary national emergency, is probably well outside the envelope for saying we have probable cause to go into any particular place. Justice Scalia's hypothetical illustrates that the emergence of later facts can make it very clear that the agents can go in and get probable cause at that moment, but this case is fundamentally different because the agents have probable cause based on probabilities."

The magistrate found that the warrant, the form of -- that constitutes the warrant, incorporated the attached affidavit, and the attached affidavit makes clear exactly what the agent had in mind. There is an alternative point here that I want to make before I reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, and that is the Ninth Circuit's position, even if the Ninth Circuit were correct that the triggering condition needs to be in the warrant, should still not lead to the suppression of evidence because although the Government's submission is that the triggering condition is not required by the Particularity Clause, if some other doctrine under the Fourth Amendment did require it to be in the warrant, the warrant should be treated as one that is at most overbroad as to the time of permissible execution. That is, on its face it would authorize the warrant to be executed from the moment of issuance until 10 days after issuance instead of from the moment that the triggering condition is satisfied until 10 days after issuance. When courts have confronted overbroad warrants, what they have done is ask is there probable cause that supports part of this warrant. If the answer to that is yes, the next question is, is the evidence that's sought to be suppressed acquired under the part of the warrant that was validly supported by probable cause? If the answer to that is yes, there's no suppression. The warrant is, in effect, severed and the only suppression that can be obtained is as to evidence that was secured by execution of the part of the warrant that's not supported by probable cause. Here, there was ample probable cause to support the magistrate judge's conclusion that after the triggering condition was satisfied, the videotape would be on the premises. The warrant was not executed until after the delivery of the videotape took place, and therefore, there was no deficiency in the correlation between probable cause showings that were made to obtain the warrant and the time at which it was executed. And the result is that there should be no suppression of evidence. If I may save the rest of my time for rebuttal."

A discussion was -- was had about triggering events are commonly not so clean. It requires a lot of judgment to be made by the officer in the field. There are not only examples in the case law, but I speak from my own experience as a public defender of many years that there are many examples that occur often in the courtroom. Specifically a triggering condition may allow for the search of a home after a suspect sells narcotics to an officer, but what will happen is the suspect will take the money from the officer and then have to go to another residence to get the narcotics, not the residence that the magistrate and the officer believe he would get them from. As a result, he has to make a determination at that point whether the triggering condition has been satisfied."

Everybody knows it's going to take half an hour. And the probable cause that they come up with is they know that this mob leader is going to be in this apartment between 6:30 and 6:45. Okay? And they present the warrant to the magistrate at -- at 6 o'clock. It will take half an hour to get to Brooklyn. The magistrate knows that when it's served, the mob leader will be in this apartment.

It's just a matter of waiting till it gets there. There is probable cause to believe that he will receive it.

The magistrate will not be nearly as well informed as he was when he was presented with -- was it a 64-paragraph affidavit? So the magistrate knows that the whole deal -- he can't possibly know it if he's got -- got a telephone call on an urgent basis.

I can't figure out what issue should be brought up here. There's a Van Treska case that says we ought to read these things in a common sense fashion. All right? I read it. My common sense says I have a warrant here. It says nothing about anticipatory anything. It says you can go and search for any of 16 items, 14 of which are in his house well before the delivery. After all, he's had all this correspondence with these people about child pornography. They have terrific reason for thinking he might have some. And that's all it says. And then it says, is there probable cause for a warrant that says go in any time now and search for any of these items, including what will be delivered, if that's when you do it? I say I look at the probable cause. His probable cause is he thinks that another package is being delivered, and he's right to think it. Now, whether it is delivered or not doesn't add anything really to the issuance of the warrant. It might add to his personal confidence. But that's my common sense opinion. The common sense is the only question here is do they have probable cause to issue a warrant that allows them to search now, because that's what it says. So now how -- how, given that -- I grant you the Ninth Circuit went into all kinds of other things, but you explain to me, please, how I'm supposed to reach those other things and what I'm supposed to do, and why I'm wrong."

Nothing else in the warrant does. What am I supposed to do if I think there's adequate probable cause for issuing that warrant right now in respect to 12 of the things? And it's really pretty hard for me to try to understand what this warrant is about if I'm supposed to understand it, by reading through about 15 or 20 pages of small print and there discovering somewhere in the back of it some -- the post office says I'm not going to execute this until this other package gets there too.

I'm assuming that the conditions have to reasonably describe. My anxiety is resting only on the fact that this warrant doesn't seem to be an anticipatory warrant but for one word, and to know what it's about, you have to look through 28 pages of fine print.

What is going on here? Why are you here? At that point, I believe clearly under -- under the court of appeals decisions and other court decisions, that this crime, the knowing receipt of the illegal material, had not been completed.

But the magistrate's probable cause finding is predicated on the view that the items will be there because the Postal Service has represented they'll deliver them. The burden of the Ninth Circuit's view is that the Particularity Clause applies to the triggering condition and mandates that it be stated in the text even though the Fourth Amendment's text doesn't contain that requirement. This Court in Dalia v. United States rejected a similar effort to add a requirement to a warrant that would authorize surreptitious entry to install a covert bugging device, and the Court's reasoning in Dalia makes clear that the Court was unwilling to go on a progressive path of reading things into the Fourth Amendment's Particularity Clause that are not there."
