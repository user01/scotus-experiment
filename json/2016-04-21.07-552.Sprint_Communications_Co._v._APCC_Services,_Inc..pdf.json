      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Chief Judge Sentelle observed in his dissent below that there are assignments and there are assignments, and that's essentially going to be the theme of my presentation this morning. It is I think common ground between the parties in this litigation that if you have an assignment which represents the grant of the entirety of both the right and the remedy, that is the complete assignment of the chosen action, then under those circumstances there's no question that the assignee has standing under Article III. By parity of receiving, if all that the assignee receives is a power of attorney, a mere collection agency role, under those circumstances I think it's common ground between the parties that Article III is not satisfied. Two of the data points come from --"

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Say it again? What is the common ground?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "I think the second part of the common ground is that if all that the assignee receives is the power of attorney, that is to serve as the lawyer for the assignor, under those circumstances the assignee doesn't -- cannot -- has no common stake than I or my clients do in these particular cases, any more than I do in my client's interest in these particular cases, and there I don't think anybody disputes that Article III is not satisfied. Now, the Court in Vermont Agency sort of identified two additional data points. First of all, it made clear that a 10 percent bounty by itself unattached to anything else is not sufficient, largely I think for the same reasons why the lawyer's claim is insufficient, because that's not tied to the particular right at stake and therefore is inadequate to allow Article III to the satisfied. The second half of it is, though, that if that bounty is coupled with an assignment of the rights and even if that's a partial assignment of the rights, then there is Article III jurisdiction under those circumstances."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "So that if these contracts provided that the aggregators will turn over all of the proceeds of the litigation except for one penny, then you'd be satisfied?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, I'm not sure I'd be satisfied. I think there's a different -- I think the answer is that might satisfy Article III. The only reason I'm reluctant to say that that's the line that ought to be drawn is because this Court's taxpayer standing cases seems to recognize that there are situations where there is a sufficiently de minimis amount of at stake that under those circumstances Article III won't be satisfied. But clearly the cleanest line to draw is in circumstances where have you no stake in the outcome that clearly is beyond what Article III would ultimately do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Well then, this is not really a very significant case, is it? Because I presume that these enterprises that agglomerate claims and bring suit as a collection agency, they could simply get their compensation, instead of by way of, of a flat fee, by, you know, claiming entitlement to 2 percent of the rewards. So it's no big deal, I mean, really."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "But it is a big deal, not necessarily because of the importance of the article. I think the Article III part of it is still a big deal. I think requiring as a separation of powers matter that there has to be a concrete stake in the party bringing the litigation, that's an important principle and the Court shouldn't abandon it, and that's posed directly in this case. But more fundamentally in terms of the importance of the underlying process, remember here we're talking about an assignee who takes on 1400 different assignor claims involving 400,000 pay phones. And that's the problem, is that when you break this down and you allow just simple assignments to satisfy Article III in its prudential standing concerns, then what you end up with is this mass tort litigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "But it would be just the same, Mr. Phillips, would it not, if the arrangement was that the aggregator gets a piece of the action? Let's take out the de minimis one cent. A significant stake, like the qui tam plaintiff has. So you would have the same problems that you're complaining about with regard to discovery from the individual PSPs, the same problem with respect to counterclaim. That's -- so it seems to me that, as Justice Scalia suggested, this isn't about a whole lot if just by the device of giving the aggregator part of the, a piece of the action, this suit would be okay because the prudential objections that you are making here would apply just as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, and I would -- I would still assert those same prudential objections in the hypothetical you pose. What I'm saying is when you -- when you have an assignment and there is a bounty built into it, however you want to define the bounty, whether it's a penny or 10 percent or 2 percent or whatever, that may satisfy Article III. I understand that. That does not answer the question of whether there's prudential standing under those circumstances. In that --"

You don't get to use the efficiency of the counterclaim process, and there are serious questions about whether or not there are res judicata and collateral estoppel effects, and I would argue in that context that there's a very significant claim that those proceedings ought not to be entertained by a Federal court as a prudential matter, not as a matter of Article III."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

He has no interest in it personally and he is compensated the same way, the same way this agglomerator is compensated. He has no personal interest. He could sue, couldn't he?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",

      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, it is a big deal, because trust relationships carry all kinds of additional legal consequences. What is particularly offensive about this arrangement, Your Honors, is that the assignor gets all of the benefits of being able to bring mass tort litigation with none of the responsibilities."

    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
      "speech": "-- that might protect those who assigned their interest to the trust, but I don't offhand see what difference it would make, what difference those responsibilities would make vis a vis you and your client."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, again, Justice Souter, I think the answer probably is going to depend on how the Court interprets the prudential standing doctrine. Again, I don't have any quarrel as an Article III matter, because I think it's one of those long-held traditions that trustees are allowed to bring litigation on behalf of the trust and that's understood."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
      "speech": "But the real issue is not whether the trustee can sue. The real issue is whether the trust can sue."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
      "speech": "It seems to me in his example if the trust can sue, why can't the aggregator sue? And your answer was, well, trustees have certain responsibilities. But I don't see that those responsibilities inure to the benefit of your client or to an opposing party in litigation that a trust brings. So I don't see how it would differentiate it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, there are two differentiations. One is that there is this entire legal regime that regulates trusts and that has allowed the courts for 200 years, probably longer than that, to be comfortable to allow litigation to proceed in a particular way. But second of all and the second answer to your first question is the prudential concerns remain just, potentially just as serious. I think the question is do you want to create litigation devices that allow the courts to avoid -- to allow lower courts or, more to the point, allow plaintiffs to avoid the requirements either of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or the associational standing doctrine. Those are doctrines that are designed to limit mass tort litigation in particularized circumstances --"

The Qwest amicus brief does a very nice job of explaining that there are a lot of situations where the -- where the payphone operators are overpaid and it's very difficult -- first of all, and the aggregator has no idea or any incentive to find out any of that, any of that information. And when Qwest made the requests of the aggregator saying, provide me with the information, the brief quotes in a variety of places comments such as, you know, \"whatever the -- our aggregator says is fine with us,\" or \"I don't care about those claims,\" or answers like that, which, if I sue you -- I mean, if you sue me and I ask for those, you cannot give me back those answers."

So that whatever counterclaims you have operate directly against that particular individual. But even in that context, Justice Kennedy, it seems to me there's a fundamental difference, as a matter of prudence, between dealing with a single assignee back and forth and the disputes that arise there and the difficulty of discovery that would exist there, and the situation we have here where you have 1400 payphone operators --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",

And two things it reminds me of are, one very common, a financer takes an interest in receivables and he's going to have to collect them as receivables and there may be 50,000. That could have the same kind of practical problems. Or we had cases in the First Circuit you may or may not be aware of where somebody went around and had assignments for 50,000 cabbages that were delivered a day late in 50,000 box cars and each one was worth about $10. Nobody figured a way out of that. They had to pass a special statute. There was -- and so it seems to me you're better off than the cabbage people because have you two possible remedies: One on discovery; you could ask the judge, Judge, see what the Communications Commission thinks. It's called primary jurisdiction of the kind."

      "speech": "But, Justice --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
      "speech": "Or you could go to the FCC and you say, FCC, you got us into this. Now, you have some rules here that make some sense in terms of collection. You have both those agency avenues open to you, not open to the cabbage people, and this doesn't seem a standing problem. Now, what's your response to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, there are two elements of the standing problem: The first one is we're all -- let's be clear -- we're talking about a hypothetical that's different from this case because we're talking about a hypothetical where in fact the assignee has a concrete interest in the outcome of this dispute. Here the assignee has no interest in the outcome of this dispute. So the Article III problem arises there. The question is if you have a minor amount at interest, even if it's, you know, concrete but nevertheless approaches de minimis, should you nevertheless entertain that case. And I think the answer to your question, Justice Breyer, is that instead of making this into a Federal court case, where you have 1400 claims like this, what the Court should say is that the better course to follow is in fact for the plaintiffs to take their claims, if they want to, in an aggregate form to the FCC because that's the right institution to deal with it because it doesn't have the limitations of Article III and it doesn't have the limitations of prudential standing to interfere with its ability to provide complete relief. And, indeed, if you read the Respondents' brief, they identify, as the prototype litigation, in which this entire system worked effectively, a claim that was in fact litigated in front of the Federal Communications Commission, not a case that was litigated in front of the Federal court. So, to my mind, the right answer to this case is to take these cases all to the FCC, not as a matter of what we do as primary jurisdiction, but simply as what the plaintiffs do because they don't have the vehicle to bring this to the Federal courts."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "What do you do about -- about aggregated plaintiffs who are not in the field of Federal regulation? They're just sort of out of luck? Can they petition for the creation of an FCC that they can take their claims to? I mean, this is a fluke that there happens to be this Federal agency they could have gone to. Certainly our principles of standing should not depend upon that fluke, should it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, I think when the Court is considering the questions of prudence, you know, it can certainly take it into account, and maybe that would argue in the alternative in another case if there weren't such an available vehicle that the Court might be more inclined to entertain it under those circumstances."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "Would there be review? The FCC, you pointed out, doesn't have Article III barriers. So the FCC decides one way or another. One party ends up losing. Is there review in Federal court?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "I mean, Justice Ginsburg, that is Spiller. That's what the Court said in Spiller, and I think it's a logical outgrowth of what the Court held in ASARCO, which is that, even though a claim doesn't start with Article III jurisdiction because it's not an Article III entity, that when a final determination comes out of that entity that is in fact enforceable as a right that that right is enforceable consistent with Article III notions. And that's true. That is what the Court essentially, without dealing with Article III at all, said in Spiller, and that's clearly what the Court held in ASARCO."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

They get all of the benefits of being able to go to Federal court and bring litigation with none of the burdens of having to deal with discovery or cross-claims or counterclaims or even necessarily being bound by doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.

The core question here is whether or not an aggregator who has no claim, who has no stake at all, not a penny's worth, can pursue this litigation. On that it seems to me the answer got -- should be no. There's no benefit to it. The concrete stake is a core requirement of Article III and the Court ought to enforce it as a separation of powers question. The issue that we've been discussing here is what do you do when you get past that, and when you have a kind of a bounty that's been attached to it, and how do you resolve that? In that situation, which is not this case, I still think that there would be grounds for prudential standing to serve as a basis to eliminate this kind of litigation.

You know, the court can consider whether or not it thinks joinder is appropriate under those circumstances, but they could unquestionably do that. But then, again, they are then at that point a plaintiff in the litigation having brought this action and, therefore, subject to all of the burdens of being a plaintiff in the litigation, including submitting themselves to the personal jurisdiction of the court. I mean, let's be clear about this. There are 1400 names out of people all over the country that under the -- under the plaintiffs aggregators' theory we have to go chase down in order to obtain discovery, to obtain any of our counterclaims or anything like that. Whereas if they come into this Court and they submit themselves to the jurisdiction, at least the process works as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, I don't doubt that the trial court can do that, but the question is: Why do we have to go to the burden of having to chase all of that in the first instance? I mean, the Respondent's brief at page 10 criticizes us for not having brought 1400 third-party complaints, not having sought additional discovery. All of those are burdens that simply arise in this context that otherwise do not exist in an ordinary case where you simply ask the party who has the actual claim to be the plaintiff in front of the court. And that's -- and, again, just to be clear, we are still here dealing with the hypothetical. We're not dealing with the core question of what do you do with a plaintiff who has not one penny at stake in litigation that, as the lawyers describe, is all hard cash."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
      "speech": "I'm sorry. The only way, it seems to me, that you can eliminate what you regard as a problem is by having 1400 separate actions, so that in any given case if you want discovery, your plaintiff, the person who has got to provide that discovery, is standing right there. And I don't see how you can get the benefits that you are claiming entitled to without having 1400 separate actions. If you don't have 1400 separate actions, whether you have an aggregation like this, whether you have a joint action, whether you have a class action, this problem of chasing down, as you describe it, is going to be there. So it seems to me the prudential question for this Court is: Do we really want to require 1400 separate actions so that you can have your perfect paradigm of private litigation? And to say, yes, we want 1400 actions, it seems to me is a stretch. What do you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "I think the answer to that is that when you -- when you deal with mass tort litigation, the Rules of Civil Procedure ought to apply in that context as it applies in every other place. And when the courts deviate from the standard paradigm for litigation, they do it expressly, either through the rules or through doctrines that already exist. And so we have Rule 23, which sets out very clear protections for both the courts -- or not only for the courts, but for the plaintiffs and for the absent defendants -- absent, absent plaintiffs and for the defendants, and is a clear mechanism for conducting 1400 claims all once in a particular situation."

That's a bedrock requirement of Article III and ought to be a basis for simply reversing. But, you know, to the extent that the Court then goes beyond that and worries about what's the next case going to look like and what are the prudential limitations, which I don't think the Court has to resolve any of this, what I would suggest is the Court should be informed by Rule 23 and associational standing and those doctrines --"

Is that basically it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",

We haven't had to have aggregator standing all of this time. It strikes me that there's no compelling need for a change and that for that reason the Court ought to go back to the paradigm example, plaintiffs sue defendants and you have normal discovery and counterclaims."

Assume that is part of the first agreement, so that there is an assignment and as part of the assigning document there is a stated obligation on the part of the assignee to pay all proceeds to the assignor.

So when Spiller, the secretary of the Cattleman's Association, went to the Federal district court seeking enforcement of the reparations award he had gotten before the ICC, he had to satisfy Article III. When Titus came to this Court arguing that the lower courts had not properly given full faith and credit, he had to satisfy Article III. Each of those parties invoking the jurisdiction of the Federal court was someone who had to turn over 100 percent of the proceeds to the assignors.

So between the fact that the reasoning of Vermont Agency, whatever the facts were, relied on the interest of the assignor, relied on the ancient doctrine that the assignee for Article III purposes stands in the assignor's shoes, and the fact that this argument has been rejected in every case in which it's come up, I think the case for Article III standing is quite strong here."

      "speaker": "ENGLERT",

If there were serious counterclaims in this case, first of all as a factual matter, AT&T and Sprint would know it from their own records and second, they would have done something in nine years to try to bring a claim against PSP, and they have done nothing in nine years. So this is a very, very odd case in which to be worrying about whether they have lost some counterclaim rights because the PSPs -- lost some counterclaim rights because the PSPs aren't individual parties. It's also a very odd case in which to be worrying about discovery rights because the PSPs aren't individual parties because that issue was resolved in their favor in 2000 by the special master's discovery order saying, just as Justice Stevens postulated, the aggregator to go out and get the information from the PSPs. Now they complained that some of the PSPs, some of these mom and pop operations, said we don't have any information. That's because for the most part the PSP don't have any information. The information resides with the carriers and with the aggregators. So as a purely practical, pragmatic matter this is not the case in which to be worrying that some discovery rights have been lost; this is not the case in which to be worrying in which some counterclaim rights have been lost; this is not the case in which to be worrying that my clients aren't' bound. Every single -- I'm sorry, that the PSPs aren't bound, the assignors aren't bound, because every single one of them has signed an agreement, or two agreements, really, saying they will be bound. What this comes down to is a series of abstractions put up against the tradition of allowing lawsuits by assignee for collection."

Most of these cases settle. These cases as Justice Stevens pointed out are about analyzing computer records, and you can fight to the death or you can say let's figure out who owes whom what and let's settle; and most of the cases settle.

I mean we understand this kind of problem. So I go back to my question. They have one view of it; you have another of what's going on here. And their view is very unfavorable to your clients and your clients' view is very unfavorable to their clients. So I would like to know is there a way to get this worked out at the FCC?

Does the FCC have a useful role to play in this process at this point? Never say never, but I don't see one.

There are all sorts of problems with class actions. Class actions are typically brought by enterprising law firms who may not ever have met their clients. This is a different litigation altogether. This is litigation by a trade association that exists to collect payphone compensation, doing the same thing it always does, only doing it in court on behalf of 1,400 companies that each signed an agreement saying I want you to go do this for me and I agree to be bound by the result.

To dig up each individual record costs $1, there were billions of such records, and the value to you, to the other side, the plaintiff, imaginary in this case, was 12 cents a call. Okay? So you say look, those people are asking us to dig up billions of records, it's going to cost us a dollar each to do it, and all they are going to get out of it is 12 cents a call.

They have those protections. In fact, if you read the blue and yellow briefs in this case, they keep referring in the abstract to the protections of Rule 23, but they don't identify a single concrete protection that they do not have under this system. Rule 23 is inferior to an action by assignees for collection in every imaginable way. It's not a superior alternative.

So the agreement is, to my mind, inherently contradictory as to what are the obligations."

And I don't know the answer to that in any given case. And I think part of the -- Justice Kennedy and Justice Breyer, you asked the question about above and beyond discovery, what are the other problems that arise when you go down this -- and the more -- the other one is that being bound by the judgment. If you have a complete assignment of the chosen action, the assignee, then, is completely bound. There is nothing left. The assignor has no rights left. There is nothing left for the assignor to do in that situation; whereas, in these kinds of situations where the assignee receives the right to go forward but the remedy is in another party's hands, the potential for being bound is completely lost."
