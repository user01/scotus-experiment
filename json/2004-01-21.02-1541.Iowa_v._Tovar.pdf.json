And here, all of the statements made relate to what you're giving up by pleading guilty and not going to trial. Now, I thought, as Justice Breyer did, from that opening colloquy there was information to the defendant that he could consult with a lawyer before entering the plea. And I wondered particularly about the form that he signed. Tovar signed a form waiving counsel before the plea hearing, but that form is nowhere in the record or the lodging. Does it exist?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MILLER",
    "speech": "Your -- Your Honor, I -- I don't think he actually signed a form. What -- what did happen is that he was informed at the -- informed at the arrest through the Miranda warnings that he had a right to counsel. And then he went for a initial appearance, and this is -- this is the part that -- that I think we focus on. At the initial appearance, the judge marked the form saying application for court-appointed counsel, and then wrote waived. In other words, he had given the opportunity at this initial appearance for counsel. Going forward, there -- there was no reason to -- to interrupt the initial appearance and having to have counsel at -- at initial appearance. It was going forward. And then the words that Justice Breyer referred to, when he went to -- went to the plea hearing, the judge said, you know, I see that you've -- you've waived counsel, and then he says I assume that you want to proceed to represent yourself. So we think that -- that that really satisfies the requirement --"

  {
    "speaker": "MILLER",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. I think -- I think the -- the point is this, that in the plea setting it is very analogous to the Patterson setting and not analogous to the Faretta setting at -- at going to trial without counsel. And -- and the reason for that is, Your Honor, that going through the plea and hearing the elements and going through the factual basis and knowing the punishments, that's something a person can comprehend and can make a decision on, just like the Court held in Patterson that the decision to answer a question under interrogation or not under interrogation is something someone could do. But in -- in the trial setting, it is just so difficult for a person to represent himself in terms of the rule of evidence, in terms of strategy, witnesses, choosing the jury. Those are the kinds of things that it is just so difficult. What we do is two things. We inform the defendant of all those difficulties and by informing him as -- with a -- with an authority figure like a judge, we're -- we're pushing him towards counsel."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but -- but in -- in the context of entering a plea, it certainly would be useful for the defendant to know that if he had an attorney, the attorney might take a look at -- at the sobriety tests. He might talk with the prosecutor about a plea to the lesser charge, reckless driving. He might talk to the judge about a reduced sentence. It didn't happen here because he got the minimum. But just as -- as a general matter, your brief seems to suggest that there's -- there's not really much role for the attorney at -- in entering a guilty plea. I -- I suggest that there -- there's a very important role for him."

And in the Patterson setting, the -- you know, the things that a lawyer could do about strategy on the questions or make sure that you weren't tripped up on the questions, that was not required by Patterson. It's the -- it's the main consequences. It's the direct consequences that Patterson requires and that this requires. And, Your Honor, if we go into all the useful things that an attorney can do -- and -- and certainly there are many -- then it's -- it's almost an endless list. It's a fairly long list. And then we're cluttering up the -- the colloquy. It's already a -- a rather long colloquy."

    "speech": "You know, I -- I don't think there is a great interest, Your Honor, and I don't -- I don't think -- I don't think the -- the system is served here particularly what -- what the Iowa Supreme Court required that, you know, a -- and a lawyer can give you an independent assessment of -- of whether it's wise to plead guilty. Obviously, that's something that -- that we know about lawyers. And also really subsumed in that, to some extent, is the -- the question of defenses, but it's not a -- it's not a particularly helpful litany that they developed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, the Iowa court made rather a long laundry list of requirements. I suppose you wouldn't have to go along with all of those things, but I am interested to know whether you think there is a baseline requirement that the court advise the defendant in making a plea that he has a right to counsel and the attorney could be helpful in making that decision."

And indeed, to this date he's not asserted that he didn't know."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but the -- all I'm saying is the record doesn't establish it, and we've been -- in some situations been rather meticulous about what ought to be on the record because then you solve all the problems of collateral attack if the record does disclose it rather than relying on presumptions and inferences.

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "He does have a right to counsel at the plea hearing. He does have a right if he asserts it to consult with counsel before the hearing takes place, but I -- I think your argument is he doesn't even have to be told that bare information, never mind the -- the continuing spiel about how much a lawyer would be worth to him, but just the simple statement before you enter this plea, you're entitled to consult a lawyer. And if you want a lawyer to be with you at the hearing, you're entitled to that too."

There's a referral back. It was reaffirmed that he wanted to represent himself at -- at the hearing. As I say, that -- that -- you know, it was not raised by the -- by the defendant at the trial court level or in the -- or in the resistance to the cert petition.

    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The plea colloquy conducted at respondent's 1996 prosecution adequately informed respondent of the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding without counsel. Respondent's waiver of counsel and the guilty plea itself were therefore knowing and intelligent. The judgment of the Iowa Supreme Court should be reversed. I think it may be helpful to look first at the precise language that the Iowa Supreme Court employed in announcing the warnings that it thought were constitutionally required, and if the Court looks at page 18 of the appendix to the certiorari petition, that's the paragraph of the Iowa Supreme Court's opinion that's entitled Summary and Disposition. And it --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Page 18 of what?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "Of the appendix to the certiorari petition. And if you -- if you look in -- in the middle of the page, the Iowa Supreme Court in summarizing its holding said, rather, the trial judge need only advise the defendant generally that there are defenses to criminal charges that may not be known by lay persons and that the danger in waiving of the assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty is the risk that a viable defense will be overlooked. The defendant should be admonished that by waiving his right to an attorney, he will lose the opportunity to obtain an -- an opinion on whether under the facts and applicable law it is wise to plead guilty. In addition, the court must ensure the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him and the range of allowable punishments. But the third paragraph is -- is more -- the third sentence is more or less irrelevant because there's no dispute here that the defendant was informed of the nature and -- of the charge and the applicable punishments, and that would be done in any standard plea colloquy. So it's really just the previous two sentences that are at issue, and I think there are some noteworthy points about these. The first is that the warnings mandated by the Iowa Supreme Court don't contain any declarative sentence to the effect that you have a right to represented by counsel at this plea proceeding. The Iowa Supreme Court I think took it as given that respondent had been made adequately aware that he had a right to counsel and that what was missing was adequate information about the services that counsel could perform in connection with the plea decision. The second thing is that there's no reference in these warnings to case-specific issues such as possible suppression of evidence or the potential for plea bargaining. The -- the warnings are designed to be warnings that could be given in every single case. And in our view, the warnings are either vacuous or misleading, depending on how they're interpreted. If they are accurately interpreted as generalizations about the criminal justice process, they really say nothing more than that as a class lawyers know more about the law than people who are not lawyers, and it's at least possible that consulting with a lawyer would improve your chances in this criminal prosecution. And I think any defendant who is aware that he has the right to counsel would be aware of those facts, would be aware of at least the possibility that a lawyer could help him and the certainty that a lawyer would know more about the charges than he would. On the other hand, if the defendant misunderstands these warnings as directed to him personally as availed suggestion that there is actually a meritorious defense in his own case, then the defendant may be given an artificial disincentive to plead guilty and in the case of a non-indigent defendant may be led to spend his own funds consulting with a lawyer when in fact no valid defense exists."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would a Miranda warning be sufficient to advise the -- the defendant that you have a right to counsel? Period. It's pretty obvious to me that if you have a right to counsel at interrogation, you certainly have a right to one at the plea bargain. Would that be sufficient?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "I think it would be constitutionally sufficient, but it's certainly better practice to make sure that the defendant understands that the right extends beyond the questioning itself. And I think that was done in the initial appearance. The defendant -- there's -- there's a form. The defendant is represented as having waived his right to application for appointed counsel. I suppose that still leaves open the possibility that he could have retained counsel if he had chosen to. But I think that certainly apprised the defendant of the right -- of -- of the fact that his right to counsel extended beyond the initial questioning itself and would continue for the duration of the proceedings. And we'd also point out that because this is a collateral challenge, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that no knowing and intelligent waiver occurred. And to the extent that there's a gap in the record on this point, I think the defendant is properly chargeable with that. I'd also like to return to the point that Justice Kennedy made earlier about the possibility that in some cases an attorney might be able to obtain suppression of incriminating evidence or might be able to negotiate with the prosecution about possible plea bargains. I think first it's noteworthy that the standard rule 11 colloquy mentions several constitutional rights that an individual gives up by pleading guilty, but it doesn't mention the possibility of suppressing evidence and it doesn't mention the possibility of plea bargaining. So it would be odd to think that you could have a constitutionally valid waiver even though the defendant was not informed of those substantive possibilities but would, nevertheless, have to be informed of the assistance that a lawyer might provide in connection with those --"

    "speech": "Mr. Stewart, do you know what the general practice is in Federal courts? Are there instructions given to prosecutors to make sure, for example, that the defendant at a guilty plea is told that maybe the -- that he has a right to a lawyer and he might be helpful?"

  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "Well, as to the -- it does -- Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in its current form says that if the defendant appears at the plea hearing without counsel, he is to be informed that he has a right to counsel at trial and at every other stage of the proceedings. So there's clearly a requirement that the defendant be made aware that he has a right to counsel at the plea hearing. Neither the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure nor the bench book for U.S. district judges requires that the defendant be given additional information about the services that an attorney might provide or the likelihood that an attorney could be helpful by --"

But I think if -- if we try to -- to think about how warnings about suppression and plea bargaining might work, I think we realize why the Iowa Supreme Court shied away from something like that because, on the one hand, if this Court instructed, as a matter of constitutional law, that whenever an uncounseled person pleads guilty, he has to be informed that in some cases it may be possible to suppress incriminating evidence and in some cases it may be possible to negotiate with the prosecution for a reduced charge, a lot of defendants are going to be given false hope because the possibility that those modes of procedure might succeed would vary enormously."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "Well, I -- I think those rules really do focus on things that will actually happen in any criminal trial if the defendant decides not to plead guilty. That is, the defendant is informed if you plead guilty, you are waiving the right either to testify or not testify on your own behalf. You're giving up the right to counsel. You're giving up the right to cross-examine witnesses. The defendant really is being told about things that are likely to occur in virtually any criminal trial, and I think that's -- that's the idea of a standardized plea colloquy. On -- on the other hand, if you're talking about suppression of evidence or talking about plea bargaining, if you give that advice in every case, it's often going to be misleading. A trial judge is going to find himself in the position of saying you might be able to bargain with the prosecution over a reduced charge even though he knows that the policy of the prosecutor is not to engage in plea bargaining with respect to a category of cases that includes that one."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Stewart, as I understand your argument, you're -- you're arguing not only are these warnings not constitutionally mandated, you're also saying  they're probably unwise in a number of situations. Are you arguing that they're so unwise that we should tell, as a matter of Federal law, a State judge could not give these warnings?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "No, I don't think there would be any Federal law barrier to States requiring warnings such as these. And I -- I think the -- the vacuous warnings, the warnings we regard as vacuous, that were mandated by the Iowa Supreme Court are less likely to be harmful than more specific warnings about -- But the other point I wanted to make is if the Court decided that it wouldn't be a good idea to warn about suppression of evidence or plea bargaining in every case but maybe it would be advisable to do that in some cases, that would really be thrusting trial judges in an untenable position because the point of having a standardized plea colloquy is to give judges a -- a safe harbor, to give them some assurance that if they provide standardized advice in every case, that's going to be enough. And if a trial judge had to decide is the likelihood of a successful plea negotiation sufficiently great in this particular case that the defendant should be advised about it or do I see a viable basis for asking for suppression of evidence, it would really make the trial judge's life much more difficult. And if the Court were  to hold, as a matter of constitutional law, that the trial judge is required to do that and can be reversed for failure to, it would really cause disruption."

These are the minimal standards required for a waiver of plea counsel."

  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Correct. The Iowa Supreme Court applied the rules of Patterson and Faretta, determining that a uncounseled defendant who chooses to plead guilty must be given a meaningful discussion regarding the usefulness of counsel at the plea proceeding and the dangers of proceeding pro se. The court determined that the best way to fulfill that obligation is to advise the defendant of the risks of overlooking potential defenses and of the loss of an independent opinion regarding his case."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "My -- I guess the difficulty that I have with that is no -- no question about the -- the soundness of those general statements, but they are so general that they -- they raise the question whether there are really very many defendants that don't know that to begin with and whether there is a real utility in requiring those warnings and hence paying the price in the mistaken cases when they're not given. Do -- do defendants really need this?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Yes. We simply cannot infer from the fact that a defendant is told that he has counsel or has a right to counsel that he necessarily understands the sort of assistance counsel could provide. The American Bar Association has discussed this particular problem in their criminal justice standards, specifically part 5, 8.1. The American Bar Association recognizes that to many defendants the word counsel may not necessarily have any clear meaning."

Yet, they do not require that you tell the lawyer how useful -- you tell the -- the individual how useful the lawyer will be. They do require that you tell the defendant how -- that he has a right to a lawyer at every stage of the proceeding. So I took from the fact that the ABA and everybody else lobby nonstop for this kind of thing that they felt it was very desirable but not so important that you had to actually include it in the colloquy. Otherwise, it would be there in rule 11(b). So now, what -- what does the ABA say? Do they say it's a constitutional requirement? Do they try to change even the rule? No. I don't think they do."

    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Not necessarily. Under -- under Patterson, under Faretta, even as -- back as far as Johnson v. Zerbst, this Court has required that any waiver of a constitutional right be a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent abandonment or relinquishment of a known right or privilege."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But, Ms. Wilson, you know, as to how much that requires, when we invented the Miranda warning, we -- we simply required that -- that the defendant be told you have a right to counsel. We didn't -- we didn't say that he be told, and by the way, the first thing counsel will tell you is to shut up, which would be very good advice. (Laughter.)"

    "speech": "The -- those particular warnings were used both in the Miranda case and in the Patterson case, Sixth Amendment right to counsel at post-indictment questioning. In both of those cases, a defendant still has other alternatives even if he does make statements to the police. He can attempt to recant his statement. He may have other available defenses. If a defendant appears before a court to enter a guilty plea uncounseled, that admission is going to be conclusive proof of guilt, leading to a final conviction that isn't revocable."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why -- even on this very record, when he came for the sentencing, the judge did say, as Judge Kennedy -- Justice Kennedy pointed out, that are you sure you don't want more time to consider having counsel. And one of the questions I was going to ask you is given that the judge was so solicitous at the sentencing hearing, could the defendant at that point have said, judge, I've thought about what I did at the plea hearing and I'd really like to withdraw my plea? I think you're right. I need more time to consult a lawyer."

It's okay. We'll hold it in abeyance and you talk to your lawyer."

At the time the court gave its discussion, I see you're appearing here today without counsel, do you wish to proceed pro se, the district court had no idea whether Mr. Tovar was going to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. And unfortunately, a defendant in that situation may come into a court believing that he does not have a right to counsel simply because he's going to plead guilty. Nothing that district court would have told him up to that point would have dissuaded him from such a belief."

But in fact, in the brief filed before the Iowa Supreme Court and the Iowa Court of Appeals, I did raise the fact that Mr. Tovar was not informed that he had a right to plea counsel, that the only discussion of the right to counsel at that plea hearing was in the context of the right to counsel at trial he was waiving."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Correct. The -- the reason that the issue of whether he was informed of plea counsel is important is because that is the first requirement for a valid waiver of counsel. The first requirement is an intentional relinquishment of a known right. This means that a defendant must be made aware that he has a constitutional right. According to Miranda v. Arizona, the only way to ensure that is to tell the defendant that he has the right."

This case essentially falls into a -- a gap between Patterson and Faretta. Both of those cases require some discussion regarding the usefulness of counsel and the dangers of proceeding pro se. The Iowa Supreme Court attempted to fill that gap by requiring these particular admonishments. But these admonishments reflect the core responsibility of defense counsel at a plea proceeding and also are responsibilities this Court has recognized in previous cases."

The majority -- about half of the jurisdictions in this Nation have not discussed this particular issue, waiver of counsel at a plea proceeding.

But I guess it -- it's -- this issue, though it hasn't been directly addressed in the brief, but obviously it's a concern of the States whether this may have retroactive effect or whether it's prospective effect as far as its effect on recidivist statutes. Mr. Tovar would argue that these standards, if adopted, could be applied prospectively because they do create a new rule.

But even assuming other jurisdictions do not use these particular standards, the burden upon the State will be alleviated for a number of reasons. First, if for example, Iowa wanted to use a guilty plea from another jurisdiction for enhancement, a defendant would have the burden of proof on a collateral attack. If these standards were not used, that may create a presumption that the waiver was invalid. However, the State could certainly attempt to prove the validity of the waiver through other means. In addition, if the other jurisdiction does not use these standards -- some of the claims are simply going to be time-barred. For example, in Iowa after direct appeal, there is a 3-year window of opportunity for a defendant to apply for post-conviction relief. So Mr. Tovar, who did not apply for a direct appeal of his guilty plea and did not for a post-conviction relief, would be time-barred from challenging it now. The --"

And one of the bases for sentencing is that 4 years ago he pleaded guilty to a similar crime but didn't get these waivers. Under Iowa law, could he challenge that 4-year- old conviction as an aggravating -- or whatever you want to call it on appeal from his present conviction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "I -- I would assume so, Your Honor. There's also a procedure in -- in Iowa law, Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 2.19(9) that would actually permit a defendant to challenge the use of that prior conviction prior to the sentencing enhancement. Now, the State may have an argument if he did not do that. Then the argument would be waived."

    "speech": "Is there any limit on how many years back you go for enhancing prior convictions?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What was the sentence imposed in this case for the -- for the third offense?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Third offense. It's -- the -- the particular sentence in this case was 180 days, all but 30 suspended, and a $2,500 fine. The maximum permitted by statute would be 5 years in prison. Also, I do want to address a point that I believe Justice Kennedy raised earlier regarding how counsel may have been useful here given that he -- given that Mr. Tovar received the mandatory minimum for a conviction in his 1996 guilty plea. It is true Mr. Tovar did receive the mandatory minimum for his conviction for OWI first. Unfortunately, under the statute in effect at the time, Mr. Tovar also would have been eligible for a deferred judgment. This is something apparently the prosecutor did not offer to Mr. Tovar and it's something the district court did not advise him regarding. It is something that had counsel been present, it would have benefitted Mr. Tovar who would have been a prime candidate for a deferred judgment. Also, I want to address the contention that a -- the factual basis discussion inherent in a guilty plea helps to ensure that a defendant is pleading guilty to the correct crime. Unfortunately, that's not always the case and I can provide an analogy. Defendant is charged with forgery for writing checks on another person's account. The district court holds a factual basis colloquy with the defendant, asks the defendant did you make out these checks, and before doing this, advises the defendant that it cannot accept his guilty plea unless it has a factual basis to support the conviction. The court asks the defendant, did you make out these checks? Defendant says, yes. Minutes of testimony don't indicate whether he signed his name or the other person's name. The defendant himself does not say at the guilty plea whether he signs his name or the other person's name. Under Iowa law, in order to be guilty of forgery, a person must do an act purporting to be the act of another. If defendant signs his own name to that check, it's not forgery."

    "speech": "Correct."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But I mean, even if we grant what you want in this case, judges will still be able to make mistakes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Correct, but unfortunately --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If he doesn't make a mistake, he would know all the elements of the crime. Right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Um-hum. And unfortunately, in -- in the situation of an uncounseled defendant, as in that case, the defendant wouldn't know that he's not legally guilty, that there was no factual --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But in this case -- this case I don't think you can raise any such --"

    "speech": "-- thing because it was a -- a blood alcohol test that did him in, and he didn't dispute the results of that test."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Correct. There may have -- in an OWI case, your mostly likely defenses are going to be suppression, implied consent. Mr. Tovar didn't make any of those challenges in this case. He may have had them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I'll ask you the same question I -- I asked of General Miller. If in fact the defendant here, Mr. Tovar, says, yes, I was guilty of driving under the influence and I know that the test said that and I don't disagree with it, what public policy is there to try to get him to change his mind because you might have suppressed some of that evidence?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "We're not attempting to make defendants change their mind. What Mr. Tovar and the Iowa Supreme Court is hoping to do is to ensure that a defendant knows exactly what they're getting into when they plead guilty, that they know that they have the availability of counsel and the basic services counsel can provide, and therefore they will be pleading guilty uncounseled with their eyes open. The -- the plea colloquy suggested -- or the waiver colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court is not unduly burdensome."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Can I ask? Like the Chief, I'm -- I'm not sure that as a matter of public policy I -- I even -- even like what -- what you're suggesting even if it were made very, very simple. That is to say, we've gone through the elements of the crime and you acknowledge that you've committed all of them. What you ought to know, however, is that if you got an attorney, he might find some gimmick that would allow you not to be convicted of this crime even though you have committed it. You should know that because it's your right, you know, to know that you can get off even where you're guilty. Now, is this something that we really want to encourage? (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So long as you've told the individual these are the elements, are you sure you did it, why -- why isn't that all that the State should require? We want to encourage people to -- to confess. We want to encourage people, when they're guilty, to pay what used to be called their just debt to society. Why do we want to encourage them to -- to hire a lawyer so that they'll get off on a -- on an irrelevancy?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "It is doubtful that these -- these -- well, I'll rephrase that. The colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court is certainly not going to prevent anyone from pleading guilty. The State speaks of the defendant who wants to expeditiously accept responsibility. That person is more than likely going to plead guilty regardless of the length of the colloquy given by the court. However, what -- the only person that may possibly be deterred by this sort of a colloquy is the defendant who's already experiencing doubts as to -- to his decision of whether to plead guilty."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Do you think it would be valuable in California to have somebody there to say, by the way, this is the second time you've stolen a chicken and if you plead guilty and do it again, you may go to jail the rest of your life? Or if you're in, say, Alaska, this seems to be an assault case but it's connected, in fact, with the charge of sexual assault. So if you plead guilty, the rest of your life you're going to have to be registered as a sex offender. Or to say, for example, if you're immigrant, you know, it may not seem to be important to you because it just happened to be hitting your child or something, you know, a slap or something like that, but you're going to be deported likely if you plead guilty. Would it be useful to have a lawyer there to tell them that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Absolutely, Your Honor, because the district court isn't necessarily required to tell the defendant such things and we're seeing in cases like Lockyear v. Andrade, Ewing v. California where petty offenses, because they are tied in with recidivist statutes, are creating life sentences. And it would make sense to have an attorney. If we're going to have this robust system of recidivist statutes, then we should also have a robust system of safeguards to ensure that a defendant's due process rights are protected. The -- the plea -- the waiver colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court is not going to inhibit the plea process. Again, it's adding a few lines to the colloquy that's already required for the acceptance of guilty pleas. Furthermore, such a standard would actually assist the State in the long run. These standards places the waiver colloquy on the record for all to see. This assists not only the initial court in making the waiver decision as an initial decision, but it also assists any future court that may have to make a determination of the validity of the waiver."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, if the Iowa Supreme Court thinks so, it could put it in the Iowa rules."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And that -- that's how it would be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Correct. They could do that."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In this case, the Iowa Supreme Court is projecting what it would be law for the Nation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Correct. It was making an interpretation of -- of Patterson and Faretta to the plea context. That's correct. But for all these reasons, we would respectfully request that this Court affirm the decision of the Iowa Supreme Court."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Thank you, Ms. Wilson. General Miller, you have 4 minutes remaining."

    "speaker": "MILLER",
    "speech": "I would just pick up on -- on Justice Ginsburg's question or comment there that in terms of usefulness of counsel, there's a -- you know, we've explored a lot of difficulties and cross currents here today. What should happen is the States, as a matter of -- of the legislature or as a matter of the -- the court, making rules that -- that deal with these issues, rather than having a constitutional mandate for the whole country. With that, I would close except if there are other questions from the Court."
