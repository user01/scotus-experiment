    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The propriety of any section 5 legislation is judged by in reference to the historical perspective that it reflects, and that historical perspective is very clear in -- and it's set very clearly by Congress and by this Court. It -- it is an unfortunate, long history of State-sponsored gender discrimination. And those -- that discrimination embodies gender-based stereotypes that took a very firm hold in the employment area, where women had difficulty obtaining employment and holding employment. And this Court in a litany of cases recognized these gender-based stereotypes as -- as an improper assumption about women's abilities. In Frontiero v. Richardson, it rejected this issue that women's mission were to be women -- to be wives and mothers; Stanton v. Stanton, that women were to be the homemaker and men the breadwinner, and --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "Well, Mr. Foreman, I guess the question in this case is what this particular statutory provision has to do with gender discrimination and the history of gender discrimination, whether Congress was aiming to eradicate gender discrimination through this provision or whether it was trying to do something else entirely."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "And it was directly attempting to address these gender-based stereotypes in a couple different ways as a practical matter. At that time, when an employer saw a woman, they didn't necessarily just see a worker. They saw a person that could become pregnant, and worked on these gender-based stereotypes, that that woman would either become pregnant, would be disabled because of pregnancy-related disabilities but, in any event, was a least -- least attractive employee. And the Family and Medical Leave Act addresses that specifically in its purposes section. It specifically says that is intended to promote the equal opportunity for women and men pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause. But more specific to the self-care provision, Congress made it very clear what they were attempting to do. If you move to the \"findings\" section, first, in finding number 6, they address --"

  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "I am reading from Appendix A to the brief, and it is -- that employment standards that apply to one gender only have a serious potential for encouraging employers to discriminate against employees and applicants of employment who are of that gender. That's the negative inference argument that we make in our brief. But even more to the point, if you move to the purpose sections at appendix 2, page appendix 2, it specifically is intended to minimize the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons, including maternity-related disabilities and for compelling family reasons, and to ensure equal protection under the law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, following up on Justice Kagan's question, I have -- I have difficulty seeing how providing 12 weeks of leave for self-care for both men and women affects the incentive of an employer who we will assume has an inclination to discriminate against women based on the possibility that a woman applicant for employment may become pregnant. I just don't see how that would affect the incentives of -- of an employer in that situation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "The rationale of Congress at that point was that they could have addressed this issue several different ways. They -- and they passed (A), (B), and (C) -- the birth of the child, the adoption of the child, and the Family and Medical Leave Act -- against -- again, addressing gender-based stereotypes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, (A) is not at issue, right? Okay. So, we're just dealing with (D), which concerns a serious health condition. So, you have an employer who is willing to discriminate on the basis of gender. The employer has two applicants for employment, a man and a woman, and the employer says, well, if I hire the man, he might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious medical condition, and if I hire the woman, she might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious medical condition which might be something that either men or women could get, or it also could be a sickness related to pregnancy. So, there still is -- there still would be an incentive for this hypothetical employer to discriminate against the woman."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "But one of the things Congress tried to do is to take that incentive away."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "How does it do that? That's what I'm -- I understand that, and it's a worthy objective. I just don't understand how giving both men and women 12 weeks of leave for self-care affects the incentive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "It affects the incentive by providing -- it becomes the equal opportunity employer. It evens the -- the ground. And the way it would do it is an employer, if you just have (A) through (C), can look at an employee and, based upon gender stereotypes, would make the assumption that the women, because of historically the role they were required to play, would be taking all the leave under (A) and (B) and (C). And so, why would I even hire that woman in the first place?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "But women don't get sick less often than men, do they?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "No, absolutely."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "So, you're just adding something to both sides of the balance, and it doesn't affect the employer's incentive. The employer still -- the -- the hypothetical discriminatory employer would still say, well, women are going to be caregivers more often; so, I'm -- I'm going to not hire that person."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "But under (A), (B), and (C) after the Family and Medical Leave, an employer would look and say both men can take these now. And I think we need to step back --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "And that's why (A), (B), and (C) go to the problem, but what does (D) have to do with it? If you assume that both men and women get sick at an approximately equal rate -- maybe you don't assume that -- but if you do, it doesn't seem to factor into the employer's incentives in any way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "There is nothing in the record that demonstrates that there's a differential rate between the self-care rates for men and women. But the perception was that women, because of pregnancy, because of pregnancy-related disabilities, would in fact take more leave. And so that I would look at a woman as an employer and say she will become pregnant, she will take leave, she will be disabled. However, with (D) now, but the man can take a -- a disability leave on the same basis. And the hope of Congress was not that it would happen immediately, but by the -- what would happen is, with the application of family and medical leave, at some point men would be taking (A), (B), and (C), and, in fact, women and men would be taking family and medical self-care leave. I just --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Foreman, I think everyone has been trying to get you to focus on the health care sickness leave alone, and in the -- in the portions of the Act that this Court upheld, the Congress said there is this close association of women with children; we think it's going to be good for everybody if fathers recognize their responsibility for elderly parents, sick children, sick spouse. So, we -- we can see the rationale, trying to change the stereotype, trying to open up caregiving for both sexes. But you have answered the question that women and men get sick; there's no -- there's no disproportion. So, how do you tie that, just -- just that part of the Act, where there -- there isn't the obvious association of women with childbearing? So, we extend the benefit to men so they'll be associated with child care. There isn't that same link here, is there?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "I think it is the same linkage trying to address -- it's addressing a difference there, but it's addressing the linkage that women will in fact take pregnancy-based leave or pregnancy-based disabilities and, therefore, are less attractive, less -- employees, and that's what self-care was intended to do."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "So, you're saying -- let me just make sure I understand. You're saying that the -- that Congress is thinking that an employer actually does think that women take more sick leave because women get pregnant. And just as Congress was thinking about the employer who thought women are going to take more family leave, you think Congress was thinking about the employer who thinks women are also going to take more sick leave because of pregnancy?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "Absolutely, Your Honor. And in response to Justice Alito's question -- and I'm sorry if I gave a confusing response. There are two separate ways of addressing that. You can look at self-care as a stand-alone provision, without (A), (B), and (C). Congress passed just self-care. In that case it would be responding to exactly that type of gender stereotype, and 12 weeks would be a congruent and proportional response. The other way to look at it is that's not the way Congress passed the bill. They passed it as a comprehensive response with (A), (B), and (C), and hence (D) then becomes a bit of an equalizer to take away this negative incentive that only women would take (A), (B), and (C). So, there's two separate ways that this Court can get to the same conclusion, and that conclusion is that this is a congruent and proportional response to gender-based discrimination."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "Do you have any evidence that Congress in fact was thinking about either of these two things? Is there anything in the record that suggests either of those two theories?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "Yes, there -- there is, Your Honor, and let me -- let me take the negative inference first, because I think looking at the statute as a comprehensive makes sense -- is it was introduced -- and I'm reading from page 43. It's referenced on page 43 of our brief, that starting in 1987, National Women's Political Caucus testified, quote: \"My primary purpose is to stress that parental and medical leave are inseparable. In the words of the old song, 'You can't have one without the other.'\" And the point she then later on to explain was parental leave without medical leave would encourage discrimination against women of child-bearing age, who constitute approximately 73 percent of all women in the workforce. Employers would tend to hire men, who are much less likely to make this claim. Fast forward to 1993 at the time of the passage of -- and this would be on page 42 of our merits brief: \"A law providing special protection to women or any defined group, in addition to being inequitable, runs the risk of causing discrimination.\" The FML addresses this by addressing the needs of all workers, avoids this risk. The FMLA is based on the guarantees of equal protection. So, it addresses that aspect of -- it addresses that aspect."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Counselor, I -- I take your argument, but if you look at the legislative record, the reports, the findings, et cetera, and the statements repeatedly by many congresspeople, there appears to be -- have been a dual motive for this provision. They were, in fact, engaged in the question of discrimination against pregnant women. That was recognized in Hibbs, and that's clear. But with respect to this particular provision, they were also concerned about economic effect that -- that happened to everyone, men and women, who became disabled. And so, they appear to have had dual motivation. Part of the bill was gender-related; part of the bill seemed to be disability-related. What do -- how do we judge that kind of bill, where Congress may have been expanding the benefits it's giving to people, not solely because of gender discrimination, but because of this desire to address disability discrimination?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "Justice Sotomayor, I -- I think the way you judge it is rely on what Congress's expressed findings and provisions are. And to the extent this Court makes a determination that the FMLA is responsive to gender-based discrimination, then how Congress chose to address that is congruent and proportional. The fact that Congress may also have had other motives, that there was a concern with -- with families and that families are -- benefit should not be used to undermine the fact that Congress indeed was acting pursuant to one of its broadest powers, section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, therefore, that their -- their considered judgment is a congruent and proportional response. Part of -- part of the findings is clearly reflective of a fact that this covered both governmental employers and private industry. So, there was reference to Commerce Clause type of -- of analysis, which my colleagues raised repeatedly in their brief. But the court -- the Congress needed to do that because they were regulating private employment but, at the same time, recognized to the extent that we are -- are going to regulate State-based conduct."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, with respect to the Commerce Clause, could I ask you this: If we were to disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment and hold that it -- that Congress didn't validly abrogate State sovereign immunity with respect to subsection (D), would your client still be able to seek reinstatement or other injunctive relief?"

And the answer is -- and I know that both Justice Kennedy and Justice Rehnquist, I think, in one of his dissents, pointed out in the Family and Medical Leave Act that the employee may not be left out in the dark because there is an Ex parte Young claim. A couple points on that --"

But as -- as you pointed out in your dissent in Hibbs, that Ex parte Young may be available, but one of the concerns we have is, again, that the Court -- as a majority, the Court has never held that. I believe that is in fact the correct interpretation of the law, that it would be available for injunctive relief. However, the Court has never defined the parameters of what an Ex parte Young action really gives a plaintiff, and that becomes very important in this case."

The University of Tennessee -- Texas, a -- the case that dealt with -- exactly with this issue of abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, and they found that there was valid abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, the State of Texas -- then the court was required to address the Ex parte Young issue. And the State of Texas argued that reinstatement is not an appropriate remedy under Ex parte Young and that -- while the Fifth Circuit ultimately rejected that, that is an argument that employees would have to face: What are the parameters of Ex parte Young? And, more importantly, that is not the remedy that Congress in their considered judgment believed was the appropriate remedy to address gender-based discrimination."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Well, Congress must have thought that giving the woman back her job was an important part. I mean, I thought the whole idea is she wasn't supposed to be fired. So, I think that the -- the relief, the non-monetary relief, is certainly important."

  {
    "speaker": "FOREMAN",
    "speech": "It is extremely important, but Congress did not stop there. Congress decided it needed to take one step further and there needed to be monetary relief. And I think Mr. Coleman's case illustrates exactly why. Here Mr. Coleman exercised his rights that were supposedly guaranteed him under the Family and Medical Leave Act, and indeed under a State law, and the State of Maryland fired him, and he is out of work. And what is the disincentive for the State to not do the same thing the next time if the only thing that you can get is possibly injunctive relief prohibiting them from doing that in the future and maybe reinstatement 2 or 3 years down the line? Employees at that point cannot put their lives on hold. They have a duty to go out and try to mitigate, try to find another job. What's an employer to do? And Congress said there needs to be more. We passed Title VII to try to address gender-based discrimination, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, but there were still voids. And the Family and Medical Leave Act attempts to fill those voids, and one of those voids is try to provide a monetary incentive so that the State of Maryland and private employers will in fact comply with the law."

So here, employers think of women as needing more medical leave because of pregnancy, and the response of Congress is to provide gender-neutral sick leave. So, what is your response to that argument?"

In fact, Mr. Foreman has conceded as much. And that same study projects that men and women will take roughly the same amount of time after the enactment of the FMLA --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "But there certainly was -- there was certainly much conversation and testimony that, whether they in fact took the same amount of leave time or not, that women who were pregnant or were perceived as capable of getting pregnant were hired less frequently because, subjectively, the employers thought that they were more likely to take the time. So, frankly, for years there was questions about whether law firms were hiring young -- not hiring young women because they feared they would leave in the middle of a big case or something else. We all know those stories. So, it is sort of common knowledge in many ways, but there was plenty of testimony related to that. So, assume that that was Congress's perception, because it was supported by the record or as much of the record as Hibbs recognized as adequate. Where does that leave your argument?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HOWARD",
    "speech": "Well, I would make a couple of points in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was already in place. And so, to the extent there were perceptions that employers might discriminate based on pregnancy disabilities, that would be unlawful under Title VII as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. And the fact that -- and you are quite right that there is a fair amount of discussion in the legislative record, although I think it's less of a predominant theme than the concern for job security for working families, but there certainly is discussion about pregnancy discrimination and pregnancy disability as a type of illness. But we again would note that this is valid Commerce Clause legislation. And so, to the extent that kind of discrimination was occurring and leave was being denied or women were suffering adverse consequences in the workplace as a result of pregnancy discrimination, they could enforce the 12 weeks through a Title VII action."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "They couldn't -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act says that you have to treat pregnancy like any other disability. So, if they're not giving anybody any leave for anything, they don't have to give any leave; not 12 weeks, not 1 day. And that's what -- that's the gap that this legislation fills. It says, yes, you do have to provide leave for women who have disabling conditions, including pregnancy, but then you have to give that to men as well. You can't reserve that for the one sex. So, it was the gap in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act that this -- this was referring to."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HOWARD",
    "speech": "Yes, I agree, Justice Ginsburg, but the gap that existed was the absence of a guaranteed period of leave. In other words, it was the absence of a substantive entitlement, and so -- to a certain amount of leave. And, in effect, the gap that was being filled served as prophylaxis for Title VII but not for constitutional violations. Now --"

So, giving everybody 12 weeks eliminates the -- the possibility that women -- women who will be -- want to take additional -- will want to take more sick leave will be fired because they exceed the amount of sick leave allowed by the employer for everybody. Now, isn't that connected to eliminating discrimination in employment?"

    "speaker": "HOWARD",
    "speech": "Justice Alito, I think that one could argue that that is connected with eliminating pregnancy disability discrimination. It's also connected to the purposes of (A), (B), and (C). I think that the principal reason why employers do view potential hires as -- when they're women, as likely to take a lot of time off I think goes more to the family caretaking provisions, and I think that's largely reflected in the record."

If an employer says you get 2 weeks of sick leave, period; after that, if you can't come back, you're fired -- that may -- at least for applicants within a certain age range, that may have a much more severe or a more severe impact on women than on men."

And, of course, if States were engaging in this kind of conduct or if there were a disproportionate impact, that would not state an equal protection violation under Washington v. --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Why are you separating four things? I mean, I've heard, it seems to me, three separate rationales. One, the easiest, is in (D) itself. Sometimes a woman could have a miscarriage, and of course she has to stay home. And that isn't covered by (A), (B), or (C). So, we cover it in (D), you know. And then we put the men in too because we don't want to make this incentive just to not hire women. That's one. The second one was the one Justice Ginsburg brought up, that there is a gap in the pregnancy law which won't work unless you have to give people some medical leave. So, here it is, (D). And the third one, which I think was related to what Justice Alito just said, is when -- you have to read it together to understand the third one. You get 12 weeks all together. All right? Now, that means, once you put in (D), this Act will have less of a bad effect. The bad effect of the Act is if you protect the women, then the -- the employers say, well, we're not going to hire women, perfect; we have to give them 12 leaves; we'd have to give the men -- terrible, it's a terrible disincentive. But then they worked out how to lessen the disincentive. And the way you do that, you say 12 weeks overall. And now look what happens. A woman wants to take, say, 12 weeks to look after her family, and she gets separately sick, 4 more weeks. But how many does she get? Answer: Twelve, right? Twelve. You could answer that part. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Now let's think of the man. Let's think of the man. The man would like to look after the family, say, for 6 weeks. And he gets sick 4 weeks. How many weeks have we got?"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",

  {
    "speaker": "HOWARD",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "But now look what happens. Without this Act, he's got a woman who is going to be out of there -- I mean, with the Act -- see, unless we put in four -- unless we put in the fourth part of it, we have a woman who's gone for 12 weeks and a man who's gone maybe for 6 but maybe for zero, okay? Maybe for 6. With the Act, the woman's gone for 12, the man's gone for 10. You see? And so, the comparison there -- and it will work with whatever numbers you want. The comparison there is very different. And the comparison doesn't -- doesn't totally erase the problem with the woman, but it may reduce it to a size where the Act itself will no longer act as such a disincentive to hiring a woman. We have three different rationales. All of them are related to a serious problem, which is the problem of discrimination against women because the employers think they'll be home more. And so, you see the conclusion I'm drawing? Yes, okay. So -- so, where are we?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HOWARD",
    "speech": "Well, let me speak first to the second one, the concern about the gap. The gap that is filled by the 12 weeks is -- is a -- is to provide a substantive entitlement. And when it permits a claim, a damages claim enforceable against a State treasury, it provides an entirely -- it requires a different justification than simply to fill a gap with a substantive entitlement. It becomes --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "The idea is it's part of one package. I think that's what Justice Breyer was getting at. But just suppose that Congress wanted to improve conditions for the -- in the job market for women, which I think it's fair to say was the motivating force behind this Act, and they also wanted to protect families so that sick children, sick spouses are attended to. Now, what leave policy would say, okay, to do that, we will have leave when a spouse is sick, a child is sick, a parent is sick, but not when the worker herself is sick? Without -- it's all part of one package which is designed to increase job security for women and increase protection for their families. So, I don't think you can slice off (D) from the other three."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HOWARD",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, I think you can separate (D) on the same analysis that this Court applied in Tennessee v. Lane, in contrast to the Garrett case. In Lane, of course, different sections of the same Antidiscrimination Act required different analysis -- analyses and reference to different parts of the record. There was a single over-arching purpose, to prevent discrimination against persons with disabilities, but the operation and effect of the particular claim requires a different analysis. As Justice Stevens said, the Court is not required to evaluate statutes as an undifferentiated whole."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "No, it doesn't have to, of course. But the whole point of the question that I was asking was, sure, what helps you by doing it separately is it helps your case. But if we look at what Congress was trying to do, they were trying to do it as a whole. That's my point that I want you to answer. And they're trying to do it as a whole because, no matter what numbers I use, if I look at it without (D) -- is it (D)? Yes, (D). If I look at it without (D), the ratio will disfavor the woman. And if I look at it with (D), suddenly the ratio from the point of view of the employer of the disadvantage of hiring a woman over -- over hiring a man -- it goes way down. And that helps women. And that is why, I think -- reading this and listening, a major reason why they put in (D) as part of the other, because working with that 12-week limitation and the whole rest of the statute, we now have a statute that doesn't defeat itself. We now have a statute that actually can achieve the end of leading employers to not discriminate against women. Not perfectly, but there's a big improvement. And that's the -- that's the argument I'm making. You have to read it as a whole to see that. And that's what I -- I wonder if there's an answer to that. Of course, I'm at the moment thinking there isn't an answer to it, but I asked the question because I want to hear what you say."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HOWARD",
    "speech": "Well, with respect to the ratio, I think the premise of that point is that women will take more leave for serious health conditions than men. And I don't think that's borne out. And, you know, Mr. Foreman has recognized as much. So, I don't think the ratio really changes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, what if Congress had added three additional subsections here and said that an employer has to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that an employee can go to a health spa, 12 weeks of unpaid leave for -- so that the employee can travel, 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that the employee can take an educational course? Now, that -- those could be taken advantage of by either men and women. It makes both men and women increasingly unattractive as employees and, therefore, reduces the any special disincentive that might have been created by (A), (B), and (C). Now, on that same logic, would those be -- would those be provisions that further the elimination of discrimination based on gender?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HOWARD",
    "speech": "I -- I think even if one accepted the premise, and we don't, that women take more leave for health conditions, that would further dilute the ratio, to have available all those types of leave. Now, I thought, for example, one could imagine --"

But I mean, I don't want to put arguments in your mouth, which I just have, which you wouldn't like there anyway, because -- but I would appreciate your going on with this discussion in respect to what Justice Alito and I have been talking about, and I'd be interested in what you think."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "HOWARD",

And then there was also concern against discrimination against persons with illness. But I think that one thing I'd like to emphasize is that your -- your suggestion, Justice Sotomayor, and -- and really almost all of the discussion here today, I think, explains why this is good social policy. We support it. But I don't think that we've really gotten anywhere near the necessary predicate of unconstitutional State conduct when the constitutional right is defined with some precision. And I -- and I think one has to define this right as -- as disability.

But when you look at (D) as passed at the same moment on the basis of the same record as (A), (B), and (C), with the overwhelming purpose of Congress being to protect women from discrimination in the workplace because of unfair stereotypical -- views about what women do as workers, then (D) assumes a different kind of aura. And you can talk about a number of theories for that, but I guess I would just ask for your -- your reaction to that, that (D) is just part of a package which was about telling employers: Get rid of your old stereotypes. Don't act on your old stereotypes. Employ women."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HOWARD",
    "speech": "Well, I -- I would respond in part -- and I'm going to accept your proposition that I should discuss these provisions as part of a single package. But from the standpoint of States, subsection (D) provides a separate claim, a separate basis to sue States, and we think that claim is incongruent and disproportionate to any conceivable unconstitutional conduct that it might prohibit. And I think this is borne out in the case law. We've surveyed the 40 Federal cases that we could find under subsection (D). Only two involve pregnancy-related disabilities. Only one of them alludes in passing to headaches arising from pregnancy along with other stress-related conditions. But -- but all of the others really have to do with men and women benefiting from this leave for -- to care for a serious health condition. So, I -- I would really emphasize, in response to your question, that one could look at it as a package, but from the standpoint of States, it's a separate and independent claim, and it's an extraordinarily broad one. And it is not necessary, not simply because Pregnancy Discrimination Act claims are available, but, Justice Alito, there are Ex parte Young claims available. In -- in response to your question, in this case at the Joint Appendix pages 3 to 12, the amended complaint reveals that injunctive relief was sought, albeit -- and on page 12 is the prayer for relief. It's -- it's not clear whether that relief is sought under Title VII or FMLA or both. But the reason why I don't think -- the claim fails separate and apart from any sovereign immunity argument. Of course, Ex parte Young is not -- does not protect on that ground."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But there's some focus in the legislative history particularly on the -- the family that has a single parent -- much more often a woman, not a man -- and the devastating impact on that family of the woman getting sick, the sole breadwinner getting sick. So, that was certainly an -- a problem for families with -- with only one breadwinner. And Congress was focusing on those women and wanting to have job security for them. That wasn't the only group of women, but certainly that -- that affected the -- this Act as it came out, didn't it?"
