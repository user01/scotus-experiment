And that is, if we know these parties have agreed to arbitrate ­­ this is in the first options. It's in lots of cases ­­ if we know you and I have agreed to arbitrate so that there's an arbitration agreement, we're going to assume that all of the cases fall into the bucket of arbitrability, and that's a fair common­sense presumption. But what the Court said in Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court in Granite Rock is that the question of whether there's an enforceable arbitration agreement at all is not ­­ is a State law question, not a Federal law question, and here's the reason. There are two interpretive principles under the Federal Arbitration Act.

We can't presume that you and I intend to arbitrate because that's the question we're asking. And the most important thing for you to understand about the nature of this Section 9 in the contract is that it does determine whether there is going to be any arbitration at all in California.

That's what it says. Now, would the law of California find the agreement \"dispense with class action\" procedure unenforceable? The answer to that question is clearly no. Because they did have a law like that, but it was invalid. So in order to read this in your favor, you'd have to say these words: If, however, the law of your State would find this agreement, you have to read it as saying, if, however the invalid law of your State would find this agreement to dispense with class action unenforceable, then. Now, nobody ­­ it's very hard to say that the parties meant if the invalid law of your State would find it and, therefore, contract interpretation is a question of law, this question of law was decided by California to read the word \"law\" as \"invalid law,\" there is no case in California or anywhere else, to our knowledge, that has interpreted contracts in such way out of the arbitration context, and therefore, this rule of law interpreting this word this way is discriminating against arbitration.

      "speech": "I mean, I just don't want to ­­ I don't want to play around with words, Your Honor, about nonsensical or not. I think you and I are basically on the same page about the FAA principle. Here's what I have in terms of why this is not remotely outside the bounds, why, if you write an opinion reversing here, you are going to invite an enormous amount of second­guessing of State law contract interpretation. The first is that Section 10 of the contract expressly contrasts State and Federal law; that is, it says the law of your State, and then distinguishes Federal law from that. The second is, as Justice Ginsburg says, why is it the parties even referred to State law at all if what they are talking about is just \"it would be invalid.\" The third is both before this contract and after this contract, DIRECTV wrote this contract very differently in the way that it now says this contract means, and it says if it would be found invalid, and as was mentioned in the first half hour, every other Fortune 500 company wrote it that way as well. So there are a whole series of very good contrasts for us. I also have what I think is the pushback to the intuition that DIRECTV really must have always intended for the contract to pick up Federal preemption law. And here's the reason why that's not right: DIRECTV claims and has applied the power to unilaterally change this contract, and that is a huge deal in the ­­ in the context of a national form contract. Here's what happened here: DIRECTV put this into the contract in 2006 before AT&T v. Concepcion was a glimmer in anyone's eye at all. And it referred to State law, and everybody agrees at that time that California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act was going to control and was going to prevent any arbitration in California whatsoever. DIRECTV filed an amicus brief in Concepcion saying we will not arbitrate with anyone in California before the court's decision in Concepcion. And the way that DIRECTV intended to account for changes in the law is that they would change the contract unilaterally when the law changed, and I can prove it. In the wake of Concepcion, DIRECTV rewrote the contract. It did it before the California Court of Appeals' decision in this case. DIRECTV had another mechanism fully available to it that would account for the idea that now, under the Federal Arbitration Act, the State can't forbid class action waivers. It didn't need this contract to do anything other than to pick up existing California law. And I will add a couple of other points just about whether, as a matter of Federal law, you would want to say that right now we have to go to arbitration. Remember, DIRECTV's position is in the teeth of the efficiency of the Federal Arbitration Act. Its view is that the parties intended that three years into the litigation, what they would want is to blow up the litigation and send everybody to thousands of individual arbitrations. That is an extremely implausible interpretation of what the parties would want if their goal was to have an efficient dispute resolution mechanism. And so what I'm ­­ the point that I'm trying to make, Your Honors, is while I am sympathetic to the concern, and it may be a concern directed at California in particular, that we need to be attentive to whether or not those courts are discriminating against arbitration. My point to you is that you may believe this is wrong, like you were concerned in Oxford Health that the arbitrator had got it wrong, but you have to adopt a legal rule here. And there are too many points in favor of the California Court of Appeals' decision to say that this is wildly out of bounds and have an administrable legal rule that the lower courts can actually apply. You can say it's way out of bounds; you could say it's nonsensical. But then the lower courts are going to look at what happened here, and they are not going to view it as something that is just wildly impossible."

And I think the way you show that is you say, well, look, here they found a number of provisions illegal, and they struck the whole thing. Here, every other case that's not about arbitration, when they find a couple of provisions illegal, they just sever those; they keep ­­ you know, try to keep in effect the rest of the agreement. That's a different rule for arbitration contracts than other contracts. It's not a question of way out of bounds or way in bounds. It may be a hard question in some cases; it may be easy in others.

What Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act asks is, is there an agreement with ­­ to resolve any disputes by arbitration? And what Section 9 tells you in the States where it is effective, where the ­­ what we call the blowup clause takes effect, is that in all of those States, DIRECTV will not arbitrate with individuals, it will not arbitrate with respect to class arbitration. If I could just give you the reasons we know that's true. DIRECTV filed an amicus brief in Concepcion saying we do not arbitrate with anybody in California. It then ­­ and you can see this in the Stevens declaration in opposition to the motion to compel arbitration said we have gotten 215 small claims requests related to these early termination fees, which is ­­ and in court, which is the subject matter of our complaint. And we have arbitrated with one party. So what was going on ­­ and so there ­­ in California, DIRECTV was arbitrating with no one whatsoever because of this contractual provision. And that brings it not within the Volt principle, Your Honor. We interpret ­­ when we have an arbitration agreement, we're going to put things into the bucket, your argument ­­ your ­­ your point, Your Honor, about scope when it comes to safety disputes. But rather, within Granite Rock, which said quite expressly, what we are ­­ when we are talking about the antecedent question, we're trying to figure out if you and I have agreed to arbitrate any subjects whatsoever. When we're in that circumstance, we can't presume that we are arbitrating, because the first principle of the Federal Arbitration Act is to not force people to arbitrate when they haven't intended, and to require people to arbitrate when they have. So, Justice Kennedy, the distinction I was drawing with Justice Alito is if we had an arbitration agreement and we were trying to figure out if, say, class cases were in and individual cases were out, it would make a little bit more sense to say we're going to presume and resolve ambiguities in favor of putting class cases in. But this is not that situation. It is the question whether we are going to arbitrate with anyone. Now, that is not to say that Federal ­­"

So we have, on the one hand, the risks that we'll get into, too many State law cases, if we take their side. On the other hand, there is the risk that they'll run around our decisions. Now, when you get to that second thing, even though I dissented, I think it's an extremely important thing in a country which has only nine judges here and thousands of judges in other places who must follow our decisions ­­ and think of the desegregation matters, et cetera ­­ that we be pretty firm on saying you can't run around our decisions, even if they're decisions that I disagree with, okay?

    {
      "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
      "speech": "Justice Breyer, there's one threshold point that needs to be made, and that is five members of the Court in Concepcion, as I understand their opinions, would not have applied Concepcion in this circumstance. They would not extend it here whatsoever, because the four members of the Court who ­­ you and the other members of the Court who agreed with it would not extend it to the circumstance in which the parties have agreed by contract. And Justice Thomas explained in his opinion in that case that the opinion there ­­ that the ­­ the principle opinion depended on obstacle preemption, and there is no argument here that this case implicates obstacle preemption because it's a question of contract law. So at the threshold, I don't think Concepcion would apply here at all. But your question is bigger. And that is, look, I'm concerned that if we, as the Supreme Court ­­ U.S. Supreme Court articulate a question of Federal law, particularly on a statute that's as important as the Federal Arbitration Act, particularly on a statute that is ­­ is rooted in a concern about hostility of the State courts, we have to show people that we're serious. A couple of things about that. First is, we know the California courts are serious in the wake of ­­ excuse me. We have filed a supplemental brief. The California Supreme Court has decided a case called Sanchez. And Sanchez dealt with the contract that is written like every other Fortune 500 contract is. And it talks about if the ­­ the provision barring class action waivers would be deemed invalid. And the California Supreme Court said that's controlled by Concepcion. That is an enforceable arbitration agreement right there. And so now we are dancing on the head of the pin about one contract that's entirely defunct, and the question of whether the reference to State law, when contrasted in another provision of the contract with Federal law, is so far out of bounds. I think that what you have to do is compare two prospects, Justice Breyer. One is the concern. And we recognize the concern that if you write in an opinion that says, nah, we're not going to take too hard a look, that the State courts will run wild. All I can tell you is that there really isn't evidence of that happening at all. And the Court has doctrines like discrimination against arbitration that can handle it. The second is a reality. We know for a fact that if you announce an opinion that says, this interpretation of State law ­­ because we know what the California law is here. The California Court of Appeals has told us. This interpretation of State law is just too bad and invalidated my arbitration agreement, that's now a question of Federal law, and we are going to relitigate what State law means. That is a boundless rule that is going to be invoked in every single arbitration case. And so you just have to choose between those two prospects. One is you know what will happen. You will be going against the very first principle of Federal arbitration law, which is that we look to State law in determining whether an arbitration agreement is formed, or you have the hypothetical prospect. And what I can say to Your Honor is we have a legislature that is there in the event that the hypothetical prospect comes to pass. We have doctrines to deal with this. I am just terribly worried about how it is that you write an opinion that says this is not just wrong, it's really really wrong, and explain why in the face of the other things in this contract, the contrast with other contracts that I have given you are out there. You do retain the possibility, of course, of not deciding the case at all in the wake of Sanchez, why it is that we need to have an opinion about this, given that this is a contract that doesn't exist anymore, and the California Court of Appeals has resolved it is a question that ­­ that is, you know, very difficult to answer. But if you are going to write an opinion in the case, please do not do it in a way that just invites litigation upon litigation upon litigation because you, as in Oxford Health, are concerned that this Court got it wrong, just like you were concerned that the arbitrator got it wrong. It is an unfortunate cost of the Federal system that Congress decided this is the job of the Federal courts. Not everything is a Federal case. If there are no further questions."

We are ­­ in this case, this Court is reviewing what a court did. You're not reviewing it under the arguable standard. It's a very different standard.
