      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals was without authority to grant habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1) on respondent's ineffective assistance of counsel claim for two reasons: first, because the State court decision rejecting the claim correctly identified this Court's decision in Strickland v. Washington as the clearly established Federal law governing this case, not United States v. Cronic as respondent contends; and second, because the State court's application of Strickland to the facts of respondent's case was not objectively unreasonable. Turning to the first point, respondent's ineffective assistance claim from the outset of this case has asserted two specific errors that his attorney allegedly committed during the sentencing phase of his capital trial: first, counsel's alleged failure to present available mitigating evidence; and second, his counsel's decision to waive closing argument. This Court held in Strickland that such claims are properly analyzed under the two-part actual deficient performance/actual prejudice test announced in that case itself."

He vigorously objected and -- to the admission of some very gruesome crime scene photographs that the prosecution sought to introduce to establish the heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating circumstance, and he succeeded in excluding that testimony.

The actual ineffectiveness claims Mr. Hutton's client raises are twofold. He complains that available mitigating evidence was not presented, but the record simply does not support that claim. Counsel was under no obligation to reintroduce the mental health evidence that had been introduced during the guilt phase because Tennessee State law specifically allows counsel to rely on guilt phase evidence. As I earlier indicated, counsel specifically explained the mitigating significance of that evidence to the jury during his opening statement and related it to three specific statutory mitigating circumstances."

The only question to be resolved here is whether the State court's rejection of the claim was either contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established law.

No evidence was presented to the State post-conviction court that the Bronze Star, other than the fact of its award and the fact that of -- that it indicated Mr. Cone had been decorated -- no evidence elaborating on that was ever presented to the State courts. Similarly, no evidence concerning Mr. Cone's family background, social history, military record, educational record, none of the evidence that Mr. Hutton complains was not presented during the sentencing phase was ever presented to the State courts during the post- conviction hearing. Accordingly, under this Court's decision in Burger v. Kemp, we say that the State courts reasonably concluded that there was no deficient performance in -- in that regard in this case because no record was ever made in the State court concerning what the allegedly available mitigating evidence might have been. No testimony was introduced indicating what these witnesses who allegedly had knowledge concerning these matters would have said had they been called at the sentencing."

In fact, one of respondent's own experts at the State post- conviction hearing stated that he had waived closing argument as a defense counsel for precisely the same reason, to -- to prevent Mr. Strother from delivering what was typically a killing rebuttal argument. And he pronounced that this was a -- clearly a viable trial tactic. In -- in addition, both he and another expert were asked point blank whether waiver of closing in -- in these circumstances with these advocates amounted to essentially a -- a breach of prevailing professional norms. And both refused to say whether it would or wouldn't. Indeed, we think that that testimony is absolutely critical, because surely if the only witnesses who are actually qualified as experts and competent to testify whether a particular decision of counsel breached prevailing -- prevailing professional norms are unwilling to state that they -- that there has been a breach, surely a State court does not act unreasonably in concluding that the defendant has failed to overcome Strickland's strong presumption that all significant decisions of counsel are made in -- in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment."

And that is because Strickland squarely governs claims alleging deficiencies in attorney performance and that's -- that's what this case is. Cronic did make an observation that prejudice may be presumed when counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing. But that's not this case. Counsel put on a meaningful case for life and he did it in his opening statement. He had already introduced the substantial mitigation evidence during the sentencing proceeding and the State court procedures expressly allowed the jury to consider that evidence in its sentencing deliberations in determining whether to impose the death sentence. Now, to take a claim of ineffective assistance and just to presume prejudice under Cronic would be inconsistent with what the Court said in Strickland, and that is, absent a showing of prejudice, it cannot be said that a verdict of a death sentence resulted from an adversarial breakdown that renders the death sentence unreliable.

And his point was that the personality of the defendant changed totally after he went to Vietnam, which drove him to drugs, which led to this killing, to the point where he was irresponsible and couldn't be held legally responsible for the death. Now, the jury the day before has heard all that. Out of a two-hour presentation on the death penalty part, he -- 15 minutes of it is taken up by him going back over that. His having reviewed the whole thing, and the prosecution having put on three witnesses, who were irrelevant, because they talked about his criminal behavior after he returned from Vietnam, leads the defense lawyer to say I'm saying nothing.

That's on page 81 of the joint appendix. There was a finding that the lawyer for the State in the closing argument said, Gary Cone is a drug dealer. You can find that because of the evidence of the money in the car. The State court on post-conviction said they should not have argued that because they knew the money came from a robbery. But the problem was that even though that didn't raise to a substantive claim for relief, it nonetheless tainted the evidence for mitigation evidence because the prosecution's misstatements led the jury to believe, oh, he was not a drug user, he was a drug dealer.

It was a rule announced for the first time in Mr. Cone's own case. Secondly, there are Michael Williams v. Taylor problems because there are facts -- when we asked for an evidentiary hearing, we were not afforded an evidentiary hearing to develop many of these facts with respect to the Bronze Star.

Number two, with the aspects of the Sixth Amendment claim raised in a second post-conviction petition, there are issues as to whether the State procedural bar was clearly established, because Mr. Cone's case was the very first case where there was a holding that previous determination acted as a State bar to developing facts in State court.

And the fact of the matter is the combination -- we can't piecemeal the no evidence and no argument. It's the combined force of both of them. The failure to do anything in response to the State's case for death is what makes this a total abdication of advocacy in the context of a penalty phase of a capital trial. So, Your Honors, in preparing for this argument, I read an article that one of Your Honors wrote several years ago about how important oral argument was before this Court and how in many cases this Court -- argument had affected the minds of members of this Court. And if oral argument is so important for members of this Court who have the benefits of briefs, training, legal training, the benefits of clerks, how much more important is argument for a jury that's not trained in the law, that doesn't have the benefits of briefs, that has to make the most difficult decision they ever made as to whether somebody should live or should die? And how much more devastating is it when the jury is told they have to weigh evidence, they hear a case for death, they hear the prosecutor argue a case for death, and then there's silence from the defense? Your Honor, that amounts to a total failure in the penalty phase to -- to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing. That's why this Court wrote Cronic, to talk about problems just like this case. And Cronic has been sparingly applied by the lower courts."
