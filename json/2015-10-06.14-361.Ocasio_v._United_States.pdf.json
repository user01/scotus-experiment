When two people agree that one will pay the other a bribe, they have merely agreed to exchange property between themselves, not to obtain property from another. The historical background, the statutory structure, and basic criminal ­­ principles of criminal law all point in the same direction.

And I think that's a sufficient answer to the question, but my second answer is that we disagree with the government that there was sufficient evidence in the record linking Ocasio with other police officers. The evidence showed only that these police officers were generally aware of what each other were doing. It didn't show that they formed an agreement to work together.

The vast majority of the testimony was about Moreno and Mejia forming an agreement with Ocasio. The government's whole case went through Moreno and Mejia. And the government would have had a much more difficult case if it had to prove an agreement between police officers to obtain property from Moreno and Mejia. There just wasn't that much evidence of such an agreement. Everything, again, went through that, hub of Moreno and Mejia. So it's hard for me to imagine that it would have been harmless error, let alone that the jury would even have convicted if it had been instructed that it had to find an agreement between multiple police officers."

And the person, you know, pays him $20 because you've got to get your license. But there's no way in the world in which that would count as a conspiratorial agreement. It would count as consent under the Hobbs Act. So there's a big gap between consent and a conspiratorial agreement, even in the context of bribes."

But I think still, there is a large category of bribery cases that would ­­ would still be conspiratorial agreements under the government's theory, anytime someone, like in Salinas, pays a bribe in exchange for official action and wasn't required to do so. So I think still the government's theory would render some of the language in 666 unnecessary. You know, 18 U.S.C. 666 has specific monetary thresholds put on when a bribe is a Federal crime. And the ­­ and none of ­­ the bribe has to be over $5,000. The State official has to work for an agency that receives $10,000 or more in Federal funds. And I think in a lot of those cases, the government could just avoid those limitations by charging the case as a conspiracy to commit extortion under the Hobbs Act. And that's even though there may be a category of cases that would not be a conspiratorial agreement, but that would be consent under the Hobbs Act. On one more textual point, Your Honors, the statute also punishes whoever conspires to obtain property from another, which, I think, reinforces our reading that the \"whoever\" who obtains the property has to be a different person from the \"another\" from whom property is obtained. And I think the general conspiracy statute gets to the same place by just a slightly more circuitous route. It punishes each person who conspires to commit any offense against the United States."

Holte and Gebardi concerned the Mann Act, which prohibited the transportation of a woman across State lines for immoral purposes. And the question was whether a woman who was transported could conspire to violate the Act. In answering that question, the Court focused on two things. First of all, although the Act contemplates the involvement of the woman, it doesn't impose substantive criminal liability on her. And, second, some minimal form of agreement is an inherent feature of most instances of the offense. Based on those two factors, the Court said, if that's all there is, if the only thing that the woman agrees to is to the transportation itself, that is, the bare outlines of the crime, that by itself would be insufficient to make her a conspirator. But if she were to agree to do more ­­ if, for instance, she were to purchase the tickets or to arrange the transportation in some other way ­­ then she could be a conspirator. And so in this case, with respect to a bribe pair, if all the bribe pair agrees to do is turn over money in return for official acts, that by itself would be insufficient to make the bribe pair a conspirator."

Because Moreno and Mejia didn't just hand over an envelope with $100 bills in it. They worked closely in conjunction with police officers, including Petitioner. For instance, when Petitioner went to the scene of an accident, he would call Moreno, and they would talk about what cars were involved: The make, model, the year, what extent of damage was involved. And then Moreno would consult with Petitioner about which cars would be most lucrative to have in the shop. And so it wasn't simply a case of agreeing to the bare outlines of the crime.

Imagine the for instance, there was a statute that said if you steal from a bank while pointing a gun at another, it's aggravated bank robbery. And imagine a robber says to his friend, you go into the bank ahead of me. I'll run in, point a gun at your head, and say, cashier give me all of your money. According to Petitioner, that would not be conspiracy, because judged ­­ from the perspective of the conspiracy as a whole, no gun was pointed at another.

A couple responses to that. First of all, it's not even clear what that means; for instance, how it could be that a conspiracy as a whole obtains property under color of official right.

      "speaker": "KEDEM",
      "speech": "Well, Justice Kennedy, I would point you then to the statute that we cite that talks about someone who is a government official who receives coded, secret information from another and provides it to another. Petitioner's only response is there may be some other statute that you could prosecute under in the case in which the \"from another\" and \"to another\" are both officials of other governments. But what if there are not? What if they're officials ­­ what if they're members of a terrorist organization, for instance? I'd like to also address my friend's argument with respect to the word \"whoever\" in Subsection A. I don't think it works for a couple reasons. First of all, the word \"whoever\" in Subsection A ­­ and this is best addressed if looking directly at the words of the statute at page 2a to the appendix to our brief. \"Whoever,\" in Subsection (a), is not the subject of the phrase \"obtaining of property from another\" in Subsection (b)(2). If it were, then no private citizen could ever be member of a conspiracy because no private citizen can obtain property from another under color of official right. Instead, the word \"whoever\" is the subject of the phrase \"obstructs, delays, or affects commerce\" by extortion or agrees or conspires so to do. And to give you an example of how that can be affected, even if you yourself are not the person who commits the extortion, imagine a case of robbery in which there is a central organizer who brings together robbers who have various skills and gives them a plan but doesn't himself intend to participate in the robbery. In that case, he would have conspired to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce by robbery, even though he himself would not be committing robbery. And the same is true with respect to extortion. Moreno and Mejia were part of a plan which they actively facilitated that obstructed, delayed, and affected commerce by extortion."

So from that point on, there is no further consent to be given. So it's like robbing the pocket of a stone idol or some ­­ what used to be called in law school ­­ once the consent is given.

Conspiracy just requires an agreement and sometimes an overt act, and this active participant standard doesn't map on well to that at all. The government ­­ the cases that the government cites that supposedly apply, Holte and Gebardi to ­­ to Hobbs Act prosecutions really dealt with aiding and abetting, not with conspiracy. And it's much easier to see how the active participant standard applies in the context of aiding and abetting, which requires acts beyond mere agreement.
