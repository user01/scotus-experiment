    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "speech": "I think there are two responses to the question, Your Honor. The first is there is in the law, as the Government's reply brief points out a doctrine of necessity which in some narrow circumstances, and it's not precisely clear how far it extends, in essence privileges what would otherwise be a violation of a statute. If the statute doesn't rule that defense out. So an action to protect life and limb may be an exception. The second answer though, is that -- because it is a very hard question, but there are -- when there are content-neutral laws that say that because of the way in which information came to someone, that information is not to be revealed be it these statutes or be it for example a protective orders in the Seattle Times, that generally the fact that what was revealed is a matter of public importance does not automatically say that the interests that are being served by the content-neutral law that says either you should not have this information at all or you should not be able to use it, they don't necessarily give way. And that's indeed if this exact tape had been received in discovery I believe under Seattle Times the press could again be prevented from making use and publishing the tape. And the key is that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but in Seattle Times and Rhinehart and in the Aguilar case, we were controlling the people who received the information under a court order. They were within our immediate control. The Rhinehart case would be as if somebody surreptitiously took this tape and gave if to a person and then that person gave it to the newspapers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "speech": "But in both instances, though, Justice Kennedy, we are saying that a person has information, it is of public importance, and because of interest bound up in the way in which they received it, we will not allow them to distribute. The interests are different granted. And the Court did not say in Seattle Times that the fact that this information is coming in discovery means there is no First Amendment concern. Quite the contrary. The Court said the Court has to conclude that there will be harm to privacy interests and the like if it is disclosed and the Court applied intermediate scrutiny. But the Court said that because of interests of the justice system that are served by being able to limit disclosure of that which is given in discovery we can tolerate the fact that the press cannot tell the public something of great importance. Here we again have very vital interests, different interests, but the interests of people knowing that they will not come home some day and have a hundred thousand people hearing a phone call that they made. And I submit that what unites those cases and in essense solves the problem here is the fact that we're dealing with a totally content-neutral statute and one which as applied does not unduly interfere with the ability of the press --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But merely because it's content- neutral does not mean you can't regulate it. This isn't seditious. It isn't obscene. And there is no category that I know of which allows you to regulate it. It's intercepted which is now going to be a new category under your rule and there is no precedent for that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I don't know of any case in which this Court has struck down a statute which is content-neutral in the full sense that this one is except in some rare circumstances where the Court in essence has determined that too much speech is going to be supressed. In other words, we are not saying, we don't have to say, that some of this is a category of speech of no First Amendment significance whatsoever. What we are saying is that there are important governmental interests harmed not only by the interception but by the disclosure. If those are then taken into account through a content-neutral statutory regime, we believe and we have argued that that in essence exhausts the First Amendment concerns both as to level of scrutiny and as to satisfying scrutiny as long as we are not in one of the rare situations such as City of Ladue, for example, where the Court would say granted it's content-neutral, but you're just restricting too much speech and we think in this case the question would be, the concern about whether this content-neutral law -- and let me just pause for a moment because I think it's essential to emphasize when I say content-neutral this law is neutral in a way that absolutely requires a determination of content neutrality. It's neutral as to viewpoint. It's neutral as to subject matter. It doesn't allow liability to turn on disagreement with a particular message. It doesn't even target speech specifically. It targets all uses of what has been unlawfully intercepted, so there is no case in this Court that would characterize this law as content- based."

That first of all, there is -- we are applying a content-neutral statute based on important government interests and secondly -- and I do think this is critical, we then have to ask ourselves is this one of the very rare cases in this Court's jurisprudence where one would say that even though a statute is totally neutral, doesn't lend itself to Government thought control, to supression of ideas in any way, it's not reshaping public debate, totally neutral, does it in some way restrict too much speech? And one area where one would worry is, does it prevent the press from doing what it needs to do?

What we say is that under Branzburg, for example, the Court says that we know the press could get important information of public concern through wire tapping. We know the press could get important information of public concern by having a system of private informants. We say to the press, you cannot do that. Even if you know that behind that wall is someone communicating matter of utmost public importance, you can't pierce that wall. So why then is it crucial to the press to say we can't ourselves go out and try to obtain this information of public concern through wire tapping but if serendipitously some third person has done it, it's vital us to be able to then use the information.

    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "speech": "I think in the final analysis, no, Your Honor, because as I understand Florida Star and this Court's jurisprudence, the question here is whether there are sufficient Government interests to justify a content- neutral application of these laws in this manner. It's not a question of is the press a bad actor or not to be punished. One has to be concerned undoubtedly will the press, by the rule that we advocate, be chilled from performing its function and we argue no because as we have briefed the way that the reason to factor can be construed under this statute, but I don't think that the proper analysis of the issues here can ultimately turn simply on did the press violate a law when they received the information or not, otherwise of course Congress could take a jab with the pen and say, oh, and also it's illegal -- to be receiving any that has been intercepted."

I first want to make the point because there is been some suggestion I think here that it is the Government's position that the First Amendment does not -- the First Amendment interests here don't require heightened scrutiny. That's not our position. We do recognize that there is an important burden on First Amendment rights here, but we submit that the appropriate level of scrutiny is intermediate-level scrutiny because this is a totally content-neutral law of general applicability that protects fundamental values of privacy and private speech and denies third parties nothing that they otherwise would have had if the act's prohibition on interception itself was fully effective --"

But it is not a restraint on -- with respect to any topic, any viewpoint, any speaker. If these -- anybody who gets wire tapped information or information from a bug planted in my home or my conference room -- gets the information otherwise, the identical information is fully available for speech or other use.

It's still true that when you do the balancing, whether you call it intermediate scrutiny or you figure out some other level to put it on, you're -- what you've got to balance is that if this law is good, then the disclosure which apparently has no other source of information which is of concern to the public is absolutely forbidden and we've got to accept that as one of the prices that will be paid. Maybe as you say not in every case but it will be paid if the statute is going to be enforced across the board."

I have three reasons that I'd like to articulate why we think we do, but I certainly acknowledge the fact that the -- a restriction on speech under intermediate- level scrutiny may fail just as heightened scrutiny like in cases like Bursen v. Freeman and Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce can sometimes prevail. My point here is, and this goes to the distinction with the Pentagon Papers case and I think to Justice O'Connor's initial question about why we should care how the information came to be, is that the knowing use of illegally intercepted private expression implicates other constitutional values as this Court recognized in Cox and Florida Star and in particular the distinction between information that is leaked from the Government or otherwise that is leaked as the result of a failure of a trusted responsibility, which was at issue in Florida Star and perhaps at issue in Landmark and certainly was at issue in the Pentagon Papers case, where this Court has said repeatedly that in that instance, where we're talking about information that was not unlawfully obtained, but instead was disclosed to the public as a result of a failure of a trust relationship, there is quote, almost -- there are almost always less drastic means of resolving the problem, both because you can be more careful about who you trust, and secondly, there is a much smaller universe of potential violators. Here we're talking about an interception which almost by definition is impossible of detection.

It simply says that if you know that this is the result of an illegal intrusion into a zone of conversational privacy, you cannot use it until it becomes publicly known. And I also -- I'm not sure that it is fair to say that there is no precedent for taking speech like this off the table. I think we have talked about Seattle Times and Cowles and Harper & Row and Zacchini but there is also the San Francisco arts case involving use of the word Olympic.

It's at least ambiguous in the record and if all you want is a decision that you can disseminate it if it's a threat to blow off somebody's porch, I'll give you that, that's an easy case.

This notion of the laundering rationale somehow being enough to make the statute survive intermediate scrutiny. That rationale, we submit, is not persuasive when you're talking as we are here about matters of public concern. In the Internet age, an interceptor doesn't need the press to disseminate anonymously information to a mass audience. Even if he did, there is no evidence that that provides that person with an incentive to intercept in the first place, especially where, as in this case money does not drive the market hypothesized by the petitioner. There may well be the occasional case in which an anonymous interceptor gratuitously throws the contents of an intercepted communication over the transom, but there is no evidence that this is a systemic problem or that --"

I think warrants a conclusion that the Government doesn't need to be able to do that, and of course if the Court applies the Daily Mail principle, we don't reach that question because the Daily Mail principle obviates the need to show that, especially whereas here there are so many less restrictive alternatives to prohibiting the dissemination of information, like meaningful criminal penalties against the interception itself. In this case, your Honors, the maximum criminal penalty that could be applied against the interceptor of this communication was a nominal fine with no possibility of incarceration.

So when you have only the circumstance where you have speech on a matter of public significance, not just what was happening on the phone, someone came in and just overheard my conversation in my bedroom, they adopted a line -- this a -- a principle that exists in lots of this Court's cases, including in the defamation context, in Pickering balancing, when you're speaking on a matter of public importance, that's when the First Amendment interests are at their highest."

Defamation and libel, the Hustler Magazine case, the Philadelphia Newspaper v. Hepps case and Dun & Bradstreet all turn on whether or not the speech in question is on an issue of public significance. The same is true in the Pickering balancing cases, including particularly the Court's opinion in United States v. National Treasury Employee's Union which, too, was a content-neutral statute. But I need to return to what else we would say, what other strictures we would put on the statute in order to permit it to survive intermediate scrutiny and still fulfill what we agree is an important governmental interest and that is that no one wants people tapping phones and breaking into homes. The difficulty here is that there are a number of respects in which the statute is not tailored whatsoever. And so I want to get to Justice Stevens' point that really this does get to the heart of the matter. The real problem is that this is not a case like the Daily Mail case where it is a one-to-one trade off, we're going to reduce some speech in order to further some other interest. We have here a statute that is so broad that much speech that the Government has no interest or actual intent to stop from being published will in fact be published. The different -- I will identify five distinctions. The first is that it applies equally and I mean all the way down the line in terms of punishment whether or not you can put someone in jail, identical fines to the newspaper that is the 10th party down the line to receive the information as to the intercepting."

      "speech": "The plain text of the statute uses a much broader term than is suggested by the Solicitor General and let me continue with the other four problems with tailoring. The second is that it applies to any piece of information about the conversation, not merely the tape. The fact that, and Justice -- there was a question about talking to my neighbor. In this context if you receive innocently a tape recording and merely mention the fact that you have -- you know that there was a tape recording of the conversation, it applies equally because the definition of content is so broad. It's literally any datum about the conversation. The third is that it imposes civil and criminal liability and permits the commencement of litigation even when there has been no injury at all. And the plaintiffs in this case disavowed any claim that they had been actually been hurt. The fourth is that it applies equally no matter whether the information and indeed the conversation in question was even private. And this was Justice O'Connor's first question is that the information that was spoken and was heard and intercepted could have been a completely public fact but the fact that it was said in a conversation would be disclosed, and fifth and this one is the particularly troubling one that I began with, it applies even when the information is of vital public significance. Now, the reason I mentioned these five is that you have to look at someone who is in the position of receiving a piece of information and there is the grave concern that when you get a piece of information notwithstanding the reason to know limitation which is what the Solicitor General points had to saving the statute, you had real doubts about the provenance of information. Because of the great breath of the statute, it's unlike Daily Mail and it's unlike Florida Star. You've got a rape victim's name and you know okay that's prohibited. I'm not going to say that if I followed the statute and its constitutional --"

If you are going to have a situation where you attempt to discern the provenance of information, this case -- this statute operates only in the circumstance where the newspaper doesn't know the intercepting party. If the newspaper knows the intercepting party then the statute operates because the newspaper will be subpoenaed and will have to testify about who gave them the interception and that person will be prosecuted. In the situation where you don't know and if the Court's point is that look, it simply won't be published in that instance we don't have a problem because the broader disclosure won't happen."

And they are doing that in part for reasons better than trade secret law or copyright law because there is something about human dignity that requires it. Well, if they can keep people away from my bedroom to hear my private conversations, even about important matters, can't they try to protect that same kind of basic dignity in respect to the new world that will come through wireless communication? Now, do you see there's a lot involved there, but that's at the bottom of what I'm trying to work out in this case."

      "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
      "speech": "Let me begin by stepping back to the variant on that question that you asked my colleague. And I do want to specify, that when it comes to things like diaries, the intellectual property laws still apply fully in the same way they did in Cowles, those sorts of copyright laws, and we don't doubt that if it's a diary and it's something that is your personal information, you have written it down, that you can claim that you have stolen something like intellectual property. Your version to me was, can't we try hard to reduce the incentives, and I think Congress is doing that here. There is no record that suggests there is a real problem, but I think we all agree intuitively, it will reduce somewhat the incentive to engage in the interception. Our problem is that it's a purely prophylactic ban on someone and could result in massive punitive damages or jail time on someone who hasn't engaged in the primary wrongdoing. Where the prophylaxis has broken down, my client has no idea who gave him this piece of information. He has it. It's of public significance. It's a legitimate threat on page."

The first is a point you identified to my colleague before which is, is it really difficult to identify people and stop them when they are doing these kinds of interceptions.

      "speaker": "WAXMAN",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Questions about the extent of the necessity defense which we mentioned in our reply brief or the meaning of the word disclosure are all, of course, questions of application that will be given judicial interpretation in appropriate cases where they arise. The salient point here is that the respondents have not made a case, either in their briefs or here, that going solely against the wiretapper is going to significantly protect privacy. And contrary to their representation, the legislative history does, in fact, reflect both great solicitude for the privacy rights involved and that's quoted at page 3 of our reply brief and also repeatedly the recognition that wiretapping and bugging and now of course we have hacking into e-mails is almost completely impossible of interception or even detection. The nominal fine that Mr. Levine referred to Levine referred to is, of course, $5,000 which is not nominal with respect to most people, and in any event exists independent of the civil remedy under 2520 that Congress thought was appropriate and Congress said in the legislative history was appropriate to vindicate the privacy rights of the people whose privacy interests were not vindicated. The notion that there is a limiting principal for facts of public significance, I think, is fatal. First of all, if there were such an exception, that would not -- that would deprive the statute of being content neutral. And second of all, there is almost no way to draw the line, as Justice Scalia suggests, for what is publicly significant. This Court has already held twice that the name of a woman who has been raped, not the fact that there was a rape or the name of the perpetrator, but the victim is a matter of public significance and public interest. So we don't think that there is a constitutional way to draw a line here. The Daily Mail principle that the other side bases its case on is distinguishable from this case and this law in five critical respects. Those were laws that applied only to the press and not to nonexpressive uses. They were content based laws reflected a determination that society should not know certain information. They reflect -- they dealt with information that came from the Government that is not in the hands of private parties and there are, we understand, reasons to respect a sensorial motive when the Government seeks to limit disclosure of information about its own activities. They did not -- they all obtained -- involved information that was lawfully obtained. Every single one of the persons who gave that information to the person got it lawfully."
