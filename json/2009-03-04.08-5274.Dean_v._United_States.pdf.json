  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue before the Court in this case is whether the discharge provision of 924(c) carries with it some requirement of intent. We believe that the answer to this question is yes. And to that end we would cite to the leg -- to the text of the statute itself as well as the history involved, the presumption of mens rea that is inherent in all statutes such as this Court's case law has been clear on as well as the principle of the rule of lenity, if we get to that point, and if the Court deems that there is some type of ambiguity."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Forster, there are three levels under this: Possession, brandishing, and if the gun is discharged. You don't quarrel with the notion that Dean at least brandished this gun?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "We -- we do not dispute that, Your Honor. No, he clearly intentionally brandished the weapon."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "So we're talking about a three-year difference between brandishing and if the gun is discharged?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly right. And the statute in 924 requires that the use of the firearm be during and in relation to the underlying crime of violence, which in this case is a bank robbery. And we believe that the proper reading of the statute would require that the discharge also be done during and in relation to the underlying crime of violence. Otherwise, the statute simply would not make any sense."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I think one of the stronger arguments against you is the use of the passive voice. It doesn't say anybody who discharges a firearm. It says a firearm is discharged. And that seems to me to take it away from the element of intent that you're trying to focus on."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I think that it's a transitive verb the way it's used. By definition it would have some object. Someone would have had to have discharged the weapon. And so I think that the Court's cases on mens rea and so forth would continue to apply, even given the way that it's phrased in the statute. I don't think --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So you think it's different -- I don't remember the grammar too well. You think \"if firearm is discharged\" is different than \"firearm discharges;\" is that your point?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "I'm not sure it would make a difference in this case, Your Honor, because I don't think there's any -- I think that by definition the Court would have to ask itself who discharged the weapon. I don't think you can just use the word \"discharge\" in a vacuum. It has to be during --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, I'm not sure that's right. I mean, if in fact the bank robber tries to flee and the security guard is forced to use his firearm, increasing the danger to everybody else in the bank, I'm not sure this statute wouldn't cover that as well."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't believe the statute would, because the individual who would be charged with it would not himself have \"during\" or \"and in relation to\" the underlying crime of violence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But it doesn't say -- it says, \"if the gun is discharged.\" And I think on the government's reading it would cover the police officer who is trying to apprehend a robber and fires a gun."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, I think under the government's theory that would be true. But I think that would open up --"
  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Excuse me. What -- what -- I guess I'm not following this.  You say it would be true that if the blank -- if the bank guard fires his own gun when -- when the bank robber is fleeing, that would come within this?"

    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "No, Justice Scalia, not under our reading. I think --"

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "So it's using the robber's gun, but by the police officer who is apprehending him. In other words, as I understand the government's view, it doesn't matter whether it's the police officer. It has to be the gun of the robber, but it doesn't matter whether it's the robber or the police officer who discharges it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "That's true, ma'am."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "I guess it's also the government's view -- this is even weirder -- that it doesn't matter who brandishes the gun. The -- the bank guard grabs the gun and brandishes the gun, and that also gets additional time served for the bank robber. It doesn't seem fair."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't believe that the -- that the hypothetical of the guard waving the gun around, I don't think that would meet the definition of \"brandish\" the way 924 defines it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "It has very specific -- what are the words that define what is brandishing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, \"brandish\" is defined under the statute a couple of different ways. The -- the dictionary definition of \"brandish,\" which is to grab something and wave it around, is certainly contained in that. But the definition goes further. The definition also says that if I, for example, make known that I have a gun, if I pass a note saying I have a gun, that would also be brandishing under the statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "I -- I didn't think the government or anybody was reading the definition of brandishing to include a police officer."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "The way the government's brief -- well, with regards to brandish, Your Honor, I don't know that the government goes that far."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Well, it runs into the problem, which is also a different problem for you, and that is the brandishing must be for the purposes -- for the purpose of intimidating."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "So that's probably going to eliminate the case in which the officer grabs the felon's gun. So the problem that it seems to me that it creates for you is that \"brandish\" is specifically defined to have that particular intentional element. There is, however, no definition of -- of the -- of the term in question here, which suggests that they did not have any discharge -- that they did not have any -- any -- any intent to impose an intent requirement. When they do it, they know how to do it. In this case they didn't do it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I would disagree with that simply for this reason. This Court's case law is clear that if Congress wants to do away with the mens rea element, they must affirmatively do so. And I don't think that it's proper to say that because there's a specific definition of \"brandish,\" therefore they meant discharge to be basically strict liability."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Why is it improper? I mean, it may not be conclusive, but it seems to me evidence that points in that direction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I think that that would be disregarding the presumption of mens rea that exists pursuant to this Court's case law as well as the requirement --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "We have -- we have lots of cases in which it makes sense to disregard that presumption, and -- and nobody thinks twice about it, I mean, accomplice liability being an example. There are -- there are -- there are lots of State crimes in which it is dispensed with, reckless driving, death resulting. And in all of those cases what in effect the rationale is that the -- that the individual who is being charged has created a risk, no one can control that risk, including himself. But he bears the responsibility for, if you will, bad luck if the risk is realized. And that is the rationale for -- for holding him liable for discharge here without any particular knowing or -- or intentional act in making the discharge. So why doesn't that make sense and why is that not an answer to the usual presumption that there will be a specific state of mind required?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't think this statute is driven by consequence. And as I understand Your Honor's hypothetical --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Why? Why?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Because the words that the statute uses are directly focused to the -- to the conduct of the defendant: \"Possess, use, brandish, discharge,\" as opposed to, for example, carjacking."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, this is conduct. I mean, it isn't just bad luck. This is -- what we have here is a negligent bank robber. I mean, he has left the safety off, okay, and -- and trips the gun. I mean, bank robbing is bad enough, but negligent bank robbing is something -- (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "-- is something that should be punished more severely."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, certainly under the statute the Court has far more authority than the ten years it imposed, and I think Congress is clear that they -- they allowed for substantially larger sentences in such a case. This case obviously just discusses the application of the mandatory minimum."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Your -- your argument would give rise to very serious problems of proof. Every time a gun goes off, the bank robber would be able to say it was an accident. I mean, we had a particularly klutzy robber here that everybody agrees it was an accident, but, you know, in many cases it won't be clear. Yes, I was pointing the gun at the person, but I didn't mean to fire it. It just went off. And he's sad about it just as everyone else is. And that would get to the jury in every case. Just because it was easy here doesn't mean it's going to be easy every time to draw a line. And it gets back to Justice Souter's point. If you pose the risk that the gun is going to go off, that's additionally punishable conduct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, obviously -- I mean, the risk certainly does go up. But as I -- as I think the statute is written, it's not driven by what the risk is. As I say, as opposed to --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "That's not my question, really. The question is the problem of proof. Yours is an easy case. Most cases it's not going to be. Most cases when the gun goes off, the robber will be able to say, I didn't intend that it discharged. It was -- it was an accident."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't believe a jury would be -- would make that decision, because under this Court's authority in Harris, that would be for the judge; and -- and obviously criminals would make these claims, and it would be --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Excuse me? That would be for the judge?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Under this Court's authority in Harris, Your Honor, brandish and discharge are not elements of the offense that must be indicted and proved to a jury. They are sentencing elements or enhancement, if you will, that -- that would be up to the judge, and that's this Court's Harris ruling."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Doesn't that undermine your argument that there's a presumption that a mens rea has to apply, because this is just a sentencing element?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't believe so. This Court has never said that merely because it is a sentencing enhancement rather than an element of the offense that somehow the statutory rules of construction cease to apply."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Isn't it part of the background here that it was proposed at the time these enhancements came into the law, it was proposed that there be a specific state of mind requirement for the discharge of the gun, and that was not enacted?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "I didn't hear the -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "I thought that part of the legislative history was that there were proposals -- I mean, there is a rather sharp difference between \"possess\" -- yes, you have to have a knowledge, intent element -- \"brandishing,\" very clear, for purposes of intimidation -- then \"discharge\" has no -- it's just that the gun is discharged. Weren't there proposals to include something like what was included for the other two, that is, that there be an intent requirement?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, there were various drafts in the House and the Senate that -- that specifically provided the intent requirement. The compromise that came out was basically a disagreement over the penalty, and the language that the Congress used, \"during and in relation to,\" necessarily implies some type of an intent element. I think the circuits are clear on that; it has to be knowing, otherwise it's not during and in relation to. And so I believe that the choice of language that Congress uses -- there has to be the connection, we believe, between the use -- during in relation to and the discharge. Otherwise the statute makes no sense, because it wouldn't be triggered by anything."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Why? I can't get anywhere with the language, to tell you the truth. I could read it either way. It -- the House language is the same. The person \"discharges,\" yeah, but what if he discharges it accidentally? Is the accidental case or unintended case meant to be covered or not meant to be covered?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "We don't --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "And you don't get anywhere -- I just can't get anywhere with the language. The reason they put the \"is discharged\" is probably for parallelism. It was a drafting section in the Senate, and they do their job in a stylistic way. I found nothing that suggests anything other than that. So -- so where am I? Sometimes a person who discharges the weapon accidentally is really much worse than the one who does it purposely. Purposely, he shoots at the ceiling; accidentally, he kills a person dead; okay? So I mean, I can't get too far with that. So where -- so there we are. Is there anything else -- there is the post problem that the Chief Justice mentioned. Is there anything else you can say to me, who really doesn't see it one way or the other way in this statute?"

    "speech": "Would you say, look, this is why you win?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, in the committee reports and so forth I think it's pretty clear that they did not intend an unintentional or an accidental discharge to be covered."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Why -- why do you think that? I mean, it is absolutely true that a person who is a bank robber and has a gun and has already shown it, and it goes off accidentally is, is -- has caused a tremendous harm in certain cases, which traditionally has been thought meriting a higher sentence. And it is also true that he doesn't have the same state of mind as the one who does it purposely. That is true, too. Both are true. And so now what should I do? I know what you want me to do, but why?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, the requirement -- we think that the discharge again must be during and in relation to. There has to be that connection. And --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Well, there's accidents and accidents. And couldn't one say, looking at this that, well, we will -- the State will find that the culpability that we will attribute to this statute is reckless? If recklessness were the requirement certainly the facts in this case would fit, would they not?"

It's -- this -- the gun was loaded, it wasn't locked, and he's raking in money with one hand, holding the gun with the other. The teller is crouching down. I mean, there was -- there was a pretty substantial risk of something going wrong, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Absolutely, there was. But I think this Court's authority in Smith talks about the -- the intent element that is inherent in this. It has to be purposeful, it has -- it cannot be by accident, and that's what this Court --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Why? You place a lot of reliance on this: During and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. But that -- that's in the prologue, and it applies only to the matter covered in the prologue -- to wit, \"During and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm or in furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm.\" That -- that's what all that language \"during and relation to\" applies to. And then it continues: \"Shall,\" if that \"in relation to\" exists, \"in addition to the punishment provided for such crime:\" One, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than five\"; two; and number three, what we're dealing with here, \"if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years.\" I don't see how that language during and in relation to any crime of violence applies to anything, except the use or carrying of a firearm."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Why is that? How could you -- how could you make the lack of connection any clearer than by ending the first, the introduction with a dash, and then putting 1, 2, and 3? I mean, it seems to me that it applies to the portion before the dash."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, if that were the -- if that were the interpretation, then it would lead to what we consider to be some of the absurdities as far as the results go. If there is no connection between \"during and in relation to\" -- I will refer to it as the connection. In absence of that connection, any number of different things could occur, and that connection is what makes this statute make sense. And I believe that the government basically acknowledges that in their brief, that there has to be -- if there's not some connection -- I think it's page 29 of the government's brief. When we discussed the absurd results that might flow from a statute where there is no such connection, what the government says -- I believe it's on page 29 -- is that to avoid these absurd results, this connection does exist. But then the next sentence they say: But it doesn't mean there is a mens rea. And it seems to me that what the government wants in that case is the \"during and relation to \"has to apply to discharge to avoid the absurd results, but yet they don't want Smith to go along with it. And Smith said that during and relation to is purposeful, has to have an effect, and it can't be done by accident."

    "speech": "The -- the \"use or carry\" certainly has to be in relation -- during and in relation to, but that's step one. So he already is using and carrying or carrying in relation to the bank robbery. And then -- so that's the starting premise. That excludes all your things about years before or years after he carried -- he carried a gun. You -- step one narrows it to the person who uses or carries a gun in connection with a bank robbery."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "And -- and I would agree with that, and then when you take this Court's authority in Smith to say that that type use during and in relation to cannot be accidental. And so I go back to the original question Your Honor asked me, did he intentionally brandish it? Clearly. And so we believe that if -- if this case we are here about is fit into Smith, he's on the hook for the seven years under brandish, but because the discharge was accidental, it cannot constitute use under this Court's authority in Smith."

Why can't we limit it by saying, oh, of course it means if the firearm is brandished by the bank robber or by the felon or if it's discharged by the felon, but leaving it quite undetermined whether it has to be intentionally discharged, or even intentionally brandished for that matter."

    "speaker": "FORSTER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I think that you would then have to turn to this Court's -- well, first of all, I think it's the best reading of the statute. It doesn't make sense any other way to say that you can have the gun discharged but not be during and in relation to the underlying crime of violence. It doesn't make sense. Second, I believe that this Court's statutory rules of construction would say that if Congress wanted to do away with the mens rea element in this case, they would have had to have done so expressly. And we don't believe that they did. Now, every circuit that has discussed the requirement \"during and in relation to\" has found a knowledge requirement that you can't not know the gun is there, for example. There has to be the knowledge requirement. And this Court's authority in Smith suggests or says clearly that it cannot be used accidentally. So now the question becomes this: If the Court decides that during -- that the discharge must be during and in relation to, and when the Court does that it takes its own authority in Smith to say that it has to be purposeful, it has to have the effect of the commission of the crime, now is -- would the use in this case be subject to Smith? And Smith is clear that accidental discharge simply -- or accidental use, rather -- it didn't talk about discharge exactly -- but that accidental use would never be because it --"

And that's simply never what these cases from this Court have held. There's the presumption that Congress operates against, and if they wish to eliminate the mens rea element, they must do so expressly. And we simply do not believe that it -- that it happened in this case. One last point is, we believe there's nothing else that Congress would have had to have done to establish a general intent, and if that's true, then I think the very least that could be said about our interpretation is that it would be a reasonable one, in which case lenity principles would then come into play.

If one concluded that because the bank robbery continued, even though he was no longer using or carrying the firearm or no longer possessing it, that the 924(c) offense also continued, and the firearm discharges when he drops it, then, yes, the firearm is discharged while the section 924(c) offense is ongoing, and, yes, the mandatory minimum would apply.

But if -- if -- in other words, not the security guard's firearm. If the firearm is discharged by third party causes you concern, one could conclude that that is not the manner in which the defendant committed the offense; and that this Court's decision in Harris described this type of sentencing factor, these very sentencing factors, as the kind of factor that one looks at: Is a fact present in the manner in which the defendant committed the offense?

Now I would agree with you that sentencing is different, and the reason that it's different is because sentencing often goes up or down depending upon whether the harm that is foreseen does or does not occur, irrespective of the state of mind. So we couldn't apply that normal background rule, in my view."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Now -- now, having done that I wonder if the background rule should come into play once again where a mandatory minimum sentence is at stake, for the reason that if the harm eventuates, there are many ways in which the sentence will go up. If this person had been killed, for example, it becomes a murder in the course of a felony. There are all kinds of other statutes that can aggravate the felony; and if you don't apply the mandatory minimum, the judge still can give him the higher sentence, if he warrants it. But if you apply the mandatory minimum where the judge wouldn't go up, the only impact that has is to take people who the judge and others think fall into the minimal category of bad behavior plus consequences, and force them to have a higher sentence. Now, that would be a rationale for a rule of lenity in mandatory minimum sentencing matters."

    "speaker": "MAYNARD",

The whole point of having the mandatory minimum is to take away discretion from judges. What -- and the language of the statute here in our view is clear. It says \"if the firearm is discharged,\" and I think it's the present tense that gets you the -- the temporal connection to the crime here. If it is discharged while you are using or carrying it or possessing it, in the offense in the principal paragraph, Congress wanted you to have ten years."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "No, I can't -- I can't -- the trouble is I can't find anything in the history of this that really says why they use \"is discharged\" or used \"as opposed to discharges.\" And I find those very metaphysical, those arguments, unless I -- I can see either something in the history or some functional consideration."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "Well, in the blue brief they lay out the House's final version, and we have the House's final version in one of our footnotes. And then they lay out the Senate's final version. And one important distinction, Justice Breyer, between those two versions is that the House's version would have made it active voice, but not only active. But it would have been amenable to the argument that during and in relation to -- discharges, because it's structured different. But the House would have set the penalty for a discharge at 20 years.  Okay. That's -- you can infer from that that the House thought an intentional discharge should subject you to 20 years. The Senate's version, which put it in the passive voice, said if the firearm is discharged and set a mandatory minimum of 10 years. And I think you can infer from that, Justice Breyer, the -- the current structure allows what you're positing, which is more culpable defendants who intend to discharge the firearm to receive a higher sentence. And one could infer, I think, that the House thinks that should be 20 years. So I think the -- the current structure does allow judges to take into consideration. It just sets the floor. And Congress is entitled to do that, and I think they have clearly done that and then to take out of the realm of debate whether or not the defendant intended to discharge the firearm or didn't mean to discharge the firearm. I would like to -- to say one factual point, which is in the -- in the indictment Petitioner actually was charged with use or carrying. It just seems -- if I could explain, the \"use or carry during or in relation to,\" is one prong, one way in which to commit the principal offense. \"Possessing in furtherance\" is another way to commit the principal offense. The \"use or carry\" is not modified by \"possession in furtherance of,\" and \"possess\" is not modified by -- by \"during or in relation to,\" which is another reason it makes no sense to -- to trail the \"during or in relation to\" down to the generally applicable sentencing factors."

  {
    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "It has to be during and -- but there -- but it's not because the word \"during\" appears in the principal offense, which is how they would have our argument be. The -- the -- it has to -- the sentencing factor has to occur. First you have to commit the principal -- let me just back up. You have to commit the principal offense."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "Why does it have to be \"during\"? It -- it doesn't in the statute?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "It has to be \"during\" for three reasons. One, the -- the language of the sentencing factor says if the firearm is discharged. It's in the present tense. So the present tense of the \"is discharged\" language -- it has to be while you're using, carrying -- \"uses, carries, or possesses\" is also in the act. The \"is discharged\" has to happen while you're using, carrying, or possessing. That takes out hypotheticals about, well, it was discharged at the factory before I got it, and law enforcement discharged it well after they took it from me to test the ballistics on it. Those aren't covered because it's not \"is discharged\" while you're using, carrying or possessing. Secondly, this Court in Harris recognized that these are the types of sentencing factors that one considers when deciding whether a certain fact is present in the manner in which an offense is committed. So the fact has to be present in the commission of the offense. That's just the way this type of sentencing factor operates, and the courts so interpreted these particular sentencing factors in Harris. And we know that it's not because of the \"during\" in the principal paragraph, Justice Stevens, because there is no \"during\" element to the \"possession\" prong. Nevertheless, the sentencing factors apply to that prong, and we would apply temporal in cases that --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "I want to make sure I understand. You are saying it need not be \"during\" or -- you said it has to be \"during\" but not because the statute includes the word \"during.\""

    "speech": "Well, what does -- where does the \"during\" come from then?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "The \"during\" comes from the fact that the sentencing factor is in the present tense, and says \"is discharged.\" That means that the \"is discharged\" must occur while the offense is -- is occurring. So the temporal limitation comes from, and is from, the nature of these types of sentencing factors, which ask: Is this factor present? That's what Congress cared about."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "And you say it can't come from the prologue, because if it came from the prologue, it wouldn't apply to the mere possession."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Two hours later when he got home -- he carried the gun in -- IN furtherance of the crime. He still had it with him all the way through, and the gun went off after he left the bank."

  {
    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "If -- if it were determined that the -- the 924(c) offense, which is the possession in furtherance of crime, were still going on at that point -- in other words he was still possessing it in furtherance of the underlying crime of violence, and it discharges -- then, yes, the sentencing factor, by its plain terms, applies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "Then you're telling me that it need not be during as long as it's in furtherance of. So the \"in furtherance of\" is also incorporated implicitly in the sentencing factors."
  },

    "speaker": "MAYNARD",
    "speech": "Well, the -- no, the \"in furtherance of,\" it -- the inquiry we would be making at sentencing, Justice Stevens, is not was the discharge in furtherance of. You would -- you would -- all you would be asking is, were you still possessing the firearm in furtherance --"

And our argument is simply this, merely because this might be a sentencing enhancement rather than an element of the offense, this Court never says that the normal rules of statutory construction cease to apply under those circumstances, which means that the mens rea presumption is appropriate in this case, and just like this Court said in the passage I just cited. If Congress wants to dispense with that requirement, they must do so clearly, and they simply did not do that in this case. If they wanted to do that, they could insert the words \"intentionally\" or \"unintentionally discharge,\" in which case that would be clear. And that simply is not the way this statute reads. The best reading of the statute, I believe, and this is what Your Honor was headed toward, is to read the discharge to require during and in relation to. I just think that's the best --"
