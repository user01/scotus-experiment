      "speaker": "BROWNING",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether Congress expressly provided for a limitations period for retaliatory discharge action under the Federal False Claims Act. The 6-year limitation period set out in section 3731(b) of the act is tied to a violation of section 3729, that is, the submission of a fraudulent claim to the Government. The triggering event to start the statute of limitations running under section 3731(b) is a violation of section 3729. Because a violation of section 3729 is not an element of the cause of action for retaliatory discharge, Congress did not intend to provide a limitations period in section 3731(b) for a retaliatory discharge action. The Government in its amicus brief argues that Congress must have intended a uniform limitation period so that all three actions created by the False Claims Act could be brought in the same proceeding. The -- the Government's argument undermines the very purpose of the Federal False Claims Act and the retaliatory discharge provision. The retaliatory discharge provision, section 3730(h) of the False Claims Act, not only protects people who blow the whistle, the initial whistleblower, but it expressly protects people who testify at trial. And we have seen time and again in many of these cases the Government will keep a case under seal for 5, 6, 7 years. We've seen repeatedly situations, because of the complexity of the underlying violation of the false claim, that it might take a decade from when the complaint is filed to when the case actually is put before a jury."

Yes, one could hypothesize these cases, but are there any actual cases where the retaliation in fact fell outside the 6-year, dated from the submission of the false claim?"

But it is a very real and concrete problem when you have cases that go to trial, that it takes so long to go to trial, and those people who are testifying at trial have no protection because it's more than 6 years from the violation of section 3729.

And -- and as the amicus brief of the National Work Right Institute points out, an organization that's designed to protect the human rights of employees, an organization that's a spin-off of the American Civil Liberties Union, that organization clearly views the interpretation advocated by the respondents and adopted by the Fourth Circuit as detrimental by employees."

I imagine you all racked your brains to say has there ever been such an example, and I take the answer is no, never. Not all of you could even find one instance where this happened. Now, am I right?

And if there's some other problem of the kind you're worried about that comes up, we will worry about that later through amendment, tolling, et cetera. Why is that an -- we don't want 30 - day statutes of limitations or 90-day statute of limitations. We want 6 years. That helps most people.

We'll have to go into that proof to take place more than 6 years later. Now, that would be the reason, and I agree it would be contrary.

It is clearly in 3730(h), but when you look at the False Claims Act, Congress has used the phrase, an action under 3730, to mean different things in various portions throughout the False Claims Act. Congress has used that phrase on six different occasions, and I would particularly direct the Court's attention to 3731(c). In -- in that provision, Congress has provided that in an action brought under section 3730, the United States must prove the elements of the cause of action by a preponderance of the evidence. The respondent and the Government say you must have this literal reading of section -- the phrase, an action under 3730, and it means all three causes of action in 3731(b), but that -- but when you turn to 3731(c), that virtually identical phrase appears and you have to read that statutory provision in context, and read in context - -"

      "speaker": "BROWNING",

You have to read it in context, and I think when you read 3731(b) in context and that limitations period is tied to a violation of section 3729, it is clear that Congress did not intend the phrase, an action under 3730, to -- to include a retaliatory discharge action in which a violation of section - -"

      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

Congress might want to have one 6-year limitation and say, well, maybe there would be this hypothetical case that you're worried about, but for the most part, 6 years will take care of everybody."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BROWNING",
      "speech": "And, Justice Ginsburg, my point is just as section 3731(c) is not intended to cover all of the causes of action under the False Claims Act, 3731(b) is not intended to cover all of the actions under the False Claims Act as well, that it's only intended to cover the causes of action in which a violation of section 3729 is an element of the cause of action. The -- the Government makes the argument that you need a uniform limitations period so these actions can be tried together, but the Government ignores the fact that a qui tam action or an action brought by the Government is a completely different cause of action than an action for retaliatory discharge action. They involve different substantive claims."

      "speaker": "BROWNING",
      "speech": "That is the case, but -- but I also want to point out that in many cases, the person who brings the qui tam action is a completely different plaintiff than the person who brings the retaliatory discharge action. The example of someone who is retaliated against for testifying at trial -- in that situation, it's clearly going to be a different plaintiff than the plaintiff who brought the original qui tam action. It can also be a different defendant. Section 3730(h) is intended to preclude an industry from blacklisting an employee. So if an employee brings a qui tam action while at one employer and subsequently leaves and go to -- goes to work for a second employer, when the second employer recognizes or -- or learns that this employee had previously been involved in an investigation under the False Claims Act, that second employer is precluded from retaliating against the -- the employee.

Harrison ruled that a witness who is retaliated against at a Federal trial does have a section 1985 action. Here, Congress was focusing on the whistleblower, encouraging him to bring this qui tam action. In fact, he's only protected for activities that are -- the -- the statute says, in furtherance of an action under this section. That is pointing to the qui tam action. And there's all kinds of problems that arise if these two actions are not brought together if the retaliation action must be brought first. First, if you accept the petitioner's view, you're going to have situations where as little as 180 days -- they have 180 days like in Florida to bring this retaliation action.

      "speaker": "HURT",
      "speech": "Well, no. I think that ignores how statute of limitations are actually construed by courts. You can write a statute basically two ways. You can put the violation as the trigger or you can put the act, alleged to be a violation. Courts apply those identically. And for instance, if you have a summary judgment motion by a qui tam -- qui tam defendant, which we always agree that this statute (b)(1) applies, all the defendant has to do is point out the act alleged to be a false claim falls outside of the 6-year period, and he wins. He doesn't have -- no one has to show whether the actual claim itself was false or not. So I think, you know, as Justice Breyer points out, this is the way you universally construe statute of limitations. Having the same trigger for all three 3730 actions means the limitations period starts for all three at the same time. This makes it easier for the whistleblower to bring both their qui tam and retaliation actions together. If she's forced to bring the retaliation action first, then if she misses that, then she's got no incentive to then go on and bring the qui tam action from the -- the incentive from this whistleblower action, which is the key purpose of it. Also, if she has to bring the -- the retaliation action first before the qui tam action, then what will happen, if she's not ready to bring the qui tam action - - these can be very complicated allegations, complicated defense contract -- then what will happen is she will most likely have to split her claim.

And if it's going to take -- you've just said how difficult it may be to prepare one of these qui tam cases. If in fact you're right and it may take a couple of years from the time the employer gets wind that something is going on and fires or does whatever, then in exactly that situation, the -- the whistleblower damages are going to be mounting during that period of 1 or 2 or whatever years it may be before the qui tam action starts. So on your hypothesis, it seems to me, you're going to get just the situation that Justice Ginsburg raised."

      "speech": "I think that -- that that is a possible case, but I think that that's -- the priorities for the Government and -- and Congress in drafting this law was to get money back for the Government. That's their number one concern here and to incentivize that whistleblower. If it so happens that the whistleblower takes much -- takes a long time to prepare his qui tam and brings his -- his retaliation action at the same time and ends up getting some more damages, I -- I think that ranks low on the list of Congress' priorities in drafting this retaliation provision. It's the -- getting the Government's money back, giving the whistleblower protection and an incentive to bring that qui tam claim is really Congress' core concern here. And I think these other issues about damages mounting can be readily addressed with the mitigation defense and -- and dealing with that that will take care of double damages so -- so if the whistleblower is just sitting around waiting for that, then the mitigation defense would take care of that. Also, I think the petitioner raised the idea that this is some kind of -- the -- the retaliator can bring some kind of nebulous fraud allegation if it doesn't -- isn't really tied to a specific false claim. I think that the courts are not interpreting it that way because this is a False Claims Act retaliation claim, not just a generalized fraud claim. So in a typical case, there will be a claim that -- that the whistleblower will -- will be able to point to and say I think that this claim is false. I have a good faith belief that it is false, and then it -- and that's what the trigger would be based on. I mean, in summary, if there's no further questions, I'd like to just summarize. I think this Court should uphold the plain language of the statute. While the limitations trigger is unusual, it is the one that Congress set forth in the statute. It makes sense. It reflects the unique considerations of encouraging -- the goal of encouraging a whistleblower to bring his qui tam claim with his retaliation claim. 19 years of experience have shown that the plain language works in the typical cases that arise, and that none of the reasons given by the petitioners come close to providing a justification for this Court to discard the plain language of the statute. None of the reasons - - this statute does not rise to the level of absurdity that would justify this Court disregarding the plain language. Thank you."

Well, that's certainly not true because if -- if an action is brought under 3730(b) and the United States intervenes, section 3731(c) establishes the standard of proof. If Congress were to amend section 3730(h) to allow the United States to bring a claim on behalf of the employee who was retaliated against, section 3731(c) would, by its terms, establish the burden of proof that the United States would have to meet.

But in each of those case -- cases, the Court was very clear that that was the rule that applied in the absence of contrary indication by Congress. And here we have a very explicit contrary indication by Congress, that the statute of limitations for any civil action under section 3730 runs from the date on which the violation of section 3729 was committed. In other words, Congress has opted here to establish a single uniform statute of limitations for all claims that might arise under the False Claims Act. And as I said before, that serves the purposes of the False Claims Act better, far better certainly, than petitioner's alternative. As we have pointed out, many State statutes of limitations, assuming that one can determine which one applies of the many that might be offered, are much shorter than the statute provided for bringing the qui tam action. As a practical matter, then an employee might be forced to split their claims. If they split their claims, any number of adverse consequences follow. First, they could find themselves barred from bringing a subsequent qui tam action on behalf of the United States by the public disclosure bar of the False Claims Act. The Eleventh Circuit has a rule that says that the two claims are one for purposes of res judicata. So in the Eleventh Circuit, apparently they could be barred by res judicata from bringing a qui tam action. The disclosures in the course of the wrongful termination of retaliation claim action would, of course, alert the defendant to the scope and extent of any Government investigation."

He doesn't have a full knowledge of what the employee knows and certainly doesn't know that the employee might have told the Government and that the Government is investigating. And that's the purpose of the under seal requirement of the False Claims Act, to allow the Government to conduct a full investigation of the claim, talk to other employees about what was going on. Sometimes the employee really has identified fraud, but may only have identified a portion of the larger scheme of fraud that's going on. And the Government gets to investigate that while the claim is under seal. But in the course of discovery in any wrongful termination suit or retaliation suit, all of that information would become available to the employer. And so the sealed provisions of the FCA would be defeated in large extent. There's also the fact of just the litigation efficiencies of litigating the two claims together."

And one of the examples that the Government use -- uses is the public disclosure doctrine which is set out in section 3730(e)(4)(A) of the False Claims Act. The public disclosure doctrine, however, is a red herring here because the public disclosure doctrine is designed to keep -- to avoid parasitic lawsuits where information is in the -- the public domain, somebody taking that information, and then filing a -- a qui tam lawsuit. The -- the public disclosure doctrine, 3730(e)(4)(A), also provides that when someone is the original source of the information, even if the basis for the lawsuit has been made public through a congressional hearing or elsewhere, that person can still bring an action if they're an original source. So it's a complete red herring here. The other red herring that was put forth is a statement that there's a rule in the Eleventh Circuit relating to claims splitting. And forgive me, I cannot recall the name of the case that the Government is referring to, but it is a decision by James C. Hill. And that specific case involved a situation where the qui tam action was brought, a settlement was reached, and then well after the fact, the plaintiff said, oh, and I have this retaliation claim. It makes perfect sense in that situation to -- to apply principles of res judicata. What the Government is ignoring is there are no reported decisions anywhere where a retaliatory discharge action was brought and then res judicata was used to bar the qui tam action filed at a later date. And there's a perfectly logical reason for that because they are different causes of action, and they involve different parties. A retaliation claim is personal to the individual. A qui tam action is an action brought on behalf of the Government. One final point that I'd like to make is the respondent takes the position that the False Claims Act is unique. Well, it's not unique. It's not unique in that when you look at the Major Fraud Act, there is a retaliatory discharge provision that is virtually identical to the False Claims Act, and in the Major Frauds Act -- with respect to the Major Fraud Act, Congress made a -- a conscious decision not to include an express limitations period. It's not -- the False Claim Act is also not unique when you compare it to ERISA. ERISA - -"

      "speaker": "BROWNING",
      "speech": "But -- but there is -- it -- but the criminal statute provides for a civil remedy for a retaliatory discharge, and with respect to that retaliatory discharge provision in the Major Fraud Act, there is no limitations provision. One other point that I want to make is that the False Claims Act is not -- not unique when you compare it to ERISA. ERISA is a statute that has essentially a retaliatory discharge provision as well in section 510 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1140. And courts -- the Federal courts have consistently held that there is no express limitations period for section 510, so we have to look to the limitations period under the most closely analogous State law cause of action. On the other hand, ERISA has numerous provisions, numerous other aspects of the statute, that do have a limitations period. The limitations period for an action for breach of fiduciary duty is a 6-year period with a 3-year tolling provision. So ERISA is a prime example of a statute where Congress has made a decision that when you have a retaliatory discharge provision, not to apply the statute of limitations period, that you look to State law, even though that Federal statute in other aspects has other limitations provisions. If there are no further questions, we would rely upon our briefs."
