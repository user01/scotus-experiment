Whereas, in fact, the cause of action at the time of the agreement with the lawyer has an inchoate value. The -- the value that is actually realized is going to depend in part on the -- on the skill and -- and the -- the gumption of the lawyer.

Our analysis says at all relevant times, regardless of whether the value changed or not, the client was at all times in control of the underlying source of income, and it's just as if in Helvering v.

And that, of course, is what's bothering me because it seems to me that your theory, which is a well-established theory, coupled with a Congress that seems to be willing to take away deductions for expenses that lead to the income, could produce an income tax that in many cases, not just a few, exceeds the income that an individual has.

It is a bedrock principle of taxation that settlements of a claim are taxed the same as a judgment would have been taxed. Mr. Banks' settlement was achieved in lieu of his claims under title VII and 42 U.S.C., sections 1981 and 1983. Now, each of these statutes contains a fee shifting provision which enables a court to award attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff. The defendant in Mr. Banks' case, the California Department of Education -- they therefore settled Mr. Banks' claim in lieu of their exposure under these fee shifting statutes. An award pursuant to these fee shifting statutes is separate and distinct from a damages recovery and therefore should not be taxable to a plaintiff. And the Federal tax consequences to Mr. Banks, the litigant who settles, shouldn't be any different as well. Otherwise, this Court would be discouraging settlement. Therefore, a judicial anti-abuse rule should not be misused to undermine the statutory scheme devised by Congress to encourage civil rights litigants to bring meritorious claims and vindicate national policy.

In petitioner's view, those agreements don't even give rise to an assignment of income in the ordinary sense. If you look at the text of the fee agreement in the Banaitis case -- the Banks' fee agreement is not in the record -- among other things, it makes clear that if there is a termination -- and it provides lots of grounds on which the attorney-client relationship can be terminated -- that the attorney will be paid a reasonable fee, calculated at the sum of $175 per hour. That doesn't sound like an assignment of any income or even an assignment of the underlying cause of action. Even if it did, it is clear that in every assignment of income case, the assignor loses control over that income that he assigned. That doesn't stop the application of the proper tax principles, however. The -- the respondents in these cases suffered a legally cognizable injury. They had a claim. That claim entitled them to a recovery. They retained services to pursued that claim. If they had paid their lawyers on an hourly basis, those lawyers may have been just as necessary to the actual outcome of the case as their contingent fee attorneys. Both the -- an hourly fee attorney and a contingent fee attorney in both of the States at issue here -- and in fact, in all States of which I'm aware -- received precisely the same attorney's lien. That lien makes clear that the relationship between attorney and client starts out as that between a master and an agent and then is converted through the fee agreement to that between a creditor and a debtor, and the lien secures the debt and ensures its payment. When the proceeds from the litigation are paid to the attorney, it satisfies the respondent's debt and is therefore income to the attorney. Under the separate and alternative ground of this Court's Old Colony decision, it goes far and beyond even the holding with regard to an assignment of income. To address just a couple of questions that came up, I would point out that in the class action context, again, as I indicated, there are a number of differences. And just to be a little more specific about some of them, generally speaking there's no unilateral right to settle a -- a case by class members. There's no unilateral right to dismiss the case, and there's no right to a determined fee."
