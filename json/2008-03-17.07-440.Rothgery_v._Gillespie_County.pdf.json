  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Brewer and Jackson, this Court held that an initial appearance before a magistrate like the one here marks the commencement of a criminal prosecution under the Sixth Amendment.  This case demonstrates why that holding makes eminent sense. Rothgery was arrested on the erroneous belief that he was a felon in possession of a firearm. As required by the Texas Code, he was brought before a magistrate, who informed him of the felony accusation against him and required him to post bail or remain in jail to ensure that he answered that accusation. At that point, Rothgery acquired specific rights under Texas law as the accused in a felony case, including the right to have the prosecution against him dismissed if an indictment or information were not filed within a set period and the right to contest the accusation against him prior to indictment in an examining trial before the magistrate.  At that point, Rothgery was no longer merely a suspect, but an accused within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, this Court held in Jackson that the question whether a particular --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, in Jackson of course the charges had already been filed by the prosecutor, so there was an adversary on the field."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "What I was going to say was that there is a clear distinction which is set forth in this Court's opinion in Jackson between the question whether a particular proceeding initiates a criminal prosecution and whether that proceeding itself is adversarial in the sense that it requires the presence of defense counsel. And, as to the first question, whether a particular proceeding initiates a criminal prosecution, this Court's cases have not held that prosecutorial involvement is a relevant factor, and that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, I suppose -- I suppose you could you have an adversarial proceeding without the prosecutor present, but it would depend on the nature of the proceeding.  And here the magistrate simply advises the individual of the charges against him, repeats the Miranda warnings, advises him that he can have counsel if bail is denied or if he can't make bail.  What about that is adversarial?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and we don't contend that it is adversarial. In Jackson, this Court made clear that a proceeding need not itself be adversarial in the sense that would require defense counsel to be present to counter the adversary presentation of the prosecutor in order for that proceeding to initiate a criminal prosecution.  Rather, it held that the initial appearance itself, regardless of those other factors, marked the commencement of a prosecution. And it's worth noting that in Jackson substantially the same arguments that Respondent raises here were made by the State there.  The State there contended this initial appearance is merely an administrative ministerial proceeding."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, I guess I'll get back to the point I raised earlier, that in Jackson charges had already been filed by a prosecutor.  The prosecutor was aware of this proceeding.  I think that's a fairly significant distinction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "Well, the Court in Jackson placed no weight on that distinction.  That wasn't something that was mentioned in Jackson.  And what happened in Jackson was that warrants were obtained, the defendants were arrested, and they were brought before a magistrate for this initial proceeding.  There is no indication that the prosecutor was present at that initial proceeding.  The Jackson court -- the Jackson court put no weight on that factor.  And none of this Court's cases have ever stated that there is a requirement that a prosecutor be involved.  And that makes sense, because the consequences of the initial appearance for the defendant are precisely the same whether or not a prosecutor is involved."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "But what we're looking for here, at least one of the things we might look for in this case, is a specific rule to give to the States so the State knows when counsel has to be appointed. In this case suppose the magistrate, the man behind the little window, said:  We're going to give you a ticket; keep in touch with us; don't change your address until you notify us; you're free on your own recognizance.  Would counsel have been required there?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "Had there been no way in which the defendant was bound to reappear and answer the charges, then we would not have the situation that we have, and it would seem less likely that that would initiate a criminal proceeding.  The factors that we have here that make it clear that a prosecution was initiated, just as it was in Jackson on identical facts --"

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Ms. Spinelli, there's something confusing about your presentation of this, because you say that at this initial appearance that's called a magistration, you are not contending that there was a right to counsel at that very proceeding."

    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "Well, first I should say I believe that that question goes to Respondent's alternative argument for affirmance.  The only question that was addressed by the Fifth Circuit and the only question presented in the petition was the question whether a criminal prosecution commenced at Rothgery's magistration.  And we are certainly not asking this Court to direct the entry of judgment in our favor, but merely --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "We believe that -- well, this Court's cases have made clear that the right to counsel attaches at the time a criminal prosecution commences. Now, the question whether counsel must then be appointed immediately upon attachment is a separate question."

    "speech": "What does \"attachment\" mean?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",

At that point the defendant has the right to counsel to serve as an intermediary --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Well if Mr. Roth -- if your client had shown up at the magistration with an attorney, could the State of Texas have said, no, your attorney may not be present during the magistration?"

    "speech": "No, I don't believe so, because --"
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "We believe that the right attached at the magistration."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "At the beginning, at the end?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "What does that mean?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "So perhaps -- so at the end -- I suppose I would say at the end, once --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Then why could Texas have said your attorney -- why could Texas have not said, although you came here with an attorney, your attorney may not be present because you don't have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the magistration?  Your right hasn't attached yet.  It won't attach until the end."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "Well, I believe that it would attach at the time that the magistrate informed the defendant of the accusation against him, at which point he became a defendant in a criminal case and his right to counsel attached. Now, to get back to Justice Ginsburg's question, whether -- whether counsel is required to be appointed immediately upon attachment is a separate issue, which is the subject of Respondent's alternative ground for affirmance.  We are merely asking this Court to resolve the threshold question, which is the threshold question in every right to counsel case, did a criminal prosecution commence at Rothgery's magistration?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "The two are kind of related.  If in fact there's not a right to counsel upon the magistration, but, as you said earlier to Justice Alito, it attaches at the end of the magistration, it seems to me like you're asking for counsel to be an investigator rather than to participate in the trial proceedings."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "No, I don't believe so, Your Honor.  This Court has said that a defendant does not have a right for a lawyer to act as a pre-charge private investigator.  But our contention is that Rothgery was charged at his magistration.  At that point he became an accused, which is demonstrated by the structure of the Texas Code itself."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "How is that different from a traffic ticket?"

  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "It's very different from a traffic ticket, Justice Kennedy, because in that situation -- I think that situation would be analogous to a warrantless arrest, which, as we know, does not commence adversary judicial proceedings.  Here, we have an arrest.  We have a person who has been held for a period of time --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "So it's the warrant that makes the difference?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "No, I don't believe so.  I believe it's the magistration."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Or the incarceration. Would your case be different if after the magistration the -- your client was free to go?  The court said, you know, this is what you've been arrested for and charged with by the policeman who brought you in; we'll -- you know, good-bye.  Whereas in this case, he was required to make bail.  Suppose he hadn't been required to make bail, supposing he was free to go?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "If he had not been required to make bail or make any other binding promise to appear, which is the function of bail, to ensure that the defendant will answer the accusation --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "-- then we would be lacking that piece of evidence that he had been accused.  There still would remain other evidence under Texas law that he was, in fact, an accused at that time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "So Texas -- assuming we agree with that, Texas made one of two possible constitutional violations.  Either it was unconstitutional for Texas to require him to make bail, or it was unconstitutional for Texas not to provide him with an attorney.  Why should -- why should we find that the latter was the problem rather than the former?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "Well, there is certainly nothing unconstitutional about requiring bail, as we know."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, there certainly is if you're not charged.  I think it's a very strong point in your favor that he was required to make bail, because I don't think you can hold somebody without charging him, just say, you know --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "Well, we -- I mean, we --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "The fact -- the fact that he was held suggests that he was charged with something."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "We agree, Justice Scalia.  In fact, the Texas Code expressly recognizes that the function of bail is to ensure that the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Sure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "-- accused will answer the accusation against him."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "So maybe, maybe Texas was wrong about that, that it shouldn't have required bail. Maybe that was what was unconstitutional, rather than its failure to provide counsel."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "Well, what occurred here, however, was that Texas did require Mr. Rothgery to post bail.  And in addition, the magistration gave rise to certain specific rights, which only accrued to defendants in criminal prosecutions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "-- that a magistrate is required whenever bail is set -- pardon me, that an attorney is required whenever bail is set?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "We're not contending that an attorney was required."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "The rule is -- I want to know, what do we tell Texas it has to do in all these cases?  What do we tell jurisdictions that have to deal with traffic tickets?  Does it make a difference that you're held in custody or not held in custody?  I don't understand the rule you want us to adopt."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "I think the rule -- we're actually not asking the Court to adopt any new rule today, but simply to reaffirm the rule it has already announced in Brewer and Jackson, which is that an initial appearance before a magistrate, which is a proceeding that is common across jurisdictions and has a common significance across jurisdictions, a proceeding at which a magistrate informs the defendant officially of the accusation against him and of his rights as a criminal defendant --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

Now, is there any law that tells me -- it's an indictment, that's clear -- and is there any law that tells me, when he requests a counsel be appointed, when they have to do it?"

A big demonstration, 500 people arrested, they are brought down to the station, bail is posted the next day, the U.S. attorney or the D.A. thinks:  I'm going to indict the ringleaders, and the rest -- you know, the rest we are just going to let go; they will forfeit their bond.

What happens there is that these 500 people brought down to the station, they are required to put up bail; they are given a warning because people might question them; they are given a warning; they are then released.  And nothing further is heard.  Maybe three months later, they come in and they agree that they'll forfeit their bond. Now, that's what I'm wondering.  That must happen, because I think there are lots of demonstrations; they occur sometimes.  I suspect it happens.  How is it handled, if you know?"

You're saying, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, you're charged with, for example, trespassing or conducting a demonstration on the court grounds, and that's a crime.  You're charged with that, but we are not going to hold you, so, you know, come back in a month."

If all that happens is that the police tell you, you know, we believe you've committed a crime, certainly that doesn't commence a prosecution.  If there is a formal -- you know, as happens in misdemeanor prosecutions, if there is a formal complaint filed which can be the basis for a conviction in a misdemeanor case, then it may be that, by analogy to an indictment in a felony case, a prosecution would commence at that point."

I mean, if you have some proceeding afterwards, yes, then you do need a lawyer, but the mere fact that you've been brought to the courthouse and made bail and let go does not require 500 counsel to be provided.

I mean, if I think that counsel has to be appointed right away for -- for Justice Breyer's 500 demonstrators, I'm going to give a different answer to the first question.  But if I know that counsel doesn't have to be appointed until the prosecution proceeds to some significant phase where an attorney would be -- would be really helpful, then -- then I can -- I can be quite more sympathetic to your -- to your argument."

And more broadly, this Court has repeatedly stated that one of the core purposes of the right to counsel is to ensure that the defendant understands and is able to invoke all of his rights.  And in this case, this was the right that he possessed that could have enabled him to demonstrate his innocence prior to being indicted, rearrested, and incarcerated.  And he lost that right because he didn't have counsel's help. With the Court's permission, I'll reserve the balance of my time."

And that's true in general and it's true under Texas law. Either way he's faced with a need to negotiate criminal law in order to contest the charges against him.  He has a right to do so under Texas law, and he has a right to have the prosecution against him dismissed if an indictment isn't filed within a set period.

It said:  \"I have determined that probable cause existed for the arrest of the individual accused therein.\" All right.  Now, what happens -- and I think it would be helpful to know the answer to this -- in what might be a rare instance, but the truth of the matter is there was probable cause to arrest that individual when he was arrested, but there isn't now. So because he came in -- you know, he said here's 14 cousins, I was somewhere else at the time, they all agree.  I mean, everybody agrees on a certain fact that means there isn't now.

We are unaware of any case that has said that there is a Sixth Amendment right to consult with counsel before deciding whether to ask for an examining trial.  And in fact, in Texas they are very rare because in the very unusual circumstances where somebody asks for one, more often than not the prosecutor will simply hurry up and do an indictment.

If that happens for the purpose, the primary purpose, primary purpose of bringing the individual to trial, at that point the Sixth Amendment right attaches. Now, the State would not have to give him a lawyer if there was some other purpose primary, for example, as in Gouveia, keeping the prisons safe. For example, it's quite clear under the circumstances, there are 14 people accused, they couldn't have all have done it, they want to investigate further.  Or maybe there are other examples.  But, for the primary purpose, then the right attaches. So you pick up Gerstein and add to Gerstein that additional requirement.  What about that?  What harm would that cause?

The Court went through a lengthy exegesis in Gouveia about what interests in particular are protected and talked about this, this expression of a concern about our liberty interests; and that the purpose issue was not something that the Court addressed there. It simply said that our Fourth Amendment precedents go to the liberty interests.  Our Sixth Amendment speedy-trial and other precedents go to the liberty interests. The right to counsel is not specifically a liberty-interest protection.  It is something, as Chief Justice Roberts mentioned a few minutes ago as we set out in our brief, something that protects your right to a fair trial.

Coleman itself says that the reason we're requiring counsel for a preliminary hearing or an examining trial, as we call it in Texas, is precisely because there will be witnesses, there will be arguments made; and you could waive defenses if not made there; that this is very important.  So we're going to define even, this examining trial or preliminary hearing, even though it comes before an indictment, we're going to define that as an event of attachment solely because your right to a fair trial could very much be prejudiced there. And that -- that doesn't exist in this case, and that certainly the failure to ask for a examining trial does not prejudice your right to a fair trial. Justice Breyer, you asked a hypothetical that I would like -- I would like to address because it is something that happens all the time, and I think should inform the Court's decision here.  And, that is, it is not uncommon, and some statistics that I have seen suggest that it may happen in half of the cases, where an individual is arrested, magistrated, released, and no charges are ever brought.  So the bulk of your 500 protesters are never brought. Under Mr. Rothgery's view of the Sixth Amendment, the county -- you know, let's say somebody is protesting whitetail deer hunting in Gillespie County. The county would be required to appoint counsel for all of those individuals even though --"

Jackson, which I have previously addressed in the Cobb case which I argued. But in most other circumstances we think that the analysis is essentially the same, because the Court has never said that there isn't a right -- there is a right to have the assistance of counsel without having a critical stage. In fact, I believe Justice Brennan -- if you will allow me 15 seconds -- Justice Brennan's decision in Maine v. Moulton said:  \"Recognizing that the right to the assistance of counsel is shaped by the need for the assistance of counsel, we have found that the right attaches at earlier critical stages in the criminal justice process where the results might well settle the accused's fate and reduce the trial, itself, to a mere formality.\""

Is that the state of the law, in fact?"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "I don't believe so, Justice Kennedy.  It's correct that Gerstein says that the probable-cause determination made under Gerstein is not, itself, a critical stage, and we are not contending otherwise. The Gerstein determination is something separate from the initial appearance that occurred here. A Gerstein determination is made for the purpose of determining whether there was probable cause for an arrest.  It can be made ex parte.  It's essentially the equivalent of what happens prior to arrest when a magistrate decides whether there is probable cause to issue a warrant. What happened here, by contrast, was after arrest and after the police had decided to -- Mr. Rothgery, he was brought before a magistrate.  He was officially informed of the accusation against him, and at that time he acquired the right to contest the accusation against him in an examining trial, which we believe shows that he was accused within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and a prosecution had begun. And we are not contending that that initial proceeding was, itself, a critical stage where counsel was required; and it's not necessary to contend that in order to prevail on the point that that was when a prosecution commenced, which is the only question that we believe is properly before this Court and the only one we are asking it to resolve."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So Texas would be better off if they didn't have a magistration proceeding at all, if they didn't have a proceeding to alert the individual of the charges against him; they did not have a proceeding to read him his rights; they did not have a determination of probable cause.  They would be better off if they didn't do any of that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "Well, I mean I think you are suggesting, Mr. Chief Justice, that reaffirming the rule adopted in Jackson would create, you know, a perverse incentive for States to do away with this proceeding.  I don't believe that that's the case because, as Justice Breyer observed, 45 jurisdictions already follow the rule of appointing counsel at, or immediately following, the initial appearance, which the -- any CDL brief lays out and which neither Respondent nor its State amici have contested."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, what's in it for the State to provide this additional layer? Because, of course, the person gets Miranda warnings when he is arrested.  And so why -- why should the State do this?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "The initial appearance serves a specific, substantive purpose which I think is well described in the Seventh Circuit's decision in Armstrong cited on page 15 of our reply brief, which is this is the proceeding at which the defendant is informed:  You are now a criminal defendant.  This is the accusation against you, and these are your rights as a defendant in a criminal proceeding. And for that reason, as the Armstrong decision says, it is commonly recognized across jurisdictions as the inception of a formal prosecution, and we believe that's the rule that this Court has already laid out in Brewer and Jackson and should reaffirm today."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Why don't you take an extra minute?  We have eaten up your rebuttal time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPINELLI",
    "speech": "Of course, absolutely.  I mean, just to respond to one other question that arose during the course of Respondent's argument, I think it is important to understand that in Texas, as in other jurisdictions, there are two phases in a felony prosecution. There is an initial phase that commences in a magistrate court where a document setting out the charges will be filed either by the police or by a prosecutor, and the magistrate at that point has jurisdiction over that criminal case.  It is only later that an indictment or information will be filed in the general trial court with jurisdiction to enter final judgment. But this Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that a prosecution begins only in that second phase.  It rejected it expressly in Moore.  It rejected it in Coleman, in Brewer, in Jackson, and in statements in Kirby and McNeil.  So that can't be the rule."
