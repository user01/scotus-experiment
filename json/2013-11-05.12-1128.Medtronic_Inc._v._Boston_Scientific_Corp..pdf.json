And until this case, it was settled that the burden does not shift if the issue arises in a declaratory action seeking a judgment of non­infringement. The Federal circuit imposed a different rule in suits brought under MedImmune where the party seeking a declaration of non­infringement is a licensee. That was error. Allocation of the burden of proof inheres in the governing substantive law, while the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only and does not change substantive rights. The burden of proof in MedImmune actions, like all other declaratory actions, remains where it would have rested in the equivalent coercive suit brought by that patentee."

In MedImmune, you didn't have that procedure, but the Court still held in the context of that case that, because Genentech had made clear that it thought that the Cabilly patent covered the accused devices, there was sufficient ­­ sufficiently concrete controversy that MedImmune did not have to stop paying royalties and breach the license. And ­­ and so, therefore ­­ I think I may be talking around your question, but I am trying to get to the point that the ­­ the requirement of some notice, the ­­ the patentee ­­ there's no declaratory judgment jurisdiction if the patentee doesn't know about the product, has ­­ has never done anything to suggest that the product ­­ that his or her patent reads on the product.

But there are particular types of non­infringement claims. And the ones that I'm familiar with are prosecution history estoppel and the experimental use exception that are affirmative defenses. In other words, those are situations in which the alleged infringer says, hey, I'm not saying that your patent doesn't read ­­ all the claims of your patent don't read on my invention; I'm claiming non­infringement because I was making experimental use, and that has affirmatively been determined by Congress not to infringe. Or, yes, your ­­ the elements of your claim read upon my invention, but during the prosecution of the patent in the Patent Office, you disclaimed some claim scope, and under prosecution history estoppel, this Court elucidated in Festow, there is no infringement.

And if so, who would bear the burden of proof?"

    {
      "speaker": "WAXMAN",

This case not only involves products that didn't ­­ that aren't specifically articulated in a license agreement; neither the patents nor the products at issue in this case had even been conceived, much less in existence, at the time the license agreement was in effect. But in ­­ if I understand your question, in a situation in which I make Widget A and you claim that you have the patent that reads on that widget, and I ­­ you agree to license me to do it, if the license ­­ if payment of the license depends upon a determination that it otherwise would be infringing, I can file a declaratory judgment action and seek a declaration that it's not infringing. That is, if the cover ­­ if the license covers only products that otherwise would infringe, I can bring a DEC action, claiming non­infringement, and you would bear the burden, assuming that you had threatened, in some way, to enforce your patent against me. In ­­ in the ­­ the situation that ­­ sort of bogeyman situation that Mirowski and the ­­ the intellectual property owner's brief articulate, which ­­ imagine, which is you license ­­ I have a ­­ I have a product, you have a patent, you license it to me, and I turn around the next day and sue for ­­ a declaration of non­infringement, there are any number of ways that you, as the patentee, could protect yourself from that extraordinary eventuality. You could provide, for example, that ­­ I ­­ you would require me to issue a ­­ you know, to ­­ to ­­ to pay a paid­up royalty for all use. Or you could simply say, we don't care whether the patent infringes or not; you agree to pay me three dollars per unit sold. Or you could put a provision in that would say, if you sue for patent infringement, the royalty rate goes to 3X. Or, for that matter, if you sue, that will ­­ that can ­­ I can deem that a breach of the license agreement and ­­ and recover the ­­ the remedies that patent law allows, an injunction and treble damages and attorneys' fees in the context of a ­­ a willful action. I want to underscore, although the Federal circuit made a broad rule, exactly what we have here. In this case, Mirowski ­­ this license is from 1991. Mirowski ­­ it's not in the record, but there's no dispute that Mirowski has received hundreds of millions of dollars of royalties from Medtronic for its patents. It gets, as a benefit of this license ­­ notice, as I said, within 30 days of every new product and the manual, and it can require Medtronic to start accruing royalties and an interest rate of 2 ­­ of 2 points over prime, as soon as it sends us a notice. And moreover, in the ­­ in the litigation tolling agreement, we agree that, even though we are not a party in the referenced St. Jude action, we would be bound by any determination in that adjudication, whereas, otherwise, we wouldn't. So this license agreement was enormously beneficial and couldn't be farther from the scenario of I have a widget, I agree to license it, and the next day, I turn around and sue you. But, in that event, there would be lots and lots of remedies. I do want to underscore one other thing, that the Federal circuit said that it was applying this special rule only in MedImmune­type cases. But the rationale of the court is that what causes the burden to shift is the absence of a counterclaim for infringement. That would have, for example, caused the burden to shift in the Myriad case that this Court decided last term, where there was one researcher at NYU who had standing to bring a declaratory judgment action. There was no basis for Myriad to claim infringement because he had made clear that he wouldn't ­­ he wouldn't engage in the research and clinical work that he was going to, so long as he was in risk of patent infringement remedies. And that ­­ the source of the rule ­­ the source of the law where the burden of proof lies, is in substantive patent law. And this Court has said, for 125 years, that it rests with the infringer. What neither the Federal circuit nor my friend on the other side of this case has ever identified is what is the source of the rule that shifts the burden in a declaratory judgment action? It can't be the Declaratory Judgment Act because that Act is procedural only. If I can reserve the balance of my time?"

That best serves the purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act and allows for final resolution of the types of controversies that this Court contemplated in MedImmune. If I could turn to Justice Kagan's points about an incident in which the parties had actually agreed to ­­ whether certain products were covered by a particular license. That would be different from the situation we have here because the products in question here weren't actually in existence at the time of the underlying license agreement.

      "speaker": "GANNON",
      "speech": "I was not about to suggest that, Justice Sotomayor. I was going to say that I think that's the ­­ that ­­ that that would probably be the least logical way to deal with the quandary that might arise from thinking that somebody is then trying to breach the license. And we don't think there's any license breach here because there wasn't any prior agreement on the fact that these future products were going to be covered by the ­­ by these patents, that they'd be practicing these patents. But, even if there were some concern about the licensee turning around and challenging the agreement that it had previously made, it seems like the problem there is either that they should be estopped by what they already said in the agreement or Lear needs to be extended to keep them from being estopped in that way. But shifting the burden of proof seems like an odd way to get at solving whatever the quandary there might be. And I think that, at some point, this ­­ this also interweaves with a point that the Chief Justice made, about whether Medtronic here is seeking to change the status quo. And we don't think that Medtronic is seeking to change the status quo here, for a couple different reasons. One of them is, as I was just saying, that the agreement here didn't actually reach ­­ the license agreement here didn't ­­ it didn't include a meeting of the minds about whether these particular future products would be covered by these patents, including one of the patents was reissued after the time of the license. And also, this license agreement expressly preserved the parties' ability, including Medtronic's ability, to challenge both the validity and the enforceability of the patent. That's at page 13 of the Joint Appendix. And so there's no way in which I think it can be legitimately said that Medtronic is trying to either get out of its contractual obligations or to change the status quo. The status quo, right now, is that the royalties are collecting in a certified account, and so, in a sense, both parties are trying to change the status quo, in trying to get the stream of royalties that either is applicable to these products or isn't, on the basis of the resolution of a question that the parties had not decided, but said would be decided in a declaratory judgment action like this. And we think that the best way to think of a declaratory judgment action like this is that it is the mirror image of the underlying coercive hypothetical action that could have been brought against Medtronic."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Well ­­ well, but I guess the argument is that it's the mirror image of an action that could not have been brought because Medtronic is paying royalties."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GANNON",
      "speech": "Well, the same thing is true in MedImmune, and I think that the Court noted that the ­­ in MedImmune, that the Declaratory Judgment Act was intended to help get the party out of the dilemma it would be in, in deciding whether it should continue to be effectively coerced into paying royalties that it thinks it doesn't need to pay or exposing itself to the risks associated with ­­ with breaching the license and ­­ and being subject to treble damages, attorneys' fees, and the other remedies that would be available under the Patent Act. And, yet, even though there had been no infringement in that case and no breach of the contract in that case, which is also true here, because, so far, everybody has been behaving the way the license expected them to behave, the Court recognized that the parties had a concrete dispute about the applicability of the patents to those particular products, that the scope of the contract was not going to require payment of royalties where the patent did not apply, and said that the ­­ the issues that were going to be resolved in the declaratory judgment action there were going to involve questions of patent validity, patent enforceability, and scope of coverage, patent infringement, which is exactly what we have here. Medtronic has raised in their complaint ­­ the well­pleaded complaint that you would look to here, is one that arises under the Patent Act and includes claims involving all three of those issues, just as was the case in MedImmune."

      "speaker": "GANNON",
      "speech": "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do disagree with that. We think that this case involves a claim that arises under the patent laws, for the reasons that I was just saying. I think that the way to ­­ the way to conceptualize this is to look to what the well­pleaded complaint would be in the hypothetical coercive action that would be being brought against Medtronic if we didn't have the problem presented by the fact that they haven't actually breached the contract or infringed at this point. And we have every reason to think that that hypothetical coercive action is one that arises under the patent laws because it's one involving infringement. That's the dispute that the parties acknowledge that they have. In the litigation tolling agreement at page 20 of the Joint Appendix, it talks about the fact that the parties have a dispute under Section 271 of the Patent Act. In the red brief here, Mirowski has ­­ has told us on page 48 that, if Medtronic were to cease paying royalties, that the recourse would be that they would bring an infringement suit. And the complaint here in paragraph 5 alleges that the claim here arises under the Patent Act. And because it does arise under the Patent Act and because it's clear here that all of the defensive issues would also be Federal, as I mentioned before, I think there is no dispute here that this ­­ this would arise under the patent laws, which would provide for district court jurisdiction under Section 1338 and exclusive appellate jurisdiction in the Federal circuit under Section 1295(a), even before the amendments in the America Invents Act in 2011. I think that there is one other point that would be worth making in response to some of the amicus briefs about the ­­ the potential problems here associated with whether the parties have an incentive to enter into these type of licensing arrangements. As Mr. Waxman already explained, the patentholder here got lots of benefits out of ­­ out of entering into an agreement like this, notwithstanding the fact that they would leave themselves open to precisely the suits that the agreement contemplated, which was a suit involving both infringement and validity questions; and that, under the circumstances, there's ­­ they had plenty of incentive to enter into a license agreement, notwithstanding the fact that they would continue to bear the same burden of proof that they would bear in every other procedural context in which patent infringement claims have arisen up until now. And so I think that, in that sense, that's ­­ that's not a sea change from their perspective. And ­­ and, yet, even if they were to think it so, as Mr. Waxman explained, a licensor in that context would have several mechanisms that they could use in order to rejigger the balance between the parties if they wanted to. And ­­ and I think that we agree with ­­ with everything on the list that Mr. Waxman mentioned, including having fully paid­up licenses or allowing a suit for infringement or invalidity to constitute a termination of the license that would allow the patentholder to bring an infringement action. If there are no further questions, we would urge the Court to reverse."

The two stipulated facts were, number one, when Mirowski's counsel, me, wrote letters to Medtronic, that was not a notice of infringement. There could be no infringement in this case. Infringement is defined as \"using a patented invention without authority.\" Medtronic had authority. It was licensed. The second stipulated fact ­­ and this is at page 51 of the Joint Appendix ­­ is that Medtronic is a licensee. It cannot be an infringer. So everything that you say about infringement involves a completely different situation. There was no shifting of the burden of proof.

So as a matter of sheer rigidity, they could not not pay the royalty. They will lose their whole business. They wanted to get into Federal court.

The person suing, the DJ licensee, doesn't have to anticipate any argument. He said, you told me it was these claims. And we even had an agreement with him we couldn't go over 30. And all I got to do is say, in claim 1, we don't have element number 6. In Claim 2, we don't have element number 4. It's a very simple manner. There is no problem whatsoever there. So what the Federal Circuit did is, I've got a burden of proof issue. Let me find the controlling law. I’ll look to the Supreme Court.

So you have a simple case of only one party seeking relief; that party has the burden. And you would have that anyway even ­­ even without this agreement, because only one party can bring suit.
