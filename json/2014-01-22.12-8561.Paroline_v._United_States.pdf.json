Specifically, under 18 USC 2259, must a victim's ­­ victim's losses be proximally caused by a defendant's offense conduct before a sentencing judge can award restitution? The short answer to the question is all losses must be proximately caused. Eleven courts of appeals and the government agree that this circuit ignored the plain text of the statute and the enumerated enforcement provisions of 3664 to craft a restitution scheme where the possession of two images of child pornography resulted in the award of $3.4 million to Doyle Paroline which was strictly ­­ jointly and severally liable. In my time before the Court, I wish to address, first, why the Fifth Circuit decision is incorrect, and second, why the government's concept of aggregate causation conflicts with its statutory burden of proof contained in 3664(e)."

But the overriding goal of Congress, as it always is when they deal with criminal, intentional tortfeasors, is to pay more attention to the victims and less about some notion of distributing losses among criminally culpable defendants. Congress doesn't give you any indication in this statute that they were concerned that one particular defendant might pay more than his, quote, \"fair share,\" or whatever that means. And the fundamental problem with the government's position is that, after four­and­a­half years of litigation, we still don't have any indication as to how much Amy is going to receive in this particular case. What the government proposes to do is to cast district courts adrift, as they have been for the last four and a half years, to look at a variety of the factors, including, remarkably, if we read the government's brief correctly, one of the factors is the need to get the victim full ­­ full recovery."

And Congress acted against that understanding and said she recovers the full amount from the very first person, and if she gets her compensation, then she's out of the picture. And one of the beauties of our approach is that we estimate, within 2 to 3 years, if you affirm the Fifth Circuit, her restitution requests will be done. If you adopt the government's approach, you could be looking at literally thousands and thousands of cases where Amy will have to ­­ will have to be filing piecemeal restitution requests, collecting as little as $47 under some of the calculation theories that the government has proposed, and there's no certainty that she's ever going to get the psychological counseling costs that she desperately needs and the lost income. Now, certainly, Congress could have drafted the statute in different ways, but every single word or every single phrase of this statute at least indicates to you that Congress had one goal and one goal alone in mind, that is, that victims get the full amount of restitution that they desperately need. And we're not talking here about reworking an entire restitution scheme for the broad swath of Federal crime. We're talking about three crimes covered by the Violence Against Women Act, the child pornography cases, Federal sexual assault cases, and domestic violence cases. And it's hardly a surprise to discover, when you look at the Violence Against Women Act, that Congress created a particularly expansive restitution regime for the victims of these particular crimes.
