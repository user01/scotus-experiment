The State of Arizona was permitted to offer facts to circumstantially prove these mental and essential requisite elements of mens rea. Under the rule espoused by the Arizona Supreme Court in State versus Mott, as we have been calling it, \"the Mott rule,\" this evidence, as offered by the defense both in lay testimony and expert testimony, was arbitrarily categorically excluded as a rule of evidence that's unsupported by any valid State purpose.

However, Arizona did not do that, and Arizona did not argue that below. Below, Arizona argued, repeatedly, that Eric Clark knew this was a police officer, that Eric Clark intentionally shot a police officer. On appeal, they argued the same thing. In the appellate decision in this case, by the Court of Appeals of the State of Arizona, the State -- I raised a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in addressing that issue. And this is in the joint appendix at -- one -- if I could have one moment -- begins on page 330 of the joint appendix -- 336, and proceeds through the court's discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence, in paragraph 17. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable finder of fact could conclude -- and it states, \"reasonable inference thereupon that Clark knowingly and intentionally shot Moritz, and knew that he was a police officer when he did so.\" There's repeated references that the Arizona Court of Appeals did not understand that Arizona had somehow, by adoption of the Mott rule, decided to redefine the crime of first- degree murder, and -- as it -- we point in our opening brief, they could not constitutionally do so."

Thus, if he thinks the truckdriver is an alien, or he thinks he's an animal, and has a serious mental problem in knowing what's going on, that comes right in, as it did here, because it's relevant to whether he knew it was right or wrong to shoot this person. And, therefore, once I read that, I thought there is not, at least in this case, a question of whether the insanity defense is complete, because it is. Everything that you wanted to introduce was introduced. And, indeed, it was considered, properly, under the insanity defense.

But if the Arizona reference to the criminal act being wrong refers to the act in this case -- i.e., killing somebody you believe is a Martian -- then the evidence could come in.

And as the Arizona Court of Appeals noted, it would be -- it would be difficult to imagine a situation where someone would know his conduct was wrong, but not know the nature of his act. And I won't pretend that perhaps in some theoretical hypothetical scenario that might -- you know, that might occur. But it's very difficult, indeed, to imagine that. And the Arizona Legislature rationally could, you know -- could have, you know, decided that they will -- that they will reduce the definition to the heart of M'Naghten, which is right/wrong, because the -- you know, the issue of nature and quality will rarely, if ever, come up."

The second answer, Your Honor, is, as M'Naghten says, at page 723, what we look at when we're examining whether the defendant knew right from wrong, is his -- is the very conduct that he committed."

There's also -- you know, a third policy reason, that, because you -- in your -- because the -- you know, because the gross question of whether someone is insane or sane is a difficult enough question with psychiatric evidence, it raises -- it raises the question to a whole other level of complexity to ask the juries, \"Well, if we -- if you find that he is sane, but he has some degree of mental illness, just find -- you know, just how did that mental illness affect his ability to intend.\" And the State, as a matter of policy, you know, may properly say, \"That is -- you know, we're finding on the nature to determine whether someone's insane or not,\" but it's just too complex a question to ask the -- a jury or a judge, as in this case, to make fine gradations of ability and responsibility."

Neither aspect of that judgment violates the Federal Constitution. And I think, with respect to the substantive decision, there are two elements to it. First of all, Arizona wanted to streamline consideration of M'Naghten and focus on the heart of M'Naghten, which is the right/wrong test. But, equally important, as far back as 1965, in the Schantz case, where they first came up with the rule applied in Mott, they also wanted to not have a diminished-capacity defense in the State of Arizona."

It's all coming in. I'm going to take it into consideration, but I'm going to take it into consideration only on the insanity defense, not as part of the mens rea defense.\" And I think that was consistent with Arizona law.

And I think that goes back to the common law, and goes back to Blackstone. And if you look at Blackstone, and you look at some of the common law cases that this Court cited in its Davis opinion, they describe murder as having several elements. One of them is obviously killing a person, and one is malice aforethought. And then, some of the cases treat a sound mind as a separate element. But, I think, if you look at the history, it's clear it wasn't a true element, because the common law put the -- it started with a presumption of sanity, which you couldn't have with respect to any other element, and said it was perfectly appropriate to put the burden on the defendant. And I think what the common law recognizes is the question of criminal responsibility or insanity, although it has some logical relationship to mens rea, can be separated out and can be dealt with in an affirmative defense. And I think if you don't recognize the State's ability to do that, you end up allowing a defendant to basically sneak in, through, as Justice Souter put it, the front door, all sorts of watered-down insanity defenses in the guise of arguments trying to negate mens rea."

I can argue that, \"I lack the capacity to form the requisite intent, because I responded to an irresistible impulse.\" Well, a State that's decided to have the M'Naghten insanity defense, rather than the irresistible-impulse defense, has to be able to make the judgment, I submit, that, \"We're going to have the M'Naghten defense, and we're going to keep it as an affirmative defense, and we're not going to allow that defense, that we've rejected, to effectively come in through the front door.\" And, to use Justice Souter's --"

I mean -- and that might be -- come up with irresistible impulse, because the person is totally insane, not like any other human being.
