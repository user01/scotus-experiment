  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1996 the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, or AEDPA, was enacted, which imposed a 1­ year limitation period upon the filing of Federal habeas petitions following the finality of a State criminal conviction. In Duncan v. Walker, this Court held that the 1­ year limitation period may be tolled during the pendency of a properly filed State post-conviction or other collateral application, but not during the pendency of a Federal habeas application. Despite that holding, the Ninth Circuit in this case concluded that the district court's dismissal of admittedly mixed Federal habeas petitions was improper and prejudicial because the district court did not provide certain advisements designed to effectuate the Ninth Circuit's practice of stay and abeyance."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is there some peculiar virtue about the word advisements as opposed to advice?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "No, not in this particular situation, Your Honor. We believe stay and abeyance is incompatible with this Court's precedent, as well as AEDPA, for four reasons."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Before we get to that, do you agree that some kind of remedy is required here, warnings or no warnings, as a result of the fact that what the judge did tell the -- the defendant in this case seems to have been just affirmatively misleading. He said you -- dismiss and then you can come back when it was perfectly clear, that -- that he could never come back that the time in -- in all practical terms would have run. Haven't we got to do something or hasn't the courts got to do something to correct that?"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, is that issue still open? I mean, even if you're correct on your premise that a court doesn't have to inform a defendant of the statute of limitations, is -- is the issue of possible misleading of the defendant open on the remand even if you were successful?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "No, we don't believe it would be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, shouldn't it be? I mean, if -­ if we think that the record shows there is some evidence of misleading where the defendant expressed concern about a statute of  limitations problem and was told it wouldn't present a problem, when in fact it did --it had already run -- you don't think that should be open on remand?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "If that were the case, perhaps that would be the situation or perhaps that would be the remedy. That wasn't the case here. The district court told Ford that he could refile his petitions following exhaustion and dismissed the mixed petitions without prejudice."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it wasn't without prejudice. For all intents and purposes, he could never come back because the statute of limitations, as I understand the facts, had already run before the case was even dismissed in the district court. So he could never come back. Therefore, without prejudice was surely misleading."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "No. Dismissal without prejudice merely means that the petitioner can refile. It will be a separate issue as to whether the claims of the petition that he refiles will be considered on its merits."

  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "Well, that -- that has always been the procedure when courts have addressed mixed petitions. They have always dismissed them without prejudice."

    "speech": "And they have always made a statement that was affirmatively misleading?"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "We need to -- let me put it this way. Wouldn't any defendant in his right mind, if he had known that he could not come back into court, that the statute had run, at least have said, well, judge, get rid of the unexhausted claims so that I can at least litigate the ones which I have filed in time and which are exhausted? Wouldn't that have been the only sensible thing for him to do if -- if he had understood what you understand?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "Not necessarily. A Federal habeas petitioner may believe, in fact, that his exhausted claims are unmeritorious or frivolous compared with the claims that he wishes to exhaust in State court. So there may be circumstances where a Federal habeas petitioner will not, in fact, object to the dismissal of even his exhausted claims or to the -- the dismissal of an entire petition."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "May I ask you about the unexhausted claims that have to go first to the State court? When Rose v. Lundy was decided, this problem of time didn't exist because there was no statute of limitations on Federal habeas. Now that there is this bind, why isn't it appropriate to say the stay and abeyance applies not simply to the Federal claim but to the entire complaint, which is -- is the ordinary rule when there's a -- a prior action pending or abstention? Usually the --the whole complaint just sits in Federal court till the State court is through. Why shouldn't this, now with the statute of limitations, the 12 months, in the picture, be the same way?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "I think there are two responses to that. The first is that Congress would not have contemplated that procedure because Congress, in incorporating section 2254(b)(1) in virtually unaltered form, would have contemplated Rose v. Lundy's application in the way it had always been applied by this Court. The second response is that a stay of the proceeding under those circumstances would make sense only if the claims that are being dismissed as unexhausted can be added back and would, in fact, be -­"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So not added back. I mean, this is the Third Circuit's solution, and I'm asking you why isn't that the simplest way to deal with this. Nothing is added back. Everything, the entire complaint sits in Federal court while the petitioner goes over to State court to exhaust the State claims and then comes back to the Federal court with nothing to supplement. The complaint is already there."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "That procedure guts Rose v. Lundy and AEDPA. Rose v. Lundy would have absolutely no meaning under that procedure because Rose v. Lundy never contemplated that procedure. It contemplated the complete dismissal of a mixed petition or, at most, the dismissal of unexhausted claims from a mixed petition."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But coming -- with the ability to come back, which was not a problem then because there was no statute of limitations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "Well, even prior to the enactment of AEDPA, refiled petitions would not necessarily be considered on their merits. Claims could be procedurally defaulted, for instance, and if the default was based upon an adequate and independent State ground, the claims would not be considered on their merits, but would be summarily denied. So even prior to the enactment of AEDPA, this Court contemplated that refiled petitions would not necessarily be considered on their merits. But --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I mean, just to elaborate on Justice Ginsburg's question, what is your answer to her point? Why -- imagine the imaginary author of Rose v. Lundy. When I read this, I think they're worried about exhausting the State claim so the State will have a chance to pass on it. All right. Now, what Justice Ginsburg just said gives the State the chance to pass on it. What is it in Rose v. Lundy that cares whether the way you give the State to pass on it is to dismiss the whole thing and let them pass on it or hold it on the docket and let them pass on it or call them into your office, any other thing you can think of? I mean, what is it in Rose v. Lundy that cares how you give the State the opportunity to pass on it as long as they pass on it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "Because Rose v. Lundy contemplates the unexhausted claims will be presented in State court first, and it enforces or promotes that through what this Court has referred to in Rose v. Lundy as a rigorously enforced total exhaustion requirement. Now, if the petitioner can simply file a mixed petition in Federal court without any consequences either under Rose v. Lundy or under AEDPA, what we will have is a situation where petitioners have an incentive to file mixed petitions in Federal court instead of presenting their unexhausted claims in State court first. Contrary to this Court's holding in Duncan v. Walker that AEDPA is not indifferent between State and Federal filings, but promotes and encourages the filing of unexhausted claims in State court first -­ could have said what is now being proposed if it had wanted to. I mean, Rose v. Lundy could have said -­ instead of you have to dismiss the whole thing, they could have simply said, you know, hold it in abeyance."

    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",

    "speech": "Six of the seven circuits allow it I know, but I don't see how we -- we get into it here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "Because the Ninth Circuit majority concluded that the failure to advise in the manner in which they thought was appropriate was improper and prejudicial because they assumed that had the advisement been given with regard to the dismissal of unexhausted claims as a precondition to the consideration of a motion to stay, that Ford would have dismissed his unexhausted claims. And in doing so, the district court would have been required to grant the motion to stay. In fact, the majority concludes it would have been abuse of discretion not to do so. So it's inextricably bound in the advisement requirement in this case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But we could rule, I suppose, that the advice was unnecessary when leaving open the question of whether the stay and abey proceeding is permissible or desirable, whatever."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "Yes. The Ninth Circuit, after concluding that the advisements that were given in this case were inadequate and misleading, fashioned a remedy for that particular error which it believed occurred by way of applying rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in a manner that no other circuit court has ever applied before. In fact, three prior panels of the Ninth Circuit itself concluded that relation back would not apply under these circumstances because there's nothing to which the subsequent proceeding can relate back."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But the Ninth Circuit did that only because their own precedents said all you can stay is the Federal claim. You can't stay the entire petition. That was the preliminary to doing this fancy 15(c) application."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "Yes, but in doing so, what the Ninth Circuit majority did was have a subsequent proceeding relate back to a prior proceeding that had been dismissed and was no longer pending."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If the Ninth Circuit decided or if we decided that equitable tolling is permissible in this case, what -- what procedure should be adopted to reflect that rule? I know that's maybe not -- not your position, but if that -- if that were the holding, how -- how would that work? And --and how is that any different than relation back?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "Well, it's -- it's difficult to say because equitable tolling has been applied differently in different situations. The Ninth Circuit itself applies it in a very different fashion than it was applied in this case. I suppose equitable tolling could be applied to toll the limitation period during the pendency of the first set of proceedings, the 1997 proceedings, up to the dismissed as unexhausted. That would leave Ford with 5 days to file his unexhausted claims in State court, exhaust, and -- and then return with those claims to Federal court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let --let me ask you this somewhat related question. You look at the records that the -­ that's presented --the petitions that are presented to the district courts through their magistrates, and they're bewildering. The petitioner really restates a claim in three or four different ways to make sure he's left nothing out. And the -- the district courts are --are very busy. Suppose you have a sort of Johnny-on-the-spot, prompt attorney at --at the habeas level in a Federal court and he files on day one. He has got a year but he files on day one. The district court just doesn't get around to it until, say, the 10th month, and then it says, oh, well, this has -- this has some unexhausted claim. Any relief for the -- or even on day 360. Any relief available there for the petitioner?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "It certainly wouldn't appear to be the case under AEDPA because AEDPA doesn't toll the limitation period during pendency of the Federal habeas proceeding, and that's very clear, we believe, from the statute itself. So an individual filing a petition in Federal court is well advised, of course, to ensure that all the claims are fully exhausted. The Eighth Circuit in Akins v. Kenney suggested that where a petitioner is concerned that any of his claims may be unexhausted, he's well advised under AEDPA to present those claims in State court first and accomplish two goals simultaneously. First, he exhausts beyond any doubt, and second, he tolls the limitation period during the pendency of that proceeding. district judge number one rules in a week. District judge number two waits 300 days. The petitioner is in the same position in either case in your view."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "Yes, because I think the petitioner has to contemplate the vagaries of any kind of judicial interpretation or ruling on his matters, and that may depend upon the particular court. It may depend upon the caseload. It may depend upon the particular matter that's put before the court, the number of claims, the complexity, and so on. That's always going to vary in any case. A petitioner who files a one-claim petition will most assuredly receive a quicker resolution of that than the petitioner who files a 200-page petition containing hundreds of claims. That's just in the nature of any kind of adjudication in any kind of court. And that has to be contemplated and anticipated by any would-be Federal habeas petitioner because if that petitioner files a mixed petition under AEDPA, the clock keeps ticking during the pendency of that Federal habeas proceeding no matter how long or how short. So, again, he's well advised, as the Eighth Circuit noted, to file any claims that he's unsure about in State court first. And that's what AEDPA contemplates, as this Court concluded in Duncan v. Walker. To allow petitioners to file mixed petitions in Federal court without any consequences and -- and to do so in the manner in which the Ninth Circuit contemplates it here and in other cases would eviscerate AEDPA's limitation period because, as we point out in our briefing, a petitioner could well file a mixed petition containing only one exhausted claim, confident that all of his unexhausted claims will be purged from the petition, the remaining exhausted claims stayed, and those purged claims, following exhaustion, will be added back to the State petition, no matter that they were pursued in State court after the expiration of the limitation period, and they will be deemed timely by the Ninth Circuit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, of course, that --that would -- that may well be the Ninth Circuit rule, but you could also have a stay and abey rule in which in order to --to grant the petitioner time to go back and -- and litigate the State claims, he has to make a -- a showing first that there is some reason to excuse his delay, in other words, threshold. And -- and if -- if that were the requirement, then the -- the scenario that you just --just outlined would -- would not be an objection."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "Well, I think the problem with that approach, first of all, with regard to the application of equitable tolling to AEDPA, is that AEDPA itself doesn't contemplate the application of such tolling. that there cannot be equitable tolling under AEDPA?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "It certainly seems foreclosed by this Court's holdings in United States v. Beggerly, United States v. Brockamp, and Lampf v. Gilbertson. In all of those cases, this Court concluded, in reviewing Federal limitation periods, that because the statutes contain tolling provisions within them, it would be inconsistent, incompatible with those statutes to apply equitable tolling. Congress had spoken as to the circumstances under which tolling could be applied. In Beggerly, in particular, this Court concluded that under the Federal Quiet Title Act, equitable tolling would be inapplicable because there was already an accrual or tolling provision built in that provided that the limitation period did not begin to run until the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of the claim of the United States. AEDPA contains a very similar provision in section 2244(d)(1), subsection (D), which provides that the limitation period does not begin to run until the petitioner was aware of the factual predicate of the claim or claims through the exercise of due diligence. In Brockamp, this Court commented upon the tolling provisions in the IRS tax refund statute and noted that because they were numerous and very specific, equitable tolling likewise would be incompatible with the statute. AEDPA also contains very specific tolling provisions, beyond the one that I just described, tolling where there is a properly filed State post-conviction or other collateral application, tolling where, for instance, unconstitutional State action leads to an impediment to filing, tolling where this Court issues a ruling on an issue of Federal constitutional law that's made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Leaving aside tolling, you said something I didn't quite grasp; that is, if you allowed the Federal petition to sit while you went to State court, all this is well within the 12-month period. You're in State court, you exhaust everything there. The statute is tolled during that time. Then you come back to Federal court and you -- as long as you're still within the 12 months, you're okay. It doesn't gut the statute of limitations. It just recognizes that it's tolled while you're in State court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "I'm sorry. I misunderstood your hypothetical, Your Honor. If claims are presented in State court, prior to the expiration of the limitation period, yes, they will toll the limitation period. The problem with stay and abeyance under that situation, however, is that it actually gives the petitioner greater benefits under AEDPA than he received prior to the enactment of AEDPA. Prior to the enactment of AEDPA, mixed petitions in -- in certain circuits would actually, instead of being dismissed, have their unexhausted claims purged, and the petitioner would go back to State court and exhaust those claims. But the purged petition, the purged Federal habeas petition, would go forward and be resolved expeditiously. It would not be stayed. And that I think was the basis of the plurality's warning in Rose v. Lundy that where a petitioner chooses that course of action, he will be barred from having his refiled claims considered on the merits because they will consist of a second or successive application. They will consist of a second or successive application only if the purged Federal habeas petition goes forward. If it's stayed, there will never be a second or successive application relating to those claims. And that would, I think, vitiate not only rule 9(b) of the rules governing -­"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Are you now questioning the propriety of -- let's just stick with the Rose v. Lundy the way it was. You have the Federal claim and the State claims. You lop off the State claims. Are you saying the Federal court can't say, well, I'm going to let this Federal claim sit until the State is through? Why should I adjudicate it? Maybe he'll prevail on some claim in the State court."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That it would or wouldn't? McCleskey v. Zant, when this Court talked about second or successive applications and abuse of the writ, it contemplated or presumed that that procedure if followed under Rose v. Lundy would lead to those refiled claims constituting second or successive applications."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So are you saying that the Federal court would have no choice under the -- we'll keep the Federal claim in Federal court, no choice but to go full steam ahead on that claim?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "I think so because to do otherwise would be inconsistent with Rose v. Lundy, rule 9(b), but it would also be inconsistent with AEDPA because AEDPA contains a provision in section 2244(b)(1) of title 28 of the United States Code that requires claims that are dismissed from an initial petition and submitted as a second or successive application to be dismissed. If we're always going to stay mixed petitions, pending the exhaustion of even timely presented unexhausted claims, it certainly leads one to wonder what the purpose of section 2244(b)(1) would be. That also appears to contemplate what the plurality suggested in Rose v. Lundy, which is that the purged Federal habeas petition goes full speed ahead, to use your words, and that it's not, in fact, stayed. To stay the Federal habeas petition under those circumstances would also result in delay, which is something that is inimical to AEDPA. As a number of lower courts have pointed out, one of the primary purposes of AEDPA is to tighten the Federal habeas process."

    "speech": "Yes, you are, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When this Court adopted the total exhaustion rule in Rose, there was no statute of limitations for the filing of Federal habeas petitions, and a prisoner seeking to file a second Federal petition, after fully exhausting State remedies, faced no time bar. But AEDPA added to the mix a 1-year statute of limitations, which in many cases, such as Mr. Ford's, converts the choices under Rose into a complete bar on Federal habeas corpus review."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, isn't it reasonable to --at Congress legislates in the light of existing law or existing rules from this Court, that that's exactly what Congress intended?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BASSIS",
    "speech": "No, I disagree, Your Honor. What Rose said is that a prisoner be afforded a choice, and that choice involves either proceeding on exhausted claims and deleting the unexhausted or dismissing the petition without prejudice to a right to return. No one ever suggested in Rose that the petitioner would lose the right to have even his exhausted claims heard on the merits. In order to avoid the exhaustion requirement from becoming what would, in effect, be a trap for the unwary pro se prisoner requires nothing more than adding a sentence to what Rose already requires, a sentence made critical by AEDPA, which was nonexistent at the time of Rose. There is no need for warning, however, if the court issues a stay. The lower courts almost unanimously do so and endorse State procedures where the failure to do so would result in a forfeiture of the right to Federal habeas review."

It makes it incumbent upon the prisoner litigant to withdraw his unexhausted claims and then renew a motion to stay. So the motion to stay is at the defendant's or the petitioner's election. But without being apprised of that peculiar procedure, Mr. Ford was not informed as to his choice of options with regard to amendment. The only choices he was given were the two choices under Rose: delete the  unexhausted claims and proceed on the exhausted or dismissal of the entire petition without prejudice, an option which was illusory at the time it was given to him because of the running of the limitations period. 57 percent of the habeas petitions filed are dismissed for want of exhaustion. potential equitable tolling arguments open to him other than based on the so-called misleading advice?"

He certainly didn't know about the availability of filing a contemporaneous writ petition in State court in order to toll the limitations period. Had he done so, most assuredly he would not have pursued the option of motions to stay, which he filed contemporaneously with his writ. I doubt that he also knew about equitable tolling, statutory tolling, or really the statute of limitations  and how that was calculated. All he knew is that there was 1 year, and he filed in time. But he also did so by simultaneously filing a motion to stay. However, without -- or without knowledge at the time the court made a judicial disposition of Mr. Ford's petitions, that he could elect a stay procedure, the court --he --he merely went with the option of dismissal without prejudice. That decision was not informed absent further information about the availability of the stay."

It requires no additional burden for the district court to give this kind of admonition or this kind of warning.

  {
    "speaker": "ROADARMEL",
    "speech": "With the Court's permission, I'd like to make four brief points. The proof is in the pudding regarding stay and abeyance and what we're experiencing in California. We're experiencing greater delays since the enactment of AEDPA than we ever experienced before because of stay and abeyance and relation back, particularly in capital Federal habeas cases. We make mention in footnote 1 of our reply brief of a capital Federal habeas case pending in the Central District Court of California called Reno v. Woodford. In that case, the district court issued a stay of the purged petition on May 7th, 1999 for the ostensible purpose of allowing the petitioner to exhaust his State court remedies. To date, no State court exhaustion petition has been filed. None is on the horizon. But under stay and abeyance and relation back, whenever one is filed and the claims are exhausted and added back into the State petition, those claims will be deemed timely by the district court, notwithstanding the fact that at this point in time, at best, they will be presented for exhaustion in State court more than 5 years after the expiration of AEDPA's limitation period. The second point is that Ford in this case knew that the 1997 petitions he filed contained unexhausted claims. He admitted as much to the district court in connection with our motion to dismiss those petitions. That's found at pages 56 to 57 and 75 to 78 of the joint appendix. Ford purposely filed mixed petitions. He knew of the limitation period as well because he indicated in filings to the district court that he was in a hurry to get his 1997 petitions in in time so that he would have them before the court prior to the expiration of the limitation period. What stay and abeyance does is reward petitioners like Ford who file admittedly mixed petitions knowing full well the identity of the unexhausted claims that they're asserting. If they're aware of those unexhausted claims, there's no reason why those petitioners should not have and could not have presented those claims in State court first, and they would have received a proper benefit under AEDPA by doing so. They would have exhausted the claims so the Federal court could consider them on the merits conceivably if there wasn't some kind of default that was applicable, and they would also toll the limitation period during the pendency of that State proceeding. Ford was under the misapprehension that his Federal filing tolled the limitation period in much the same way that the petitioner in Duncan was under the misapprehension that his first mixed petition tolled the limitation period in that case as well. We know from Duncan v. Walker that it does not. Finally, advice regarding AEDPA's limitation period, to be meaningful at all, to be more than just a meaningless gesture, has to rely on specific documents and has to provide specific information that a district court is simply in no position to provide at the time a mixed petition is dismissed. The only documents a district court typically has before it at that time are documents relating to filings by the petitioner in the State supreme court. The allegations contained in those documents are then compared against the allegations in the Federal habeas proceeding for the purpose of determining whether the claims are exhausted. The court does not have before it the entire record of proceedings. And even if it did, there are certain circumstances that would warrant tolling that would not be contained in those documents and the court would not be able to make any kind of a reasoned decision or give any kind of reason or correct advice regarding the impact of the limitation period on any unexhausted claims. Stay and abeyance we believe vitiates AEDPA by rendering largely irrelevant the limitation period, rendering the State court tolling provision near surplusage, and in effect, encouraging petitioners to file mixed petitions in Federal court instead of presenting their unexhausted claims in State court first. Thank you."
