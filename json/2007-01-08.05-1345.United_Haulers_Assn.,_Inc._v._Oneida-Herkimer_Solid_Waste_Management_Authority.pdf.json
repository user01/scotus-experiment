As in Carbone, no local waste can leave the counties for processing. In addition, now that Respondent's landfill is up and running no local waste can leave the counties for disposal either. The issue here is whether Carbone is inapplicable to this outright embargo merely because Respondent's own the facilities to which the haulers are required to bring the waste. The answer is no, and the reason is that the concerns underlying the Commerce Clause are implicated whether interstate commerce was being obstructed for the benefit of a public enterprise or a private one. The whole point of the Commerce Clause was to promote the national economy and to put an end to parochial barriers to interstate trade. This Court has consistently held that embargoes, local processing requirements, and other barriers to interstate commerce violate the Commerce Clause because such laws inevitably prompt resentment, retaliation, and ultimately - -"

And I guess that's been going on for about 110 years. And yet I've never seen anybody think or write or anything that that violated the Commerce Clause. But of course, there could be somebody in another State who'd like to sell electricity to the people in our town. They can't do it because the town says, we own the company and you got to buy from us.

And that was common and it was called a service area, and in the local town, the service area, I never even heard of a company trying to come in and sell from abroad, because I thought that this certificate gave them an exclusive right to provide the local electricity service or the natural gas service. I mean, it's a fairly obvious thing. And I might be wrong and I mention that my memory -- I've never focused directly on it.

Now, the people you're representing, out of state people who would provide dumping grounds for this waste, they would charge 9 dollars a ton or whatever they would charge.

The Court has rejected that very - that very standard in Garcia and the Tenth Amendment cases, and prior to that in the intergovernmental tax immunity cases, and the reason it did so is it found that it was unworkable to try to determine what is a traditional government function in any particular case. The Court found that it was in a total line-drawing morass. And so it said we're throwing that out."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
      "speech": "Well, there is still at least the obvious distinction, that one of the main purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause is to prevent protectionism. Protectionism is when a state favors its own producers. And you could see, indeed a big argument in Carbone was, you aren't favoring your own producer; well, we are at least favoring one. But now where the municipality is running it itself, no one is favored. So I don't think it was an object of the Commerce Clause to prevent a State from favoring its own government."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAGER",
      "speech": "No. First of all, what was being protected was this plan. The town had to fund its transfer station, a transfer station that it was going to take possession of less than two years after this Court decided the case. So the protectionism that was going on there was really protection of their investment in their scheme."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
      "speech": "But it was also protectionism -- I mean, I didn't agree with this at the time, but I mean there, it -- you have to admit that there was protectionism of the one licensee, the person who constructed the plant and was going to sell it to the town for a dollar. That, so far as we know, that person or that company was in it for the money. And so for the period of the five years prior to the transfer to the town for the dollar, that particular entity was being protected so it could make money, and therefore, make it worthwhile for that company to sell its, its real estate to the town for a dollar. Surely that entity was being protected handsomely."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Well, so, you say formalistic as if it's a bad thing. But the, the distinction, say in the First Amendment, if the private contractor the day before the municipality bought the facility for a dollar had fired an employee because of his or her political views, you wouldn't argue that that is state action just because the next day it was going to be controlled by the public entity. And yet the next day, that type of action would be subject to First Amendment scrutiny. It may be a formalistic distinction but in many areas of the law it makes all the difference."

Once you go down this road, I think it is just opening up a huge can of worms when the focus ought to be what is the impact on interstate commerce? What we have here now that the landfill is up and running is an absolute embargo. No waste generated in this town, in these counties, excuse me, can leave the State, period, end of story. It is no different, in effect, it is no less likely to breed resentment and retaliation than - -"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "It is kind of formalistic on the other side because you, I thought you agreed that if the municipality did it through tax revenues and there was no formal flow restriction and yet it only made sense to dump your waste at the free facility, you seem to suggest that would be okay."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAGER",
      "speech": "Well, I'm glad you reminded me of that point. I meant to make it earlier. In West Lynn Creamery this Court said that these kind of things make a difference. There are certain ways you do things and certain ways you can't do things. If you place an embargo, that's traditionally been regarded as subject to strict scrutiny. If you try to do the same thing by making it free and providing public -- public -- public collection, that's okay. And -- and what the Court cases say is do it the right way and we'll worry about the consequences later."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
      "speech": "Here, I take it the reason they want to do this is because they wanted their municipal facility to charge a higher price for the non-recyclable rubbish and that will encourage people to segregate the rubbish and thereby have more cyclable - - recyclable rubbish, and therefore overall pay less. And that's why they want to do it, and of course that's not going to work. If somebody comes in from out of State and charges a lower price for all of the non-recyclable rubbish or you know, for all rubbish, it just won't work. It is rather like electricity, interestingly enough, where municipalities would do the same thing. They want discriminatory rates in order to push out the possibility of poorer people getting electricity. This they want to do the same thing but they want to do it for rubbish, for, to encourage recycling."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAGER",
      "speech": "Several answers to that, Justice Breyer. One, the same argument was made in Carbone. It doesn't matter who owns the facility. Two, this is an argument about why they might survive strict scrutiny, it's not a -- I know you don't like hearing about that -- but the question here is do we apply strict scrutiny or not. And that goes to the strength of their interest. And then of course the question turns on, can it be met in nondiscriminatory ways? The answer is \"very well.\" Since Carbone was decided, the municipalities have been living with no flow control, virtually every one in the country, yet recycling has gone up in the, in that intervening period. Indeed the best way to accomplish recycling is to charge volume-based fees to, to the -- between the haulers and the, and the generators. That's not what is going on here. They're just charging it at the disposal point. So there are plenty of communities all -- excuse me -- plenty of communities all over the country that are charging what's known as a batch fee where you pay for each -- you pay -- you get a label, like you put on a bag; you can't dispose of the bag without the label, the label costs a certain amount of money. None of these people have flow -- none of these communities have flow control but there's a direct straightforward way. They can also impose regulations directly on the generators and directly on the haulers to make sure they're doing these things. So it is hardly a reason for creating a brand-new public-private distinction."

Going back to the trash argument, the trash example, you could provide it for free; but a consumer might say, you know what, I'd like to have more days of pickup than you're providing me. Or I think their trucks of this private company are a lot nicer; I'd rather have a van stopping in front of my house than your beaten up municipal truck.

We do things -- we have three different, three basic differences between what we do and what the private sector would do. The first one is to step in and take some of the risk for proper disposal. When the haulers make the decision about where the garbage goes, there's a liability that attaches to the waste. If it goes to the wrong place it's going to follow, follow back both to the hauler and to the person who generated it. We have had some bad experiences with people making bad decisions about where waste goes in the 1980s and the public asked us to set something up so that they could trust who was making the disposal decisions.

Whether -- where a private entity might decide to go out of business tomorrow, government is going to be there to continue to do what we set out to do. But this leads me also to my third point, which is that we're attempting to implement a comprehensive solid waste plan. With the passage of Federal legislation on these environmental matters touching on waste in the 1970s, with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and With the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Liability Act, there was a new message sent to the country, which to generators meant, you better think about what you're doing with this stuff. You better make a -- you better watch where it goes and you better be careful because liability could attach to you. And RCRA told government, States and localities, it was their responsibility to come up with plans to find new ways to manage solid wastes. That's what we've done. Any time a government comes together to put a plan together to dispose of solid wastes, whether like ours it uses several different technologies to try to address different parts of the waste stream, you have to have the cooperation of the people who collect the waste. If the people who collect the waste could drive its away to anywhere they please, the plan is no plan; the plan is just a suggestion. The haulers --"

What they are suggesting is that there is discrimination sufficient to trigger near fatal scrutiny every time the government takes over, to the exclusion of all private actors both in state and out of state, a government service, that that is sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny. That is completely inconsistent with the way that this Court has defined what constitutes discrimination for purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause. The Court has said, and it has stressed repeatedly in its precedent, that discrimination is the differential treatment of in state and out of State economic interests, not government interests, in a way that benefits the former and burdens the latter. That's from Oregon Waste System."

But that's not what you have here. What both the district court and the circuit court in fact found here is that the primary burden of these local ordnances in fact is on local residents.

For the dormant Commerce Clause to reach that far would be unprecedented.

      "speaker": "HALLIGAN",

First of all, I think this Court has answered that question with respect to waste management more than a hundred years ago in the California Reduction case. It was clearly held there the provision of waste management services is an essential function that governments appropriately provide. So that's been answered here. With respect to this question about hamburgers and other services that look commercial, I think there are two checks on those kinds of ordinances. First of all, I think it is very likely that in most circumstances if you were to say that hamburgers will be sold at a government operated facility, that that would disadvantage local interests significantly, and there would be a political process check. Secondly the Court has been clear that it is not bound by formalistic distinctions in the Commerce Clause arena and so it will look for discrimination that is protectionist in nature whether it is, as the Court has said, forthright or ingenious. So if case were to present itself, and the facts in the facts in this case no whiff of that protectionism, where you were to believe that the motive of a government entity was, in fact, to favor some local private interest, then strict scrutiny might be appropriate."

      "speaker": "HALLIGAN",
      "speech": "No, I think this Court has held the purpose alone cannot cure an inappropriate means that is used. But what we are arguing is that here you have both a very legitimate purpose, as my co-counsel outlined for you; you also have appropriate means. It is not inappropriate under the dormant Commerce Clause for the government to step in and take over provision of a service. Petitioners themselves agree that, in fact, the government could take over waste management services from soup to nuts. They suggest that there is some difference of a constitutional magnitude because some aspect of that is contracted out to the private market, and would argue that actually turns the dominant Commerce Clause on its head. One final point, if I could make. Several of you asked about whether or not there are other mechanisms that the localities could use to further these goals, goals which are set forth in both Federal and State laws. First of all, under the Pike test, there is no least restrictive alternative test. So it is not required that the localities demonstrate that there is no other option that might meet these goals. The Second Circuit concluded and rightly so I think on page 20a of the appendix to the petition that there was no other option that presented itself in the record that the counties could address, or could use to address their liability concerns and to encourage recycling across a very wide range of products."

      "speaker": "TAGER",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The first point I'd like to make is I'd like to ask the Court to review Reeves versus Stake which is a market participant case. But what is significant there -- that's the cement plant case -- there's two significant things about that case which I think are of interest. First, the Court's footnote 1 is an interesting historical footnote about how South Dakota had elected to make a lot of these different industries state-run industries, so the hypotheticals we've been discussing are not completely off the wall. If you can do it for waste you can do it for, in that case coal. They wanted to do it for stockyards but I think the legislature rejected the government's proposal. So the hypos are right on point. Secondly, the Court made a point there in rejecting the argument, the constitutional argument that the state was not prohibiting competing cement companies. And I think the inference from that is that it had, there would have been a Commerce Clause problem. Second, Mr. Cahill's user -- user fee point. I just want to remind the Court that in addition to paying for the recycling and everything, they were using the user fee to pay off the bond for their failed energy recovery facility. So, if you start focusing on what you use it for, it is a very slippery slope. On his point about protecting the generator from liability, we've addressed that at great lengths in our briefs. But one other point I want to make is he's wrong about their ability to determine whether other facilities that the haulers want to use are safe for environmental purposes. That's exactly what the city of New York does. Because it doesn't have its own disposal facility, its got very stringent requirements for where the waste can be taken. Fourth, Justice Souter, I believe you were raising an inquiry about the political process and whether that's adequate to protect the out of State interests. And I'd like to refer you to the West Lynn Creamery decision where the Court said the people whose oxen are being gored by a tariff are the local residents as well, but a tariff is the prototypical Commerce Clause violation. The political process is simply not a good answer to our argument. In terms of your other question about - -"

On Ms. Halligan's point about California Reduction, I just would like to remind the Court that that was a case of flow control to a private company. So Carbone, to the extent that case was concerned at all with the Commerce Clause, and it didn't say that it was, it was a taking case, I think, it has been overruled to the extent it had any Commerce Clause implications. Finally, I would like end with the point that Carbone has been the law for 13 years -- may I finish? If the Respondents have a problem with Carbone, Congress can fix it. That's one of the unique things about the Commerce Clause that is different from other constitutional provisions."
