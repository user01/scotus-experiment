That mandate, which applies only to the VA and reflects the agency's unique obligation to veterans, contains no exception for the contracts formed when the VA makes awards under the Federal Supply Schedule. And the government's attempt to create such an exception fares no better than its prior attempts to resist the mandate.

And it did that for two reasons: Number one, as opposed to the self­certification procedures of the Small Business Act, which are more open to abuse, it wanted to prescreen and make sure these are the real deal here in the database. And that also ensures that the VA has this information at its fingertips. Currently, there are about 7,000 people listed in that database.

And ­­ and so there's ­­ for the heartland of ­­ of small­business contracting, the ­­ are going to fall into the simplified acquisition procedures under part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. That's for services under $150,000. And for procurement of goods, it's now up to $7 million. And under that system, you have a greatly streamlined process for the smallest contracts, micro purchases. It's ­­ it's really just you make the decision for the sort of lower tier of contracts, certainly for anything under $25,000, all the ­­ all the government's doing is placing a purchase order under the simplified acquisition procedures. There is a standard form. It's Form 1449. It's a single sheet of paper. And that's the purchase order that they place. And quite frankly, the form looks almost identical to FSS Form 347 for how you place the order. So for the lower­level stuff, there is already a procedure outside the FSS that's incredibly streamlined. And as you begin to get to larger dollar­valued contracts, the requirements of going within the FSS begin to ramp up in terms of having to seek price reductions. And also, if you think of how the FSS operates in terms of services, you might be listed on there for the GSA as someone who can provide information technology, customized computer programming. But to go to Justice Kagan's question about how do you know can you actually do this work? That same process plays out under the FSS. For the services, yes, someone's listed as a custom computer programmer. But the agency still has to issue a statement of work saying this is what we actually need done. Here are our requirements. It puts that out there with their request for quotations that come in from the various FSS suppliers. Now, they will be constrained by, you know, the prices that they listed before on the FSS, but it still is an interactive process. It's not just firing up the computer and ­­ and clicking ­­"

And at the end of the day here, we're looking at a mandate that was plain on its face in terms of Congress saying shall award contracts, contracts being an expansive, all­inclusive term here.

And if, in retrospect, it seems like there might be some mismatch between the mandate and the goals, you have to remember that at this time they were so far from meeting even the more modest goals that Congress was thinking of this in mandatory terms: We have to do everything we can here to ramp up this obligation, because the old approaches, the discretionary approaches aren't working. And the idea that in doing that they would, without saying anything to that effect in the statute, leave an enormous loophole that lets the agency take up to 60 percent of its procurements off the top and just send them straight to the FSS doesn't jive, especially when you remember that at the time that the agency was missing its goals, those contracting goals counted not just open market contracts, but FSS orders were being counted.

And the ­­ the standard way of doing it, it's ­­ it's ­­ you know, it's not like Amazon.com, but you can go on to a website, drill down, see all the vendors who ­­ who are already prequalified to provide that kind of service. And the standard way that you would do this is that you would request ­­ request quotes from at least three of them, and then consider them when they come in. And when you request ­­ request the quote from them, even if you request it from three or four of them, every vendor on the schedule who is preapproved will ­­ will see that it's open and can submit an offer, and then ­­ and then the ­­ the agency would consider all the offers that were given to it, and it picks the one that offers the best value.

And so the pricing is ­­ the idea of the ­­ of the FSS is that it's both easier to do and that the price will ordinarily be lower. And so ­­ I mean, the ­­ the agency wouldn't be going into the FSS if the agency didn't think that that was the ­­ the best approach. And in fact, whenever the procurement is over half a million dollars, I believe, the FAR requires the contracting officer to make an affirmative, express determination on exactly that point: That ­­ that going through the FSS is going to provide the best value for us overall.

      "speaker": "SAUNDERS",
      "speech": "Thank you. This case should begin and end for this Court with the concession that in the ordinary sense of the term, an order under the FSS is a contract. Congress chose sweeping language here in acting its mandate, and that language encompasses FSS orders. And to the extent there are, you know, changes that would need to be made or other policy considerations, those can be made by Congress in the future. But the policy consideration it made is ­­ is embodied in the statutory language it chose. Now, the idea that we're going to come back and limit this based on a specialized meaning of the word \"contract,\" we should remember that that argument is not one that appeared in this case until the government's merits brief in this Court. If it's a settled background interpretation that ­­ that Congress was incorporating that limitation into the Act, you think it would have occurred to them in the last decade, the carve­outs for the Small Business Act exceptions were never justified based on providing a narrower meaning of the word \"contract,\" and on their face were expressly limited to the Small Business Act, the provision that applied to part 19 of the FAR implementing the Small Business Act. Well, to the extent there's an exception for the Small Business Act, well, Congress came in here is it rejected the Small Business Act approach. Rather than continuing to tinker within the framework of the Small Business Act where this exception applied, it said we're taking this mandate out of the Small Business Act, we're going to narrow it, it's not going to be a government­wide mandate, but we're going to apply it specifically to the VA in light of its unique obligations and set the VA up as the driver of procurement in this area; have it set the example for the rest of the government. Congress was making ­­ balancing these policy considerations. It wasn't going to be blundering into something that was administratively unworkable. And if you ­­ the dire consequences that we're hearing today really stood any chance of coming to pass, I don't think that you would have the American Legion, the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, 41 members of Congress, who care deeply about veterans issues, supporting Kingdomware's position in this case. The reality is if the government's only doing 20 percent of its procurements from FSS, you're already talking about a broad mandate. And then with respect to those existing ones, you have to have a business that is eligible, it has to appear in the database, and it has to be able to offer a fair and reasonable price and best value. And as the ­­ the Chief Justice discussed for some of these big order commodity contracts, that it's going to be a difficult fight for the ­­ for the drugs that are being offered here, there's a statutory provision that says that the government acquires its drugs at 76 percent of the average price that wholesalers pay to the manufacturers. So take the average price that anyone else in the world can get from the manufacturer and do a big discount on top of that. Those are tough terms to beat. And so I think that there's going to be ­­ you know, the reality here is not the dire consequences that you're seeing, and the policy judgment is for Congress. And believe me, if anything in this mandate enforced as written is going to hurt veterans in any way, then you can expect Congress will act swiftly to correct that problem. But none of this supports the sweeping carve­out that the government is saying that it doesn't even have to look at its own database. It doesn't have to consider a single veteran­owned small business, no matter how competitive it would be, because it can go straight to the Federal suppliers."
