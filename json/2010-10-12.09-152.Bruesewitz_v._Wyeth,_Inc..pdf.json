      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a vaccine designed in the 1940s that was administered to Hannah Bruesewitz in 1992, some 30 years after scientists discovered a safer way to design the pertussis component of the DTP vaccine. The Third Circuit held that the Bruesewitzes could not pursue a design defect claim under State law invoking the preemption principle in claiming that the Vaccine Act of 1986 preempted the Bruesewitz's State claim. That holding is in error for three reasons. First, the court overlooked the numerous provisions of the Act protecting manufacturers from liability, but it did not expressly preempt design defect claims. Second, the court misconstrued the word \"unavoidable\" in section 22(b)(1)'s Federal law defense. And third, the court adopted a policy that exposes children to unnecessary safety risks. With respect to the first reason, in the 1986 Act Congress created a program, the vaccine program, that was funded by surcharges on the vaccines that users used, and out of that fund designed a program to pay compensation to persons who were injured by vaccine-related acts. Congress also provided a mechanism for exhaustion through the vaccine court program before a person claiming injury could pursue a State law cause of action. In creating Federal law defenses to the State law that was designed to govern such actions, Congress established certain defenses, but all of those defenses apply on a case-by-case basis. There are no absolute provisions that preclude a State law claim. The Third Circuit misunderstood that basic principle. The defenses that the Vaccine Act created for manufacturers includes such things as a regulatory compliance defense for failure to warrant claims, a learned intermediary doctrine that is instituted at a national level, the imposition of comment k -足"

Several of them had been overruled by the time the 1986 act took effect and there was a decided shift in favor in the case-by-case application of comment k. And in the 1987 report, Congress made very clear it intended to preserve that case-by-case approach. That is set forth at page 50 of our brief, Justice Alito.

This was a proviso that was intended to ensure that the focus be kept on the unavoidable, unsafe aspects of the design of the vaccine. Now, the other side's view takes other words of 22(b)(1) and renders them surplusage.

We think the best way to read the two clauses together \"unavoidable,\" \"even though,\" is to refer to what comment k meant. Now, comment k used the term \"unavoidable.\" We know Congress was thinking about the term unavoidable. We know that because in the 1986 House report the congressional committee say we would like to enact the principle of comment K. Well, what is the principle of comment K? The principle of comment k is there are so products so useful that we want them to stay on the market without design defect liability. They can only be sued for manufacturing or warning defects. Those are the only two kinds of suits you can bring. In our view, comment k was Congress's denomination of vaccines as comment -- sorry, 22.1 was the denomination of -足"

Now CDC made a determination and this was a determination in effect from the 1960s through the 1990s, that the Sabin vaccine -- the one that is, quote, unquote, \"less safe,\" was the appropriate one for use because it better served the public health. Now as polio -- now this is a dynamic process that CDC is continually engaged in, and so as polio approached global eradication and you are not as concerned about actual control of disease running in the community, CDC transitioned its recommendation to the Salk vaccine. So I -- I think that answers the question that the CDC is making determinations in this regard in a comparative way; and I think it would be extraordinary then to have juries -- to have -- to imagine that Congress set up a system in which juries would effectively be second-guessing decisions like that, because CDC has made -足"

In 1965 Lederle's researchers determine that Lily, the Tri-Solgen, had a \"superior product,\" that's at page 245 of the Joint Appendix. That was in 1967. Eight years later the internal scientists at Lederle wrote a memo to the head of Lederle and said we recommend that we approach Lily for its pertussis vaccine process and/or continue to bid on foreign contracts for this product line with the intent of increasing volume. They had made the determination they were not capable internally of doing a safer design and they knew that for eight years and they nonetheless kept the wholesale pertussis in its market and the documents in this case indicate they did it for economic reasons. And the whole idea behind having design defect claims is to put manufacturers to the duty of putting out safest possible products in light of what the science holds.
