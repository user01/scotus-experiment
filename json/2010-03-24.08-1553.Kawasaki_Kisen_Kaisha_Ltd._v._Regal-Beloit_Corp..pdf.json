  },
  {
    "speaker": "BALLENGER",
    "speech": "I don't believe so, Your Honor. I think both of our position is that the current scope of Carmack is consistent with its historic scope, which had a very limited, special application to exports to Canada and Mexico. Other than that, it doesn't apply to foreign trade at all."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "I thought the government told us in this -- in that case that Carmack wasn't in the case because it was either waived or something. But the case was considered on the basis of, on the one hand, COGSA and, on the other, the law of 50 States."

  {
    "speaker": "BALLENGER",
    "speech": "That's correct, Justice. The United States represented to this Court that -- that Carmack was not in the case, either because it was waived or because the traffic was moving under 49 U.S.C. section 10709, which of course is true here as well. Our view has always been that this Court wouldn't have granted certiorari purely on the basis of a waiver. But in any event, this Court's reasoning in Kirby was that it's very important to foreign trade and to the uniformity of rules on a through shipment."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

    "speaker": "BALLENGER",
    "speech": "That's absolutely true, Your Honor. But the -- for more than a century, the relevant Federal statutes have been construed harmoniously not to overlap in this particular situation. Foreign ocean commerce is governed by the Carriage of Goods at Sea Act, and the Carmack Amendment has always governed purely domestic traffic and exports to Canada and Mexico. Now, Respondents say that the settled meaning of that statute changed dramatically in 1978, but Congress said that it didn't. And it's not really that hard to read the present language --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

I mean, the language that they adopted sure looks quite different to me than what was applicable prior to 1978, and the boilerplate provision that, oh, when we codify this, we don't mean to change anything -- I mean, which prevails, the actual language they used or that boilerplate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BALLENGER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I think that this Court's task, as always, is to read the statute as a whole, which includes that language that Your Honor characterizes as boilerplate and also includes the language that we are here to construe. And you would want to read it all together if possible. So let's look at the -- at the present language. It appears at the back of Union Pacific's reply brief at page 6a. Just like it always has, Carmack distinguishes between receiving carriers, delivering carriers, and connecting carriers. The simplest way to resolve this case is that I believe even Respondents would concede that for Carmack to apply, you need a receiving carrier that is a rail carrier. \"K\" Line is the receiving carrier here, and they are not a rail carrier. Numerous decisions of this Court and the Interstate Commerce Commission confirm what the statute plainly says, which is that a rail carrier is a party providing common carrier railroad transportation, not --"

    "speech": "They are, Your Honor. The simplest way to resolve this case is that the present language, even taken on its face, requires a receiving carrier that is a rail carrier. \"K\" Line is the receiving carrier here. They are not a rail carrier. This Court and the ICC have long held that merely subcontracting for common carrier service does not make you a common carrier. This Court held that in the American Railway Express case. The ICC made this crystal clear in the CSX/Sea-Land matter in 1987, where they held that the ocean carrier Sea-Land was not a rail carrier simply because it subcontracted for inland rail transportation and provided carrier containers to the inland rail carrier. So --"

    "speaker": "BALLENGER",
    "speech": "Correct."

    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. It has always meant that. It has to mean that, because otherwise, if you read it to mean receives from another carrier, then every single connecting carrier or delivering carrier in the chain would be a receiving carrier as well as a connecting or delivering carrier and required to issue its own bill of lading, which would turn the historic purposes of Carmack on its head. The purpose of Carmack was to require the first carrier in the chain to issue a single through bill of lading to the destination that would govern the whole voyage under uniform, consistent liability terms. No one else in the chain is supposed to issue a bill of lading, so there’s only one receiving carrier. It's the first carrier who deals directly with the shipper. If you look at the venue provision, you can see that the statute uses the term \"originating carrier\" interchangeably with \"receiving carrier,\" and it provides venue over that carrier only at the point of origin of the shipment. That would make absolutely no sense if someone downstream could be the receiving carrier. In this circumstance you would say, I suppose, that Union Pacific was the receiving carrier --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BALLENGER",
    "speech": "In domestic -- Congress drew a distinction between foreign and domestic commerce for a very long time, Your Honor. In domestic commerce, the rule has been that a rail carrier could interconnect with a domestic water carrier and the domestic water carrier could carry it for a leg of the trip, and the whole trip would still be governed by the Carmack through bill of lading. But if there was damage during the water portion, it would be governed by the water law, which is the Harter Act."

Congress made the choice to compromise and have kind of a hybrid arrangement. But in foreign trade -- the geographics of Carmack was always confined -- that Carmack did not apply to imports at all, and it did not apply to exports except for exports to adjacent foreign countries --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

If I think you lose on that question under the law as happens to be currently codified, but would prevail under the pre-1978 law, what -- what is your strongest case for the proposition that what I referred to earlier as the boilerplate language trumps the plain language of the currently codified version?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BALLENGER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, we don't think that this Court has ever interpreted language of that nature. But in a different context with a much weaker statutory language, the Fourco Glass line of cases, this Court applies a strong thumb on the scale that Congress didn't intend to change the law."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It's kind of a difficult -- I mean, if you’re a shipper and you’re trying to figure out, okay, let's ship some goods, and you pick up the law and it says, well, this is what the law says, who's going to tell you that, well, that you may think that's what the law says, but you’re really governed by the pre-1978 law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BALLENGER",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, we don't -- we don’t think that it’s -- it is necessary for this Court to read the statute in a counter-textual way. You just have to do what this Court has always done and read the statute as a whole, including giving some weight to that provision, which is in the text of the statute, and reading the rest of the statute in light of it. And I think if you do that, particularly in this case, it's really not that hard to reconcile the pre-1978 law with the current law. Union Pacific can’t be a receiving carrier because it didn't receive the goods at the point of origin. \"K\" Line isn't a rail carrier. That's enough to resolve this case, and this Court doesn't need to go any farther. Actually, that would, as a practical matter, mostly resolve the commercial problem that this Court granted certiorari to resolve."

Can I assume that whether we rule for Petitioners or Respondents in this case, the shipping world, the cargo world, will immediately adjust to our decision? It's not going to be a problem. There are insurers, there are freight forwarders, there are form contracts. People will know exactly what to do. They will adjust in 1 week to what we do. Am I right about that? Or can you say that if we adopt the Respondents’ position, it will be disruptive to the shipping trade and so forth?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BALLENGER",
    "speech": "Not exactly, Your Honor, because of course Respondents’ position is that Carmack is a mandatory regime; there’s no way to contract around it if it applies. So Respondents’ position is that Carmack mandatorily must govern the inland leg of any of these through shipments. The practical consequence of that is that true through bills of lading -- unity of responsibility in one shipper under consistent terms for the entire voyage -- will become impossible in foreign trade. So there won't be a way to correct that."

    "speaker": "YANG",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I’d like to address a few of the questions that have come up already. Justice Sotomayor, you asked what Supreme Court decision addresses the receiving carrier. There’s a series of decisions which address receiving carriers and the nature of the receiving carrier as the initial carrier that receives goods from the shipper. I would -- Mexican Light and Power Company, 1947, is probably the best, but that traces its way back all the way to the 1910s, Galveston Wharf Company, Ward, Starbird, Blish Milling, Riverside Mills. These cases are largely cited at our brief at page 27 to 28, footnote 10. Regarding the geographic scope of Carmack on the current text, we believe that the current text, which is reproduced in the petition appendix at 69a -- if you look at the combination of both the first and the third sentences of Carmack, we believe that that reproduces the historic scope as encompassing only domestic transportation, purely domestic transportation, and transportation to an adjacent foreign country when it's an export. The first sentence requires that the rail carrier be providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the board and issue a receipt or bill of lading. The very purpose of Carmack from the very beginning, its core purpose, was to allow a shipper to sue the initial carrier. The initial carrier was responsible for the entire shipment. All the connecting carriers were deemed to be agents of the initial carrier, and, therefore, there was an easy defendant for the shipper, who dealt directly with that shipper -- that carrier and received a bill of lading from that carrier to sue. That --"

So, a shipper -- or a carrier that is subject to STB jurisdiction has to be providing this U.S. transportation when it issues the bill of lading. So the -- again, the central purpose was to provide a carrier by which -- against whom the shipper can bring suit in a convenient forum, the person that the shipper dealt with. And that's now reflected in section -- the forum provision of Carmack, which is subsection (d)(2), it provides that a suit under Carmack may only be brought against the originating rail carrier in the judicial district in which the point of origin is located. Those -- and the prior provision says that that's a U.S. district court or a State court. Carmack itself anchors the transportation as starting in the United States.

It says the liability under this section is for damage “caused by the receiving carrier, the delivering carrier, or another rail carrier over whose line or route the property is transited in the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country.” So, what that does is that provides the center for the two bookends. The first bookend is the originating carrier, the receiving carrier that receives the goods in the United States, provides the bill of lading to the shipper. The second bookend is the delivering carrier, and in between -- remember Carmack was intended to cover the entire carriage as a unified whole. The in-between is transportation in the United States or export transportation from the United States to a point in a foreign country. We believe that that text, read as a whole, reflects the historic scope of Carmack that's existed since 1915 when it was extended beyond purely domestic transportation."

So, what the Court can do -- it's true, Carmack is less clear than it used to be. It was made somewhat less clear in '78 and in '95. But we believe  that when you take the text as a whole, particularly when read in light of the context of this Court's decision and the long-standing practice in the United States reflected in the STB -- the STB's decisions, that is the ICC's decisions, the predecessor, that at least the provision is ambiguous. And if the provision is ambiguous, section 3(a), the mandate that the statute should not be construed to make a substantive change in the law, should control."

The case is controlled by the plain language of several Federal statutes, and they have been adverted to, to some extent. But I would like to point out to the Court that in 2-1/2 pages of our merits brief, starting at page 26 and going over to page 28, we not only cite the full language in full of the Carmack Amendment and the jurisdictional provision of the STB, but explain how Union Pacific is a delivering carrier within the meaning of the Carmack Amendment; under the plain terms of the statute, they are liable for the loss; the Carmack Amendment applies to their receipt of the property; and the train derailment which was caused by their negligence comes within the plain terms of the Carmack Amendment."

Now, if that's correct and if the ship -- the only one that has to do that, it says, is a rail carrier, and a rail carrier is a person providing common carrier rail transport. And then that's defined to include intermodal equipment used by or in connection with a railroad. And my understanding -- which I'm asking you for correction if I don’t -- is that the argument here is the ship is providing intermodal equipment used by or in connection with a railroad."

And it means that the bill of ladings issued by people throughout the world are all going to have to apply to meet the terms of the Carmack Amendment, which had the purposes of railroads in the United States, and that's going to be a nightmare."

In 1978, the plain language of the statute defined what the STB's jurisdiction is. They do not dispute that the last part of the jurisdictional provision is the STB jurisdiction when a -- a shipment is in, quote, \"between the United States and a place in a foreign country,\" but the STB only has jurisdiction to the extent the transportation occurs in the United States. So it is true that imports into the United States are covered by the Carmack Amendment, but only to the extent of the transportation being within the United States."

    "speech": "Let me go to that point now, Mr. Chief Justice. The Port of Long Beach is situated more than 20 miles from Los Angeles, and the port has 60 miles of train track with intermodal, multimodal facilities that get the cargo containers which \"K\" Line owns on chassis that \"K\" Line owns, and they have to get from the Port of Long Beach 20 miles away to the Los Angeles train depot where Union Pacific picks them up. Now, under \"K\" Line's theory of the case, they get to have a donut hole in the Carmack Amendment liability provision for that 20-mile transport. We would submit as a factual matter, which of course would need to be done on remand, that there are facts that can be adduced to establish the functionality test which the ICC has long administered to look at the functions being performed as well as --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "If it weren't -- if it weren't for the -- for the track from Long Beach to Los Angeles, you would say then they’re not a rail carrier?"

    "speaker": "FREDERICK",

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, how -- how does the Chief Justice's hypothetical work with the language of the statute? They -- it just goes to Los Angeles and it -- there’s a railroad track right by -- by the wharf, and it's the Union Pacific Railroad."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FREDERICK",
    "speech": "Well, there are -- there are two ways to read the text and resolve the case. One is to say \"K\" Line is the receiving rail carrier when it transfers from the international ocean carriage corporation to the American multimodal transportation operation and gets the goods from the Port of Long Beach up to Los Angeles, and then treat UP, Union Pacific, as the delivering rail carrier. Under the statute, UP is not required -- although the first part says you’re supposed to issue a bill of lading, their liability for the train derailment does not turn on whether they issued a bill of lading or not."

And in fact, when Union Pacific removed this case from State court to Federal court, the Federal question was they said: There is a Carmack Amendment claim being asserted against us. That's how we get from State court to Federal court. And when they -- when they sought to transfer the case from California to New York, they did so on the basis of the convenience of 28 of the 32 witnesses to their train derailment being American citizens. So it's not like there needs to be some special -- there’s a special cause of action within the Carmack Amendment, Justice Sotomayor, that provides a means of redress for damaged cargo interests to go directly against the railroad."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Maybe now you could respond to my question about the distinction under 10502 between claims and liability and venue."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FREDERICK",
    "speech": "Yes. The STB, in an authoritative determination that is entitled to our deference, has said that when it issues an exemption for certain categories of rail carriage, which it has done with the multimodal shipments, those exemptions remove the possibility of a 10709 contract carriage. And the reason for that is that, in both situations, the rail carrier has to provide an opportunity for Carmack-compliant terms to be given to the shipper. If it's exempt cargo carriage under 10502, 10502(e) says that the carrier must provide Carmack-compliant terms in order to take advantage of the exemption and contract under the exemption. 10709 provides contract carriage, but only if the rail carrier provides common carrier tariffs that a cargo interest could ship under. Here, because the transportation is exempt under 105 -- 10205, there is no common carrier tariff that is applicable. And that's why the STB has said if there’s no common carrier tariff applicable under 11101, then there cannot be an opportunity for contract carriage. To do otherwise would be to make the statute a complete deregulation statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, but it's a little -- I mean, the -- I’m looking at page 64a of the petition appendix, where they’re saying you can't exempt through contractual terms for liability and claims. Venue is treated elsewhere, separately from liability and claims. So, again, under -- you’re the plain language team, and that seems fairly plain that venue is not covered."

And if we read this with no limitation, this definition makes the ships that carried it from other places railroads, and once that's railroad transportation, we’re into Carmack. And now, if STB exempts it, what happens is the provision comes into play that says you can't exempt an exempt carrier, in effect, from the liability provisions. And it means the ships that had to issue the bill of lading now have to allow the kinds of suits -- now, here is the point I'm not certain about -- I would think against them, not just against a railroad carrier, and perhaps against them for anything that happens, even on the ocean, and not just the railroad carrier for something that happens within the United States."

  {
    "speaker": "FREDERICK",
    "speech": "Now, it is not true that the law was settled prior to 1978. The Woodbury case applied the Carmack Amendment to imports. Union Pacific v. Burke applied it to imports. And in those cases, this Court made the determination that the words \"from\" and \"to\" were also meaning \"between.\" And Congress, when it cleaned up the statute in 1978 and provided words that are very easy to understand now, was not changing what had been a well-settled practice of goods that were getting -- arriving at a port in the United States and then being transported by land means. And it's important to understand the context in which this arose, because I think our fundamental disagreement with the Solicitor General's presentation is that it ignores the container revolution that was occurring between the late 1950s and the '70s, when this Act was codified and cleaned up. And in that container revolution, prior to the time when containers were used for multimodal transportation, it was common for goods to be repackaged at ports in the United States. They were taken off ships; they were repackaged, put onto trains or trucks, and that required a separate contractual arrangement. Now, this Court, in Woodbury and Burke, had said it is not so important whether or not there is a separate contract, so long as the function and the intent is clear that it is being moved by rail or road in the United States. The Carmack Amendment will apply, Justice Sotomayor. You are completely correct that the purpose of the Carmack Amendment was to hold railroads and motor carriers responsible for the liabilities caused by their loss. But when Congress then cleaned that up and put it in section 3, it was not intending to obviate the clear and unambiguous language of the statute. It was simply providing, you know, some boilerplate that I think is very difficult to cause the Court to override the plain language of the statute today. And in 1995, when Congress eliminated -- terminated the ICC and enacted the ICC Termination Act, it reenacted that language. It did not encompass section 3 at that time, so the statute as it presently exists does not have a statutory pointer as to how you are to interpret the language. And under the normal canons that this Court has instructed for courts and the bar, the easiest way to practice law in this area is to look at the statute, see what it says, and not have to go back, not just through the last iteration of the statute, but the one before that, and not just to be able to look at what was in the U.S. Code, but to have to go back to the Statutes at Large to see what other statutory provisions Congress had put into the statute. That would make the practice of law extremely difficult."

Suppose the -- suppose the American rail carrier is waiting right at the foot of the wharf, and all these wharves have rails that go out to the ship, okay? And let's assume that that's owned by the -- by the shipping company. And a crane takes the -- the goods off of the ship, puts it on a -- on a car that rides along those rails for a couple of hundred yards. Is that enough to make the shipper a railroad?"

Our point here is that when there is exempt carriage, the STB has already defined this as something that can be provided by contract, but we believe that 10502(e) says that they have to provide Carmack-compliant terms. The industry will adapt to a decision by this Court in setting the background rules. We would submit that the simpler regime and the one that the railroad had advocated in the international community was there -- was for there to be a U.S. statute that applies and not to allow complete deregulation through contracts --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, they -- they can't contract around liability for an event such as the one that happened here. Because they have to offer Carmack-compliant terms, and if the owner of the goods has the option of accepting those, they can't contract around that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FREDERICK",
    "speech": "That's correct. And -- and the point here about the forum is an important one, because Union Pacific has never thought that in these ocean bills of lading that that entitled American cargo interests to have to go to a foreign country under the ocean carrier's bill of lading in order to vindicate the interests in damage to their cargo. That was an invention by \"K\" Line in this case after UP sought to remove it under the Carmack Amendment and transfer it to New York, and UP joined that motion and has argued throughout that the Carmack Amendment applies. It would be unusual, to say the least, to allow UP now to take advantage of a contractual extension of COGSA where section 12 of COGSA, by its plain terms, in language that is completely ignored by the other side, says COGSA stops basically at the tackle-to-tackle period and does -- otherwise does not waived at this point, Your Honor. It's not actually true. That's not \"K\" Line; it's an affiliate, and they don't provide rail transportation. It's a Union Pacific subsidiary that provides the rail transportation. But the real point is that all of this is far too late. This case was decided on a rule 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss for improper venue, and the lower courts have made clear, sensibly, that if you are confronted with a forum selection motion to dismiss, you are required to at least come forward with any factual disputes that you think need to be resolved before the district court can grant or deny that motion. It's far too late to wait until the Supreme Court of the United States, and say we have discovered some X number of miles of track --"
