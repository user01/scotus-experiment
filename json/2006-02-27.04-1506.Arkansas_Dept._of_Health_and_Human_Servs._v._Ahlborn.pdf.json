      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The parties agree that Medicaid paid over $215,000 to cover the costs of medical care provided to Ms. Ahlborn that resulted from an auto accident that she was involved in. The parties also agree that the Petitioner, the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services, may place a lien on some portion of the third party settlement proceeds that are at issue in this case. They disagree, however, as to what extent that lien may reach into the third party settlement proceeds in this case. The Respondent, without notifying the Department of Health and Human Services, finalized a settlement with the remaining tortfeasor accepting $550,000 as a compromised settlement for a claim that she had originally valued at over $3 million."

Party A and party B enter into a settlement, and they say $10,000 is for medical and $90,000 is for pain and suffering. You, Arkansas, are out $50,000. Well, fine. You're in the case anyway.

If they have a good faith settlement and they think that $10,000 of this good faith settlement is attributable to the medical expense and you are out $40,000 -- $50,000, you can sue the other party.

The remedy is to go against the causer of the accident and get the extra money that you think is entitled to you. The statutes say that literally, and why not just follow them?"

Now, as a -- a condition of Ms. Ahlborn's eligibility -- or as a condition of eligibility for Medicaid, Ms. Ahlborn had to assign to the State her right to payment for medical costs -- her right to payment for medical costs. Consequently, when she assigned that right to the State, it was synonymous with what the State itself had to do, which was seek full reimbursement from liable third parties to the extent of the third parties' legal liability."

And also, in the third party liability provisions, it's important to recognize that they provide -- they include a duty of cooperation that the recipient has to cooperate with the State in seeking full Medicaid reimbursement. So the third -- the Federal third party liability provisions basically consider the recipient and the State to be a team, a team that is out to get full reimbursement."

So she has to turn over from her recovery what she got for health care, but we know that her tort claim consisted of a lot more. So if the Federal statute says she has to turn over what she received from the third party for health care services, well, she did that, and you agreed that that would be a fair allocation. So I don't see how you get from her the -- a much larger share than what she got for health care."

And what are her rights to payment for medical care? If we would take this out of the Medicaid context and put it in a standard tort context, someone who's injured by a third party has a right to receive all the money that she is out due to the fact that she was injured by the third party."

In fact, I've done that as a matter of law, under Arkansas law. You've got your assignment. Number two, I'm giving you the portion of the recovery that I got with respect to medical payments. You can have it. Now, there's a difference between what you paid and what I got attributable to medical payments, an amount, by the way, which you stipulated was correct.

The problem in this case -- and it's a common one -- is when private parties, beneficiaries, sue first and run the well dry. There's no question in this case that the settlement includes the payment for medical care that she was entitled to and the one she assigned to the State. That is not in dispute. The question is the amount, and the amount is very much in dispute.

It -- the -- the question of liability for medical care, or at least the State's claim for medical care -- sometimes they have their own -- is still open, and there has to be enough money left in the well.

But let -- if I -- I think it's important to understand why these suits against the -- or a State could decide -- and the anti-lien decision does not compel the State to decide otherwise. A State, with its discretion under Medicaid, could decide that pursuing third parties is not viable. This is not an ordinary assignment. This is an assignment with strong duties of cooperation required on the part of the beneficiary. Now, what does the lawsuit look like when the State goes, after the settlement, against the third party tortfeasor here? The State has no control of evidence. It has a pile of bills, none of the relevant evidence. At the point of this lawsuit, the beneficiary's interests are adverse to the State's. They're not in a cooperative mode.

Do you get the amount that we unilaterally designate, or can the State have a default rule that says when you cut us out and we no longer have a means of litigating in cooperation with you to make a reasoned judgment as to what the fair medical payment is in this settlement, can we insist upon 100 percent?

What's more easily documented. They didn't do -- it's just a mathematical reduction. The State never said that's accurate.

Now, once you've done that, you've given them an opportunity to participate. If they have that opportunity, thereafter they cannot attach more than what are the real medical expenses, which could be a matter for argument in a settlement like this.

And to have the -- the State at the injured plaintiff's side throughout all of that step would be a logistical problem. And -- and in any event, it -- the plaintiff is in control of the litigation. The State has no right to say, you go to trial or you don't go to trial. We don't agree that you're getting enough. If -- if you go -- if you settle at this figure, we're going to be cut short."

If you win this, then the defendant's insurance companies know that they're subject to further liability for the medicals in every case. And why won't they sit there and tell you at this settlement, hey, we're not going to enter into this unless you get the State involved so they sign off on it too?

Secondly, as to the who owned the proceeds depends upon the extent to which the State was allowed to take an assignment. If the State was allowed to take an assignment from something other than the claim for medical expenses, then they owned the proceeds.

We -- in -- in summation, as I see the white light is on, we believe that this case -- and it is Respondent's position that these three statutes that we have been discussing here are plain and unambiguous and that the case should be resolved upon the basis of the statutory language. And we -- it is further Respondent's position that if the case is resolved on the basis of the statutory language, the Eighth Circuit reached a very correct analysis of the language and the results that that takes place. There is no ambiguity, and under the first step of the Chevron case, we submit to the Court that this is a case of statutory construction within the terms of the statutes which, read together, are unambiguous and plain. They get an assignment for the claim for medical care services. The anti-lien statute shields the rest. Thank you very much."

First of all, the default rule, that rule being that unless the State is invited into the negotiations, that liability -- the extent of the liability of the third party can be considered to be 100 -- the full amount that Medicaid had to pay -- that is a very important rule. And it makes sense because money that has to be spent -- there was a suggestion of post-settlement hearings to determine what portion of the money is for -- for medical costs and what is for something else. Such hearings would be incredibly expensive, horribly inconvenient. The State would have to, you know, burden -- shoulder this burden, and this is money that could be going into the Medicaid program. Every dollar that's recovered from liable third parties is put back into the Medicaid program, and if the State has to keep hiring more lawyers and has to have administrative hearings or proceeding in judiciary proceedings to determine what part of a settlement constitutes a payment, then that -- that is just a very inefficient use of -- of very limited Federal -- or State funds.
