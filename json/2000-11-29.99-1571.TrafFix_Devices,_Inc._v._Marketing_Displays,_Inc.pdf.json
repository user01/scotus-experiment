  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, incidental ornamentation that is not part of what the patent protects does not give rise to the right to copy.  There should be an exact symmetry.  Whatever the patent had protected as part of the patent bargain, the public has the right to copy. Now, the color of the legs probably would not have been claimed in the patent, and wouldn't have been part of the invention, and therefore it would not give rise to a right to copy that color."

    "speech": "Well, it depends on which stand is involved.  The steel stand is one color and the aluminum stand is another, but in terms of what they claimed in the patent as -- the part that makes the invention work, it's dual springs Traffix could have, but you have to devise some kind of other stand, curved legs, or a double stand. I thought that's --"

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

Now, if they said, you could use three springs or four springs, I guess it would never end, five springs, or you could put a little skirt around the springs so people wouldn't see them, or, as Your Honor points out, if you're going to use the springs you have to change something else so it doesn't look like it. But that's not what this Court's cases have held.  What the Court has said, Singer and Kellogg and Sears, is that the public has the right to copy the patented invention in precisely the form in which it was practiced, and that's critically important.  The idea of new improvement to some different sign stand, but the right to copy attaches to the product as it was practiced during the term of the patent.  We don't have to design around their superior stand -- that's why it succeeded in getting the patent -- to add improvements of our own."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So as far as you're concerned, if it's useful, then it's functional?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Period, without regard to competitive need, available alternatives -- MDI's position is, look, you can make a sign that stands up to the wind that's just as good as our sign stand, so don't make it the way we made it, but the patent, the expired patent gives us the right to copy -- that there was no way to make or sell shredded wheat other than in the pillow-shaped biscuit form that Nabisco had made famous when it had its patent.  It was enough that that was the form in which Nabisco had practiced its patent.  Kellogg therefore could copy it, even though they could have made shredded wheat some other way, and that's important precisely because of the purpose of the patent bargain to promote competition. As I said, why -- if we have an improvement to this sign stand, the step-and-drop legs, why should we have to add it only to a very different sign stand?  It's the commercially proven version that the public has the right to copy.  That is important to enhance competition. To require people, if they're going to make improvements, to design around the form that the public had become accustomed to, would inhibit competition, and -- You recite the old cases like Kellogg.  It's been argued that on the trade dress side the law has evolved since those old cases, and it's now, trade dress gets more protection."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Yes.  You're dealing with what is in the trade dress area essentially judge-made law, and it has expanded in various ways, and functionality -- it doesn't interfere with the patent bargain if functionality means a broad range of other things, but so long as it is also satisfied completely by a demonstration that it is a useful product feature. There may be other limitations on a trade dress claim going to competitive need, available alternatives, any of the various multi-factor tests, but if functionality is going to serve the purpose of demarking the regime of trademark and trade dress and patent law, it on which we could decide this case would simply be on the basis of how expensive a concept of configuration trade dress we want, because if we take your position, configuration trade dress is going to be, at least in formally patented matters, a pretty narrow concept, and if we're going to have coherence within the concept of configuration trade dress, we're going to have to make it equally narrow. I mean, we can't have different functionality tests, I presume, and if on the other hand we find good reason to think configuration trade dress is desirable, then we're going to go the other way with a different concept of functionality, I suppose."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I think it is the expansion of the concept of configuration trade dress that has given rise to this issue and the problem.  If you go back to where useful product feature, as the Court said in Qualitex, that's the regime of patent law, and it's no answer to say, well, we're protected by patent law and when the patent expires we're protected under trade dress law, because that takes away the public's half of the patent bargain.  We're giving exclusive right to an inventor for a term of years on the condition that he or she disclose what the invention is, and that the public obtains a right to copy it when the patent expires. So yes, I mean, it is the expansion of product configuration trade dress that has given rise to this problem, and I would at least suggest that the Court should not get on board with that expansion without waiting for Congress to say something about it, particularly given the fact that it so directly impinges upon the central patent bargain underlying the patent evidentiary support for the ultimate conclusion that this is a functional feature."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, it gives rise to an important distinction.  In other words, having been covered by the patent, another producer knows that when it comes off patent he can copy it, and that's how it worked in this case.  Traffix Devices knew -- they were in the business -- this was a patented sign stand, they couldn't make it, it comes off patent, they can make it. Now, if they at that point had to -- instead, if respondent's position were adopted, they had to go to their lawyer and say, is this legally functional, their lawyer would tell them, well, it depends.  There are six factors in this circuit, there are eight factors in the other circuit.  We've got to get expert economic testimony.  It depends on consumer surveys.  By that time I mean, should you make it absolute never, or should you allow somebody to defend on the ground that, look, it wasn't that crucial to the patent, and everybody's come to identify it, and please let me make an exception here, and then they give some fabulous reasons. Should it be absolute, or leave them a little bit of a loophole?"

Someone made the exact same sign here and he said, a-ha, that infringes my patent.  Well, if it did infringe his patent, and the Ninth Circuit concluded it did, then the public has a right to copy. I'd like to reserve --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Wasn't the exact same sign -- I thought one of the points that was made was that in the patent infringement case, that sign didn't look as much like the Market Display signs --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Yes.  The patent displays what they call a business sign, with two springs far apart. The Traffix sign, the one at issue in Windproof and at issue here, the springs are closely together. MDI argued successfully that made no difference, may it please the Court: Our brief is built on the premise that the functionality doctrine, the traditional functionality doctrine of trademark law is what makes trademark protection of trade dress and other symbolic elements consistent with this Court's patent law jurisprudence, as synthesized and reaffirmed as recently as the Bonito Boats case, but I think part of the reason the two laws harmonize is because the use of functionality doctrine is to limit the scope of protection of the device. Its traditional function was to bar the holder of a patent or other utilitarian device, even if nonpatented, from withdrawing that device from the public domain when there's no longer the protection of the patent as trade -- withdrawing it from the public domain as trade dress because people have a right to practice and use as monopolizing and withdrawing from the public domain utilitarian features or the entire utilitarian device in the absence of valid patent protection.  That is the domain of patent law, and one must qualify for a patent and have a valid patent in order to have a legal monopoly that withdraws, that prevents others from using the device, but there -- as I say, these other protections are still available as well as the ability to exclude ornamental or incidental features.  That is what to us harmonizes the two statutory schemes. The traditional understanding of functionality was not an artificial concept.  It was the ordinary meaning of the word.  What enables the device to function is what is functional.  That was reflected in a very terse quotation we have in a footnote on page 17 of our brief by Representative Lanham himself, when someone raised because this sign, all the ingredients are functional. There's no purple bow on it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALLACE",
    "speech": "That is absolutely correct.  We would come out the same way as we were -- I think this Court's decision in Bonito Boats is an example of that, because there was no patent shown in the record, as the court noted, of the boat hull that they said could not be copied."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So your position is the utilitarian feature of the patent is a conclusive presumption in a trade dress suit where functionality would otherwise be at issue?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALLACE",
    "speech": "With regard to the scope of protection, that others cannot be excluded from using something utilitarian. As we compressed our brief down to our allotted confusing similarity make the need for a right to exclude imitation of trade dress relatively unimportant compared to the policies this Court has reiterated at least since 1896 in the Singer case about the need for utilitarian features to be used as building blocks and to be in the public domain except for the limited period of time in which they are protected by a valid and unexpired patent, and we understand this Court's decision in Qualitex to mean much the same thing. The difficulty has arisen because an alternative test of functionality has also become appropriate as the scope of trademark protection has extended to matters that don't have utilitarian features to them.  We point particularly to the protection of color as an example, where there is relevance to looking at competitive need in -- we give an example in our brief of an orange-colored replacing a portion of the piping would be disadvantaged if he couldn't match the color of it. It was a different case from the Federal Circuit's Corning, Owens-Corning case involving the pink- colored insulation, because that goes behind the wall and people don't see it.  The orange coloring in some contexts connotes danger, and perhaps there is marketing significance to that. But the mistake that I think some of the courts of appeals have made, including the Sixth Circuit in this case, is to say that that is now the exclusive approach, and you wind up with multi-factored tests that don't really give an adequate guidance to what the law is. A very good example is found on page 17 of the light green amicus brief filed by the International Trademark Association in this case, in which they speak the Court has recognized in the cases synthesized in the Bonito Boats opinion."

They added it to the fact that you can't have functional trademarks -- you can't have trademark that's functional but if it's nonfunctional you can, and they knew about the Vornado case at that time because it was decided in 1995, and that's the Tenth Circuit, and there's a lot of flurry of activity in the intellectual property bar because of that, so all that was before Congress when it amended it, and Congress did not go to any per se test at that time, and so you've got two Federal laws here, and add functionality."

You have to show it's nonfunctional. Under the Qualitex case in my opinion you have to show whether it's competitive necessity, then you've got to show whether there's a likelihood of confusion. You may have a product that looks exactly the same as yours, but if you can't show there's a likelihood of confusion, you don't win.  You need all three of those tests in the trade dress area."

They're essential to the use, these springs, in this way. Now, should there be an absolute presumption that if you one day said -- I'm not saying what you did say, but we'll assume this.  If you one day said in the patent application, I have a great idea here, and my idea is to have two springs just like this, and then later on, when it's expired, they say, that was the heart of it.  It was useful.  Should the fact that you said that one day in the patent be the end of the matter, nobody ever looks further?

You can't look at one --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speech": "As long as you don't confuse the You also have the fact that as -- where do you look at the trade dress and this functionality, look at one patent, look at two patents, what if there are several patents that show it. You know, what if you don't even own the patents?  What if we were just a licensee and asserted it? What if you didn't own it?  Would that make a difference, or if a third party owns the patent.  There are several things, questions we raise at the back of our brief that Traffix and the Government really can't answer.  They really do admit that if someone is the subject matter of one patent by one person, and it expires, somebody else's trade dress will expire. I mean, right now we also have a situation where they're trying to get special protection for utility patents, which is different than, for example, for design the product, but there's no problem with having trade dress protection afterwards because it isn't functional, so why should utility patents be treated any differently? And as I said initially, there are different areas of intellectual property law, you have different standards, different tests, different remedies.  You know, in trade dress law you have -- in trademark law you have much different remedies to protect the public and consumers.  Here --"

Third, that is the form in which they practiced their patent, the closely spaced springs.  Kellogg, Singer, Sears, that line of cases gives Traffix Devices and any member of the public the right to copy the patent in the form in which it was practiced.  That is critically important to maintain competition.  Whether you begin with patent law and the right to copy from an expired patent, or trade dress law and the definition of functionality that focuses on usefulness, is it a useful product figure, you come to the same point.  Traffix Devices had the right to copy the MDI sign stand when it came off patent, and it"
