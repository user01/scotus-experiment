    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The president and founder of Marketing Displays, Incorporated, MDI, invented a new type of sign stand, one with a dual-spring design that allowed the stand to resist the wind. MDI patented that invention and, for the term of its patents, MDI labeled its sign stands as patent- protected to warn of copiers, touted in its trade literature the benefit of its, quote, patented dual- spring design, end quote, and when another company, Windproof, tried to market a copy of MDI's patented stand, MDI sued it for patent infringement and won. But then MDI's patents expired, as under the Constitution all patents eventually must. Sometime thereafter, Traffix Devices, the petitioner, copied MDI's stand, added some improvements of its own, and marketed a competing version. No longer armed with its patents, MDI tried a new tack to exclude competition. It claimed that the configuration of its stand, the same dual-spring design that it had touted as patent-protected during the term of the patents, was protected as trade dress and could not be copied."

      "speech": "Well, incidental ornamentation that is not part of what the patent protects does not give rise to the right to copy. There should be an exact symmetry. Whatever the patent had protected as part of the patent bargain, the public has the right to copy. Now, the color of the legs probably would not have been claimed in the patent, and wouldn't have been part of the invention, and therefore it would not give rise to a right to copy that color."

      "speech": "Well, it depends on which stand is involved. The steel stand is one color and the aluminum stand is another, but in terms of what they claimed in the patent as -- the part that makes the invention work, it's not the legs that made this invention. It's not the sign. It is the dual-spring design. That's what they said was patented. When they marketed this, when they had the exclusive right to do so, they focused on that in their trade literature, said this is our patented dual-spring design, and that is the same claim they now raise in their trade dress assertion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But Mr. Roberts, didn't the court of appeals say, at least as I understood it to say, okay, the dual springs Traffix could have, but you have to devise some kind of other stand, curved legs, or a double stand. I thought that's --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "It said we -- it said we basically had to design around their stand. Now, if they said, you could use three springs or four springs, I guess it would never end, five springs, or you could put a little skirt around the springs so people wouldn't see them, or, as Your Honor points out, if you're going to use the springs you have to change something else so it doesn't look like it. But that's not what this Court's cases have held. What the Court has said, Singer and Kellogg and Sears, is that the public has the right to copy the patented invention in precisely the form in which it was practiced, and that's critically important. The idea of designing around what had previously been patented is a significant hindrance to competition, and this case is a good example. When we copied the sign we added an important improvement of our own, the step-and-drop leg. Under MDI's stand you have to bend over and pull the pins out. Under ours, you just step and the legs come out. Now, if the rule were the rule that the respondents are arguing for, we would have had to add that new improvement to some different sign stand, but the right to copy attaches to the product as it was practiced during the term of the patent. We don't have to design around their superior stand -- that's why it succeeded in getting the patent -- to add improvements of our own."

      "speech": "Well, it gives you -- this -- I think my question is related to Justice O'Connor's, and this is a problem that I have in understanding, and maybe you can help me.

Kellogg did not have to show that there was no way to make or sell shredded wheat other than in the pillow-shaped biscuit form that Nabisco had made famous when it had its patent. It was enough that that was the form in which Nabisco had practiced its patent. Kellogg therefore could copy it, even though they could have made shredded wheat some other way, and that's important precisely because of the purpose of the patent bargain to promote competition. As I said, why -- if we have an improvement to this sign stand, the step-and-drop legs, why should we have to add it only to a very different sign stand? It's the commercially proven version that the public has the right to copy. That is important to enhance competition. To require people, if they're going to make improvements, to design around the form that the public had become accustomed to, would inhibit competition, and --"

You recite the old cases like Kellogg. It's been argued that on the trade dress side the law has evolved since those old cases, and it's now, trade dress gets more protection."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Yes. You're dealing with what is in the trade dress area essentially judge-made law, and it has expanded in various ways, and functionality -- it doesn't interfere with the patent bargain if functionality means a broad range of other things, but so long as it is also satisfied completely by a demonstration that it is a useful product feature. There may be other limitations on a trade dress claim going to competitive need, available alternatives, any of the various multi-factor tests, but if functionality is going to serve the purpose of demarking the regime of trademark and trade dress and patent law, it must be satisfied by a showing that it is a useful product feature and in our case that's significant, because you can't get a utility patent as MDI had, without showing that it's a useful product feature, so the fact that they had a utility patent, that it covered the dual-spring design, should be enough to establish functionality and therefore should be enough to reject their trade dress claim."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Do you agree that at least one basis on which we could decide this case would simply be on the basis of how expensive a concept of configuration trade dress we want, because if we take your position, configuration trade dress is going to be, at least in formally patented matters, a pretty narrow concept, and if we're going to have coherence within the concept of configuration trade dress, we're going to have to make it equally narrow. I mean, we can't have different functionality tests, I presume, and if on the other hand we find good reason to think configuration trade dress is desirable, then we're going to go the other way with a different concept of functionality, I suppose."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "I think it is the expansion of the concept of configuration trade dress that has given rise to this issue and the problem. If you go back to where trademark was limited to marks on the product, of course, the product could be patented, the trademark is fine. If you even then go the next step, and you're talking about trade dress and packaging, again, so long as it's distinct from the product, there's no interference with patent. But when you start saying that the configuration of the product itself is entitled to protection as trade dress, you bump right into the patent law, because the key to the patent bargain is, if you're going to control a useful product feature, as the Court said in Qualitex, that's the regime of patent law, and it's no answer to say, well, we're protected by patent law and when the patent expires we're protected under trade dress law, because that takes away the public's half of the patent bargain. We're giving exclusive right to an inventor for a term of years on the condition that he or she disclose what the invention is, and that the public obtains a right to copy it when the patent expires. So yes, I mean, it is the expansion of product configuration trade dress that has given rise to this problem, and I would at least suggest that the Court should not get on board with that expansion without waiting for Congress to say something about it, particularly given the fact that it so directly impinges upon the central patent bargain underlying the patent system."

      "speech": "Well, it gives rise to an important distinction. In other words, having been covered by the patent, another producer knows that when it comes off patent he can copy it, and that's how it worked in this case. Traffix Devices knew -- they were in the business -- this was a patented sign stand, they couldn't make it, it comes off patent, they can make it. Now, if they at that point had to -- instead, if respondent's position were adopted, they had to go to their lawyer and say, is this legally functional, their lawyer would tell them, well, it depends. There are six factors in this circuit, there are eight factors in the other circuit. We've got to get expert economic testimony. It depends on consumer surveys. By that time the producer says, forget it, it's not worth the candle, I'll go make something else, and competition suffers."

I mean, should you make it absolute never, or should you allow somebody to defend on the ground that, look, it wasn't that crucial to the patent, and everybody's come to identify it, and please let me make an exception here, and then they give some fabulous reasons. Should it be absolute, or leave them a little bit of a loophole?"

Here, we not only have the labeling and the trade literature, we have the Windproof litigation. Someone made the exact same sign here and he said, a-ha, that infringes my patent. Well, if it did infringe his patent, and the Ninth Circuit concluded it did, then the public has a right to copy. I'd like to reserve --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our brief is built on the premise that the functionality doctrine, the traditional functionality doctrine of trademark law is what makes trademark protection of trade dress and other symbolic elements consistent with this Court's patent law jurisprudence, as synthesized and reaffirmed as recently as the Bonito Boats case, but I think part of the reason the two laws harmonize is because the use of functionality doctrine is to limit the scope of protection of the device. Its traditional function was to bar the holder of a patent or other utilitarian device, even if nonpatented, from withdrawing that device from the public domain when there's no longer the protection of the patent as trade -- withdrawing it from the public domain as trade dress because people have a right to practice and use as the building blocks for further innovation whatever devices are in the public domain that are utilitarian in nature, including their overall configuration, but there is still protection against confusing similarity through requirements of labeling, packaging, avoiding palming off and other misrepresentations. Functionality really goes to the scope of protection, and limits the scope of protection available under trademark law by preventing someone from monopolizing and withdrawing from the public domain utilitarian features or the entire utilitarian device in the absence of valid patent protection. That is the domain of patent law, and one must qualify for a patent and have a valid patent in order to have a legal monopoly that withdraws, that prevents others from using the device, but there -- as I say, these other protections are still available as well as the ability to exclude ornamental or incidental features. That is what to us harmonizes the two statutory schemes. The traditional understanding of functionality was not an artificial concept. It was the ordinary meaning of the word. What enables the device to function is what is functional. That was reflected in a very terse quotation we have in a footnote on page 17 of our brief by Representative Lanham himself, when someone raised concerns about whether the trademark law might result in compromising of the public's right to use useful inventions, and he said --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Wallace, may I ask if you would answer the question that Justice Stevens posed to Mr. Roberts in the same way? That is, the definition you're now giving us as functional sounds like you would come out the same way on this alleged trade dress infringement, even if there had never been any patent in the picture, because this sign, all the ingredients are functional. There's no purple bow on it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "That is absolutely correct. We would come out the same way as we were -- I think this Court's decision in Bonito Boats is an example of that, because there was no patent shown in the record, as the court noted, of the boat hull that they said could not be copied."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So your position is the utilitarian feature of the patent is a conclusive presumption in a trade dress suit where functionality would otherwise be at issue?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "With regard to the scope of protection, that others cannot be excluded from using something utilitarian. As we compressed our brief down to our allotted 30 pages we carefully preserved a quotation on page 11 that you can see at the top of the page from the 1917, or 1911, excuse me, Seventh Circuit decision because it states the common sense of it. If you have utilitarian features that didn't even meet the standard for getting a patent, they should not be given a perpetual monopoly in contrast to what was then the 17-year monopoly that you could get if you met the criteria for patentability. The other protections available against confusing similarity make the need for a right to exclude imitation of trade dress relatively unimportant compared to the policies this Court has reiterated at least since 1896 in the Singer case about the need for utilitarian features to be used as building blocks and to be in the public domain except for the limited period of time in which they are protected by a valid and unexpired patent, and we understand this Court's decision in Qualitex to mean much the same thing. The difficulty has arisen because an alternative test of functionality has also become appropriate as the scope of trademark protection has extended to matters that don't have utilitarian features to them. We point particularly to the protection of color as an example, where there is relevance to looking at competitive need in -- we give an example in our brief of an orange-colored can of soda. There were other amicus submissions in the Qualitex case in which people were making claims that raised issues that went quite beyond what was involved in the press pad that was at issue in Qualitex. One of them, for example, involved orange-colored sprinkler system piping. Well, it raised other questions. I don't say the result would necessarily be different, but one would have to examine whether a competitor who wanted to compete for replacing a portion of the piping would be disadvantaged if he couldn't match the color of it. It was a different case from the Federal Circuit's Corning, Owens-Corning case involving the pink- colored insulation, because that goes behind the wall and people don't see it. The orange coloring in some contexts connotes danger, and perhaps there is marketing significance to that. But the mistake that I think some of the courts of appeals have made, including the Sixth Circuit in this case, is to say that that is now the exclusive approach, and you wind up with multi-factored tests that don't really give an adequate guidance to what the law is. A very good example is found on page 17 of the light green amicus brief filed by the International Trademark Association in this case, in which they speak approvingly of various multi-factored tests that the courts of appeals have adopted in this area, which leaves open what this Court in its salutary opinion in Wal-Mart v. Samara Brothers referred to as the plausible threat of litigation which can discourage competitors and become an impediment to the benefits that consumers would get from competition, and to have tests of this kind applied to displace the traditional approach to functionality would be very detrimental to competitors for the very reasons the Court has recognized in the cases synthesized in the Bonito Boats opinion."

I thought, on page 165 where the court quotes the tradition, what's in quotes, the definition, a product feature is functional if it is essential to the use or purpose of this article, all in quotes, or if it affects the cost or quality of the article, okay, end of the matter. Now it adds, because that's what happens to be relevant to aesthetic functionality, that is, if exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a significant nonreputational disadvantage.

There are different forms of intellectual property laws, or IP laws, as I call them, you've got five different basically Federal laws on intellectual property, patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, unfair competition. They're all separate and distinct. The fact that you have a patent on something, that is different than whether or not you can have a trade dress on something. Patent would be relevant in the sense that under this commercial necessity test, if there's only one way to make that product, that was look and experience, then it's functional, and so in that sense the functionality test would apply and the patent, if it says something about the functionality, that would be relevant to the functionality test in the trade dress area, but they're separate and distinct, and they always have. Design patents, for example --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "They may be separate and distinct, but they bear upon one another, and there seems to be something horribly unfair about allowing someone who has acquired a secondary meaning in the trade dress only because of the patent -- let's say the shape of a Coca- Cola bottle. I mean, you know, if that wasn't patented, somebody else could have come out with the same shape bottle as soon as it -- you know, as soon as the first ones came off the line they could say, gee, that's a nice- looking bottle, and they could have copied it, but you couldn't copy it because it was patented, and therefore, by reason of the patent, for 17 years Coca-Cola acquires a secondary meaning. Anyone who sees that bottle would say, it's Coca-Cola. Then, when the patent expires, Coca-Cola in effect extends the patent by parlaying what was the design patent into what is now trade dress protection, because they say, well, gee, everybody knows that that's a Coca- Cola bottle, but the only reason they know is because you've been given a monopoly for 17 years, and it doesn't seem right to enable you to extend that monopoly indefinitely. The only reason you acquired the secondary meaning was because of the patent. That's unlike other companies that get secondary meanings without a patent. Doesn't there seem any incompatibility with the patent law to you?"

I agree that perhaps, if you have this 17-year monopoly on this patent, that might help you on the trade dress area with respect to secondary meaning, but then, of course, just as we found here, the functionality test, the fact that you had a patent on it actually hurts you. It might be a wash between those two. The trade dress has three separate and distinct tests. You have to show it's distinctive -- in other words, it has secondary meaning -- and the public recognizes it as something which comes from a certain source. It's a source identifier. You have to show it's nonfunctional. However, trademark law has been amended, which specifically says you have that burden of proof if it's unregistered. You have to show it's nonfunctional. Under the Qualitex case in my opinion you have to show whether it's competitive necessity, then you've got to show whether there's a likelihood of confusion. You may have a product that looks exactly the same as yours, but if you can't show there's a likelihood of confusion, you don't win. You need all three of those tests in the trade dress area."

It was really acquired meaning, acquired meaning afterwards. Legal functionality really is a misnomer. Every product has a function. The Coke bottle has a function, obviously. It's useful, has a purpose. It's got a flat bottom so it doesn't tip over. It's got a narrow waist so you can grab it, a narrow spout so you can drink it easier, it's clear so you can see it. Those are all functional, useful, purposeful."

They're saying that the functionality of the product is that the springs prevent it from twisting in the wind.

I thought what you said is, you agreed with me before that Qualitex is talking about aesthetic functionality, that we apply the normal test without that little add-on, but we apply Restatement Three, the aesthetic functionality test, which is the add- on, where they make the claim that the reason this product is functional is because of the way it looks, i.e., the pipes are painted orange as a warning, which is not their claim in this case.

Everything has a use or purpose, and then you say, if it affects the cost or quality. Virtually everything affects the cost or quality, so it seems to me the only objective test you have here, because it relates to competitors and consumers, is whether or not it puts competitors at a significant disadvantage in the marketplace."

This is in the record before the court of appeals. Now, they could change any one of those. They could keep the coil springs if they change some other configuration to make it look different, to give it a visual -- different visual appearance. Like, right now, even the vice president and their technical expert say that when they see a sign like this one driving along the road, they know it comes from Marketing Displays.

They could have gone to something like this, with a wide base, a pair of springs way apart, they could have gone to straight legs like this, they could have gone to an upright like this, rather than this, and attached the sign to it. This is what the patent covered. This is what was shown in the patent. This is only found to infringe, under the doctrine of equivalents, which took several years and several thousands of dollars for MDI to prove it, and that's the problem with a per se test."

Six others all came up with sign stands which looked different. They have different spring mechanisms in particular. There's flat springs, horizontal spring, there's a torsion spring, and so Traffix said, I had to copy MDI's, yet all the other competitors made their own design. They came up with sign stands which look different. They have different visual appearance. So there are seven types of sign stands out there, MDI's, six others, and then Traffix'."

Now, assuming that that's so, what would be wrong -- and they come in and they say, look, these springs are part of the function. They're part of the function. They're essential to the use, these springs, in this way. Now, should there be an absolute presumption that if you one day said -- I'm not saying what you did say, but we'll assume this. If you one day said in the patent application, I have a great idea here, and my idea is to have two springs just like this, and then later on, when it's expired, they say, that was the heart of it. It was useful. Should the fact that you said that one day in the patent be the end of the matter, nobody ever looks further? There is a -- what the Government said here is where as an expired utility patent discloses that the feature alleges trade dress contributes to the operation of the formerly patented device, the feature must be considered function.

      "speaker": "ARTZ",
      "speech": "Well, the problem you have, Your Honor, is that tests -- either the Government's test or Traffix' test is going to be unworkable, because you could have company A that makes this product, or comes up with this idea, company B. Company A gets a patent on it, goes 17 years. Company B doesn't get a patent, and gets trade dress protection on it, and yet company A for some reason doesn't sue them, but when this patent expires, that means all the trade dress that company B has developed over all those years is shot. It's out the window, because it happens to be the subject of a patent. See, that's a problem with this per se test that they're saying."

In that case, the competitors made a flat spring, they had a horizontal spring, they put two springs at 45-degree angles, you could change the legs, you could change the upright -- all of those might give a different visual impression. That's what the Sixth Circuit said. See, the district court in this case concentrated on just the two springs, and the Sixth Circuit said that was not proper because it's the overall appearance, visual, visual and image of the product which really controls.

      "speech": "As long as you don't confuse the patent law with the trade dress law, Your Honor, two separate and distinct, but from a patent law standpoint you're right, but not from the trade dress standpoint. There's another -- right now we're looking at the public domain, and the difference is where it comes from. If it comes from a patent, it's given special recognition. You can't use it for the trade dress, but if it doesn't, then you can use it. Now, that to me is not a real consistent -- not a real consistent argument. You also have the fact that as -- where do you look at the trade dress and this functionality, look at one patent, look at two patents, what if there are several patents that show it. You know, what if you don't even own the patents? What if we were just a licensee and asserted it? What if you didn't own it? Would that make a difference, or if a third party owns the patent. There are several things, questions we raise at the back of our brief that Traffix and the Government really can't answer. They really do admit that if someone is the subject matter of one patent by one person, and it expires, somebody else's trade dress will expire. I mean, right now we also have a situation where they're trying to get special protection for utility patents, which is different than, for example, for design patents. Or, talk about something being nonfunctional, design patenting in which having this right, as you mentioned before, of an exclusive period of 14 years develop secondary meaning. There's no question whatsoever that courts do allow parties to get trade dress protection in such a matter of design patents, and there you've got this secondary meaning over 14 years in which you've used it exclusively, and that goes to the look and appearance of the product, but there's no problem with having trade dress protection afterwards because it isn't functional, so why should utility patents be treated any differently? And as I said initially, there are different areas of intellectual property law, you have different standards, different tests, different remedies. You know, in trade dress law you have -- in trademark law you have much different remedies to protect the public and consumers. Here --"

      "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. There was until this morning no dispute that moving the springs closer together was functional. If you look at petition appendix page 54a, there is the explanation from MDI's chief engineer that doing so makes the sign more compact and weighs less, very important if you're ferrying these things up and down the highway, and also makes it less expensive to manufacture. As far as the two different sign stands, the diamond one with the closely spaced springs, joint appendix page 236, MDI said that those signs, even though the other one was depicted in their patent, that the closely spaced springs were, quote, slavish copies from the standpoint of function of the sign stand described and claimed in the Sartesian patents. Third, that is the form in which they practiced their patent, the closely spaced springs. Kellogg, Singer, Sears, that line of cases gives Traffix Devices and any member of the public the right to copy the patent in the form in which it was practiced. That is critically important to maintain competition. Whether you begin with patent law and the right to copy from an expired patent, or trade dress law and the definition of functionality that focuses on usefulness, is it a useful product figure, you come to the same point. Traffix Devices had the right to copy the MDI sign stand when it came off patent, and it did so. It did so in the way Bonito Boats explains enhances competition, imitation and refinement through imitation by adding an improvement of its own that made a more competitive product better for highway safety departments.
