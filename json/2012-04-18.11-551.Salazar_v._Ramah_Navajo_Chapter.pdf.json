On the one hand, Congress has required the Secretary of the Interior to accept every self-determination contract proposed by an Indian tribe, provided that the contract meets the requirements of the Act, without regard to the total number of contracts into which the Secretary must enter. On the other hand, in every fiscal year since 1994, Congress has enacted an explicit statutory cap on the amount of money that the Secretary may use to pay contract support costs under the ISDA and under those contracts. Now, we think under the circumstances, Congress intended the Secretary to resolve these -- the relationship between these provisions in exactly the way that the Secretary has."

It was undisputed in Cherokee that Congress had appropriated enough money for the unobligated available funds, lawfully available funds, for the Secretary to pay all of the contracts that were at issue. Our argument -- and to be sure, we thought we were right -- our argument was that Congress had in other provisions of the Act allowed us to set aside a certain amount of money that, albeit lawfully available to pay the contracts, we thought we could use to fund the agency's inherent Federal operations.

If you stop the movie at the time the contract was issued, there was sufficient funds to pay that contract. They were lawfully available. We obligated them to the -- to the contractor. And then what happened in Ferris was, after that lawful binding agreement was entered, agency officials decided in their discretion that they'd prefer not to spend the money on that, and they instead built a wharf or something. And what the Court said in Ferris -- and this is -- we're not -- we have no quarrel with this principle -- is that when the funds are lawfully available and you obligate them to a contractor without some contingency, then you can't just decide to spend it on something else. That's a breach. And it's not a defense to the breach that at the end of the -- that at the end, once you've breached the contract, there isn't enough money left in the appropriation to go back and pay them what you should have.

That's Section (1)(c)(iii) of the model agreement that is read into every ISDA contract. They further have the availability under Section (1)(b)(v) of that model agreement to stop at any point if they're worried that there's not going to be enough money, and seek assurances from the Secretary that there will be. Now, as to whether they know and when they know how much money they're going to get, that was the point of the 2006 distribution policy that the Secretary adopted. Under the pro rata system that we used for the first many years, the tribes said, look, we don't know how pro rata is going to work out.

That argument, we think, is baseless for a number of reasons. And just as a factual matter, the GAO has done some studies of this. There are reports in the joint appendix explaining why BIA has not in every year asked for what turned out to be enough money. And that's because these -- this funding is done on a prospective estimated basis. And because we're required to take into -- we are required to accept every contract that comes in the door, BIA may estimate and make its best available estimate, and OMB and the President may accept that if he chooses, but it still may turn out not to be enough."

As I said before, Ferris is about the circumstance in which there are enough available funds in the first instance to pay the contractual obligations.

Now, we think we've performed our promise here because our -- our promise was to pay the sums that Congress made lawfully available.

And then the question is, what do you do with the \"not to exceed\" language. And what I would suggest there is that, that's no different, frankly, from Ferris or any other situation, because what the -- Congress operates against the backdrop of Ferris, which is a 120-plus-year-old doctrine that has been allowed to stay in place by Congress for that entire time. And as the Chamber of Commerce tells us, this is a rule that every contractor takes as an article of faith in dealing with the United States Government."

The language in Ferris is, \"a contractor who is one of several persons to be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable with knowledge of its administration.\" True. Now, Dyk says, in his opinion, that one difference from Ferris is they wrote the idea into the contract, saying you're subject to appropriation to get to make that lawyer chargeable with knowledge. And the second thing in Ferris is that it was an individual who went off on his own in the administration and paid money that he shouldn't have paid. It should have been over here for the contract. In this case, it is an instance where Congress itself required the money to be paid, as it was paid, and didn't provide enough. Okay. So that's where I am with Ferris, which is a big question mark.

I mean, even on a -- so we didn't have an opportunity for any analysis of this. So the reality is, is that from the tribe's perspective, they recognize, because of Ferris, and because of the way the Comptroller General has interpreted Ferris, that they are under a duty to make sure that there is an appropriation that covers this contract, that the amount, purpose, time requirements are all satisfied with enough money to accomplish that. And then, of course, we have the obligation to perform, which, of course, that's the other half of the equation here. And, Justice Sotomayor, that's why I wouldn't say --"

I mean, part of the reason -- I would like to spend a second talking about the comment that, you know, we have this fair and equitable scheme in place in which we're allocating moneys out, when the reality is, is that there is substantial evidence in the record, even though we have not had an opportunity to make a full record, that the -- that the -- that the Bureau makes mistakes in 40 percent of these contractual arrangements. And I know my -- my colleague's going to dispute that, but the truth is we've known that for years. They just make mistakes, and people get impaired -- their contract rights are impaired on that basis. This is not some kind of an equitable scheme that's operating here. There are 12 different regions operating in 12 different ways. Some people get money, some people get 300 percent of theirs, some people get 0 percent of theirs."

And then they have all of the discretion they want -- they want to apply under these circumstances. So, I mean, there's -- obviously, there is a bit of, as we said in the brief, schizophrenia.

And if that means that the scheme operates so as to protect the integrity of the appropriations process and the spending process for a particular year, and prevents us from being able to seek relief outside of this contract support cost appropriation limitation, that makes perfect sense to me, leaving open obviously the availability of the Judgment Fund at the end of the day so that the tribes do not in fact have to bear the full burden of -- of this arrangement as opposed to -- as opposed to anyone else. I mean, that's -- again, we do provide -- we've performed the services. We don't know. We do it in good faith. Under those circumstances, it seems to me that's the classic situation in which we should receive full compensation. If there are no further questions, Your Honor, thank you."

      "speech": "In part, Your Honor. Let me explain. As I mentioned earlier, for the first many years in this scheme, we did a uniform pro rata distribution methodology. The tribes came to us and said, look, that's a problem for us because we don't have any budget transparency; we can't see how much we're going to get. So we adopted this policy in 2006. And one of the principal elements of that policy is that it guarantees that, if -- as long as Congress appropriates as much money as it did in the previous fiscal year, which it generally has, the tribe will get immediately, like within 2 weeks, the exact amount of money that it received in the previous year. And that money comes immediately. They can use it however they want. It's not subject to apportionment. Unlike most Federal agencies, we don't dole it out. They get it right away. Now, the question then becomes what to do with any additional money that Congress has appropriated, and the policy provides for distribution of that money on what we call a bottoms-up basis. We give it to the tribes that are the farthest away from 100 percent of funding. That resolution was negotiated with the tribes and, indeed, with some counsel for Respondents. It's, we think -- and I might be wrong about this -- but we think that that's the solution that the tribes want, if the caps have any effect. There are --"
