In pages 23 through 28 of your appendix, you will find the Kansas jury instructions and Kansas law clearly, on four occasions, instruct individual jurors that they must individually consider all mitigating evidence that they find. Furthermore, the jurors are instructed in five different methods in which they can give that mitigating evidence the effect of a life sentence, and only one manner in which, acting unanimously and after the State has met the highest burden allowed by law in three separate measurements, beyond a reasonable doubt demonstrated that the death sentence is appropriate. Specifically, instruction number 4, paragraph 2 on page 24 of the joint appendix, will show the jurors are instructed that mercy, in and of itself, is a mitigating piece of evidence, and later, in the instruction that lays out the mitigating evidence presented in this specific case, they are told, in paragraph 18 on page 26 of your joint appendix, that mercy, by itself, can be sufficient to warrant a sentence other than death."

The juror is then told how to give the effect that they desire, after the reasoned moral decision, to that mitigating evidence. As defense counsel for Mr. Marsh, in the transcript of the sentencing phase, on page 66, volume 4 -- it is not in your joint appendix, but it is part of the record before the Court -- stated to the jury in closing, \"The practical fact is that each of you will decide whether or not you believe death is the appropriate sentence. And if you decide that death is not the appropriate sentence, you have decided that the mitigators outweigh the aggravators.\" What instruction number 10, which is before you today, which states that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravating factors, is, is guidance to the jury on how they can give the --"

Kansas has a right, as I understand it, to define what it regards as the aggravating circumstances, those that support a death verdict. And Kansas has done so. Kansas is also saying that if a jury cannot find that the aggravators, as we've defined them, outweigh the mitigators -- i.e., if the jury is in equipoise -- the result must be death, anyway. And that does not seem to be a reasoned moral response. I'm assuming that a reasoned moral response would be: the death penalty should be imposed because the aggravators do outweigh -- i.e., it's not equipoise -- the aggravators are heavier.

And the special instruction in Texas said that they could only utilize that evidence to determine whether there was a likelihood of re-offense. And this Court reasoned that it is possible to look at youthfulness as mitigating factor which diminishes the moral culpability of the defendant. There is no claim in this case that the jurors were unable to take the mitigating evidence and give it whatever effect they desired in mitigation. In fact, they are instructed that they must individually consider all such evidence. And then they are instructed to make their decision based upon what effect that they would give it."

There is a statutory requirement of a finding of guilt of capital murder, and that is in very narrow circumstances. Kansas has one of the most narrow death penalties in the Nation. Then once that guilt is determined, we then move to the phase where the State must prove an aggravating factor in addition to having proved that the defendant is guilty of capital murder. Once that is achieved, then the jurors are instructed to give way to a consideration to all aggravating factors that they find, with unanimity, to exist, and to consider all mitigating evidence which they find, individually, to exist, with the only burden on the defendant being relevancy for introduction. And then, they are instructed to consider whether the State has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors.

And if there are no questions on those jurisdictional issues, I will proceed to the merits. To pick up on some of the things that were said during Attorney General Kline's argument, the Eighth Amendment requires reliability in the determination that death is an appropriate sentence. And at the selection stage, the question is whether the jury has made a reliable, collective, responsible decision based upon the unique circumstances of the individual defendant that death is an appropriate sentence and that this defendant is particularly culpable in a way that distinguishes him from the mass of death-eligible defendants. And the problem with the equipoise provision here, which the State agrees can occur under the Kansas statute, is that we don't know from a death verdict pronounced by a jury in Kansas whether the jury did decree death by equipoise or not. Death sentences must be rationally reviewable. And when we look at the -- at a death sentence that's been pronounced in Kansas, we can't determine whether the jury decreed death by equipoise."

So, those statutes are distinguishable, and there's simply no other State that has a statute which mandates death by equipoise. In any event, the Kansas Supreme Court did interpret the statute to contain a mandatory death-by - equipoise provision, which the State's question presented assumes is the case. And the court, familiar with the way the statute has operated, and is likely to operate it in Kansas, found that equipoise can happen, and that it risks unreliability in capital sentencing in a way that's forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. And I think one of the problems here is that the terminology of \"weighing\" conveys a false impression of predefined weights. And the attorney general conceded that that's not how juries consider the balancing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. And we agree with that. And that's why it is wrong to view this as principally a burden-of-proof issue. It's not. The issue, at the selection stage -- the State certainly has the burden to prove an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, but, at the selection stage, the issue is not meeting some particular burden of proof, it's whether the jury has made a reliable, responsible, collective decision that this unique defendant deserves the death penalty that distinguishes him --"

One is that she just can't bear to debate with herself anymore about which one is the better-quality portrait; and so, she becomes agnostic about it and says, \"I give up.

It seems to me they either make a determination that the circumstances of his upbringing, emotional instability outweigh the responsibility for what they had found to be aggravating factors, or they determine that the aggravating factors outweigh the fact that they may show mercy for other basis. I just -- I can see thinking two portraits are indistinguishable. I just don't see a juror functioning and saying, \"I just can't decide whether to show mercy or to convict for death.\" And they're equally balanced. I understand the idea they may debate it with the other jurors, but, to come and say, \"You know, I just can't decide,\" it seems to me that the -- particularly since they can put as much weight into the mitigating factors as they want -- they can say, \"I want to show a lot of mercy,\" they can say, \"I want to show a little bit of mercy\" -- but to say that, \"I want to show just enough mercy that is exactly balanced,\" I don't understand that."

And to go back to Justice Breyer's hypothetical about the box from the last argument, the legislature has determined that the individuals will be separated out as a result of equipoise, but there is nothing about that situation, them being in that box, that separates them from any other generic death- eligible defendant.

And I think those are very real possibilities under this statute. The statute requires death in those situations, and it's the risk that this procedure poses that presents the problem. And this Court has always held that these kinds of risks of unconstitutional results are intolerable in capital cases. And we simply cannot look at a death sentence in Kansas and say, with any reliability at all, that this jury did not decree death by equipoise, that this jury made the reliable sentencing judgment required under the Eighth Amendment at the selection stage.

First, referring to Justice Scalia's question as it relates to other States that are affected, in the joint appendix, pages 98 through 107, you have a summary, and, additionally, in the amici brief that was filed by several States, on page 23, it identifies Arizona, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Missouri as having similar provisions. And, additionally, the cases that have relied on Walton to determine that the equipoise issue has been resolved are the Eleventh Circuit, in Jones v. Dugger, the Arizona Supreme Court. And in State v. Gretzler, they found that the provision provided for equipoise, as well as in Idaho, in State v. Hoffman. As it relates to a juror somehow imposing death when they are undecided, I would direct you to page 26 of the joint appendix, at instruction number 9, which reads, \"The Defendant is entitled to the individual opinion of each juror. Each of you must consider the evidence for the purpose of reaching a verdict. Each of you must decide the case for yourself.\" Furthermore, the jury is instructed, in instruction number 12 in the second paragraph on page 28 of the joint appendix, that, \"In order to reach a verdict in the case, your decision must be unanimous. And then, after reasonable deliberation, if you are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, you shall notify the Court, and the result is a life sentence.\" Kansas law is very clear that death is only appropriate in the singular instance in which a jury has found beyond a reasonable doubt with unanimity that the defendant is guilty of capital murder, that an aggravating factor exists, and then that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors. It was in 1994 that the Kansas Legislature passed the death penalty in Kansas, a few years after the Walton decision. And I was there for the debate, as a legislator. It was a compelling moment, not just because of the result, but the solemnity and seriousness of the debate in which they were seeking to define, through their reasoned moral judgment, what justice demands in instances such as this. And recognizing this Court as the final arbiter of the meaning of the Eighth Amendment, you will see, through pages 23 through 28 of your appendix, your words mirrored back to you.
