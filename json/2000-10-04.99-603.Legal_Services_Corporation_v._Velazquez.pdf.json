Under the Rust v. Sullivan line of cases, it is Congress itself that has the power to decide which policies or programs it will promote. It is not the participants in the program, namely the Legal Services lawyers, the grantees, or even the clients, that have that power. Here -- here, the Government is acting to promote its policy of providing free legal services for certain categories or types of civil representation, and it is the lawyers who are delivering those services. What Congress did not do was create a Legal Services program to promote diverse private expression by Legal Services lawyers around the country. In 1996, in response to criticism in Congress that the Legal Services lawyers had veered off-course from the program's original purpose by participating in politicized and expensive litigations, a compromise appropriations bill was enacted to limit the scope of the kinds of civil representations that would be funded. Specifically, Congress decided not to finance any longer, litigation to amend or otherwise challenge the Federal or State welfare reform system."

In other words, I understand your answer so far, that the Legal Services Corporation lawyer cannot present arguments about existing law.

And at the same time, in the same Congress, Congress said that at the same time that we are providing this responsibility to the States, we are simply not going to pay Federal Legal Services lawyers to get involved in the litigation involving the mosaic and interplay of the Federal and State welfare reform systems, and it made perfect sense."

And it would seem to me that because that's what the policy does here, there would be a good reason for us to say, we should not characterize this as simply the Government paying for services.

But beyond that, what the Legal Services Corporation provided for here is exactly what was provided for in Rust, which was allowing the recipient to set up a separate entity to engage in the activities that could not be engaged in by the recipient itself. The LSC regulations were patterned directly after the regulations in Rust, and --"

But that -- what the Legal Services Corporation did here is consistent with the Regan decision, with League of Women Voters, and most significantly with Rust, in providing for that private expression. But of course, that's to allow for the recipient's private expression, the association's private expression. Here, I think it's also important to bear in mind that the vast majority of the funds, non-LSC funds that are received, are also public funds, the IOLTA funds, the State funds, so we're not talking about an entity that has a large amount of private funds of the sort a typical private association would have."

May Congress choose to provide Federal subsidies to a broad array of private lawyers in order to commit them to represent poor clients in litigation in a particular area of the law, in this case welfare law, but forbid the subsidized lawyers from using the Federal funds to raise any argument in court which seeks to challenge or amend existing law, for the extraordinary sweep that the Legal Services Corporation has conceded that those words are to be given. In short, may Congress condition a subsidy to a lawyer for the poor on an explicit requirement that the subsidized lawyer argue only in favor of enforcing the legal status quo as that is defined by the last regulation to be issued down the legal chain, and not challenging in any way, by raising its constitutionality, its insufficiency to follow statutes, or its inappropriate construction and creation -- yes, sir."

When the Government simply merges its idea of category into the notion of whether or not the Government -- a lawyer for the poor is to be permitted to raise an argument that challenges the Government's own viewpoint about what the law should be, the Government has simply taken and broadened a power of categorization but used it to permit the argument of one side of this question and not the argument of another."

Justice Souter's question I think applies where the activity itself that the Government is funding is so permeated with First Amendment overtones, as this Court has noted.

Of course it's not a public forum, but it's a specialized forum in which the clash of ideas is crucially important, and in which the Government may never be permitted to put its thumb on the scales of those ideas in an effort to use law to control viewpoint, and the viewpoint here is the viewpoint of legality.

    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. It's important to bear in mind that what we have here is what type -- is a question concerning what type of professional services is the Government going to pay for under a Government program which is neither a regulation nor is it a funding restriction that affects private expression of the sort that was involved in NEA. It is funding professional services. I also take substantial issue with respondent's claim that all that Rust covers is Government speech. As the Chief Justice pointed out, Rust itself did not say that, and this Court's subsequent cases have not said that. In the Rosenberger case, for example, in addition to the passage the Chief Justice quoted about using private persons to deliver a message pertaining to the Government's own program, on page 630 -- or 834, the Court further said, it does not follow from the Government speaking -- where the Government itself speaks, that it does not follow that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the university does not itself speak, or subsidized transmittal of a message that it favors, but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers. The dichotomy that was created in Rosenberger was one where the Government is subsidizing essentially a forum where the Government gives money to a forum and asks the private speakers to have at it with one another for the benefit of the public at large, which is different from subsidizing a message the Government favors. Here, although the Legal Services lawyer opposing a State agency may not be advancing the Government's speech, the Government has decided that when it comes to a challenge of a State welfare regulation, that is not a message that the Government favors within the meaning of Rust. And again, NEA and the Wisconsin case last term did not suggest that Rust was limited to situations where it is the Government's own speech. One way in which this case raises even less of a First Amendment question than Rust is the fact that in Rust the doctor was not even permitted to advise the client where other services could be obtained. Under this program, the Legal Services lawyer, if he or she identifies a possible challenge to a statute or regulation, may tell the client that, may refer the client to another agency, to a pro bono list. Every LSC recipient is required to have a private attorney involved in the program with a list of attorneys to whom cases may be referred, so there is no gagging of communications at all. Even though there's no attorney-client relationship, the LSC fund recipient can refer the client. Also, in the context of litigation, to the extent the courtroom is a forum, it's a forum that exists independent of the Legal Services Corporation. What the Legal Services Corporation does is decide what sorts of cases are going to be funded, and there isn't enough money to go around. Congress had to decide how those moneys should be allocated. Lawyers do this all the time. Legal Services recipients do this all the time, in terms of setting their own priorities. With respect to issues concerning challenging the Government's position, one need look no further than sovereign immunity on the State level to the Eleventh Amendment to recognize that there are many situations in which the Government may decline to allow challenges in court to its own positions and, by the same token, Congress could certainly choose not to -- could repeal the Equal Access to Justice Act and not provide attorney's fees to people who want to sue the Government, even though it may provide attorney's fees for suits against private parties. And as we point out in our brief, Congress has provided differential standards for the award of attorney's fees, favoring plaintiffs in certain types of cases like environmental cases or civil rights cases, but not favoring the defendants in those cases. As Justice Scalia pointed out, all litigation has two sides, and in one respect could be viewed as viewpoint, but this Court has never analyzed regulations on attorney conduct or the attorney-client relationship in that way. Also, with respect to the argument that this is an anti-Government -- a prohibition against anti-Government speech, this is -- there's not a monolithic Government here. This statute prohibits an LSC recipient from taking on a case where what she would be doing would be challenging a State regulation as being in violation of Federal law. In other words, it would be a situation where the lawyer might even be trying to vindicate, in her view, what Federal law says on the subject, but still the client is not, or the attorney is not permitted to take that on. Congress could reasonably determine in the allocation of scarce resources that that was a better allocation of the resources."
