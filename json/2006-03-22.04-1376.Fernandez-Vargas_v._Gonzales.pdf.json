Applying it to aliens who reentered before IIRIRA's effective date would give the statute an impermissibly retroactive effect.

Therefore, I think it's unfair to say that the removal of those substantive rights is merely a procedural change. Of course, we don't even get into the question of whether there's a procedural change here, or a substantive change, unless we get to stage two of the Landgraf analysis under the -- under, I would say, either the majority's approach in Landgraf or your approach, Justice Scalia, because the first stage of Landgraf is about this Court's deferring to Congress's specific intent as to the applicability of a statute, because if Congress has decided whether a statute should apply prospectively or retroactively, this Court defers to that, outside of the ex post facto context.

But, more generally, I don't think we need a presumption to win this case. I think that -- under stage one, under an inquiry into congressional intent -- what we have in this case is a history of Congress providing for the reinstatement of deportation that goes back to 1950. In 1950, Congress passed a reinstatement provision that said that for the specified aliens -- and it was only a subgroup -- if they were deported and reentered, they would be -- that their previous deportation order would be reinstated. The INS -- and that statute's quoted at page 2 of the Government's brief -- the INS interpreted that statute as applying only prospectively, and only applying to an alien who was deported, and, therefore, obviously reinstated -- reentering after the effective date of that statute. Now, in 1952, Congress, evidently dissatisfied with an interpretation -- with a reinstatement provision that was only prospective, added the \"before or after\" language to the reinstatement provision. They said, under this 1952 Act, \"If you were deported, either before or after the effective date of the INA, your deportation order can be reinstated.\" But in 1996, Congress removed that \"before or after\" clause. Congress expanded the scope of reinstatement and provided that a much broader category of reentrants could be subject to reinstatement."

What we don't understand is how the Government thinks that helps its case, because the obvious and necessary consequence of that is that the removal of the \"before or after\" clause in 1996 must imply that the 1996 provision only is triggered by post-enactment deportations."

The Government's primary comparison -- and I think it's an important one for this Court to focus on -- is to the criminal reinstatement provision, which is section 1326 -- 8 U.S.C. at 1326. Now, the Government asserts that that provision is exclusively prospective, and, therefore, that the comparison should be that, in this context, the reinstatement provision must be retroactive. But, in so arguing, the Government hides, in ellipses in its brief, on page 14, the actual text of the provision of the criminal -- the temporal applicability of the criminal reentry provision. What Congress actually said was that deportations that predate IIRIRA could trigger reinstatement, but reentries post- -- only reentries post-dating IIRIRA could trigger it. So, in fact, what Congress was doing in the criminal context was reaching back and saying, \"We're changing the consequences of pre-enactment deportations, but not pre-enactment reentry.\" So, the comparison, if anything, I think, strengthens our case.

It would have been about this Act. And, in fact, the Senate proposal to modify the first -- the provision also would have left it in terms of this Act, not of a specific date of 1952, which would have been the INA date. More generally, I think that with this history of the 1950 Act, the 1952 Act, and the 1996 Act, any interpretation of the 1996 Act as being retroactive, or as being ambiguously retroactive, doesn't pay adequate deference to Congress's choice over time that this Act should apply prospectively in 1996."

      "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1231(a)(5) aims to streamline the removal of aliens who were already removed but have since illegally reentered. The Congress that enacted IIRIRA did not intend to grandfather the provision and exempt those aliens who are already in the country illegally. Rather, the focus on streamlining the rules for getting illegal reentrants out of the country is fully applicable, and, indeed, is especially applicable to illegal reentrants who were already in the country at the time of IIRIRA's enactment. Three considerations, I think, point to the conclusion that section 1231(a)(5) is addressed to removing illegal reentrants from the country, including aliens who are already in the country, and that the provision is not so much addressed to the antecedent act of illegal reentry, as such. The first consideration I would point to is the operation of the provision. And it's useful to bear in mind the following possible scenario in which a person, who's been removed, illegally reenters the country, but then returns to his home country. Now, in that situation the individual would have engaged in the act of illegal reentry, but section 1231(a)(5) simply would have no relevance to him whatsoever, because what section 1231(a)(5) seeks to do is to remove someone who's found in the country on the basis of their previous removal order. Now, if they have engaged in the act of illegal reentry, but then have gone back, section 1231(a)(5) simply is not relevant. And I think that goes to show that what the statute is focused on is not the act of illegal reentry, as such, but, rather, removing someone who's found in the country and who's determined to be an illegal reentrant. Now, that operation stands in significant contrast to the criminal prohibition against illegal reentry, which is at 8 U.S.C. 1326, and the prohibition against illegal entry, which is 8 U.S.C. 1325. With respect to both of those provisions, the act of illegal reentry, or the act of illegal entry, necessarily triggers the operation of the criminal prohibition, and there's nothing that the alien can do after the fact to take himself outside of the -- of the purview of that criminal --"

      "speech": "That's right. Congress specifically indicated, in the text of IIRIRA, that it's -- it understood the distinction between the way in which those provisions operate and the way that 1231(a)(5) operates. The IIRIRA expanded the scope of the criminal prohibition on an illegal reentry, and it also, for the first time, imposed civil monetary penalties on the act of illegal entry. There were civil fines, and then -- I think, $50 to $250 per episode. But what's critical is that with respect to both of those changes, Congress specified, in the terms of IIRIRA, that they would only apply, on a prospective basis, to acts of illegal entry or reentry that post - dated IIRIRA. Now, Congress made no such specification with respect to 1231(a)(5), and I think that's significant, because what that indicates is that Congress understood that that provision, unlike the two criminal -- unlike the two criminal provisions, focuses not on the act of illegal reentry, as such, but rather --"

      "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
      "speech": "That's right. Which is different, obviously, from the operation of section 1231(a)(5). Now, another consideration that I think indicates that section 1231(a)(5) is focused on the timing of the removal, as opposed to the timing of reentry, is to take into account section 1231(a)(5) in the context of Section 1231 as a whole. Section 1231 was a new provision that was enacted by IIRIRA, and Congress entitled it, quote, \"Detention and Removal of Aliens Ordered Removed,\" close quote. And, as its title indicates, the provisions in section 1231, like 1231(a)(5), all pertain to executing an order of removal against an alien who's been ordered removed. For example, those provisions concern the time period within which somebody is to be removed. They address the travel of somebody to the removal destination, the identification of the countries to which they may be removed, the payment of expenses. But all of them address the execution of an order of removal in the same way that section 1231(a)(5) does. Section 1231(a)(5) speaks to the execution of the pre-existing order of removal, the one that the alien had in place when he illegally reentered the country, but it's of a piece with those other provisions, in the sense that it, like them, addresses the timing of removal rather than speaking to the act of illegal reentry, as such. The third consideration, I think, that points to the same conclusion, which is that Congress was focused prospectively on removals that postdated IIRIRA, rather than retrospectively, in some sense, on acts of illegal reentry that predated IIRIRA, is that at the time of illegal reentry, as we explain in -- at length in our brief, an alien would have had no eligibility, as a categorical matter, and at least as a practical matter, for the three types of relief that Petitioner invokes. And those three types of relief are adjustment of status, suspension of deportation, and voluntary departure. Now, with respect to adjustment of status, as the colloquy earlier indicated, at the time that Petitioner illegally reentered the country in 1981, up until 1994, which was just 2 years before IIRIRA, adjustment of status was categorically unavailable to illegal entrants and illegal reentrants. In that light, it's -- one would be hard-pressed to assert that an illegal reentrant would have performed that act in reasonable reliance on the availability of adjustment of status. It was simply --"

You can stay.\" Now, after the Act is passed, all those relevant actions have taken place in '86, long before. Now, there's absolutely nothing they can do. All they can do is go home. And now I've learned that when they go home, they will be told, \"You cannot come back, no matter what, for 5 years.\" Now, that's a pretty harsh consequence, to separate yourself from your family or have your family come to a foreign country. So, if I think the first part of this is a wash, you have a great argument, they have a great argument, and I look to the second part, does it attach new consequences to old and unchangeable behavior?

Now, it's true that if he had been removed, then there would have been the consequence, in the sense that there would be a period of inadmissibility, at least presumptive inadmissibility, a period, which, by the way, is subject to waiver, which he could apply for. But if he had just gone back voluntarily after IIRIRA's enactment, or, indeed, in the 6-month window between IIRIRA's enactment and IIRIRA's effective date, my understanding is that there would have been no presumptive period of inadmissibility."

      "speaker": "SRINIVASAN",
      "speech": "-- the idea was -- I think what the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize was that adjustment of status was categorically unavailable to somebody who illegally reentered before IIRIRA, at least before 1994. And what Judge McConnell presumed was that it would have been available. And his point was that even if it would have been available, it's farfetched to think that somebody would have thought not only about coming into the country, but coming into the country and then meeting a United States citizen, and become married to the United States citizen, and using that as sort of a reliance basis for not applying the law retroactively to somebody who had come in beforehand. But I think that was based on a misimpression about the availability of adjustment of status. Now, I'd like to address, briefly, if I could, the argument at step one of the Landgraf inquiry concerning the negative inference the Petitioner seeks to draw from the \"before or after\" clause -- so-called \"before or after\" clause. And the two provisions can be compared side by side at pages 2 and 3 of the Government's brief, and that's in the body of the Government's brief. The fundamental flaw with the argument at step one is that the \"before or after\" clause in the old provision, which is at the bottom of page 2, referred, by terms, to the date of the INA's enactment. Now, what we've reflected is the codified version, which refers specifically to the date of June 27 of 1952. But even the INA itself referred to the date of the enactment of this Act, which can only be seen to refer to the INA itself. So, if this language had been carried forward in section 1231(a)(5), it still would have been a reference to the date of the enactment of the INA. So, it would refer to somebody who was deported before or after 1952. Now, I think, as Justice Alito suggested, the probable reason that Congress decided not to carry forward this language is because the question of whether someone was deported before or after 1952 doesn't have a great deal of practical significance at this point in time. But whatever one might think was the actual reason for Congress's failing to carry forward the language, I don't think that you can draw any negative inference from Congress's failure to carry forward that language, at least certainly not the negative inference that Petitioner wants to draw. In fact, the negative inference that one would draw, if one were going to do so, is that the section 1231(a)(5) applies only to people who were deported initially after 1952. But that sort of negative inference wouldn't be of much assistance to Petitioner, or any other person, for that matter, that illegally reentered before IIRIRA, at least as a practical matter, because everybody, I think, in that category, would have illegally reentered -- or would have been deported after 1952, rather."

I have -- nobody thinks that they would leave in June 27, 1952, but why wouldn't they have substituted, for that, the date of this new legislation, the date of IIRIRA?
