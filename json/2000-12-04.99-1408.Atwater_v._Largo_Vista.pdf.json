      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Reasonableness is the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment. The court of appeals below, however, announced a broad new rule that permits custodial arrest for any offense committed in an officer's presence regardless of the nature of that offense. The court of appeals in doing so ignores the Fourth Amendment's requirement of reasonableness. First, it ignores the fact that a common law at the time of the Fourth Amendment's adoption such an arrest would not have been layoff."

I mean if Texas law had authorized a custodial arrest for this, wouldn't your case be different? If you conceded that it authorized it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DE CARLI",
      "speech": "No, Your Honor, because it is our position that the Fourth Amendment restricts the use of custodial arrest for minor offenses such as this. If Texas were to increase the penalty for this offense, then it would be a different balancing."

Two, however, this Court -- we're well aware of this Court's respect for warrants and the fact that interjecting a neutral and detached magistrate operates as a check. However, the fact is, by requiring a warrant, still that would only require probable cause and it's our position that probable cause does not sufficiently balance the competing interest, although I concede it's a much, it would be a much weaker argument --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "See, my problem is with your common law argument because the Fourth Amendment does not contain a warrant requirement, it just says if you do have, get a warrant, it has to be based upon probable cause, blah, blah, blah, blah, but the only root requirement of the Fourth Amendment is that the arrest be reasonable. You're telling me that you could do arrests at common law, so long -- at least so long as there was a warrant."

      "speech": "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and for that reason I'm willing to concede that if a warrant were obtained, this arrest still would be reasonable. Our position is that probable cause, although it works as a balancing of the competing interest of law enforcement and the individual in some instances, in the setting before the court and in most traffic offenses, it does nothing to balance the competing interest of the individual."

So I would still, we would still argue it would be reasonable, because some of those offenses driving intoxicated and reckless driving amount, in essence, to breaches of the peace, they are by their nature violent, they impose a threat.

Ms. Atwater was helped into the police car. What that leads to is it's distinguishing between the degrees of the custodial arrest, even though once that person is removed from the scene, the safety of their car, once under custodial arrest, their life -- or excuse me, their liberty and property interests are completely forfeited."

      "speaker": "DE CARLI",

First, in that instance, probable cause, if the arrest were based on alleged child endangerment there probable cause would act as a restraint because the police officer to justify the arrest would have to establish a certain degree of certainty that the specific conduct was child endangerment. Now, this was not child endangerment for several reasons, one, the legislature has imposed an extremely minimal penalty, two, it's not child endangerment because you are set -- by virtue of the fact that if we were to call this child endangerment then not using your turn signal or perhaps speeding or running a red light, those are just as close to any possible harm as not wearing a seat belt. There's a causation problem, in other words. And most importantly is that by, if we truly are concerned about the welfare of the children, then arresting the mother and taking the mother away is inflicting a far greater harm on those children, and it's doing --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

They say to the police officer, look, if somebody commits a crime in your presence you can arrest them. But you can't use -- do an unusual thing, you know, you can't use excessive force, et cetera, but as long as you behave in a normal manner, crime, you see it, arrest them.

One of the things that I would like to know more about if we have to engage in a reasonableness determination here in setting a standard, is how bad the problem is out there. And one of the things that I know both, I forget whether it's from your brief or from the brief on the other side, in a number of jurisdictions in which arrests for misdemeanors without any distinction, and arrests for even the more minor offenses, some states called them violations, the sub-misdemeanor, but technically criminal offenses, is permitted without warrant if committed in the officer's presence. And the commonness of the practice leads me to question how many horrible cases like this one are there out there? Are we faced with a case in which the facts indeed are about as good for you as I think, you know, they could be, but are we, by the same token, faced with a case which is very rare and should not be the basis for constitutionalizing a general rule?

Or if we call it a breach of the peace. Or if we draw a distinction between fine only and jailable, lines can be drawn. That's one point.

And I want this Court to pay particular attention to the Texas statutory scheme, because the Texas statutory scheme is remarkable in that in traffic violations particularly, as opposed to other kinds of violations, it provides very explicitly that once an officer makes the decision to arrest, as opposed to giving a citation, that officer must immediately and the word in the statute is immediately, take the accused before the nearest magistrate and to have that magistrate determine whether or not the person should have to put up a bond or be released on their own recognizance. That system is exactly the system that is in my opinion specifically authorized by this Court's opinion in U.S. v. Watson, if you read the specific footnote 11 in that opinion, that is the specific kind of procedure that was authorized by this Court. It has the advantages that is the tradition in this country, at least since we've had automobiles, that in rural Texas, where I'm from, the fact that you get -- run a red light in El Paso, and you're from Brady, doesn't -- the people in El Paso are somewhat concerned that they'll ever see you again.

There's got to be some reason, any reason, as long as it's plausible and relates to the problem. And the reason there is obvious the guy may not show up to pay the fine."

This Court has rejected the notion that there must be some second reason based on some mini-trial based on the facts presented as to whether or not that decision of that tree to bring into custody is appropriate. All three options to a police officer are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The first is to issue a warning, whether it be in writing or oral. Second, to actually arrest and bring into custody, or third to issue a citation instead of actually engaging in a full custodial arrest. This Court has taught us that all three options are equally reasonable under the floor, the minimum guidelines and protections that the Fourth Amendment and the federal constitution give, and then it becomes a matter of policy."

Indeed, if arguing whether or not the state governmental interest is one that should be given credence by this Court, the state of Texas has spoken in the statute, even though the statute in question, the seat belt offense law does not provide for punishment in the form of jail time. They have likewise determined that it is appropriate to have a full custodial arrest in order to enforce the government's interest in that particular law. Therefore, that jurisdiction has made that policy choice. Those policy choices are subject to political accountability."

      "speech": "The traffic rules of the road is a certain codification of state law that includes seat belt offenses and there is a statute in Texas on the books that says for any offense in this traffic code, full custodial arrest is appropriate, save two exceptions, one is for speeding, and two is for the open container law which were the results of political judgments made in the local jurisdiction. Other states have decided that in certain circumstances they will allow the issuances of citation rather than a full custodial arrest based on the circumstances presented to that officer, and he has that discretion to make that judgment call. But if he picks wrong in the view of the folks that have to review it later, in other words, we don't think he made the best decision among all of his options, so long as those options are equally reasonable under the Federal Constitution, then that mistake does not drive a constitutional decision of reasonableness because you can't put that in front of the decision. And so, whereas here, the commission of an offense witnessed personally by the police officer gives rise to probable cause then the constitutional inquiry ends and the policy judgments and decisions will begin. And that's why it would be unworkable as this Court in several questions has asked whether or not we can draw lines between fine only and jailable time. In fact, in Welsh v. Wisconsin, one of those offenses in that case was for DWI, but under that jurisdiction's law it was only for jail -- for a fine. Similarly, in United States v. Watson, when dealing with the Prohibition cases, that particular, actually -- Carroll v. United States, that particular case dealt with bootlegging, and that was a misdemeanor fine-only offense. You cannot determine the constitutional question based on the penalty that is associated with a crime, but rather based on whether or not there is an offense for the specific facts that have occurred. If we let the penalty --"

Those extra protections are for the state's to decide. But the minimum guarantees of liberty in the Fourth Amendment are for this Court to decide, and I would submit that this Court has made it very clear that the decision must be pledged and looked to in terms of probable cause."

One hypothetical suggestion could simply be that the Federal courts would be well-equipped to know the differences between the Federal constitutional floor and the policy ceiling lights that the states may accord on situations such as this. But clearly whereas here probable cause existed, then there was no constitutional infirmity, and this Court has rejected time and time again in Berkimer, and in United States v. Robinson and other cases, that we cannot allow the punishment rather than the conduct to give rise to the constitutional infirmity or lack thereof, because otherwise we're going to have conduct which in one state will result in an unconstitutional situation, and in other state a constitutional one. And we cannot have a rule which differs all fifty jurisdictions."

      "speaker": "TAYLOR",
      "speech": "Yes, in certain circumstances a warrantless arrest would not be appropriate because there's not probable cause. But that's the touchstone. If there's probable cause, then the arrest is appropriate in all circumstances. In Wren v. United States, this unanimous Court held that the balancing test of the government and the individual is when a probable cause exists always tipped in the constitutional scale for the government. And then only in extraordinary circumstances like warrantless intrusions into homes or serious bodily injure or deadly force do we then have any additional concerns. In Knowles v. Iowa this Court made clear that what carried the day in that case was that they hadn't actually arrested the individual. I understand Mr. Chief Justice my time is up."

      "speaker": "DE CARLI",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: What is interesting about this case as some members of this Court have pointed out, is respondents do not defend the reasonableness of the conduct of the officer in question here, instead they attack the workability of potential rules and raise -- and allege that this is not a recurring problem. Two points -- well, a third point also they characterize decisions of this Court far beyond their holdings. The first point, the reoccurrence problem, since certiorari has been taken by this case and I know this is anecdotal, we have received call after call of problems of this sort and to limit it to publically reported incidents, just within the past month, before this argument, a DPS officer arrested a passenger in a vehicle, the passenger was a 17-year-old boy with his mother, and that boy then -- the officer asked the boy, do you have ID? Well that boy lived in a small town that did not have driver's ed. He had no driver's license, so that was then used as a justification for arrest. The arrest presumably would be one that would not be treated as a brief one. He spent the night in jail in a holding cell with crack dealers and people accused of violent crimes. I submit that it is a recurring problem and perhaps more on point, if the conduct in this case is condoned, it will be much more likely to be a recurring problem. Secondly, boundaries, Judge Weiner's boundary as some members of the Court have suggested is just as workable as the Terry boundary. It's not going to require a new volume of any treatise -- for one thing it's already a couple pages in Blackstone, which has been around for some time. It's just going to be a footnote. But under either standard, no matter what the standard is, if it's reliance on the probable cause, or, excuse me, reliance on the common law rule or a balancing of the competing interests or any of the rules proposed by petitioners amici, petitioners win. This was unreasonable. And that leads to the fact that again they have offered no explanation for why this arrest furthered any legitimate law enforcement interest. Finally, probable cause as the touchstone, I have not, I admit I have not read every Fourth Amendment decision that this Court has written. However, I have never come across a decision saying that probable cause and not reasonableness is the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment. And no decisions have held that anything other than a public felony arrest -- thank you."
