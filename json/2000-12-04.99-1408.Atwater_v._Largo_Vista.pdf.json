    "speech": "Well, why would the common law be involved here Mr. De Carli if Texas law says otherwise?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, the common law should be considered because it is our position that the Fourth Amendment incorporates the protections, the position that the Fourth Amendment restricts the use of custodial arrest for minor offenses such as this.  If Texas were to increase the penalty for this offense, then it would be a different balancing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Even with a warrant you couldn't do a custodial arrest?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "No, but let me qualify that.  It would be a much weaker argument, one we would lose the common law argument.  Two, however, this Court -- we're well aware of this Court's respect for warrants and the fact that interjecting a neutral and detached magistrate operates as a check. However, the fact is, by requiring a warrant, still that would only require probable cause and it's our position that probable cause does not sufficiently balance the competing interest, although I concede it's a much, it would be a much weaker argument -- and for that reason we say --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why would a warrant make it more reasonable?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Because, Your Honor, it would interject a neutral and detached magistrate who we would hope would say Officer Turek, why are you arresting this woman for not wearing a seat belt? Why do we not issue a summons.  Why not issue just a traffic citation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would that be a magistrate's prerogative ordinarily?  Isn't it a magistrate's prerogative to find probable cause."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and for that reason I'm willing to concede that if a warrant were obtained, this arrest still would be reasonable.  Our position is that probable cause, although it works as a balancing of the competing interest of law enforcement and possible endangerment of children that the state can say, okay, custody here is required, this person just won't cooperate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Justice O'Connor, I believe that time would come when, if I understand you correctly, you're alluding to nonappearances, the repeat offender."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it's possible that a nonappearance could amount to something that generates jail time, but I'm just talking about the repeat offender."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Without an offense that requires jail time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Without the nonappearance problem.  What that raises is it's the distinction between punishment and enforcement.  Punishing the repeat offender is not the role of the police officer, that's the role for is that sufficient to justify the intrusion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I notice that Judge Weiner in the case below had a suggested approach, a different approach, that when there's a plausible articulable reason for affecting such an intrusion, it's lawful."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, and I read that as trying to encompass what this Court in its opinion issued last week referred to as vehicular-bound imminent threats to life and limb which would be driving while intoxicated, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Oh, presumably that can generate jail time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "In some cases.  In most cases, however, I believe that in some jurisdictions still first offense drunk driving there is no jail time.  So I would would be a closer question, but I would still defer to the fact that if the legislature has not increased, has not provided for heightened penalties, for repeat offenders, repeat nonuse of seat belts, that still it is not that limited category of offenses that impose an imminent threat to life and limb on the road."

    "speech": "When you say -- go ahead --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Suppose in this case the driver was from another state, could there have been an arrest made."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, and let me explain why.  One, states have already provided for that kind of situation in the uniform violator compact act where if somebody does not appear, then their license can be revoked in that other state."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So the risk of nonappearance is not part of the balance that you want the police officer to -- you a police escort to the station where you pay your fine?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's sort of an old tradition in some of our states."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Well, it depends -- the problem with that approach is it leads to, and in part what respondents, respondents have implicitly made this argument that this was a brief arrest. Ms. Atwater was helped into the police car.  What that leads to is it's distinguishing between the degrees of the custodial arrest, even though once that person is removed from the scene, the safety of their car, once under custodial context of the law of arrest referred to a group of offenses that either involved violence or the type of conduct that would incite immediate violence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The opposing briefs suggest differently.  But I recognize also that your briefs also have supporting authority.  I'm just not sure whether that's too happy a distinction.  What should turn on breach of the peace which is basically a common law concept."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that if we look to, again the decision of last week, and other decisions of this Court, Delaware v. Prous, I guess Sitz would be an example, there are certain offenses, in the context of the traffic offenses where by their very nature they impose a grave risk of harm to others on the road. vacillation is in -- we proposed a rule, in looking back at that, I now wonder, well, perhaps the correct approach would be to rely exclusively on the common law.  The common law provided a clear boundary, breach of the peace, nonbreach of the peace and felonies."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The common law as of what date."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "As of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment which would be 1791."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What is your answer to the Chief Justice's question, yes or no."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What do you make of the nightwalker statute argument that at the same period in which you're arguing there was at least a threshold of immunity set here, it was clear in English law that nightwalkers who a felon, even that he intended to commit a felony, is that what you mean?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Well that the person may have committed a felon or they were up to no good. Nobody walking about in the dead of the night in the 17th century was doing anything other than contemplating criminal acts. I think at the -- that's the way I understand the nightwalker statute."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You answered the Chief Justice's question that if the state had said we regard not buckling up as very serious, therefore 10 days in jail, then you would have no case to complain about a custodial arrest"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "If the line is drawn not based on the common law but as we had proposed in our brief the jailable versus fine only distinction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Now here in this very case, could the officer have said, child endangerment is a felony, so it's not simply the misdemeanor of not buckling up, but you've put your children in danger and therefore the offense is child endangerment which is a felony."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Several responses to that Justice Ginsburg.  First, in that instance, probable cause, if the arrest were based on alleged child endangerment there probable cause would act as a restraint because the police officer to justify the arrest would have to establish a certain degree of certainty that the specific conduct was child endangerment.  Now, this was not child endangerment for several reasons, one, the legislature has imposed an mother and taking the mother away is inflicting a far greater harm on those children, and it's doing --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, the facts here are very unattractive.  I mean one doesn't like to think that a mother is going to be stopped for not wearing a seat belt and have her children in tears in the car while the mother is hauled off to jail.  You've got the perfect case."
  },

    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "We'd like to think so Justice O'Connor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But I think what we're concerned with is the broader rule because it has millions of permutations and applications across the country.  And conceivably the Fourth Amendment at bottom does always require a kind of reasonableness test, and that's why I thought Judge Weiner's approach might make a little sense here. arrest them.  But you can't use -- do an unusual thing, you know, you can't use excessive force, et cetera, but as long as you behave in a normal manner, crime, you see it, arrest them. Anyone can understand that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And the problem with your side and the people who are supporting it is are they coming up with something that works?  I mean, a policeman isn't going to know the common law or breaches of the peace.  A police -- they're just not going to understand that.  So is there some kind of practical alternative to this simple rule which has in it a way of catching abuses through the nonnormal behavior."

    "speaker": "DE CARLI",

    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "It's -- Justice Scalia, I think the reason why it's, I mean if we're looking for a bright line rule, the problem that permitting a custodial arrest in that situation would lead to is, if we say, okay, out-of-state person, he's not going to come back to Wyoming, high risk, if you allow the arrest, then what that means is the person is potentially held in custody before a probable cause --"

But isn't it almost certain that this Officer Turek would have qualified immunity given -- how could one say that the law was clearly established given the division among the Federal judges."

    "speaker": "DE CARLI",
    "speech": "I have three responses to that, Justice Ginsburg.  First, the Fifth Circuit clearly did not address that issue, the en bloc majority.  They explicitly refrained from making that determination.  But second, even though, yes, it is conceivably -- it would be a tough hurdle to overcome with regard to Officer Turek. However the city still is in the lawsuit and Judge --"

And the commonness of the practice leads me to question how many horrible cases like this one are there out there?  Are we faced with a case in which the facts indeed are about as good for you as I think, you know, they could be, but are we, by the same token, faced with a case which is very rare and should not be the basis for constitutionalizing a general rule?  How big is the problem."

That system is exactly the system that is in my opinion specifically authorized by this Court's opinion in U.S. v. Watson, if you read the specific footnote 11 in that opinion, that is the specific kind of procedure that was authorized by this Court. It has the advantages that is the tradition in this country, at least since we've had automobiles, that in rural Texas, where I'm from, the fact that you get -- run a red light in El Paso, and you're from Brady, doesn't -- the people in El Paso are somewhat concerned that they'll ever see you again.  It's a little easier to do something about it in today's world of computers and the reason there is obvious the guy may not show up to pay the fine."

But felony/misdemeanor falls into the problem that different states define misdemeanor differently and it's so complicated nobody understands it.  All right.  So that's why I asked the rule that's been suggested by others, it's not mine originally, that if it's punishable by a fine only that's where Justice O'Connor's principle kicks in.  Now, what and unreasonable.  I thought your argument was based on the fact that this has never been understood to be the constitutional rule. There has always been authority for the -- for policemen to conduct arrests of this sort."

But why should the benefit of the doubt be given to the officer? Why should the burden of uncertainty, if we're going to draw a line, be a burden that falls on the police rather than -- a burden that falls on the citizen rather than on the police?  Why would she make that choice?"

    "speaker": "GEORGE",

I don't believe -- I think there is immunity both for the city and for the individuals here as a matter of law.  I grant you that the please the Court: This Court's teachings has been clear that warrantless arrests of traffic offenders based on probable cause is reasonable, and is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment.  The court has taught us that in Robinson, in Gustafson, in Wren, and in Knowles, because the question from the constitutional perspective is whether or not probable cause to believe an arrest under that local law has occurred, and once that is met, then all the other questions become policy judgments that the 50 states should decide."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let me suggest this, again, going back to, as you can guess, I'm rather intrigued with the descending standard.  Basically the descending standard is, if the decision to make a custodial arrest rather than citation is wholly arbitrary, if there's no plausible custodial arrest, but likewise you're entitled for a temporary detention for the purpose of administrating the paperwork so that this individual can be booked and then released once a probable cause determination has been made by a magistrate.  This Court has rejected the notion that there must be some second reason based on some mini-trial based on the facts presented as to whether or not that decision of that tree to bring into custody is appropriate. All three options to a police officer are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  The first is to issue a warning, whether it be in writing or oral. Second, to actually arrest and bring into custody, or third to issue a citation instead of actually engaging in a full custodial arrest.  This Court has taught us that all three options are equally reasonable under the floor, the different states have approached it in different ways.  As you will note some of the amici here have said that it's appropriate under state law to engage in a full custodial arrest.  Indeed, if arguing whether or not the state governmental interest is one that should be given credence by this Court, the state of Texas has spoken in the statute, even though the statute in question, the seat belt offense law does not provide for punishment in the form of jail time.  They have likewise determined that it is appropriate to have a full custodial arrest in order to enforce the government's interest in that particular law. Therefore, that jurisdiction has made that policy choice. Those policy choices are subject to political accountability."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's set forth specifically in the seat belt law? circumstances they will allow the issuances of citation rather than a full custodial arrest based on the circumstances presented to that officer, and he has that discretion to make that judgment call.  But if he picks wrong in the view of the folks that have to review it later, in other words, we don't think he made the best decision among all of his options, so long as those options are equally reasonable under the Federal Constitution, then that mistake does not drive a constitutional decision of reasonableness because you can't put that in front of the decision. And so, whereas here, the commission of an offense witnessed personally by the police officer gives rise to probable cause then the constitutional inquiry ends and the policy judgments and decisions will begin. And that's why it would be unworkable as this constitutional question based on the penalty that is associated with a crime, but rather based on whether or not there is an offense for the specific facts that have occurred.  If we let the penalty --"

One hypothetical suggestion could simply be that the Federal courts would be well-equipped to know the differences between the Federal constitutional floor and the policy ceiling lights that the states may accord on situations such as this.  But clearly whereas here probable cause existed, then there was no constitutional infirmity, and this Court has felony/misdemeanor distinction.  Felonies differ, some states classify them as misdemeanors, some classify certain offenses as felonies.  It depends -- on your theory, that would make a difference in whether there could be an arrest without a warrant."

    "speaker": "TAYLOR",
    "speech": "Yes, in certain circumstances a warrantless arrest would not be appropriate because there's not probable cause.  But that's the touchstone. If there's probable cause, then the arrest is appropriate in all circumstances.  In Wren v. United States, this unanimous Court held that the balancing test of the government and the individual is when a probable cause exists always tipped in the constitutional scale for the government.  And then only in extraordinary circumstances like warrantless intrusions into homes or serious bodily injure or deadly force do we then have any additional the Court: What is interesting about this case as some members of this Court have pointed out, is respondents do not defend the reasonableness of the conduct of the officer in question here, instead they attack the workability of potential rules and raise -- and allege that this is not a recurring problem. Two points -- well, a third point also they characterize decisions of this Court far beyond their holdings.  The first point, the reoccurrence problem, since certiorari has been taken by this case and I know this is anecdotal, we have received call after call of problems of this sort and to limit it to publically reported incidents, just within the past month, before this argument, a DPS officer arrested a passenger in a vehicle, the passenger was a 17-year-old boy with his mother, and that boy then -- the officer problem. Secondly, boundaries, Judge Weiner's boundary as some members of the Court have suggested is just as workable as the Terry boundary.  It's not going to require a new volume of any treatise -- for one thing it's already a couple pages in Blackstone, which has been around for some time.  It's just going to be a footnote.  But under either standard, no matter what the standard is, if it's reliance on the probable cause, or, excuse me, reliance on the common law rule or a balancing of the competing interests or any of the rules proposed by petitioners amici, petitioners win.  This was unreasonable.  And that leads to the fact that again they have offered no explanation for why this arrest furthered any legitimate law enforcement interest. Finally, probable cause as the touchstone, I"
