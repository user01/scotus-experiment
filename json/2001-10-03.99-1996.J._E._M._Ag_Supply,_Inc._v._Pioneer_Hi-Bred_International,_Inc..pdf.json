The patents in this case that have been issued on plant varieties under section 101 of title 35 are invalid. They're invalid because Congress has enacted a specific statutory scheme that it crafted to govern Federal statutory protection over this particular type of living thing, plant varieties. The enactment of Congress by this specific statutory scheme that it designed to provide the Federal right to exclude others from reproducing plant varieties evidences Congress' intent that it plant-specific Federal statutory scheme is intended to provide the exclusive Federal statutory means of excluding others from reproducing plant varieties."

Now, this -- the statute is designed for particular types of plants that require the ability to sexually reproduce on a large scale in order to be commercially valuable, and these are plants that are only valuable if they can be produced commercially by seed. Now, the -- the corn plants at issue in this case -- the patents seek to protect the same utilitarian feature or attribute of these corn plants, and that is the right to sexually multiply -- exclude others from sexually multiplying these corn plants."

And another crucial exception is the research exception because by the -- the use of patents, the free exchange of plant genetic material which had occurred prior to the use of patents, is prohibited by patents because the seed companies now contend that under the patent statute, since there's no research exemption, then they can lock up the genes of the plant varieties on which they have obtained patents.

Now, there were two reasons why, as Justice Ginsburg points out, there was some historic -- there was some historic feeling against patents on plants. It was a living thing, a product of nature doctrine, written description. It relaxed the written description in 4888. If the language that Thomas Jefferson penned in 1793, which is the definitional language for utility patents -- and he was a plant breeder, knew what plants were -- if that language already subsumed plants, then the only thing that Congress needed to do in 1930 was to add section 4888. And if it decided that it wanted to somehow -- if -- if the language that -- that Thomas Jefferson penned included plants in 1930 and it included sexual multiplication of plants and they wanted to limit it, then they could have just put in the asexual limitation. But what they did is, they put in all three sections in 1930 because it was their intent to expand the definitional limits of section 4886, which was the definitional language that Thomas Jefferson originally wrote."

It simply remains the case that under the PPA, this is a -- the PPA deals with a -- with a plant insofar as it is a non-sexually reproducing or a non-sexually reproduced -- and I think that's the -- the fact that the Court had before it in Chakrabarty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "speech": "Well, in Chakrabarty, Justice Souter, the dissent argued that the existence of the plant-specific acts evidenced Congress' intent that no living thing could be subject to a 101 patent. The majority, 5 to 4, the tie-breaking vote said, that's not true. It -- it doesn't mean that the mere fact that something is living denies that item potential or possible section 101 -- a section 101 patent. And it -- it discussed these plant-specific acts. Then in the last paragraph of Chakrabarty, it tells us the two ways in which Congress can evidence its intent to exclude a specific type of living thing from section 101 coverage. It says, one, it can just -- it could explicitly do -- it can explicitly state that carve- out, and it used the carve-out of patenting of materials that could be employed in nuclear weapons as an example of a specific carve-out. And then it said secondly it can craft a specific statute designed to provide protection for a particular type of living organism. And in that -- in this case, that -- in the case of the PVP and the PPA, that is plant varieties. And Justice Rich stated this explicitly in the underlying opinion, Application of Bergy, which the Chakrabarty Court, of course, read and -- and was aware of when it wrote this paragraph. Justice -- or Judge Giles quoted this -- this piece of legislative history where the Senator said, anything under the sun that is made by man. It is this piece of legislative history that Pioneer's case is built upon. That's the foundation."

Because the problem that I -- I have is it seems to me that on -- on just the authorities that you're speaking of, Chakrabarty probably should have come out the other way because you had a specific statute, the PPA, which covered this asexually reproducing plant, a bacterium, and yet the Court did not say that the coverage of 101 was thereby defeated.

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So, you're telling me they did have the dual protection, but either they chose not to charge you with -- with infringing on the PVP protection or you didn't do anything that would infringe that protection."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "speech": "We -- we didn't do anything to infringe it. The -- the section 2541(d) is set out at page 18 of the appendix of the blue brief. And it says that any of the above acts -- and all the other acts that are listed as infringement, which would include selling -- are not infringements unless they involve further propagation of the protected variety. The reason that that provision is in there is because in 1970, the brokerage business in seed corn and cotton seed, soybean seed was already a thriving business. It was not the intent of Congress to inject itself into marketing situations that are governed by State law or by the Federal Seed Act. It had one thing in mind and that was to regulate the right to exclude others from sexually multiplying plant varieties. It wasn't in the market of suing people who just bought the bagged seed, didn't do anything with it, sold it to farmers who just planted that seed and took it to the elevator. So, it's not a PVP violation, number one, and number two, we weren't sued under the Plant Variety Protection Act anyway. We were sued under the Patent Act. It was the act of choice. Now, the 1970 Plant Variety Protection Act provides at section 2581 that the purpose of the act is to provide adequate encouragement for research. Congress -- the presidential commission was convened in 1965 to decide what sort of protection should we give to sexually reproducing plants. '68 the Senate Patent Subcommittee had hearings on amending title 35. There was -- there were objections. It took no further action. Hearings continued in the Agriculture Department, and this 1970 PVP Act came out to -- to provide adequate protection to encourage research. That was Congress' intent in crafting this statute. They set up a separate agency. They set up a separate board with mandated representation of affected political interests, including farmers, including the public sector, including researchers. They set up the seed saving exemption, the research exemption. Now, if -- if the argument is accepted that, well, the reason that Congress did this was because they misapprehended the ability to -- of technology to advance and make it easier to, say, identify or describe a plant variety or because of some other technological advance, well, if -- that is simply saying that the intent of Congress in 1970 was based on a mistaken apprehension or something that's proved mistaken today. But to take that position assumes that if Congress had apprehended correctly, as Pioneer's amici said they should have, then that Congress would have simply adopted section 101 without the special agency, which -- without the board, which is -- which has to have representatives of experts from the various varieties, without seed saving, without research, without all of the distinctions that it specifically intentionally enacted in the Plant Variety Protection Act, and that is too great a leap for us to take in my -- in a judicial setting. It's a political question. It's a question for Congress to answer and Congress has answered it. Everything that went into the crafting of the Plant Variety Protection Act was the result of politics. And that is if -- if in some fashion, which I see a lot -- a lot of the -- of Pioneer's and its amici's argument points out that, well, it now looks like its a better idea to have patent protection than Plant Variety Protection Act protection. Well, that is an argument to be made in the -- on the Hill to the Congress where they have the resources to examine all of this evidence that has been put before this Court in the amici briefs that is not in the record in this case. As far as the ease -- the record -- the evidence that's in the record in this case is that it's harder to get a Plant Variety Protection certificate because there was the corn hybrids that were patented in this case. The inbred parents were not deposited, only the hybrid seed. The hybrid seed, when you plant it, you get all different types of plants. You cannot recreate the hybrid without having the inbred parents' deposit. The PVP requires deposit of the inbred seed. The PVP requires that you give the breeding history. There's no requirement of that for the patent. The PVP allows the research exemption. Why is that important? Because of this. The DNA in plants is a storehouse of knowledge, a storehouse of genetic knowledge. The RNA conveys that message and the message is manifested in the characteristics of the offspring of the plant. Only when you have -- when a plant breeder has the opportunity to actually grow the plant, observe it, cross it, observe and test the offspring can the plant breeder obtain the knowledge that is in the ostensibly patented plant. And without that -- without that opportunity, then the full disclosure that supposedly is made under the Patent Act when they patent plant varieties is not -- is not made. And it is -- it is an extremely important matter that the Plant Variety Protection Act guarantees to the public, and that is the free use and transmission of genetic material, which patents are being used to stop. There's been, as you know, a extreme consolidation of the agricultural industry, and the switch to patents and the locking up of plant germ plasm is a key impetus in that consolidation. If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time."

But our case rests not upon that. Our case rests upon 35 U.S.C., section 101, which is in the regular patent statute that says, and the plain meaning of those words, as confirmed in Chakrabarty, that the corn plants that are patented here are either articles of manufacture or compositions of matter. Or the fact of the matter is, under the definitions cited with approval in Chakrabarty, they're both because these categories of statutory subject matter, under section 101 -- that is, they are sort of a gatekeeper. You got to pass through that gate to go on to the next criteria of whether you are new, useful, or nonobvious and can get a patent."

As I understand it, the -- the outline of the argument is even though the language in 101 is indeed just as broad as -- as you say and even though Chakrabarty said living things aren't excluded, the existence of -- of a separate statute dealing with the same subject matter may be taken as -- as an implied repeal to some extent if there's a conflict. And one argument for saying that there is no conflict here, as I understand it, is the argument that what is set up by section 101 on the one hand and the two separate plant statutes on the other are really two separate regimes. It's harder to get a 101 patent, so you get more protection. It's easier to get a -- we'll say, a PVP certificate, so you get less protection. And therefore, you shouldn't see them as -- as conflicting. You should see them as kind of hierarchical and the -- the applicant can choose what he wants. Mr. Johnson says, as I understood him a minute ago, that that's not a sound argument because in fact he says it's more difficult to get a PVP certificate than it is to get a -- a 101 patent. And he -- he mentioned a couple of things that you have to do that you might not have to do under 101. Would you comment on -- on that -- that difficulty point of his?"

      "speaker": "SEASE",
      "speech": "Yes. With all due respect to my colleague, I believe he's wrong. The title 35 patents, the regular utility patents, require novelty, usefulness, and nonobviousness. This Court defined how one determines nonobviousness in Graham v. Deere in 1966, and it has been universally applied by the Patent Office and by the courts since that date. And as a matter of fact, the patents that we're sued on here, if you look in their file histories, one would see that they were routinely rejected for obviousness by the Patent Office, and that was the big hurdle that had to be overcome before they could issue. The Plant Patent Act requires asexual and requires new, distinct, and probably also nonobviousness. The Patent Variety Protection Act requires new, distinct, uniform, and stable. There is no requirement whatsoever akin to nonobviousness in the Plant Variety Protection Act. And it in fact, Your Honor, is almost a registration system, very similar to like the copyright system where you file, you fill out a form, and it's granted without any kind of a rigorous examination as utility patents undergo in the United States. And our system, I might add, is recognized as one of the stronger ones in the world primarily because of our unobviousness requirement."

      "speaker": "SEASE",
      "speech": "I -- I think it is, Your Honor. And the reason historically that it came about that we have these three separate regimes that occur for plants is that plant inventors, if you will, were being discriminated against in that they were unable to comply with the rigorous requirements of title 35 for a regular utility patent not because there was any definitional wrong in section 101, but because in application, the Patent Office was routinely rejecting them -- and I'm talking about prior to 1930 -- as products of nature, and the inventors were unable to meet the written description requirement necessary to get a patent, so important to a patent because the written description requirement is how the public benefits from the knowledge from the patent so that they can use it to advance and build greater knowledge. And so, the Plant Patent Act of 1930 was passed to allow some limited rights for asexually reproduced plants, and the Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970 was passed to allow again some rights for sexually produced plants. Now, this petitioner would turn those two acts and their legislative history on their head and use them to limit patent coverage when, in fact, they were passed by Congress for the purpose of granting some coverage that was like a patent in order to get over the two historical hurdles of section 112, written description requirement, and the so-called product of nature doctrine."

The Court in Chakrabarty rejected the position of the Government and of the dissenting Justices that those two statutes showed a congressional understanding that living things are not protectable under section 101 and could be protected only insofar as that subject matter was covered in those two statutes and to the extent to which it was covered. The Court, instead, adopted a -- a broad interpretation based on the plain meaning of section 101 referring to the anything under the sun quotation, but also said quite specifically at page 313 of volume 447 that the relevant distinction is not between living and inanimate things for purposes of applying 101, but between products of nature, whether living or not, and human-made inventions. So, there is no doubt that all categories of living things are within the interpretation of 101 that the Court adopted. And the anomaly of this case is that in petitioners' contention, the Court is being asked to disfavor, for purposes of applying section 101, and indeed, to exclude from eligibility for section 101 protection the very subject matter for which Congress had shown special solicitude and saw a particular need for patent protection in these two acts at a time when it was doubtful whether living things could get section 101 protection."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

We now have --"

      "speech": "They also -- they also wanted to be sure that people could do research. You see, that's -- that's actually bothering me as much as the seeds. They wanted to be sure that people could do research, so they create a special exemption. And now your reading of the patent law will wipe out what sounds like a very important special exemption."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "The exemption is for purposes of that act only. When greater research and development, greater disclosure, and higher standards for qualifying a patent have been met, there has been more of a contribution to public knowledge which, under our intellectual property laws, justifies a greater exclusive right for a limited period of time."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "It is to the extent it goes, but of course, it has a much less -- lower threshold of qualifying for eligibility and a lesser standard of protections. The anomaly would be to say that the microorganism and animal patents issued under section 101 should have rights that are not available for those who invent plants when it was plants that Congress wanted to give special assurance for in -- in enacting this legislation at a time when it was thought that, either for practical reasons or because of doubt about the applicability of --"
