The paradigm Section 10(b) plaintiff is an investor who has purchased a security which has been inflated by deception, the price of which was been inflated by deception or manipulation. I submit the central purpose of the '34 Act is to protect such investors from financial loss. The '34 Act, I submit, was not passed to provide a Federal remedy to plaintiffs who complained of their inability to purchase stock. The '34 Act was not passed for the purpose of Federalizing the adjudication of disputes over the ownership of securities."

      "speaker": "DODYK",
      "speech": "That is correct. That is correct, Your Honor. But what I am suggesting to Your Honor is that the oral expression which passes or is asserted to be a security in this case should not be accepted as such, that in this case that what you're basically dealing with is a conversation which gave rise to an asserted right to purchase common stock in a subsidiary. The answer to why, as I understand the law, Your Honor, is rooted in the Blue Chip Stamps case. And as I interpret that case, Your Honor, I believe it to reflect a reluctance on the part of the Court to accept oral assertions as satisfying the predicate to establish standing to sue as a purchaser of securities."

      "speaker": "DODYK",
      "speech": "Well, certainly Your Honor, I'm not saying then oral statement cannot constitute a misrepresentation. Far be it from me to suggest that. Going to the second part of your question, Your Honor, I certainly think that distinctions can be made between the breadth of section 10(b) in the hands of the SEC and the breadth of the judicially-implied private right of action under Section 10(b). And as Your Honor is aware, there are distinctions. In an SEC action, it is of no concern whether anyone relied on misrepresentation. In fact, there is no purchaser requirement constraining the SEC's enforcement bar. So I think the contours of the private right of action which is implied under Section 10(b) are quite different from the contours within which the SEC might bring an enforcement action."

      "speaker": "DODYK",

But what I say to Your Honor is I don't think given what I understand to be -- and of course Your Honor would know better than I -- the thrust of that opinion. The reluctance of the Court to accept wholly oral testimony not for the purpose of saying whether or not there has been a misrepresentation, but for the purpose of satisfying the threshold predicate requirement of whether or not the plaintiff has purchased securities. The Court, time and again in the course of that opinion, said that the principal advantage of that doctrine was to place as a requirement for standing in a 10(b) case a transaction which could be proven by document."

Whether there was, indeed, an option, or there wasn't an option. If there was an option, there's no doubt that this plaintiff purchased it. It isn't a question of whether the plaintiff, you know, agreed to accept the option or not. That's, as I understand it, not an issue. The question is was there an option."

      "speaker": "DODYK",

You have no idea whether the plaintiff would have bought this stock. Plaintiff said I would have but for this misrepresentation, or I would have sold it but for the misrepresentation. It's totally up in the air. The question here is much simpler, much more focused. Was there a promise by the alleged seller of the option to deliver the stock or not?"

Now I submit to Your Honor, that this case is no different in that respect. The oral option -- the purchase of the oral option -- all of that is a lawyer's description of what happened in a conversation. And just as in --"

Had I not known it, I would not have. And it's all speculation about the future. There's no speculation about the future here. It is a simple past fact. Was there this promise to deliver the stock in exchange for certain actions by the other side, or was there not? That's not at all as hard to prove as the would have, could have, should have stuff is."

    {
      "speaker": "DODYK",
      "speech": "I think it is, if I may. I think this is a would have, could have, should have case. No question about it. Don't forget that in the Blue Chips Stamps case, you weren't talking about a drive-by offeree in the market place. What you were talking about in Blue Chip Stamps were a group of retailers who as a result of a plan of reorganization that was entered after a consent decree had the right to purchase a determinate number of shares which was defined in the consent decree. Therefore, their right to make the purchase was clearly documented. In addition, in terms of the damage claim in that action, in terms of the injury, they were pointing to the difference between what the price the stock was trading at currently and the price which it was offered at in the prospectus. And they said that is the measure of my damages. Here, you're dealing with I think very much a weaker case in the sense that the alleged act of purchase, the existence of the option, was throughout a lawyer's description of an oral event. And the would have, could have, should have goes like this: I would have exercised my option; I would over a period of years have invested fifty million dollars in this business; the business would have succeeded, and the stock market would have valued my stock interest at X million dollars."

The other, the would have, should have point is I would have exercised my option. But as I understand it, it's not open to us to assume that that is the case. As I understand it, the finding was that they did exercise the option. That they exercised the option by going ahead in effect and paying part of the consideration for that -- for getting the option which was the help that they gave to your client in getting the license. So that as I understand it, we have a finding that this is not a hypothetical should have or would have case, but a case in which we did. We went ahead, and when we performed -- when we did the part performance, at least -- that sealed the deal for the option. We had the option, and there is no question as I understand it that they sought to exercise the option at a later time. So I don't see where the subjunctive gets into this."

    {
      "speaker": "DODYK",
      "speech": "Well, I think where the subjunctive gets in -- and perhaps it's not a subjunctive as such -- what I'm saying to you is that the nature of the jury's conclusion in this particular case, I think, should not be relevant to the determination which the Court is making, if my construction of the Blue Chip Stamps case is accurate."

      "speaker": "DODYK",
      "speech": "No it's not -- I'm not saying -- I think it's a would have, should have case in many regards, Your Honor, in many regards. But what I'm saying with respect to the reason why Blue Chip Stamps should be applied to the facts of this case is that I don't see any difference in the quality of the oral evidence, or the oral event which gave rise to the finding, and the quality of the oral evidence which drove the Court in Blue Chip Stamps to say no, I'm not going to extend the doctrine to that situation."

You're in effect saying that the '34 Act should be construed as, in effect, incorporating the statute of frauds for purposes of determining how a security, or what can qualify as a security within the meaning of the Act. My question is, why should we interpret it when the statute of frauds has traditionally had an independent life of its own, and of course incidentally in this case, the statute of frauds has either been satisfied by part performance, or has been satisfied by part performance as I understand it in the findings of the jury."

First of all, certainly the courts of appeal have construed Blue Chip Stamps to hold that if you had a purely oral event to satisfy the purchase requirement which is unenforceable under the statute of frauds, that under Blue Chips Stamps that didn't suffice, number one. Number two, the argument I was making about Blue Chip Stamps and the significance of oral evidence is not limited to the statute of frauds. After all, you're talking about the meaning of the Federal statute, and my interpretation of Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Blue Chip Stamps -- excuse me, the Court's opinion in Blue Chip Stamps as underlying the Kagen and Pelletier decisions is that where the quality of the satisfaction of the purchase is oral, the quality of the evidence is purely oral, that the claim is too dubious in its nature to satisfy that threshold requirement --"

And at this stage, at least going in, I mean, you're urging that the Court hold something today that it has never held before. There is an arguable question of the interpretation of Federal law. The State claims were pended to that and thoroughly tried. This is not a case that was dismissed at the threshold. Why are we -- it seems to me that we're talking about something that is academic in this case if a judgment is going to stand based on the adjudication of the State claims."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DODYK",
      "speech": "Well, let me speak to that if I may, and also it comes back to the second part of Justice Souter's question. And this has to do with the significance of the statute of frauds in this case. And the proposition which I'm going to advance, Justice Ginsburg, is that the errors committed by the district court and by the Eleventh Circuit with respect to the statute of frauds are clear and undeniable and are fatal to every cause of action which was asserted in this case, State or Federal. Now, grant me the indulgence of assuming, although I've had little indication of this, that the Kagen and Pelletier approach would prevail, and that the Court was at least open to the argument that, well, Blue Chip Stamps means that if you have an oral event upon which you are basing your purchase argument, and you don't have an enforceable contract under the statute of frauds, you don't have a purchase. Now, I think -- and I don't mean to be rude or over-reaching -- but I think it's clear that both the district court and the Eleventh Circuit committed undeniable errors in the way they treated the statute of frauds question. In the court of appeals they said that the statute of frauds did not apply to this case because the oral option, although a security for Securities Act purposes was not a security for the purpose of the statute of frauds. Now, bear in mind that what we're talking about here is an oral agreement contract option for the sale of securities. And I submit that there can't be any question that the proper analysis on these facts is that the oral option was the contract for the sale of securities which the statute of frauds rendered unenforceable."

That there was no Section 10(b) violation because of the existence of the State claim. If I can address that question briefly. My position on that question is that if you take a look at the decided case authorities since Santa Fe and Blue Chip Stamps, there are two lines of authority which unanimously would have resulted in the dismissal of these claims. Now, we've been talking about one of those lines, and that is to say whether or not you can create a purchase out of an oral event. There is another line of cases which doesn't deal with the purchase question. Another line of cases which says that where you have a misrepresentation of a party's intention to sell securities, as distinguished in the language of the courts, from a misrepresentation going to the value of the securities, you don't have a Section 10(b) violation. There are four circuit courts that have come to that conclusion; there are two district court cases within the last three years that have followed those cases. Just this year --"

And I think it's also, Your Honor, a doctrine which this Court should take into account in deciding what types of misrepresentation are actionable under Section 10(b). The proposition is --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Even giving you the point that the only kind of misrepresentation that counts under 10(b) is a misrepresentation of value, do you really think that an option to purchase from someone who, when he gives you the option, has no intention of ever selling you what he has promised to sell you? Is it worth as much as an option from someone who when he gives you the option intends to go through with the delivery of stock if you exercise it?"

And what I mean to say by that is there are lots of actions which can undermine the value of a security or an option to purchase a security. But I submit that there is a very clear distinction between a misrepresentation about the financial condition of a company and the refusal to accede to an asserted contractual obligation to delivery securities, and I suggest to Your Honors that given the way in which this Court has articulated the purpose of the '34 Act that a line should be drawn between those representations which in the garden-variety Section 10(b)(5) case speak to the value of a security in a situation such as this in which a person says he should have sold me the stock and he didn't, and he lied about it in the first place."

There is a great deal of difficulty with a standard which says whether or not the court should proceed to adjudicate the State law claims depends on the degree of frivolity of the Federal action.

Now, I say that if you accept my construction of Section 10(b), if you accept my construction of Blue Chip Stamps as six circuit courts have done, the answer is when that case came up on a Rule 12 motion, Judge King should have thrown it out.

We had that evidence here -- written evidence from Wharf's files that Wharf did not intend at the time that it entered into the contract to fulfill it. And furthermore, Congress has taken much of this burden off the Court's shoulders, if you'll excuse me for just a second, by adding the requirement in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in which it recognized a 10(b)(5) claim and cited how to cabin it, and it requires a specific pleading of facts sufficient to create a quote strong inference of intent to defraud, and if you can't do that, your claim is dismissed under that statute."

And you say, oh, well, but what about the misrepresentation? Well, if Uncle Joe is alive. Look -- he's defending the case, isn't he? And therefore if you believe that he made the oral statement, why didn't he carry it out? So he's here defending it, so he must have intended not to carry it out. Now, maybe that isn't totally sufficient, but you'd be well along the way."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "It's not sufficient, Your Honor. Just as it's easy to allege, it's very hard to prove.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "That would be insufficient to meet that burden, Your Honor. The fact that he's defending a suit, obviously, would be insufficient. And the plaintiff's own testimony about what he thought the defendant's intention was does not prove the state of the defendant's mind, nor does the fact that the defendant failed to perform prove anything more than a breach of contract. The restatement makes that clear -- that same principle would apply. Failure to perform alone is not sufficient. There has to be additional evidence, and there was additional evidence in this case -- both testimonial and documentary evidence -- that there was no intention to perform at the time. In addition, it's important to understand that - - it's important to cover oral contracts such as these because many contracts for the purchase of securities are oral, such as when customers contract with their brokers over the telephone to buy stock. And oral contracts for the sale of securities are generally enforceable under the law of all fifty States. In addition to that, the Act does not require that there be a writing to make someone a purchaser or a seller of a security. The Act provides that the options are securities, and the Act also provides that a purchase includes any contract purchase."
