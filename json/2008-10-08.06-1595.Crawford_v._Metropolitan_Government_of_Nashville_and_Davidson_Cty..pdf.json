    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Vicky Crawford reported to city officials that she had been repeatedly harassed by the board's director of employee relations, her conduct was protected by section 704(a) of Title VII. It is protected first by the first clause of section 704(a), which is known as the opposition clause. The opposition clause has three elements that must be proven. Only one of them is at issue here. But just to set the context, first a plaintiff will have to prove that the employer acted with a retaliatory motive. Second, the employee's statement or conduct must relate to action that was unlawful under Title VII. It might be something that happened in the past. It might be a concern about something that might happen in the future. And third, the conduct must be in the nature of opposition, and that's the question in dispute in this particular case. It is our view that the -- it is sufficient to establish that element if a reasonable person would conclude from the employee's statement or conduct that the employee disapproved of or objected to the employment practice in question."

In other words, if A says \"Sexual harassment is terrible\" and elsewhere in the company sexual harassment is going on and A is then fired, would it be your view that A would at least state a claim if A said, I had expressed disapproval of sexual harassment, it turns out there was sexual harassment being gone -- taking place elsewhere; and I was fired for that reason.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "That's at least two questions. Let me try to answer them both. With regard to what would constitute protected activity, it is our view -- and I think this is consistent with the lower courts and the view of the government -- that there doesn't have to actually be a violation. If a worker walks into the office with a button saying \"Violations of Title VII are bad and I'm against them,\" she can be -- and fired for that, that's illegal even though nothing was going wrong."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

This was a person who appeared at an internal proceeding, she gave testimony, very specific testimony. She wasn't saying: I'm against harassment. She said: This boss harassed me. It is about as specific as you get. So we're dealing with a particular case of somebody who was a witness in an internal investigation. Why do we have to reach the outer boundaries of this claim in this case?"

    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "You do not, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, but, you know, that's why we ask hypotheticals that aren't related to the specific facts, because we're interested in how broadly the proposition you're asking for goes. I'd still like to find out where you draw the limit. What if the person says: Mr. Jones would never do anything like that, but if he did that would be terrible. Now, is that actionable as opposition?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "Yes. Expressing disagreement with conduct that violates the law is what the opposition clause protects. It doesn't have to be about a specific instance, although it emphatically is so here. It doesn't have to reference the statute."

Or what if the employee goes further and says: Supervisor did such and such, but I know he was just kidding; or I hope you don't take any action against that person. Would that be opposition?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "Not necessarily. Again, it depends on the question that was asked and the answer that was given. If I might, for example, in this case the question was did Mr. Hughes engage in inappropriate activity. That was a request -- I think a trier of fact could understand that that was a request for a description of something that the witness objected to."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Let me ask this. Suppose the employer conducts an investigation because it believes that the supervisor has engaged in improper activity. So what they are trying to do is substantiate grounds for dismissal or some other sanction. And then an employee provides information that's exculpatory. Can -- is that protected? Is that -- is that information protected."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "It's our view that that is not protected by the opposition clause. It is our view it would be protected by the participation clause. If I might get back to the question --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Isn't it strange when there are many situations in which testimony or the reporting of information is protected, but when it's done, isn't it usually done both ways, as it is under the participation clause? So that the testimony is -- cannot be the subject of retaliation or the reporting of information cannot be the subject of retaliation, but not it's protected only if it goes in one direction? Isn't that a very odd approach to that situation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "That's why we're advancing the view that the participation clause here provides as well, so that it's clear that exculpatory witnesses are protected. It is not unimaginable that an exculpatory witness would anger someone. But going back to the question you asked earlier, it's possible that in response to a question an answer might be given which a reasonable person would not conclude reflected disapproval such as, well, he told that joke, and I thought it was funny. And, indeed, in the Harris v. Forklift case there were witnesses like that who -- who confirmed that the owner of Harris Forklift had made the jokes in question but said they didn't mind. That that would not be our position at --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Wouldn't that be very strange? Suppose that this -- the factual situation actually is very severe and is enough to -- to establish liability on the employer's part, but this particular reporting employee doesn't think so. So then the employer might well be very annoyed that this information which can be the -- the basis for liability has been brought out against the employer, and the employer might want to retaliate. Why would that be unprotected just because this employee adds his or her opinion that it isn't serious?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "We think it is protected by the participation clause."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Why don't you follow what the EEOC says? I mean, the EEOC, as I understand it, has said the very fact the employer has initiated an investigation of an alleged discrimination is sufficient to demonstrate the reasonableness of the employee's belief that by providing information relevant to the inquiry she is opposing an employment practice made unlawful by Title VII. And then they go on. To be absolutely clear about it, they say an employee who assists her or her employer in the endeavor, i.e., you go and testify; so the sun was shining on that day; you are assisting your employee by telling the truth-- is by definition -- is opposing practices made unlawful by Title VII. So here we have a difficult question, quite an interstitial question, defining precisely \"opposing,\" and here we have the EEOC doing it. So why don't we just follow what they say?"
  },

    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",

I am a world class sexual harasser, but I'm also not a liar, and I'm -- I am subpoenaed or called up by the employer in connection with this internal investigation and asked whether so-and-so harassed a particular worker. And I'd say, yes, as a matter of fact, he did, and a good thing too. Is that expressing opposition?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Is this a real problem? I mean, let's suppose the opposition clause protects everybody in the internal investigation who could be at all interpreted as favorable to the complainant. It also protects everybody who could possibly be viewed as neutral. Then you have a problem about what about a person who loves sexual harassment? This is the hypothetical: he comes in, testifies: I love sexual harassment; it's wonderful, and they fire him. Now is this a real problem?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "It -- it is not, Your Honor. But -- but as the -- as the Chief Justice pointed out, I'm -- you know, I'm here to answer hypothetical questions, and I'm going to do so."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

That what goes on internally doesn't qualify. \"Investigation,\" \"proceeding,\" or \"hearing\" under Title VII requires first that there be a Title VII charge. I thought that that's what the controversy we're talking about today is about: Is this a qualifying investigation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, there actually are two distinct questions here. One of them is whether the conduct is protected by the opposition clause and whether it constitutes opposition. The second question is whether this conduct is protected by the participation clause and would be an investigation under Title VII. We are asserting arguments under both claims, and -- and the Respondents disagree with us on both."

And this is -- this is a statute that -- that is deliberately written with overlapping provisions to be sure nothing is missed. In the phrase in the Fort Stewart case, I think, Justice Scalia, it is ex abundante cotilla, out of an abundance of caution, or in modern terms boots -- belt and suspenders. So these are deliberately overlapping provisions to -- to assure that --"

  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "It -- it -- in our view, it doesn't have to be formal, but there are two essential elements to an investigation or a proceeding or anything other internal being under this title. The first is that the employer must have a rule or policy forbidding the type of discrimination in question which is similar to the requirements in section 706(c) for State and local agencies. Second, the individual -- the official who did whatever you describe has to have been specifically authorized by the employer to play that role. Vicarious here wouldn't cover it. If I could reserve the balance."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. We think this case is best resolved under the opposition clause, and that clause does not require employees to utter magic words of opposition or to initiate the interview in which they express opposition to unlawful conduct. Rather, the clause is satisfied when a reasonable person would understand that the employee has objected to sexual harassment in the workplace. And when an employee discloses or reports that she has been subject to unlawful sexual harassment, a reasonable person could certainly infer that the employee opposes a practice made unlawful by the statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "In that case, doesn't the opposing employee herself have a direct cause of action under Title VII? Given what Ms. Crawford described, you know, \"that happened to me, too,\" she could proceed under Title VII herself."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Right. She has got timing requirements. So if she hasn't complained to the EEOC within the relevant time, she wouldn't have a cause of action for discrimination. But once she has retaliated -- an adverse action is taken against her because of what she has reported, then she has timing requirements on when she has to sue for the retaliation, and she did that here. And this is a case where the Sixth Circuit tossed the case out on summary judgment, and it erred in doing so because the facts alleged in this case were more than ample to survive summary judgment on the question of whether she opposed what the Director of Employee Relations did to her. She alleged that in the context of a sexual harassment investigation in which she was asked to disclose inappropriate behavior by the director, she reported repeated instances of offensive, objectionable, and unwelcome conduct by him. For instance, she said that she had her head pulled into his lap and that in response she threw him out of the office, thereby indicating that she did not like this conduct. The jury could easily infer from those facts that she opposed the director's conduct. Now, that timing would --"
  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "If you -- yes, if a reasonable person could infer that. I think that we are similar. But if you just are a reporter of unlawful conduct, that's enough. But this case is easier, much easier. She was a victim."

And if -- you can either decide the broader question or the question of the Petitioner here, which she reported that she was subject, and it makes it all the more evident, and certainly a jury could have found that she opposed the conduct. But we do think that at least a reasonable inference could be drawn -- when you report facts that would constitute unlawful activity, the reasonable inference is that you have objected."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

    "speech": "No, but you have to remember there are two separate clauses.

You would be covered under -- in the proceeding, why there is such broad coverage. Once you're under the participation clause, no matter what the substance of your testimony is, it's covered. It protects the process itself, regardless of whether it was -- it was determined true."

And what is so upsetting about this case is the gaping hole in statutory coverage that the Sixth Circuit left. It is an inexplicable gap that a complaining witness in an employer investigation would be unprotected from retaliation. The statute simply can't function, as intended by Congress, as intended by this Court, if there are all these incentives for employees to investigate unlawful activity, witnesses come forward and report that they, in fact, have been subjected to sexual harassment, and employers are free to retaliate.

Yet nobody even knows that a charge has been filed. And that's just not something that Congress possibly could have intended and wanted to leave the morning witnesses unprotected from retaliation.

In relation to the anti-retaliation provisions of section 704, that balance was struck to protect the rights of employees to report allegedly discriminatory activity, as well as employers' rights to manage their workplaces. The participation clause covers activity or conduct in the course of an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII.

There's an element -- and all the parties have provided the Court with a dictionary -- the various dictionary definitions of the word \"oppose,\" all of which contain the common theme of resistance, coming up against something, communicating resistance. When the -- when what Mrs. Crawford said to the human resources investigator in response to questioning is actually examined, it is making a disclosure. There's no request that anything be done about it. The time lag between the end of the alleged harassment and the actual reporting is over two months.

You can ask somebody, you know, do you oppose the war in Iraq? And all you're asking is what is your opinion of the war in Iraq. Do you think it is good or bad? But \"oppose\" is also used in a quite different sense. He -- you say somebody opposed the war in Iraq, you mean he went out and -- and paraded against it and so forth. And your assertion is that in this legislation, it has the latter meaning. It just doesn't ask for your opinion about whether sexual harassment is good or bad. It asks whether you were actively -- actively opposing it. Now, once you adopt that position, I don't see how the fact that you -- that something that was not active opposition can be converted into active opposition by something that occurred later. I mean, if you want to abandon your other argument, that's fine with me, but -- (Laughter.)"

If every employee who was a victim of sexual harassment and says stop, if that -- if that constitutes opposition conduct under the retaliation clause, suddenly that employee has two causes of action, one for sexual harassment and one for retaliation."

And I don't see how this Court, having imposed in practical terms the requirement that Justice Ginsburg just described, can then say, oh, but we're going to construe this indefinite term of \"investigation\" to exclude this kind of employer activity which our construction of the statute has virtually mandated. So that if in fact the employer's investigation succeeds in ending the problem and there is no EEOC complaint, those who participated in the investigation are absolutely helpless against retaliation. That would be a bizarre way to interpret a -- a statute in which we have any -- any opportunity to interpret \"investigation\" to include this kind of investigation. What do you say to that?"

Why then would it be reasonable for us, if we have any option in construing the term \"investigation,\" to construe it to exclude this kind of investigation and exclude coverage of the people who under our decisions are supposed to come forward and -- and answer questions?

It sounds illogical, but I -- I submit to the Court that if -- that if it is going to be a Hobson's choice and it -- it would be a situation in which employers would have an incentive to choose not to -- would choose to abandon their policies and take their chances. If they have to interview 20 people in a -- in a retaliation -- in a sexual harassment case, there's 20 potential plaintiffs because they all participated. It doesn't even matter if the employer knows what the employees said. If -- if some type of discipline or adverse action is imposed by the employer on any of those employees, there is an instant retaliation claim."

That's true, isn't it?"

    "speech": "The lack of causation, the lack of knowledge between whatever told the investigator in this confidential interview as to which confidentiality was promised and delivered, the lack of any knowledge -- -- the lack of any evidence that the decision-makers regarding Ms. Crawford and her job, that they knew what she said in this interview. The lack of causation is my first ground and the lack of pretext is my second ground that has yet to be considered. Because of the abundant evidence of misconduct which was discovered regarding how Ms. Crawford was not running her office."

And he's not going to get any counsel fees. Why should such -- why should it -- counsel be available to a person who obviously was discharged for having her hand in the till and not because she was harassed?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "YOUNG",
    "speech": "First of all, there is no allegation that Ms. Crawford embezzled or took money. There is no allegation, and she was not disciplined. She was not discharged based on any allegation she was stealing money. That's simply not a factor."

    "speech": "Multiple -- she was the payroll coordinator and her office -- all these checks were sitting in her office and they were not being processed. Some of them were six, eight, ten months old. Her office was in complete disarray. And this came to light as a result of this sexual harassment investigation when her subordinates were interviewed and they provided testimony regarding how she was running her office, and that eventually got to the finance department of the government, which hired an outside auditor which went in and generated all this evidence at great expense to the metropolitan government to hire this outside auditor. That's where the evidence was developed to terminate Ms. Crawford six months after the statement to the investigators. So that's -- those were the facts on how it happened. I forgot Your Honor's original question, or maybe I answered it. I don't know."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "I said if you have a really strong case of having discharged this person for cause that has nothing at all to do with harassment, you are going to win the lawsuit and it would be hard for the plaintiff to get a decent lawyer to represent her side of the case because she's going to lose."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "It is a mix. I mean, you know, a lot of plaintiffs might be afraid to bring these cases because they'll be accused of doing all kinds of bad things. They don't want their reputations ruined. They have lawyers who take contingent fees because they have to pay for it. Oh the other hand, you have problems with your costs and you have problems dismissing people who should be dismissed. Everybody has problems in this area. That's why we have law and lawyers. They try to minimize it. This doesn't seem fruitful to me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Isn't it true that financially it is always cost-free for the plaintiff because she has an attorney who is taking it on a contingent basis? Now, you could say it's not cost-free to the lawyer; but even that's not always true because if the lawyer has nothing else to do he may as well be doing this, you know, whatever the odds are."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor, may it please the Court: Protecting witnesses from being fired because they provide information in internal investigates is not going to interfere with the conduct of those investigations or deter them. We know that from experience. Until the decision in this case, no one had questioned the applicability of the opposition clause to a witness in an investigation who complains about sexual harassment. It was simply not in dispute. The compliance manual in this regard was entirely clear since 2000 because the Commission took the position witnesses who complained were protected by the opposition clause. None of the problems Mr. Young expressed concern about had happened."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Counsel, Ms. Blatt said the government would prefer a decision under the opposition ground as opposed to the participation. Do you have a preference?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "I think she said she thought it was easier. We don't have a preference. But I'd like to address briefly the participation clause. The participation clause does have the singular value, as Justice Alito suggested, that it is evenhanded, that it will protect witnesses for both sides. And the integrity of the process is certainly strengthened if both witnesses, witnesses on both sides, know they're protected from retaliation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Is the only question -- -the participation is not in doubt. The only question is whether it's an investigation under this subtitle."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "But the question is under this title. That language its certainly broad enough, as Justice Souter suggested, to encompass the sort of process that's at issue here. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this Court's decisions in Faragher virtually mandate these decisions. In response to the Chief Justice's point --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "You think the language \"investigation under this title\" is the equivalent of \"investigation with respect to an alleged offense under this title\"? That doesn't strike me as self-evident at all. It seems to me \"investigation under this title\" to me means an investigation under this title, which is not an investigation by the employer."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCHNAPPER",
    "speech": "I think the words under this title are elastic enough to support either meaning. The context of the statute and the way this Court has repeatedly construed it give meaning to it. In response to the concern that the Chief Justice raised, Faragher and Ellerth are not the only decisions that provide an incentive for these investigations. The Court's decision in Kolstad makes the existence of this sort of process essential to avoid awards of punitive damages. So even in non-harassment cases that same incentive has been created by the courts. In a situation involving harassment, the contours of the investigation are fact largely shaped by Federal law, not only policy guidance which the EEOC has issued helping employers figure out what to do, but a large and growing body of case law under Faragher and Ellerth elucidating what those requirements are. Particularly importantly here, the victims of sexual harassment are virtually required by the court to use these processes. Ms. Crawford had to speak up at some point or she had had no claim. And last, as a practical matter, if sexual harassment is going to be stopped, it's mostly going to happen through these internal processes. By the time most of these controversies about sexual harassment get to the EEOC or the courts, the victims have left their jobs. In this Court's decision in Pollard, the individual had been fired. In Souter she had been driven from her job. In Faragher and Ellerth and Harris, those had quit. If you look at the array of lower court decisions involving sexual harassment, by the time a case gets to the Commission in most of those cases the victim has give up and left. So it's exceptionally important that these processes be effective and evenhanded. No further questions."
