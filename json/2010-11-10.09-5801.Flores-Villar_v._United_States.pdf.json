It provided proof of parentage and proof of an opportunity to make a relationship with the child that adhered in birth as to the mother. But here, the residential requirements that are at issue here have no biological basis.

  {
    "speaker": "HUBACHEK",
    "speech": "I respectfully disagree. At the time, in 1940, when this statute was passed, there were a number of situations where it wouldn't go through the mother. In China and Japan, if the father was merely known it would not go through the mother. There were three dozen countries at this time, including the English countries and those who followed its law, in which if their female citizen gave birth to a child somewhere other than in their country, citizenship would not travel through that mother because of the laws of those particular countries. There are also stateless women. So in all those situations, the citizenship would not go through the mother. It would have to go through the father, and this statutory scheme doesn't in situations, there are a number of countries that would not allow the woman to transmit citizenship. So if the father was precluded by laws such as they were in the United States, that child would end up stateless as well. So there is substantial risk of statelessness and it continues today. There are numerous countries that have basically reinstituted that rule, that if the father is merely known, citizenship would not transmit through the mother. And those are primarily in the Middle East and some of them in Africa, and those are detailed in the Statelessness Scholars' brief."

So it's kind of like Matthews v. Heckler: The woman is getting a special favor and the unwed father is treated like most people who married -- couples who have children. statute was passed, it was clear under the State Department practices that the non-marital children of women did get women's citizenship, and it was also true as to men. So there was no discrimination that was being remedied in that situation."

Non-marital mothers were assumed to be the ones who were going to be raising the children without the influence of an alien father. The non-marital fathers are in the same category as those, too. Those non-marital fathers who raise their children on their own, as Petitioner's father did in this case, are not subject to that type of foreign influence, so they should be grouped together expanded residence required -- was applied. Now, with respect to the -- the Solicitor General has raised concerns about the plenary power doctrine. And I would argue that that doesn't apply here for a couple of reasons. First is, we are not talking about the admission of aliens. Second is that the Court in Chadha Zadvydas said -- made clear that even when exercising that power, that congressional -- excuse me -- Congress's power is limited by constitutional limitations. Now, with respect to the entry of aliens, Congress made it very clear in passing this very statute that they considered those people who gained citizenship as of birth to be differently situated than aliens.

And the reasoning has been: Well, my goodness, Congress wanted to take care of that larger class; it would be most destructive of the legislative will if we said you can't cover that larger class.

I read at least one article that says that word, \"continuous,\" doesn't appear with the fathers, and that they really mean it. That is, if somebody is living down in Texas and they happen to go visit on Christmas their father, who is -- or their grandmother or cousin or something who is across the border for 5 minutes, that they cannot take advantage of this clause (c).

You can do that either by lowering the people who are given a benefit or by increasing the people who aren't. So he has a remedy. His objection is, we're not being -- my father and my mother are not being treated the same. That's all of the relief he is entitled to."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HUBACHEK",
    "speech": "You are absolutely right, that that is -- that is the state of the law. And my point is that structurally, that remedy is unavailable here, because you can't take away the citizenship from the people who have already gotten it. And the notion that you can grant us prospective relief as discussed in the Solicitor General's brief doesn't make any sense, either, because number one, this statute, the one we are talking about today, doesn't apply past people who were born before 1986. But the thing is that if somebody were to provision. So the prospective relief notion really doesn't makes any sense in this context, because the equal protection violations have basically all already occurred at the time that the person who would make a citizenship claim was born, and we would still be left in a situation where Petitioner's father would say that I was unable to transmit citizenship to my son and a woman who was similarly situated was able to. So that type of remedy is unavailable. In the Court's decision in Iowa v. Bennett, the bank case, they actually ordered a refund of the taxes that were collected in a discriminatory manner dating back in time. So if you could factor out -- if you could make a relief that would take away the benefit that others had received, then I would agree that that is available, but that's not possible in this situation."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "But there were claims based on both illegitimacy and gender and there were equal protection claims based on both. But if I could move on to the way that the statute operates because we think it satisfies either standard of review in this case. And if I could just step back for a moment. As I mentioned, there are a number of factors that Congress takes into account in crafting a statute like this. 1401 deals with married couples and where both parents are citizens, all that is required is that one of the parents have resided in the United States prior to the birth. Where you have mixed parentage, the background of the enactment of this in 1940 and reenactment in 1952 and continued up to this present day is Congress was concerned that such a child may not have the requisite connection to the United States. They have a connection to the parent, but may not have a connection to the United States such that Congress wanted to grant citizenship to that person. So what Congress did in the mixed citizenship situation was to require prior residency of the parent as a talisman, as the Court said in Rogers v. Bellei, for a connection to the United States of ten years, five years after the age of 14. Congress has liberalized that, but that was the basic thought. Where you have unwed parents, in 1409(a) what Congress did was to follow general principles of the law of illegitimacy or children born out of wedlock, if a father legitimates a child then it's as if the child was born in a marriage, and the rule in 1401 with respect to marriage applies. That is true whether both parents are citizens or in a mixed marriage situation. If a father legitimates a child and both parents are citizens, then not the one, then the child benefits from the rule that if either parent was present in the United States before birth he's a citizen, doesn't have to satisfy the one year unbroken residency requirement under 1409(c). If it's mixed parentage, and the father legitimates, then the rule applicable to married mixed citizen and parents applies as if the child had been married at the outset. It's a perfectly sensible and provision or approach and consistent with the way this has been done. What Congress did with respect to the mother of the child born out of wedlock where there has not have been legitimation is to confer citizenship on the basis of a one year residency. Now, as counsel for the Petitioner explains, a mother in that situation who at the moment of birth, as this Court understood in Nguyen, that mother may be the only either legal parent or the only parent at the moment of birth with the requisite connection to the child to have an opportunity for this sort of connection at birth. So the mother in that circumstance is very much like the two citizen parent family, the only parents are parents with a connection to the United States."

So you have two parents whose interests have to be taken into account. Whereas in the situation Congress was addressing in 1409(c), the situation of a child born out of wedlock where there was no -- at the moment of birth, likely to be no recognized father, have you only the mother. If we -- if we think of this in -- in parallel to the illegitimacy -- the cases involving illegitimates that this Court has had in a domestic context, I think that is instructive. In a case like Lehr, where the question was whether the father of a child born out of wedlock should have received notice of a prospective adoption, the Court explained in that case that the father had not taken the steps necessary to form the relationship with the child, and therefore, be -- be a father in the eyes of the law, then the mother alone -­ what may be a very minor thing, but I did notice, prodded by an article, I have to say, that -- that for the women there is a sense in which its tougher -­"

The person where he would get relief is if it were the father, because the relief that he is entitled to is to be treated equally. That's it. The relief this person is asking for is not to be deported. And so the problem of the relief being granted is really complicated by the fact that it's a case of third-party standing."

And here the residency requirement is what like that, that the father doesn't have a meaningful connection to the child in the sense that one would predict citizenship on the basis of, until there had been some formal steps which would happen after birth to establish the relationship with the child.

Whereas in the case of women we are going to assume that when they had have the nonmarital child they are going to be in charge and that when a father legitimates and does whatever is required wherever the child is born, we are going to assume that the mother is involved still. But the very facts of this case demonstrate that that's not the case. That in this case Petitioner's father raised him and Petitioner's mother was not involved in his growing up and he brought him to the United States -- I'm sorry, if I was getting a question. So it's basically piling further gender-related inferences on top of the ones that are already in place in order to serve to justify this distinction. Now, with respect to the Fiallo case, there is a tradition of allowing citizens to transmit citizenship. Fiallo involved getting aliens into the United States. There is no tradition that dates back to 1350 where citizens enjoyed rights to bring aliens into the United States, but it does date back to 1350 that you've been able to confer citizenship on your foreign-born children. So it is differently situated and it is differently situated in the very structure of the statute that we are talking about today. Congress very specifically eliminated the ability of courts to change the rules of naturalization of aliens. It basically used language very similar to the courts decision in Ginsberg and said that you can be naturalized under this provision and no other way. It didn't say that as to citizens as of birth. Citizens as of birth are treated differently. There is a severability clause in the statute, so that would apply to them and that brings into play all the various remedies that the Court has granted with the respect to extension over the years."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "You referred -- I'm sorry, you refer to the tradition of passing -- do you agree with Mr. Kneedler that there is no such right? it. This Court made clear in Montana v. Kennedy that when Congress remedied that situation it made that remedy retroactive. So basically we have an unbroken tradition dating back to 1350, that's why I think that this right should be treated differently than the questions of admissions of aliens in Fiallo. And, again, there is also Chadha Zadvydas that made clear that the Constitution limits the Congress's power even in the context of naturalization. And then with respect to the third-party standing issue, the Court has granted third-party standing to criminal defendants whose are raising third-party constitutional issues in their criminal cases, and the same analysis should apply here. We can still look at the right from the perspective of the Petitioner's father and if the Court grants a levelling down remedy, that would not remedy the situation the Petitioner's father would be in because both before and after the Court's decision the children of women, similarly situated women, would be citizens and Petitioner's father's son would not. of -- in one case it's a petit juror and another in the other case it was a grand juror, and there were discriminatory preemptory challenges in those cases, and the court allowed those criminal defendants to assert those constitutional rights. Several members of the court also found there was standing in Miller. Kowalski pointed out in Craig v. Boren that there is a very forgiving standard when third-party rights are at issue in the case."
