On the one hand, Congress has the sovereign power to make laws which apply to everyone, including the States. On the other hand, the States have sovereign immunity from all aspects of suit. In the past, this Court has reconciled this conflict by drawing a line between sovereign power and sovereign immunity. States are bound by Federal law, but the States are immune from monetary damages for violations of those laws. In the bankruptcy context, this line means the States are bound by the discharge decisions, but that the States are immune from the trustee's attempts to augment the estate through monetary judgment."

I don't know if there's a modern system that would help with that, but -- you're right. Suppose that the State -- suppose you're right. What I'd worry about -- and I'd like your response to this -- is that in bankruptcies, or weak firms -- a lot of firms are weak, and they owe a lot of money to the States. So, the States figure this out after a while. It takes a few years to seep through, but once they see what they can do, they say, \"Here's what we'll do. Settle your claims against the State, which happen to be pretty good, for 50 cents on the dollar. Give us the money. And you're -- we're out of it.\" So, they settle it. A month later, bankrupt. Now, two things have happened. The States got 50 cents on the dollar, every other creditor gets 5 cents on the dollar, because they were a month ahead of it. The second thing that happened is, the creditor -- the firm lost the chance to come in and be rehabilitated. So, the result of this is two bad things: bankruptcy's law's basic purpose, to treat creditors fairly, bankruptcy law's basic purpose, to give firms a chance to rehabilitate, are both seriously undermined. So, given the Bankruptcy Clause in the Constitution, how is it possible to say that Congress does not have the power to prevent those two very, very seriously harmful results -- harmful in terms of the basic purpose of the Bankruptcy Clause?"

Rather, as this Court noted in Schoenthal versus Irving Trust in 1932, and Granfinanciera versus Nordberg in 1989, actions to recover preferential transfer are much like actions to recover a contract claim. That is, like a contract claim, they do not involve the core bankruptcy proceedings, but, rather, involve matters that are -­ or controversies that are tangential to the core bankruptcy proceedings. They're nothing more than an attempt to augment the State. And where we would draw the line, and where we propose that this Court draws -- draw the line -- and a line that we believe is consistent with this Court's previous decisions -- is that the States are bound by discharge, the States are subject to the automatic stay, but the trustees' attempts to obtain monetary judgments, and thereby augment the value of the estate, are barred by sovereign immunity."

With respect, however, to a preference to a State, we would say that that particular reading, as applied to the State, is unconstitutional. I don't believe Congress can make a law which would require the State to divest money or something to which the State has in its possession in which the State has a colorable claim of ownership. Here, there is no dispute that the money is in the State treasury. What they are trying to do is to recover a monetary judgment from the State. As this Court said in Schoenfeld [sic] and in Granfinanciera, this is very much like a contracts claim."

I'm not quite sure why they wish to drop the breach of contract claims. Perhaps they feel that by dropping the breach of contract claim, they somehow obtain a tactical advantage. And, if that's the case, certainly this Court should not allow them to rewrite the question presented in order to obtain a tactical advantage.

To the contrary, you explicitly rejected an in rem exception to sovereign immunity in Nordic Village, at least where money was concerned. You have allowed recovery in certain limited circumstances, such as the admiralty cases. Those do not exist here. This is not an in rem proceeding.

Congress may not use its Article 1 Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate sovereign immunity. Second, to rule in favor of Virginia does not require any alterations in this Court's jurisprudence; however, to rule for Mr. Katz on any theory requires certain fundamental changes in this Court's jurisprudence. Finally, regardless of context, sovereign immunity bars monetary judgment claims. States are immune from contract actions; private parties are not. States are immune from court actions; private parties are not. States are immune from actions by the trustee to augment the estate; private parties are not. Thank you."

So, 106(b) and 106(c) were designed for the contract claims that Justice Scalia referred to earlier in the Petitioner's argument.

And I think that it's very important to talk about bankruptcy differently. This Court has looked at, in -­ just last term, in the Hood case, which was the debtor's discharge. And the Court said that that constituted in rem authority. This Court, in Perez versus Campbell, said that somebody cannot be denied a driver's license simply because they failed to play a discharged obligation. The Court, in the Irving Trust case, said that a State is required to satisfy the procedure of bankruptcy if they want to participate in the claims process. In Van Huffel and Straton, this Court said that a bankruptcy estate is permitted to sell property free and clear of the State's tax liens. In Whiting Pools, this Court said the IRS, who seized property on the eve of bankruptcy on behalf of a -- of a lien, had to return that in its in rem jurisdiction. And I believe it was Justice O'Connor who asked the question of Petitioner with respect to, How would this affect the automatic stay? And how I've thought of that is, sometimes the automatic stay, there may be an effect with respect to monetary relief, and there may be an effect as far as an injunctive relief. For example, if there was a judgment that a State had, prior to bankruptcy, against the estate, and then sought to enforce the judgment, executed on the debtor's bank accounts post-petition, debtor didn't know about it, because, in a -- in a debtor's reorganization, the first month of the debtor's bankruptcy, you can't -- you're not following everything that's happening the case. There is an execution on the bank account, the money is taken into the State's coffers. Does that mean that the State is bound by the automatic stay, or is the State not bound by the automatic stay? It was money that was transferred from one -- from the estate to the State."

And that's how we distinguished the Nordic Village case, Your Honor. The -- this Court, I believe, would be extending the Article -- its jurisprudence if it permitted the bankruptcy estate not to be able to sue the States. This Court has recognized that a private citizen, Indian tribes, and foreign sovereigns cannot be sued. But this Court's never recognized a Federal entity cannot pursue a State. And this Court -- this is a situation where there is no alternative remedy. We aren't in a situation where we have the ADA, the ADEA, where the EEOC can bring an action on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the individuals to enforce a Federal law. We have no other enforcement in bankruptcy, other than the collective bankruptcy process, the bankruptcy code. And the bankruptcy code assigns to the debtor in possession, or to the trustee, the ability to collect on behalf of the estate. Bankruptcy is unique in its very in rem application and its very narrow and specialized enforcement of the bankruptcy system. The framers recognized the critical nature of binding the States in a uniform scheme. The decision below ought to be affirmed on the basis of in rem, on the basis of the Constitution, and on the basis that Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, waived its sovereign immunity.

In Alden versus Maine, this Court held that there was a presumption that the States had retained their immunity unless it could be shown by conclusive evidence that the States surrendered their immunity in the plan of convention. If Congress can use the Article 1 bankruptcy power to abrogate sovereign immunity, then one would expect there to be discussions to that effect at the constitutional convention, in the federalist and antifederalist writings, and in the ratifying conventions. Yet, as the Sixth Circuit conceded in its version of Hood, there is no compelling evidence. There is, at best, silence. Silence cannot equal the compelling evidence.
