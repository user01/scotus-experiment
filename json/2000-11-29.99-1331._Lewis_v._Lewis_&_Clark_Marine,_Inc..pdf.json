At that point, I am forced to attack the rule which gives them the right to have a liability and damage determination made in the Federal court, which I do say is invalid as violation of the rulemaking powers of this Court."

      "speaker": "DRIPPS",

If, in fact, the vessel is turned over to a trustee, though, the likelihood is that it's not going to be employed by the owner, and so that owner won't be allowed to have a subsequent claim, and if they post security for value, I think that solves the problem, because there is a fund posted, and we won't be in a situation where we have competing claims for the same fund. In other words, they will be different funds."

That claim has never been rebutted or contradicted by the opposing side, by the vessel owner, so this is clearly a single-claimant case. Now, what your question suggests then, is why was this case filed, and it was filed simply as a forum- shifting device."

That was not done in this case until May 11, 6 weeks or so after the initial complaint, and it was not done until after the State court case had been filed.

      "speech": "And in this case Congress has specifically said that the injured employee has the option of determining whether or not it should be a jury or nonjury trial. That's what this Court said in the Panama Railroad case v. Johnson, from 1920. The Linton case simply followed that, and said that the fact that the seaman chooses the nonjury remedy in State court does not transform the case into something that is now removable because it's outside the scope of the saving to suitors clause. And that ties in with this Court's decision in the Red Cross Lines case, where it concluded that statutory remedies are saved remedies, and in this case Mr. Lewis is a seaman invoking his rights under the Jones Act, which is a Federal statute. Accordingly, that remedy is saved to him by the saving to suitors clause, and Congress' decision to confer the right to select the forum and the form of trial on the seaman is also saved by the saving to suitors clause. In contrast, the vessel-owner's rights in this case have been fully protected by Lewis' stipulations. We've guaranteed their right to seek the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal admiralty court, and in that case their Federal statutory rights are fully protected, but by precluding us from being able to preclude in State court, they are destroying the rights that Congress has conferred upon us in the Jones Act and preserved from the exclusive Federal jurisdiction through the savings clause."

If we look back at the Langnes case, which was a Jones Act case, the Court's decision simply hinged on applying the saving to suitors clause so that both statutory doctrines could be implemented, which is what I'm asking this Court to do now, rather than to pick one in an effort to destroy the other, and that is the goal, I think, of this case."

The -- in the event that a State court judgment would be entered in excess of the limitation fund I think they have an absolute right to go back into the Federal court and say, wait a minute, Lewis agreed that in order to get to State court his -- our liability would be capped, and at that point the Federal judge would have the right to enter an order limiting their liability. I don't think there's any dispute about that."

    {
      "speaker": "DRIPPS",
      "speech": "In some ways, Justice Ginsburg. Now, if I understand the question correctly, I don't believe that the exoneration rule is an incorporation of Congress' allowing them a defense under the Jones Act. I think that defense has to be taken in the context of the statute, and they can choose to defend and require us to put on our proof of negligence, but only in the context of the forum grant that is given to the employee by Congress."

It's a respondeat superior situation. That's one thing. Another thing is, there was no negligence by anybody at all, and I thought that that was the equivalent of the exoneration plea, that nobody was negligent at all, as distinguished from, maybe we have respondeat superior liability, but we should be allowed to limit that."

    {
      "speaker": "DRIPPS",
      "speech": "That's true, that is the essence of the exoneration claim, and that's what they want the Federal court to decide. The two responses to that are, first of all, the Langnes case from this Court essentially held that the exoneration claim was not sufficient to preclude dissolution of the injunction because, as I noted earlier, in Langnes the district court had, in fact, exonerated the vessel owner. This Court nonetheless required the injunction to be dissolved and the case to go back to State court."

The other --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, that sounds like, entirely in sync with my suggestion that the defense of no negligence at all, which can be put into the Jones Act proceeding, is the equivalent of getting, in the Federal court, exoneration."

    {
      "speaker": "DRIPPS",
      "speech": "That's absolutely true, Justice Ginsburg. They have the right in State court to defend, require the plaintiff to prove negligence, causation, and damage. They will be getting in the State court the benefit of that defense that they seek to assert in Federal court. They are not being deprived of any rights by proceeding in State court, and their Federal right of limitation will be guaranteed to them by the stipulations that we filed waiving res judicata with regard to the issue of limited liability and stipulating to the exclusive jurisdiction of the district court to decide the limitation issues. Those protect their Federal rights, and their right to defend and require proof of negligence and the other elements of the plaintiff's case are all things they can assert in the State court. The other reason that the exoneration rule should not be permitted to control disposition of this case and we're required to be brought into Federal court is because at that point we do get into the rules enabling analysis and I simply wanted to mention the Henderson case that this Court decided in 1996, which set forth four factors that the Court considers in determining whether or not a provision is substantive or procedural. Rule (f) meets each and every one of those. The Henderson Court indicated that the factors are, who may sue, which is answered by rule (f)(1), which says any vessel owner, on what claims, the amount of all demands in conflict, tort or otherwise, rule (f)(2), for what relief, exoneration, or limitation from liability under rule (f)(2), and within what limitations period, not later than 6 months after receipt of a written notice of --"

I thought all this came up originally not because of statutes, but because of court-made doctrine in admiralty, and then that doctrine gets reflected eventually into rule (f).

In this particular case, however, this Court's decision in the Benefactor specifically said that the fifty-sixth rule in admiralty, which was the predecessor of current rule (f), was designed to circumvent the prevailing English rule requiring the vessel owner to admit liability. So in fact the rule has done the opposite of what you suggest. It has created a substantive right to sue for a determination of liability and damage, where in fact the common law, or the prevailing admiralty law, required the opposite, that the vessel owner admit liability, and that was the decision specifically of this Court.

The Eighth Circuit answered this question in the affirmative, and held that since the remedy sought by the claimant, a nonjury trial, was already available in the limitation of liability court, that there was no saved remedy. In other words, there was no statutory right of the claimant implicated, and therefore the Federal district court in the limitation case was bound by its grant of jurisdiction under Article 3, section 2 --"

Green, and what we say is that we know a number of things about what this Court -- what the district courts have to do under the Limitation of Liability Act. Unlike some of the cases cited by the petitioner, where there is no limitation case, we know that when there's a limitation case on file there is exclusive Federal jurisdiction, and we know that the district courts are therefore bound to -- exclusively to administer the rights of the limitation claimant and all -- the limitation petitioner, excuse me, and all those claimants who make claim. The only way for any given claimant to exit from the limitation case is if they can, for lack of a better word, trump the limitation petitioner's rights to an exclusive determination in the Federal court with some statutory right, and in this case that would be -- the source of that right would be 28 U.S.C. section 1333, the saving to suitors clause.

Now, once it is certain that that will in fact be the case, that there is no exposure beyond the value of the ship, what function does a limitation proceeding save -- serve, other than to block what would ordinarily be a garden-variety Jones Act case from proceeding in whatever forum the sailor chooses to sue in?"

But when those early decisions came out construing the Limitation of Liability Act, for the first time -- it had been passed in 1851 -- they had to decide what it meant, and there is an extended discussion in Norwich v. Wright about it, and in that case this Court stated that the American Limitation of Liability Act represented a departure from English law, because the English chancery courts, which had earlier heard limitation cases in England, lacked the power to investigate claims in admiralty, and therefore under English admiralty law the shipowner was required to admit liability. In the American courts, and under the limitation act as construed by this Court in Norwich v. Wright, a determination not only of limitation was undertaken, but also exoneration, and from that time forward --"

What I'm really saying is that if the remedy is already available in the Federal court, and what the Eighth Circuit decided was that if the remedy's already available in the Federal court in the limitation proceeding, there is no saved remedy to pursue elsewhere, and so the -- I think the issue for this Court is not so much jury versus nonjury in the abstract sense.

      "speech": "Well, I don't think the decision whether or not the nonjury trial is saved or not is necessary to this Court's decision, nor was it addressed specifically -- in fact, it was reserved specifically by the Eighth Circuit. You don't need to get that far, and the reason is because under the rubric adopted by the Eighth Circuit, if the remedy sought is available already in the limitation court, the claimant's not allowed to go back, and it was already available, i.e. a nonjury trial, so the court below never needed to address whether a nonjury trial was specifically a saved remedy or not, nor does this Court need to decide that for --"

      "speech": "Okay, but if you're prepared to go that far, then the case turns on whether there is a Federal reason, and the Federal reason you say is exoneration, so I understand that. And then I'm back to the question I had before, which I'm not sure I had a satisfactory answer to totally, that really what this exoneration is is the tail and it follows the dog into the Federal court, and the only reason it's ever there was, historically in England they did this, what the courts thought were absurd, to force the shipowner to give up his right to exoneration in order to get in Federal court, and our court years ago said that's silly, no other country does that and we're not going to do it."

Henn tells us, which is the multiple-claimant case, or, excuse me, the adequate fund case, what those cases tell us is that when the claimant seeks a jury trial that it has been deprived of him in the limitation court, that under those circumstances there is enough of a -- there's enough rights there for that claimant to trump the shipowner's right to be in Federal court, and they will then allow him to go back to State court assuming that on the one hand there's a single claimant, or on the other hand there's an adequate fund. But you can't look back at Lake Tankers v. Henn or at Langnes v. Green and write out of the Court's decisions the references to a jury trial being requested by the plaintiff.

It's the means employed, and I think that there's really no question under the case law that a jury trial is in a class separate from a nonjury trial as far as the saving to suitors clause goes. They're different remedies. Now, they both seek judgments, but in a different way. If I may briefly address the rule (f) argument, the position urged by petitioner that rule (f) should be declared invalid is in our view extreme and not warranted by the case law. This Court in the Henderson case did not announce a general test for the determination of when a Rules Enabling Act rule would be ultra vires. It instead decided that rule 4 trumped the Suits in Admiralty Act provision requiring forthwith service of process on the basis that the rule was purely procedural. But if I may, under rule (f), three of the four items that petitioner urges are contained in rule (f) and that mandate that it's a substantive rule are found in the limitations statute itself, namely, who may sue, when they may sue, and the object of the suit and so therefore, even under the test that petitioner cites, rule (f) clearly does not meet the standard of a substantive rule that would be struck down under the Rules Enabling Act. Indeed, the limitation act addresses those items. And I turn again back to the original decisions by this Court in the Benefactor, in the Norwich v. Wright case, in which this Court had occasion to construe the act and, if you follow the language closely of those decisions the Court was not construing rules that it promulgated. The Court was construing rules that it promulgated. The Court was construing the act itself, and the original admiralty rules that were promulgated by this Court in the Norwich case, the original 50-some admiralty rules from 1871, were rules, but they were in themselves interpretations of the act as seen by this Court, and they included the right to exoneration. Now, if the limitation petitioner can come into court, and if he can pursue a limit -- exoneration as well as limitation, then by definition the Court has exclusive jurisdiction over both of those subject matters and the limitation claimant, in this case the Jones Act seaman, can return to State court only if he demonstrates that the remedy he wants is not available in the Federal court. If there are no further questions --"

      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. O'Brien indicated that three of the four items that are in rule (f) are in the statute. What he neglected to mention is, as what Justice Scalia asked earlier, the one that's not in the statute is the one that's critical to his analysis, which is the exoneration provision, and that's not in the statute. Mr. O'Brien relies heavily on the Benefactor, and I would simply refer the Court to the quote from the Benefactor. It's at 103 U.S. 241. It's at page 16 of the reply brief, and the Court said that hence, this Court, in preparing the rules of procedure for a limitation of liability, deemed it proper to allow a party seeking such limitation to contest any liability whatever. That is not the statement of statutory construction. That is a statement of legislative intent. We're adopting these rules so that the party can contest the liability. Now, that is exactly what is forbidden by the Rules Enabling Act, yet that is what this Court said it was doing in 1880. Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer both asked about, in essence, whether there would be a right to a pure exoneration claim in Federal court, and I do want to point out that both the Fifth Circuit in the Fect v. Murkowski case and the Seventh Circuit in the Joyce v. Joyce case have said no, that unless there is a viable claim for limitation you cannot come in and ask for exoneration, and I think that is the rule that this Court should adopt. The Langnes decision, as Justice Stevens noted --"

      "speech": "-- as Justice Stevens noted does not require a jury trial, but it simply said that a jury trial is one aspect that makes the State court forum desirable, and that's part of the Jones Act remedy to allow the injured employee that option of choosing either State or Federal court, and whether or not to have a jury trial in either forum. To get to the respondent's not-otherwise- available test, this Court is going to have to say that the saving clause does not protect statutory remedies, particularly the statutory remedy afforded by the Jones Act, which allows the employee to choose the forum that the case will be tried in. That, however, is exactly what the saving clause was designed to do, and that is why this Court should reverse the Eighth Circuit's decision and reinstate the decision of the district court dissolving the injunction."
