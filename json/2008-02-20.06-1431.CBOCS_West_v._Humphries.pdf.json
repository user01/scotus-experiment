The Court starts with a review of the text of the statute. Section 1981(a) says that all persons shall have the right, the same right as is enjoyed by white citizens to make and enforce contracts. Words like \"the same,\" \"equal,\" and \"like\" are all in 1981(a), and those words all have normal, plain, ordinary meaning, that is identical. So what section 1981 says is in the making and enforcing of contracts all persons shall have identical rights as white citizens. As we move into this issue - -"

In 1991, Congress passed the 1991 Civil Rights Act and in that act they also included retaliation for 2 U.S.C. 1212. So Congress was consciously thinking about this issue of retaliation.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWKINS",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I mean there are alternatives for that particular issue. In this particular case, there was Title VII that fully protected the Respondent from any form of discrimination or retaliation. In addition, in the State of Illinois there are state statutes."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

    {
      "speaker": "HAWKINS",
      "speech": "No, but there is precedent for the fact that where one law does cover a particular situation, we don't go about removing that impact. So Title VII clearly does cover this particular situation of a retaliation, a pure retaliation claim."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "Well, that's -- that's often the case, isn't it? I mean, the argument you just made could go as well to somebody who uses 1981 to complain about a racially-based demotion wasn't able to use Title VII because he filed too late. That's a typical use of 1981; is it not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWKINS",

    },

      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "So what is the difference between this case -- you say, well, there's Title VII and this would erode Title VII. Doesn't it erode Title VII when I'm complaining about, say, a demotion?"

      "speaker": "HAWKINS",

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWKINS",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, based on a reading of Domino's, it would certainly appear that the individual who is making the complaint to have protection must be the individual who has the contractual right, as opposed to complaining about a third person."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "I would have thought that you could argue that it's direct discrimination. In other words, if you're fired, whatever form the retaliation takes, that, as Justice Ginsburg suggests, that that would be on the basis -- basis of race. And I thought your position, or at least your position could be narrowed to say it's only when the individual against whom the retaliation takes place is not the individual complaining of the direct discrimination that your position would be pertinent."

      "speaker": "HAWKINS",

      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

    {
      "speaker": "HAWKINS",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, they can make -- phrase it however they want to in terms of their particular complaint, but the issue in terms of the analysis under the plain text of section 1981 is whether or not a white person in this situation is being treated differently with respect to making a similar complaint."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

Well, here we have a Federal policy, and the Federal policy is that black people shall be treated the same as white in respect to making a contract. But were the law to allow you to fire anybody who complained about it, then black people wouldn't have that right.

In fact, Patterson says in it if the right is not specifically set forth in section 1981, there is no relief. Then after that, you had West Virginia, which was decided in March of 1991, again taking that same sort of approach with respect to if it's not in the statute, we're not going to make it. It may be that it's a job left for Congress. So they act on those and pass the law in November of '91. That's the context. And even in the Jackson case, in looking back, Justice O'Connor ended up saying that what we are looking back at is 1972 following 1969. So in 1991 we're looking at Section 1981 being amended, and we're looking at Patterson and West Virginia to give the context."

Section 1981 doesn't provide any specific remedies or any type of enforcement mechanism. It can only be enforced through a private lawsuit. Petitioner's basically asking this Court to allow an employer to be able to fire an employee who brought a private lawsuit to enforce his section 1981 rights. If the Court were to allow employers to do that, then any employer or contracting party would have the ability to exempt themselves from section 1981 liability. Take the example of a person who complains that he was not promoted because of his race in violation of section 1981. His employer fires him for making that complaint. If he did not have protection under section 1981 against retaliation, he would never have the opportunity to remedy that discriminatory promotion."

And firing somebody for -- in retaliation for making a complaint is not firing him on the basis of race. Indeed, the person making the complaint may not have been the person who was racially discriminated against. You would acknowledge that you couldn't fire -- if retaliations claims lie, you couldn't fire a white whistleblower who says this employer has been discriminating against blacks. Wouldn't that white whistleblower have a cause of action for being fired?"

What they say is when the white man helps the black man from being discriminated against, it falls within the statute, not because you've discriminated against the black man, but because if it didn't fall within the statute it would seriously erode or destroy the black man's right.

Just to sum up, because this Court in Sullivan and Jackson has recognized that persons who themselves were not victims of discrimination must be protected against retaliation when they advocate the rights of those victims; otherwise the underlying discrimination would go unchecked -- we are not asking the Court to do anything here that they haven't already done.

This Court in Patterson didn't say, are we going to infer a new cause of action for harassment? No. This Court interpreted the basic prohibition of 1981 and said it didn't cover harassment.

The other reason that you might think retaliation is not covered and the reason that the court of appeals, post-Patterson, pre-1991, thought that retaliation wasn't covered was simply that it was post-formation conduct.

First and foremost, we think that a 1982 precedent, if it governs Title IX, ought to a fortiorari govern 1981. But the second way we think this case is a fortiori from Jackson is that the same textual obstacles are not present here that the Jackson -- that the Jackson dissenters identified. You know, the Jackson dissenters didn't say that retaliation isn't a form of discrimination. They said it's not discrimination on the basis of sex. And if you look at the text of 1981(a), (b), and (c), you find that it's actually more capacious language, and you don't have the same problem. It doesn't say \"discrimination on the basis of race.\" Now, to be sure, we're not saying that 1981 isn't a race statute; of course it is. But those exact words don't appear and don't provide a stumbling block. And if you look at the form that 1981 takes, it doesn't take the form of an express prohibition of discrimination on the basis of race; it actually textually takes the form of a guarantee of equal treatment.

Second, this Court has a whole line of cases, including Tillman and Runyon, that treat 1982 cases as binding authority for section 1981 purposes.

They allow him to sue because he was expelled from the property owner's association after the fact. Now, why was he expelled from the property owner's association?

The point is somebody could sue for Sullivan's expulsion from the property owner's association. And I don't understand how that's anything other than a retaliation holding.
