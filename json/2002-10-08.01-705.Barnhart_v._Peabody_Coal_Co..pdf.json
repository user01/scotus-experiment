  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Coal Act states that the Commissioner of Social Security shall, before October 1st, 1993, assign each beneficiary to a signatory coal operator or related person that remains in business. That provision understood, in light of this Court's precedents, establishes the deadline that is mandatory but not jurisdictional. It does not deprive the commissioner of the power or the obligation to complete the assignments after that date, if necessary. That understanding comports with the text and structure of the Coal Act, as well as with -- with one of its central purposes, that to the maximum extent possible, each coal retiree's benefits would be paid for by a coal operator that actually employed that miner or a related person."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But that's not true. In fact, if later research has showed that somebody should have been assigned somewhere else, you -- you don't shift the beneficiaries. It -- it isn't the case that -- that this is designed to assure a perfect system in which somebody who is responsible, no matter that a mistake was made in the past, in the future that person will be reassigned the way he should be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Well, the statute does provide for administrative review of assignment so that a coal operator who was assigned a miner in error could challenge that before the commissioner, and if the commissioner found that the assignment was erroneous, the miner could be assigned to a -- a more appropriate coal operator. In addition, the regulations promulgated by the commissioner for the administrative review process allowed the commissioner herself to reopen an assignment if she found that it had been erroneous within a 1-year period."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What happens to someone who wasn't assigned before October 1st? They're -- they're not just left out in the cold, are they?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "No. Congress did provide a fallback position for all of those who weren't assigned by October 1st or -- or at any time because they had no former employer or related person who remained in business, and that is, that they will be treated as part of the unassigned beneficiary pool. The benefits for those miners are paid from an appropriation from the AML Fund, a fund originally created to ameliorate the problems of abandoned mines, and if that fund proves insufficient, the funds will come from a -- a premium imposed on all of the coal operators to whom beneficiaries who have been assigned."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Ms. McDowell, there -- there is a section, 9704(f)(2)(B), that deals with annual adjustment of unassigned premiums. And it says that if there's an assigned miner and the operator goes out of business in any given year, then that assigned miner becomes part of the pool. And it doesn't matter really whether the initial assignment was before the October 1 deadline or not. They just go into the pool in time. And that seems to work somewhat against your interpretation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "I think the situation addressed in that provision is quite different, even assuming that it unequivocally establishes that the commissioner couldn't reassign somebody after a company went into bankruptcy. But assignments at the outset of the process, the sorts of assignments that we're concerned with here, are quite different from an assignment after bankruptcy that could occur 20, 30, or 40 years down the road, and Congress may well have been interested only in achieving a correct initial assignment at the outset and not with continuing to readjust the assignments --"

    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Yes, that's correct. But the fact that the -- that Congress directed that the applicable percentage for calculating the assigned beneficiary premium shall be adjusted in certain circumstances doesn't suggest to us that Congress would not have permitted it to be adjust in other -- adjusted in other circumstances as well that Congress may not have explicitly contemplated at the time that the Coal Act was enacted. One of those was the fact that --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Well, there's -- there's no indication in the text or legislative history that that was contemplated. And indeed, since Congress was legislating in light of this Court's opinions in Pierce County and Montalvo-Murillo, the provision could not readily be understood as providing coal operators with that sort of assurance. In addition --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you -- you say Congress is legislating in light of our decision in Pierce County. You're -- you're just applying the general presumption that Congress does that? Certainly there's -- is there any indication here that Congress was legislating in light of Pierce County?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Congress didn't explicitly say so, no, but as, we have cited a number of statutes in our briefs that made clear that when Congress wants to terminate an agency's authority to make decisions at a particular point, Congress knows how to say so explicitly and it has done so in those situations. It has not done so here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, this is -- this is quite different than Pierce County, though, at least certainly on its facts. There you had a provision that the -- you're supposed to ferret out some sort of misappropriations and saying that the inspector general, whoever it was, was supposed to do it in 4 months. That's simply a message to the agency to get going. And we -- I think we said quite properly that didn't mean that you couldn't ferret out this sort of thing after the 4 months. But this thing has -- has somewhat different ramifications, I think."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Well, I think it's clear that Congress imposed deadlines, not only this deadline, but other deadlines in the statute, because it wanted to get the new funding mechanism established by the Coal Act into place. Congress wanted the assignments to be made promptly so that the Combined Fund could then send bills for premiums to assigned operators. But it wasn't essential to that scheme that every last assignment was made by October 1st, and there's no indication that Congress adopted the deadline in order to provide any sort of certainty to coal operators. To paraphrase the Court's decision in James Daniel Good, it would seem somewhat curious that a deadline that was intended to expedite the collection of premiums by the Combined Fund could be construed to prevent the Combined Fund in some circumstances from collecting premiums at all. And that's the effect of --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Oh, the statute doesn't itself impose a limit on the commissioner's authority. However, as a practical matter, the commissioner has not made initial assignments for more than 5 years now and has no intent to recommence them. Obviously, Congress can cut off the authority to do this at -- at any particular time by denying an appropriation for the process or by doing it explicitly."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would you tell us what percentage of the assignments were made after the deadline, and how long after the deadline was the most recent assignment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Yes. The -- to answer your last question first, the last one was made in 1997. Congress made a total of approximately -- rather, the commissioner made a total of approximately 40,000 assignments before the deadline, in addition to another 15,000, approximately, assignments that the coal operators had agreed to. After the deadline, the commissioner made 10,000 more assignments. A quarter of those were made in October 1993 or a handful in February 1994. The rest were made primarily in 1995 and 1996 and a few more, about 55, in 1997. And the process has been completed."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "When there is a reassignment or taking somebody out of the unassigned pool and attributing that person to an operator, does the operator who has now gotten the assignment have to pay interest for the period from October '93 on, or is it just that you pay now the bill that we would have sent you if we had charged you in '93?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What about the argument that the Social Security Administration stood before Congress and said, we can make this date? Then the operators who might be saddled with additional responsibility could breathe easily and say, well, we don't have to set up any reserve for the assignment of more operators to us."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Well, in fact, Your Honor, the commissioner didn't say we will make the deadline. The commissioner did express optimism in September of 1993 that the deadline could be complied with."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I thought there were quotations in the record that had an official from the Social Security Administration telling Congress we are going to do it. It was more than, it's a hope. I -- I don't have that at my fingertips now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "I think it could have been only an expression of hope in -- in September 1993, and then the operators would have received, in many cases, and -- and these respondents certainly did -- assignments of additional beneficiaries during October 1993, so that should have put them on notice to make inquiry as to precisely when the assignment had been made. I think a particularly more telling and -- and earlier statement from a -- an acting commissioner came in February 1993 when the acting commissioner was testifying before a House appropriations subcommittee. He said at that point that it did not appear that the assignments could be completed by the deadline. One Member of Congress asked, well, what is the -- the crucial date, then? When is it that beneficiaries will lose benefits if the assignments aren't made? And the acting commissioner went on to explain that, well, because there was a -- a $70 million transfer coming into the Combined Fund on October 1st, 1993 from the United Mine Workers 1950 pension fund, there would be money in the Combined Fund for some time to pay benefits, and that the assignments could be done on a rolling basis to bring money into the fund. So it was clearly understood at that point that there was no jurisdictional cutoff of the time to make assignments contemplated by the statute."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Ms. McDowell, what do you do with the provision of 9704(a)(3)(D) which makes an assigned operator's unassigned beneficiaries' premium equal to the operator's applicable percentage, which is defined as its percentage of total assigned beneficiaries, quote, \"determined on the basis of assignments as of October 1,"

  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "The statute then goes on to provide for adjustments in years after 1993 for two circumstances: when a change has been made as a result of the administrative review process, and when a change has been made as a result of coal operators going out of business."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor, but the fact that Congress said that these adjustments shall be made doesn't suggest that Congress did not intend to permit other appropriate adjustments to be made as well."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but what does -- what does suggest that is the language, determined on the basis of assignments as of October 1, 1993. And then there's no provision for -- elsewhere that would enable you to -- to make the other adjustment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Well, Congress was obviously contemplating, at the point that it enacted the statute, that the deadline would be made, satisfied. So it's -- it's therefore somewhat understandable that Congress didn't discuss all the permutations of what would happen if -- if the deadline was, in fact, not satisfied. And an additional point is even if one assumed that the unassigned beneficiary premium, the applicable percentage used to calculate it had to remain fixed as of October 1st, 1993, that doesn't really address the commissioner's assignment authority after that date, and it is not essential to the statute --"

You'd be paying based on the assumption that you only had X number of -- of permanent beneficiaries, but then your -- you'd be paying that premium, but then you have additional beneficiaries that you must take care of on their own account because they're assigned to you. So you -- so you are hurt if you can't -- if you can't change the formula."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DOWELL",
    "speech": "Well, I'm not sure that it would significantly change the -- the percentage of the whole that the operator would be required to pay for. But in any event, in practice the Combined Fund has gone back and taken subsequent assignments, just like subsequent reassignments, into account in calculating the applicable percentage, and the statutory scheme has worked quite satisfactorily in that respect."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would you clarify one thing for me? I don't know whether the -- the fallback position to finance the unassigned -- the benefits for the unassigned miners -- they -- there are two -- some money comes out of the first pension fund. Later it comes out of a Government fund. And then there's the third possibility that that money may run out and the miners will be assessed for the payment -- for the unassigned -- the companies will be assessed for the payments for the unassigned miners. Now, what is the Government's position with respect to a company that, say, had nobody assigned prior to the October date, but after the October date, say, 500 miners were assigned? Now, as I read the statute, that would mean the -- that company would have no responsibility to contribute to the payments for the unassigned miners. Am I right about that? Or would you adjust it based on post-October assignments?"

    "speaker": "DOWELL",

And, you know, it seems to me that you -- you've got to go the whole hog. You -- you've simply got to say that the -- the October 1 deadline has got to be read together with the shall clause, and if the shall clause can be varied, then the October 1 deadline can be varied, too, because otherwise you just get an incoherent system.

    "speech": "During those 3 plan years, the unassigned beneficiaries are paid for out of the transfers from the UMWA 1950 pension plan. Those were transfers that could not have been made but for the statute because pension benefits and the health benefits are different. And Congress intervened and said there will be $210 million moving into the Combined Fund from the pension plan. That money is used for unassigned beneficiaries' premiums. It's used for death benefit premiums, and for the first year and the first year only, it's used to reduced the assigned operators' assigned beneficiary premiums. So every time the number of unassigned beneficiaries goes up, a greater share of that $210 million must be used to pay for the unassigned beneficiaries. Less is left for death benefits and to defray the first year assigned beneficiary premiums, and accordingly, a supplemental assessment is made on all assigned operators when the number of unassigned beneficiaries goes up. That's part one. Part two. Beginning on October 1, 1995, Congress says that there shall be annual transfers from the interest earned by the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund established under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Now, obviously, you can't transfer interest that you don't have. The interest earned by the AML Fund has been declining. Interest rates have been going down, and accordingly, the interest rates that are earned by the fund goes down. The fund at one time earned $80 million a year in interest. It's now projected to earn only 30 in fiscal 2003. So there's a limit to how much can be transferred from the AML Fund. The third component. If the AML Fund transfer is not sufficient to pay for the beneficiaries, the unassigned beneficiaries, then there must be an unassigned beneficiary premium assessed against all assigned operators, thereby shifting the cost of these beneficiaries from these respondents to all assigned operators."

The trustees believe that the policy of the statute was to have the greatest possible amount paid for from the private sector by the employers who employed the beneficiaries, retired miners. And the trustees have been, in each of these cases, arguing that  the system ought to work the way Congress intended. Now, on the applicable percentage, I do want to say one thing in response to Justice Scalia's several questions on this, and that is, the \"as of\" language in the statute is very important. Every time there is a reassignment as a result of an administrative appeal, it's made as of October 1, 1993. Every time there's an initial assignment made after September 30, 1993, it's made as of October 1, 1993. They all go back to the beginning because these beneficiaries all need health care --"

All of these assignments, whether they're reassignments after administrative appeals, whether they're initial assignments during this period when the commissioner was finishing the assignment process, they all go back to the beginning. In fact, they go back to February 1, 1993 because that's the beginning of the first plan year. I might say there are many provisions in this statute that say do something by a date certain. The trustees had to be appointed by a date certain. The $70 million transfers from the '50 pension plan had to be by a date certain. The merger of the '50 benefit plan, the '74 benefit plan into the Combined Fund had to be by a date certain. Yet no one would argue that if any of those dates was missed, then there was no authority at all. And --"

    "speaker": "BUSCEMI",

As of the time of his declaration, there had been approximately $105 million worth of payments by various assigned operators who had received assignments, initial assignments of beneficiaries that were made after September 30, 1993. Those amounts would have to be refunded or credited. Indeed, the respondents in this case sought just such refunds or credits. If you look at Judge Kinneary's opinion, for example, in the Bellaire case in the appendix, he grants a credit to Bellaire in the amount of the payments that they made on behalf of the beneficiaries assigned to them."

  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The petitioners' position is that when Congress said shall before October 1st, 1993, it meant may before or after October 1st, 1993. That is so, according to the petitioners because, as they read the statute, Congress could not really have intended to limit the authority of the commissioner to make assignments under the act. But there is nothing implausible or even unusual about reading the statute to mean what it says. The consequence of not assigning a particular miner by the statutory deadline is that the miner is unassigned under the statute. The statute tells us what to do with unassigned miners. There is an elaborate backup provision, as the Solicitor General calls it, to deal with unassigned beneficiaries. First and foremost, they receive the same benefits as assigned miners."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Roberts, all I -- all that, I guess, is conceded in the argument, but the -- the -- when all is said and done, there seems to be an -- an inequity as among the operators. And I can understand your -- I do understand, I accept your argument that at least to get the plan going initially, that the objective of Congress would have been, as it were, a good system rather than a perfect system. What I don't see is why Congress would want -- would have wanted to make it impossible to improve on that system later by eliminating the -- the inequity of an erroneous failure to assign. And it's -- it's that issue that makes it difficult for me to read the -- the shall language as being, as -- as they say, jurisdictional or providing a cutoff. Can you address what the reason Congress would have had for wanting to preserve that inequity?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Certainly. First of all, from Congress's point of view, the overriding purpose is to continue benefits. That's taken care of. Second, the coal miners get the same benefits whether they're assigned or unassigned. Now, but the argument is this undermines the pay for your own principle. But the pay for your own principle itself is -- embodies rough justice. A company that employs a miner for 2 years pays for all his benefits. Another company may have employed him for 25 years. That's the compromise that was agreed to and that's fine. But it doesn't mean that this pay for your own principle is some unqualified desideratum that you can assume Congress intended to pursue at all costs in perpetuity. We know that's not the case. They had a deadline and they imposed it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But, Mr. Roberts, didn't you omit one of the other statutory purposes, which was, insofar as possible, to assign responsibility for paying the benefits to the company that had the best, the closest connection with that particular miner?"

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Yes, and we know that was, for example, not a purpose they wanted to pursue ueber alles. If a company goes bankrupt, those miners --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it was one of the major purposes, was it not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It was one of the purposes, yes, and it was one that Congress said, spend a year trying to make these assignments. But then we've got to launch this fund and -- What is really going on here is that the commissioner wants to do a different sort of job than Congress delegated to her. This is the sort of project -- and I think this is a critical distinction from the deadlines in Pierce County and those sorts of cases. The agency could have done a reasonably good job on this project in 4 months, a better job in a year, maybe a nearly perfect job in 5 years. Congress said, we want the 1-year version. Why do we want the 1-year version and not the nearly perfect version? Because the miners are going to get the same benefits either way. Coal companies or funds established by coal companies are going to pay for them either way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And the specific hypothetical that troubles me -- let me put it right out on the table. Supposing a company had no assignments made to its prior miners until after October 1st. If I understand the system correctly, at the end of the line, if they have to finance the payments for the unassigned miners out of a -- a pool contributed to by the operators, that company will not have to contribute to that pool."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And even though that there was -- you say there's rough justice. This is making it even -- even more rough, and if the companies are not paying the proportion of the -- of the benefits that the statutory scheme requires. They're paying more."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "And Congress knew there was some unfairness in requiring the companies to pay for unassigned beneficiaries, and it cushioned that unfairness by saying we're going to draw from this AML Fund that coal operators established earlier. That will -- it has to date ensured that there is no unassigned beneficiaries --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but Mr. -- let me just interrupt you as to your answer to Justice Kennedy. It's true for the first and second stages that it doesn't matter, but if you have to go to the third stage where the unassigned miners are paid by the companies, then what he says is absolutely right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "If you have to get to the third stage where there's an unassigned beneficiaries premium assessed, yes. It's done pro rata. And Peabody Coal, for example, will have a very sizeable bill if that reaches it because they have over 4,000 assigned miners. This case is about 330 miners who were assigned after October 1st. But the point is not whether you could write a funding mechanism that is more equitable or fair. It's a question of whether that's the one that Congress wrote. Congress --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What is the harm? That is to say, as you agree -- I think we both agree there are many statutes with deadlines in them. There are regulatory statutes set, health regulations by such and such a date set, consumer, trucking regulations. And the courts regularly set that those dates, even though they use words like shall, are not fixed because obviously Congress wanted the regulations written, even if late. Well, here they're saying this is roughly the same thing. Obviously, Congress would have wanted this assigned in the principle of pay for your own way, and nobody is hurt by doing that late. Nobody is really hurt. Now, I want you to reply to that. What's the down side of trying to interpret this like we'd interpret other regulatory statutes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well -- well, it's not like the other regulatory statutes, first of all, because it's an extraordinary grant of the authority to impose retroactive liability. The grant exists nowhere other than in the same sentence that says shall. I think that's quite different than saying, EPA, in 2 years issue clean air regulations. That's -- that's a different case. And Pierce County is quite different. I think the Government probably has inherent authority to recover misspent funds. The harm is the same harm that comes from disregarding any kind of deadline. As I said, this is the sort of project you can spend 20 years on and always come up with a more perfect assignment. Congress knew that. They knew that a significant amount of work was involved. They had to go and set up an interim funding system for February to October to give the commissioner time. The commissioner came back and said, we've done it. We've completed the project."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That is -- how? How were you hurt specifically by the delay compared with if they had done it all perfectly within 5 minutes? Imagine they got the same assignments on time. Now imagine they got them late, and how are you hurt by that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Oh, sure. Well, it's the same concern the Court noted last term in the Sigmon Coal case. The coal industry is characterized by a significant amount of transactions, mergers, acquisitions. You could be looking at acquiring a coal company, and of course, given the nature of the industry, the first question you ask is what is your liability, and they're going to say, well, it's this much. And then you -- then the -- the merger or the acquisition takes place, and then you get another notice, here are, you know, 40 new miners. And now, all of a sudden, it's this much. That was a significant concern in Sigmon Coal, and it is significant in this instance as well."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But, Mr. Roberts, on the other hand, you are, in fact your companies are paying less than they would have paid had they been billed properly on time because you have had the use of the money in the interim, and Ms. McDowell said you're not being charged any interest because you're paying in 19 -- or any adjustment for inflation because you get to pay in 19-whatever, '97 dollars a bill that was due from October 1993 and you don't get charged any interest on that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I don't think interest is a significant factor just the way the interest rates have been over this time period. It certainly doesn't do much to cushion the unfairness and inequity of getting a bill retroactive as much as 5 years."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But my -- my point is simply had you gotten that bill, that -- timely, it would have been more costly than getting the bill later because you have had the use of the money in the interim."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "The -- the interest is apparently not -- not charged."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Unless you're -- unless you're a company that had bought a company which, which had that switch pulled, in which case you're -- you're out of pocket a good deal. Despite the fact that you're -- that it's less money than -- than would have been charged originally, it's coming out of your pocket when you bought a coal company that you did not believe had that liability."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "And the -- the key factor that such transactions play in this particular industry may well explain why you don't see any companies on this side of the case. I think it's always wise to be skeptical of fairness arguments that are raised by proxy. There are no companies complaining about, oh, we're going to end up potentially paying a higher pro rata assessment than otherwise because -- a number of reasons. Again, Congress cushioned the unfairness; they recognized it by making the AML Fund available. Second of all, this is a statute that is suffused with concepts of rough justice. It is not necessarily a more perfect result to pursue 5 years instead of 1 year to pay for your own principle. That does not necessarily lead to a more perfect result. It may mean that more companies who employed miners for 2 years are paying over all of those benefits than companies -- when companies who employed the same miner for 20 years don't have to pay for any. But the critical --"

    "speech": "Because there's a specific exception that allows reassignments. There's no exception for reassignments. And, I would point out, there is no provision that allows changes in the case of an unassigned miner, and that is what has been going on here primarily. The commissioner has been revisiting the unassigned pool, and that's why this is quite different from a lot of the other deadline cases. This is -- we think the commissioner did get the job done on time. She just wants to do a different job."
  },

    "speech": "Well, I think the commissioner did get the work done on time. It's just she just wants to do a more perfect job. And what I'm saying is it's reasonable for Congress to determine we don't need the more perfect job. We need a good-enough job. And this job is good enough to get the fund launched. The one thing that's clear is that the way the petitioners read the statute, if that had been proposed when the Coal Act was -- was enacted, it never would have gotten off the ground. The idea of giving the commissioner significant discretion on an open-ended timetable was certainly not in the cards. This is the legislative equivalent of trench warfare, parties fighting over every inch. They had the black lung model which did give the Secretary of Labor significant discretion in allocating responsibility for that consequence of -- of the -- of coal mining, and they wanted nothing to do with it. That's why --"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How -- how do we know this, Mr. Roberts? I -- I take it there's no helpful statement in the legislative history saying, you know, by the way, this is, you know, the linchpin of the deal, that with respect to unassigned miners, there will be no monkeying around after October 1st, '93?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I think we know it primarily -- no. There's no statement like that. I think we know it from the structure of the statute which is carefully reticulated. There is no delegation of discretion to the commissioner. The compromises in the statute are spelled out. And when you talk about revisiting fairness, keep in mind you're looking at one particular provision and you say, well, that looks unfair. It may be because another provision that's not at issue balances that out. This is, as the Court noted in Sigmon, an instance of legislative horse trading and log rolling, and they're setting up a system and everybody has to pitch in some. The older pension funds pitched in some. The operators pitched in. Congress came forward with the AML Fund, and it moved forward. And it had to be in place by October 1st or the wheels would have fallen off. This is not a deadline of the sort you've got 120 days to issue a decision. Thank you, Your Honor."

The commissioner would agree that she had no option of assigning these miners to nonsignatories or to assigning them to people that were out of business or to not following the statutory prescribed order of priority. It's one term, shall. As the Court made it clear in another deadline case, Mohasco, we're going to assume the same word has the same meaning throughout and --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SUTTON",

In effect, it says, if there hasn't been an assignment to an operator, this is where the person goes for purposes of this tripartite calculation. But the fact that there may be a default provision in the case of -- of inaction, I don't think necessarily is -- is equivalent to saying that there is a provision for all time about what shall happen. It's just that their immediate object was there had to be a grouping of these miners as of October 1 or there would have been no way to calculate the -- the sources of the -- the various assessments to pay for it. But that -- all that does is say, okay, you've got a default in place -- default position -- provision in place so that you know what to do as of October 1. But it doesn't answer the -- the question here."

Of the 10,000 people that have been reassigned, i.e., original assignments after the date, 7,500 are folks that the commissioner originally did, quote, \"designate\" in the unassigned pool. They reviewed the records. They looked at them. They said, we can't find anyone to whom they belong. They're going to the unassigned pool. Now, the proof that Congress contemplated that possibility is exactly the administrative review provisions we've been talking about. What were they about? Fact error. And so they were aware of --"

    "speaker": "SUTTON",
    "speech": "20,000 were initially decided. If you look at the Herrin affidavit at JA179 to 184, it specifically says that 20,000 were initially designated unassigned. And this proves Mr. Roberts' point that what's going on here is not a missed deadline case. They met the deadline. What's going on is they decided to reinvent the task."

Out of that 20,000, 7,500 later they decided we can do a better job with that. And our point -- our point is -- I mean, there's a cost-benefit analysis here. Congress could have said, Commissioner of Social Security, you can keep doing this into perpetuity until you get the job just right. They didn't say that."

If I could just step back for one second, I think this, I hope, puts the 1992 decision in context. Through -- from 1946 forward, they paid for these benefits in two ways. One was pay for your own. The employer paid for his or her employee. And the second one was pay as a group. They've been doing that through -- since 1946. That's what the AML tax does. That's on all coal companies."

When I say the wheels fall off the statute, if they didn't get this job done by October 1st, they've got a very serious problem on their hands because the statutory beginning that starts on that date is they began sending out these premium requirements. The first ones went out on October 22nd, 1993. And if they hadn't done a sufficient number, you wouldn't have enough money to pay for their benefits. You'd be back --"

    "speaker": "SUTTON",
    "speech": "Those were used primarily for unassigned. They were used some to help with assigned, but most were used to pay for unassigned benefits. So that's the point I'm making there. I'd like to make a point about Pierce County that I think is helpful in thinking about deadline cases in general. Here's why we're not saying that when a statute says you must complete this FOIA request in 20 days, our -- our case would control it. In Pierce County, as in that situation, these governmental agencies have preexisting general grants of authority to do these acts; i.e., go get misspent Federal funds. There are general statutes. There was one in Pierce County. If you look at page 257 of Pierce County, the plaintiff conceded there was otherwise jurisdiction to get this money. Here -- and so what Pierce County means is we're not going to say there's a repeal by implication of that general grant of authority merely because we now have another statute that says do it quickly, get it done. That's not this case. 9706(a) is the only provision either petitioner has pointed to that gives you this grant of authority. So the grant comes with a limit."

One of them is that they apply -- there's no contingency plan if you miss. Here we've got a contingency plan. That's one inference. The second is they all regulate private entities. This goes back to the point I just made about Pierce County. If a private entity is told do something by this date, they don't do it, a court clearly has authority to say, we said do it by this date, do it. They had -- they had -- you don't have a authority problem with a private entity. They can do what they want. With the Government, however, and particularly when it comes to these extraordinary retroactive assignments of liability, the commissioner is not born with that authority. It's not inappropriate to ask the Government to turn square corners in that kind of a setting as opposed to a setting where they're merely exercising a general power to get misspent Federal funds, fulfill a FOIA request. There --"
