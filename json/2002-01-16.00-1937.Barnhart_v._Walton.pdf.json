You would have to look back for the entire period covered by the application and decide if any moment during that period it could have been possible, reasonably but mistakenly thought, that his disability would last 6 months. That type of determination is entirely foreign to the law. And it's also inconsistent with the purpose of the can be expected to last prong. That exists precisely because, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, the Commissioner needs to be able to adjudicate claims before 12 months goes by.

You don't disregard evidence that is recently arriving merely because at some earlier time you would have made a mistake. And that is also -- I'm sorry.

It does not matter that, in fact, that the administrator, or in this case the Commissioner, used those procedures after the claim was adjudicated because we know that after the thoroughness consideration and using the notice and comment procedures, the Commissioner came to the same conclusion, that in fact the best reading of the statute is the one that the Commissioner has adhered to for 45 years and through repeated amendments to the statute."

Disability means an inability to gain -- to engage in any substantial -- substantial gainful activity. It doesn't say how long that disability has to -- it could be, you know, a week-long inability. And then it goes on, by reason of any mentally -- medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for 12 months.

Your Honor, what -- I believe that the problem with the court of appeals' approach of severing the two -- requirements of an impairment the fact that the impairment must last 12 months and that the impairment must be one that is of disabling severity -- is that it does not -- it does not eliminate an ambiguity but creates one. Even if we were to severe those two entirely and to say that the only the -- that only the impairment must last 12 months, it's clear that the impairment must be of disabling severity for some period of time because it would be absurd to suggest you're entitled to benefits for a minute or a second or actually, Justice Scalia, with all due respect, in my view for the week that you suggest. Given that there is an implied duration of some time for the severity, that it must be severe enough to preclude substantial gainful activity for some period of time, it is up to the Commissioner to choose the period which makes the most sense, is most consistent with the statutory structure and Congress' intent. There are other indicia of -- of the structure of the statute that make it clear that Congress was not contemplating short-term disabilities such as a week. For example, the statute does not terminate benefits just at the moment when you are able to return to work. Benefits, instead, continue for an additional 2 months following that. If the statute is, as the Commissioner supposes, a long-term disability statute, that makes sense because those 2 months of additional payments give you a time to transition back to work, to get ready to work to find a job. If in fact the statute is, as the court of appeals has construed it, a short-term disability statute where benefits are payable when you're out only for a week, as Justice Scalia suggested, that would mean that an individual who is out of work for a week, because of a chronic condition like asthma, anxiety, arthritis, and numerous ones that last a year or more, would be entitled to 2 months of benefits plus the one week for which they are briefly out. It's hard to believe that that was the type of statute that Congress had envisioned. In addition, that -- that view is supported by -- the repeated amendments to the statute that Congress repeated amendments to the definition of disability against the backdrop of the Commissioner's now 45-year- old settled construction. Years after the Commissioner first adopted her construction of the statute in 1957, in 1965 Congress amended the statute, and when Congress did so, it did not merely leave in place the Commissioner's by-then settled construction, instead Congress reiterated that construction in the committee reports that were -- accompanying it accompanying the amendments and described the act in precisely the same terms that the Commissioner had through the regulations. -- Congress, in fact, rejected a proposal actually a bill -- from the House of Representatives that would have shortened the duration requirement instead of to 12 months to 6 months, and the stated reason for rejecting that 6-month period was a disability -- it would not be sufficient to preclude the payment of benefits for short-term disabilities. Instead, as the committee reports stated, it was necessary to require that the -- individual be under a disability for a period of more of longer than 6 months. Instead, Congress meant to require that the individual be completely and totally disabled throughout a continuous period of 12 months. Under the court of appeals --"

And yet, this person, through no fault of his own -- it's kind of haphazard, by chance the one -- who will make it and because it's based on a prediction, and the one who maybe -- maybe the Social Security office is backlogged. What is the reason for the disparity in time of adjudication?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMKEN",
      "speech": "In fact, Your Honor, there were two adjudications in this case in a very short period of time within the filing of benefits. The benefit claim was filed in March and April and in the -- there was an initial adjudication on May 18th, basically just over 30 days after the April application was filed. In that adjudication, a licensed psychiatrist determined that Mr. Walton was, in fact, able to engage in substantial gainful activity and that his impairment was not severe enough. -- He sought reconsiderations in June, and there a decision was issued in August. These are very short time frames, and they are not atypical. Typically these types of claims are processed in less than 90 days for the initial adjudication. Now, regrettably there will be occasions, as in all areas of law, where the outcome is affected by the timing of the decision. And that is true because sometimes evidence develops in the interim which would allow one person to prevail where, if the adjudication had happened earlier, they would not have known about that evidence and the result would have been different. But the fact that some individuals may get a windfall and become entitled to benefits based on an erroneous prediction of expectation does not mean that the Commissioner is required to reach an erroneous result when adjudicating a claim where he has actual evidence that the individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity, as occurred here. In this case there is evidence that the individual was able to engage successfully in working for 2 solid years, and the Commissioner is not required to ignore that probative, indeed dispositive evidence simply because the Commissioner might have made a mistake had the claim been adjudicated earlier."

When one considers the number of medical conditions that persist for 12 months that are capable of disabling somebody for a short period of time, it clearly would have the effect of establishing a short-term benefits program that Congress did not intend to create. In fact, we are advised that approximately 38 percent of all Americans have an impairment -- a medical condition which is chronic in the sense that it will last 12 months that is capable of preventing them from working for short periods of time. And -- when construing the definition of disability, it is less plausible to believe that Congress intended to pull in so many Americans and to make all of their periods of absence of work on account of conditions like asthma, angina, arthritis, bad backs, and the like which -- and turn them into disabilities."

The plain language of the statutes and the early legislative history demonstrate that from the inception of the disability program, Congress has balanced its desire to restrict payment of benefits to only those with long- term severe impairments with its intention to encourage disabled persons to try to work. The Commissioner's policy, in sharp contrast, ignores the work incentive prong of Congress' careful balancing act, focusing only on the desire to restrict payment of benefits even to those who suffer with clearly disabling impairments if they manage to attempt to work with great courage and determination and, despite continuing severe impairment, within 12 months of the onset of their disability."

And I think that's the only logical reading of that, which is what the Fourth Circuit found because otherwise you're saying that the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity can -- can result in death, and that really doesn't make any sense. To read -- read it as the Commissioner would have you do is -- it seems to me is contrary to the most fundamental rule of statutory construction, that Congress must be assumed to mean what it says in the statute and that when the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it should be enforced according to its terms."

Substantial evidence which demonstrates that as determined on the basis of new or improved diagnostic techniques, the individual's impairment or combination of impairments is not as disabling as it was considered to be at the time of the most recent prior decision the he or she was under a disability, and that therefore the individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity.

And they went on to say that they wanted to be assured -- assured that only long-lasting impairments were covered and that that provision was not inconsistent with efforts towards rehabilitation because it, quote, refers only to the duration of the impairment and does not require prediction of continued inability to work. End quote. Those -- that's the first time Congress defined what disability is. And it seems to me from the very beginning, they make clear that they wanted to encourage people to work, and -- and they did that by requiring that the impairment be expected to last 12 months, but not requiring that the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity lasts 12 months. I believe Congress' judgment is expressed unambiguously in the statutory language and is -- and that's confirmed by the legislative history and that it must not be disturbed simply because the Commissioner's -- longstanding policy is at variance with with that purpose. I would acknowledge that legislative history can be read both ways, but it seems to me that the contemporaneous legislative history, when Congress first considered the definition of disability, should be given more weight and more weight even than that is the express language of the statute."

I believe that should properly be addressed to Congress. But secondly, I think that that -- those figures are based on a number of flawed assumptions. Number one, Mr. Walton has never suggested that he is entitled to indefinite payment of benefits while engaged in substantial gainful activity. Once his trial work period ends, that work can then be considered and his benefits would be cut off. In addition, someone whose condition has medically improved, unlike Mr. Walton, could -- be terminated from benefits prior to that, even before even during the trial work period. Secondly, the Government seems to assume that all those cases which have been denied on durational grounds in the past would be approved under the Fourth Circuit's ruling. That is far from the case. A person must still have an impairment which is expected to last 12 months and that impairment must still meet the severity requirement. Third, there have been acquiescence rulings in effect for several years, applying the McDonald case in the Seventh Circuit since 1988, the Walker case in the Tenth Circuit since 1992, the Newton case in the Eighth Circuit since 1998, and the Salamalekis case in the Sixth Circuit since late 2000."

My client was found twice by the administrative law judge as being -- having a listing-level impairment. So, by definition, he met the severity requirement and he met that at the time of both hearings, the second of which was more than 2 and a half years after its onset date."

Once you no longer have a severe impairment, I would agree that you can -- your benefits can be terminated. But it does not require that -- that at the outset there must be an expectation that it will persist at that level of severity for the entire 12 months. And I believe that the legislative history gives the reason for that. Congress wanted to balance its desire to restrict payment of benefits with its desire to encourage people to try to go back to work. The Commissioner's policy has the opposite effect. It tells people stay home for 12 months or at least until your case is adjudicated, before you try to work. I believe that's a clear disincentive for people like my client who are -- who are attempting to work despite the fact that their impairment remains severe."

There is no question in this case that Cleveland Walton would have been paid disability benefits long ago had he merely stayed home until after his hearing and not tried to work. Instead, he has been penalized for his courage and his motivation in trying to work despite his continuing listing-level impairment. The Commissioner's policy violates the express language of the statute. It is contrary to the legislative history of the disability program and to longstanding agency regulations. And it has been repeatedly rejected by courts of appeals and district courts throughout the Nation. The Commissioner's policy is also contrary to sound public policy concerns which are are reflected both in the legislative history and in the case law. Accordingly, the Commissioner's unlawful and ill-advised policy should be rejected so that other highly motivated disabled persons like Cleveland Walton will not be penalized in the future for their good faith efforts to work. I'd be happy to address any other questions you might have."

      "speech": "Thank you, Ms. Pryor. Mr. Lamken, you have 4 minutes remaining."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMKEN",
      "speech": "I would like to begin by addressing the 5-month trial work -- excuse me -- the 5-month waiting period. And it's important to emphasize that for a very large and important component of the Social Security program, the SSI program, the Supplemental Security Income disability program, there is no 5-month waiting period. So, for anyone who's applying for SSI disability income, they -- that person, under respondent's and the court of appeals' interpretation, would be entitled to benefits for a very brief period of inability to work so long as the underlying medical condition, such as asthma or arthritis, can be expected to last or has lasted 12 months. It is in view of the structure of the act, including the continuation of the payments for 2 months after the disability ceases, hard to believe that that was what Congress had in mind. Second, I should emphasize that the 5-month waiting period isn't part of the definition of disability. What it is is it operates like a deductible. It provides a period of time during which the individual bears the burden of their disability themselves and saves the Government the -- saves the Government money that would have to be paid for that individual. But it does not determine what is a disability. It only determines what period of disability will be paid for and compensated by the Government. I'd like to also turn to mention for a moment the legislative history. The legislative history upon which respondent relies is for a separate program enacted 2 years before the disability program at issue here. The disability program issued in 1956. When Congress enacted it, it clearly understood that the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity, the disability itself, was going to have to last the requisite duration and not merely the medical -- not merely the medical condition. And when Congress changed the duration from long, continued, and indefinite, which was the original term, to 12 months, it specifically understood that the 12-month period applied to the impairment at a disabling level of severity. And the -- the Senate report, which is quoted on page 36 of our brief, makes that lucid. It states that the act, as amended, would provide for disability benefits for an insured worker who has been or can be expected to be totally disabled throughout a continuous period of 12 calendar months, and a 6-month period was rejected specifically because it would provide benefits for short- term disabilities. Finally, in terms of incentives, the incentive to return to work before there is an actual disability is properly addressed by the Commissioner's unsuccessful work attempt regulations. In addition, the court of appeals' construction is an overbroad response that actually deters returning to work because it would provide benefits not merely to those like Mr. Walton who have a long-term impairment that briefly disables them and then heroically return to work, but also those who have a long-term impairment that briefly disables them and do not actually return to work. The vast majority of applicants who seek benefits do not return to work, and those -- and those individuals would receive benefits despite an ability to return to work and their failure to do so. If there are no further questions."
