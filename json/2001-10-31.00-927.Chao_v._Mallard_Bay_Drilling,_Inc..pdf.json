And therefore, with respect to those, all the working conditions are covered either by the specifics or by the general, and the OSH Act does not apply.

And the vessel operators are well aware of what regulations apply to them. But -- but on all uninspected vessels, it doesn't really matter whether it's little or more, because the way the statutory scheme works is that the Coast Guard regulations that govern them apply to them. And the OSHA standards apply to the extent that the working conditions are not covered by Coast Guard regulations.

And so, there aren't -- there aren't any gaps where workers would be unprotected that the OSH Act would need to -- to step in. But on uninspected vessels, the -- the situation is quite -- quite the reverse and almost the polar opposite where there aren't just little gaps, but there are potentially whole vessels that are almost completely unregulated with respect to occupational safety and health. So, the industry-wide exemption that the Fifth Circuit has crafted here would, as a result, leave many workers unprotected from many hazardous conditions and -­ and really frustrate the express purpose of the act which is to assure, insofar as possible that every working man and woman in the Nation has safe and healthful working conditions. And moreover, to -- even if there was any ambiguity about how the statutory scheme should work, from looking at its text and from looking at the -- and from the fundamental purpose of the act, the Secretary has interpreted the act this way for 30 years. It's been the Secretary's longstanding and consisted view. It's reflected in citations over those 30 years and regulations that the Secretary promulgated in 1972 in a statutorily mandated report to Congress on coordination between the OSH Act and other laws that the Secretary submitted in 1980.

But to go back to Justice O'Connor's question, that is not even required by the Coast Guard for preemption purposes. The Coast Guard has a statute -- the OSH Act, 4(b)(1) reads that it will not apply to working conditions that are -- so long as the other Federal agency exercises statutory authority. The Coast Guard has exercised statutory authority. It's not a question of degrees in the statute. It's not light exercise, moderate exercise, or heavy exercise.

It's not for this Court to step in and give OSHA -- carve out exception after exception where there are no express regulations. If I may refer to Justice Kennedy's question, he's -- you're absolutely correct. OSHA gets -- OSHA gets their jurisdiction in this case from a memorandum of understanding, a peace treaty, an informal memorandum that is not a delegation of law. That memorandum says, Your Honor -- it says -- the memorandum of understanding says nothing in this MOU pertains to uninspected vessels. That's what it says. That does not disclaim Coast Guard regulation of inspected vessels, nor does it cede to the Government jurisdiction over uninspected vessels.

If it finds violations, finds situations that indicate violations of other agency laws, it coordinates with those agencies, as it did here, and those agencies take appropriate enforcement action.

Supposing two agencies, just the two Secretaries or whoever is representing, sit down and say, let's -- let's just divide up this area -- there can be some conflict -- and just sign a very simple understanding that, you know, you regulate A and I'll regulate B.

      "speech": "None whatsoever, Your Honor. We rely -- we rely on the text of -- of section 4(b)(1) which is -- is quite clear that it displaces the OSH Act with respect to particular working conditions. That's in stark contrast to the Fifth Circuit's holding here that there's an industry-wide exemption for all seamen on all vessels from the OSH Act. That's the approach that respondent endorses, admitting that regulation of the toilets would preempt regulation of the act altogether, and that you don't even need to regulate that, that -- that the OSH Act simply doesn't apply because respondent mistakenly believes that the Coast Guard has authority, plenary authority, under section 2, when the Coast Guard has never interpreted section 2 to give it plenary authority. And it's repeatedly gone back to Congress to get specific authority to address specific issues on particular uninspected vessels, and Congress has given the Coast Guard that authority, which indicates that neither Congress nor the Coast Guard thought section 2 gave it that authority. The -- the Secretary's view that the Coast Guard has to regulate the particular working conditions at issue in order to displace the OSH Act is supported by the text. It's supported by the purpose of the act. It's been the Secretary's longstanding view. It's been followed by all the other circuits except for the Fifth Circuit. The Second Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, with due respect to the maritime expertise in the Fifth Circuit, those circuits also have a great deal of maritime -- of maritime expertise. And the working conditions here, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, are not maritime-specific. They're matters over which OSHA has expertise, and 4(b)(1) allows the Coast Guard to step in and displace the OSH Act when it has authority and when it believes that its expertise warrants it to address the particular working conditions that are at issue. The Coast Guard doesn't have authority here. It hasn't exercised authority here, and the OSH Act applies here."

A drilling vessel that went to the Outer Continental Shelf, in most cases, would be an inspected mobile oil drilling unit, which the Coast Guard has comprehensive regulations covering. The Coast Guard also has regulations specifically addressed to all facilities at the Outer Continental Shelf which include a general duty clause, similar to the OSHA general duty clause, that requires that work places there be free of -­ of recognized hazards. In addition, the Interior Department has some regulatory authority out there specifically related to mineral drilling."
