      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: This case presents a narrow but important issue, and it concerns how this Court determines the threshold question of whether a statute is civil or criminal. This threshold inquiry is important because it establishes what constitutional rules apply to a statute and that the statute must satisfy, and also what constitutional protections are available to people who are subject to the statute. It also is important because this same threshold inquiry applies to many kinds of statutes, not just statutes such as Washington's, providing for the commitment of sexually violent predators. It applies to numerous statutes, including others that deal with confinement such as more generalized civil commitment laws, commitments for drug or alcohol treatment, statutes such as quarantine statutes, and statutes relating to pretrial detention. In this case, the Ninth Circuit rejected the principle that whether a law is civil or criminal is a threshold question based on legislative intent and the face of the statute. Instead, the Ninth Circuit held that Washington's admittedly civil law may be divested of its civil nature and converted into a criminal law if conditions of confinement at Washington's Special Commitment Center are punitive. In other words, the Ninth Circuit held that the fundamental nature of a law as either civil or criminal may vary and that the same statute may be both civil and criminal at different times and in different places. The Ninth Circuit's decision is fundamentally wrong. It conflicts with the holding of this Court in Hudson v. United States. It doesn't serve --"

First, that Hudson stands for the proposition and reaffirms the notion that the effects test for whether a statute is civil or criminal is a facial test, and having given you that answer, I believe that what the effects test, or what that language means, is what are the necessary consequences of the very statutory provisions that whether it's Congress or State legislature has provided. That would be the effects."

The other thing that I think answers, or helps answer that, Your Honor, is that Washington's law, just like Kansas' law, is a civil commitment statute, and once having enacted a civil commitment statute, there are certain consequences that fall from that for a State, and among them is to provide care more considerate than one would receive or is constitutionally entitled to receive in a penal institution."

Justice Kennedy's question with regard to the evidence about Mr. Young's mental abnormality, the testimony was that from the single State psychologist was that he has a paraphilia not otherwise specified. He also has a personality disorder not otherwise specified, neither of which, standing alone, would support the prediction that the psychologist was required to make, but by combining the two, by 51 percent he would say that Mr. Young would be dangerous. There's no evidence of volitional control or the lack of volitional control. There's no jury instruction. There's no requirement about that whatsoever and, as the DSM makes clear, simply having a disorder in the DSM does not make any indication about lack of volitional control. With regard to the question about the evidence below --"

We have argued that in the State court and lost, that that volitional control element is required, and as the amicus brief suggests, that remains potentially unclarified by the Hendrix opinion, but in Washington that testimony was sufficient. I think it's important to point out with regard to the testimony, to the decision in the superior court below in Mr. Young's case at the joint appendix, page 61, the trial court applied to Mr. Young a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in order to show that the effect of the statute was unconstitutional. The judge did find that we proved by a preponderance of the evidence that certain conditions were less than treatment and greater than prison and so forth but, since she applied to us beyond reasonable doubt, we lost. In the Campbell case, which is pending cert in this Court, a judge found that in fact the conditions were unconstitutional, so that needs to be clarified, I suggest."

That's what's important, and the remedy is that those conditions that made the Hendrix statute civil do not pertain to your client, then the law of Washington is violated, and therefore your client has an excellent remedy. Either the Hendrix majority conditions apply, or they do not. If they do apply, you can't complain -- on my -- I was in dissent. But if they don't apply -- if they don't apply, well then, you have a perfect remedy, so what's the problem with that, from the point of view of the law?"

      "speaker": "BORUCHOWITZ",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I think there are many problems with it. This Court, of course, has not interpreted the Washington statute. You only interpreted the Kansas statute, and all three opinions in Hendrix focused on the conditions of confinement. The majority said, no one here is claiming that there's punitive conditions. No one here is claiming that Mr. Hendrix is not treated as a civilly committed person, and so we look at that and we decide it's not punitive. Justice Kennedy suggested that if, in fact, it turns out that treatment is a sham, then the decision would go the other way, and the dissent focused heavily on conditions and showed that treatment was not, in fact, there, so my suggestion is that this Court over and over and over again in a series of cases has looked at how a statute is implemented. In the Allen v. Illinois case this Court said this would be a different case if somebody had claimed that there was punitive conditions. Most recently in Gardner v. Jones this Court, in evaluating an ex post facto claim, said, we're going to remand this case because there wasn't enough discovery done below about what's actually going on, and what the Court said is that the respondent must show that, as applied to his own case, his own sentence, the law created a risk of ex post facto, and also said in Gardner, when the rule does not by its own terms show a significant risk, the respondent must demonstrate by evidence drawn from the rules practical implementation in his case. As long ago as Yerkwo v. Hopkins, that's the position that the Court took, that a statute that was on its face neutral, but that was as-applied with, as the Court put it, an unequal eye, or an evil eye, an unequal hand, that --"

Let's assume that criminality of the statute's character is not a shifting and springing quality.

You might win, you might lose, but it seems to me you have those already in the lower courts, and we don't need a remand on this case to give you those. That's where I'm confused.

I think it's important to point out, in response to what Justice Ginsburg asked earlier, Mr. Young has claimed that this statute was being punitively applied, and that in fact it was punitive in purpose from the very beginning. He brought a personal restraint petition before he even has his trial in State court, so he has made this claim from the very beginning, both that the effect of this statute illuminates the punitive purpose, and that the effect itself is punitive.

This was not what the Court described in Hendrix, of a psychiatric facility with 31 hours a week of treatment.

I thought we had the latter issue, not the issue whether he should be able to prove, or could prove that it was in constitutional terms unlike Hendrix in a criminal statute."

That's something we haven't reached yet, but I would think that would be the first question for the judge to decide. What nature of evidence do I take?

First of all, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, Hendrix was decided affecting Hendrix alone and, as you suggested in dissent, if the concern that Justice Kennedy had in his concurrence about the, either potential of the sham treatment or the imprecision of mental abnormality, were to come true, that in fact due process implications would be raised as well, as you put it in your dissent. So I think all three opinions in Hendrix looked at the condition of confinement and, of course, did not look at the Washington statute. You have not looked at the Washington statute, and that's not your function today, because what you're being asked to do is whether the court of appeals remand was correct or not. Now, along the way, you have to examine the question of how do we go about making that decision, and initially you look at the face of the statute, but that's not enough. The civil label is not enough, you've said over and over again, and what you do then is, you look beyond that to the purpose and effect. Has it been implemented in such a way that the effect is punitive? If it's punitive, then double jeopardy and ex post facto --"

Hudson was a question involving fines and debarment imposed by the Controller of the Currency. Hudson was decided 6 months after Hendrix, doesn't even mention it, let alone purport to overrule it. This Court has over 100 years of history, in many, many different areas of the law, of looking at how a statute is implemented to determine its constitutionality."

In Gardner, we look at the implementation as applied to him. He has to put on evidence of as-applied to him. And in Young, all we're asking for is what the Ninth Circuit ordered, which is our opportunity to do that."

      "speaker": "BORUCHOWITZ",
      "speech": "It seems to me that now that we're here the Court could do many different things. The Court could simply say, we meant in Hendrix that the conditions were important. We were all concerned about that, and the Ninth Circuit is right to consider the purpose and effect as shown by the conditions. You could just do that. You could also say, by the way, mental abnormality, we really did mean what we said about lack of control, and that there should be some showing about, the person has no volitional control, and that would clear up a lot of things in the lower courts. As we pointed out in our supplemental two-page brief, the State of Kansas just decided that yes, in fact, Hendrix just require the lack of volitional control. The Court could also, I suppose, go beyond the question presented, which it has the authority to do, and say, this statute certainly looks like it's very different than what we though Hendrix was, and at least in Washington as it's being applied there's a problem, but I don't think the Court needs to do that. The Court simply can say, we're going to remand this case and let the court of appeals order stand, because what the court of appeals has simply done is to apply Hendrix. There's nothing different from Hendrix in what the Ninth Circuit did. We're simply going to send it down for the district court to evaluate it, and if the district court, Judge Cunero decided that let Judge Dwyer handle it because he's done the 1983 litigation, that could easily -- that's something the district court could do if it decided to do that. But obviously the 1983 litigation has not been a habeas situation involving the question of release because of unconstitutional punishment, and what this case is ultimately about is that a man has been punished for 10 years in a prison, longer than he served under his criminal sentence, without having committed another crime and without having a traditional mental disorder. And so there are many issues presented, and I think one of the things that's difficult about examining this case is that it's something fundamentally radically different from a true civil commitment. There's nothing wrong with a true civil commitment, but this is not civil commitment. This is punishment. And I think that if you look at the various cases that we've cited here, one other thing about Hudson that I think is important is that the Court said that the penalties in Hudson did not approach the infamous punishment of imprisonment. They involved administrative disability, and they were imposed in administrative proceedings. In Ward, the Court found that the penalty for oil discharge and water pollution was more analogous to traditional civil damages. In Shaw v. Martin, before the Court found that pretrial detention did not violate due process, the Court examined the actual conditions of confinement and cited testimony in the opinion about actual practices."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BORUCHOWITZ",
      "speech": "I appreciate that, Your Honor. The Court has often considered punishment in a parallel way, whether it's due process, double jeopardy, or ex post facto, but I certainly acknowledge that Shaw was a due process case. This is a situation where, as Judge Dwyer indicated in the Turay 1983 litigation, for all intents and purposes this is a prison. It looks like, feels like, and is a prison run by the Department -- or the external facility run by the Department of Corrections, which is at page 6 of our brief, joint appendix 147. This is a situation where the State of Washington, over the time that the injunction has been in place, has made it harder to get less restrictive alternatives. One of the things that this Court was concerned about in Hendrix, and specifically mentioned, was the less restrictive alternative idea, and what Washington has done in the last 5 years is to eliminate less restrictive alternative from the initial court determination and to make it harder for someone to get it. I would suggest that this Court over and over, in a number of cases involving both double jeopardy and due process and ex post facto has been to look at the statute as applied. In Foosha, Justice Thomas dissented saying that this would be a different case if the procedures as applied would show, as he put it, window dressing in that case. In fact, what we have here is the actual implementation of the treatment has turned out to be a sham. The Court has said over and over that if you can show by the clearest proof that a statute is punitive in effect, then you can win. The clearest proof by its terms suggests that evidence will be taken, because otherwise where is the proof? In answer to Justice Scalia's question, does it just mean what naturally flows from the language, or does it mean the actual implementation? I would suggest that clearest proof means proof of evidence, not simply proof of --"

      "speaker": "BORUCHOWITZ",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I think the Court could say that the application to all other prisoners would certainly enlighten the question of what's applying to Mr. Young, but the Court doesn't need to reach that question. But I think the answer to the question would be yes, because it has had a punitive purpose and effect from the beginning, but I don't think there's anything that's in conflict with Hendrix for us to go forward. What Hendrix said was, nobody here's saying it's punitive, it applies to Hendrix alone, it would be different if, and that's what the Court has said in many different circumstances, including Allen v. Illinois. The case would be a different case if someone had shown that there was a punitive effect. So over and over again I think the Court has looked at the actual implementation of the statute, but you're right, I think from the very beginning he's been committed without authority of law. Let me just take a minute to mention Ex Parte Virginia, because I think it's important when the State argues that an administrative agency does not bind the State in some way. This Court said that whoever by virtue of a public position under State government deprives another of constitutional rights violates the Constitution, and he acts in the name and for the State and his act is that of the State. There can be no defense here that it's simply the administrative agency running amok. This is certainly an act of the State that binds the State. The State -- thank you, Your Honor."

      "speech": "Thank you. I would like to point out to the Court again that this case is before the Court on a very narrow issue, and it is a threshold issue, and that is, how the Court determines whether a statute is civil or criminal. Hudson establishes that that is done facially. Washington -- the issue about whether Washington's statute is civil or criminal is not before this Court. Both the Washington supreme court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals have held that Washington statute is civil on its face, meaning the legislature's intent was to have a civil statute and that in purpose and in effect the Washington statute is civil. The predicates for commitment are not at issue before this Court. There is no question that Mr. Young suffers from a mental abnormality and a personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in sexually violent acts if he is not detained. That is not before this Court. The Washington supreme court and the Ninth Circuit have both ruled against Mr. Young on those issues, and there was no cross-petition here. The only issue before this Court, and what Mr. Young is contending, is that because he alleges that he is not receiving treatment consistent with a civil statute, that he ought to be released, and the only way Mr. Young can contend that is by saying, if I do not receive the treatment that I'm entitled to under a civil statute, somehow that converts this statute to a criminal statute, that one day your statute can be civil, the next day it can be criminal. In Mr. Young's view, if Washington had two commitment centers instead of one, the law would be civil at the center where the commitment -- where the treatment was adequate and --"
