His confession was properly admitted at trial and should not have been rejected under Jackson, because Sixth Amendment right to counsel had never attached to the murders and therefore did not need to be waived, or, alternatively, because Cobb validly waived whatever Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached. Applying McNeil's rule of offense specificity to exclude factually related but uncharged crimes from the scope of Sixth Amendment attachment is true to and, we think, required by both the text and the purposes of the Sixth Amendment. In evaluating attachment, the court is interpreting the Sixth Amendment terms, criminal prosecutions and the accused, and for decades this Court has consistently interpreted that text to limit attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the formal initiation of judicial criminal proceedings.

They have a serious societal interest in continuing to investigate other crimes, but if you compare that defendant who has had one crime charged against the defendant where they haven't brought any of the charges, once you charge that defendant he has the right to counsel that has now attached not only to the Fifth Amendment but also the Sixth Amendment, and our system ensures that that person will not only have a right to counsel but will relatively quickly actually be represented by counsel, who will then, of course, advise the client as to the charged offense and almost certainly as to the uncharged offenses and will say, don't talk to the police about this charged offense or anything else and, in fact, Mr. Ridley had given that counsel to Mr. Cobb.

This Court has said that the purpose of the Sixth Amendment is to protect the unaided layman at critical confrontations with his expert adversary, the Government, after the adverse positions of the Government and the defendant have solidified with respect to a particular alleged crime. There are three parts of that statement that this Court has given in several cases that can't be satisfied by a factually related crime. Certainly the particular alleged crime doesn't meet it. We don't think that there's a solidification of the adverse positions with respect to factually related crimes. The police are stili investigating a related crime. They don't know if the defendant did it or not. Generally speaking they won't have sufficient evidence to bring that charge, certainly there was not sufficient evidence in this case, and so there's no solidification, and there is not a critical confrontation, which has been defined to be a critical stage, which is a very well-established part of this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.

So it's not the police that are really having to make a hard determination at the time that they do the interrogation. That is made later, when you try to introduce the evidence at trial."

The police are still investigating other crimes for which no charge has been made. We think that they have at that point -- and that's all they need to know. They can then interrogate the suspect, give them their Fifth Amendment rights, and do what they can to protect those, and then if they end up getting information about a charge that has been -- a crime that has been charged and for which the Sixth Amendment has both attached and been asserted, then they can't use it at trial, but they can use it, under Moulton and under this Court's precedents, for any uncharged crime, a crime for which the Sixth Amendment had not yet attached at the time of the interrogation. But what respondent would have the court do is make the court, make the police apply a test that asks the police to know ahead of time if the crime for which they are going to interrogate the suspect relates to something that the suspect has previously been charged, or with respect to something that the suspect and his counsel may feel that there is an attorney-client relationship, and we don't think that that can be the test."

There's one, the McNeil case itself, where the uncharged offenses were wholly unrelated, different time, different place, and here you have one continuous episode. Don't most courts, if I understand them correctly, think that if there is a close relationship between the offenses, if they're all part of one series of events, that the Sixth Amendment right would attach?"

Isn't the opportunity for abuse there, so that on your best argument, if the police are subtle about what they do, and they have a defendant who's not in custody, they will, in fact, raise the, I think the specter of cutting back on the Sixth Amendment right with respect to the crime that has already been charged."

Under that rule, the statements may not be used to prove the charged offense, but the statements are admissible in a trial for the uncharged offenses.

They just -- they don't know that. They're in a phase of investigation, and this case is a perfect illustration of that. There's no contention in this case the State manipulated the charges when they indicted him for burglary and 15 months later questioned him about the murder, nor is there any suggestion that they had enough proof at the time that they charged him with burglary to charge him with murder, and there's a hypothetical assertion that there might be incentives for selective manipulation, but we don't believe that those incentives necessarily exist.

In all these cases where there is a pending charge, the court in McNeil and in Moulton represented -- excuse me, recognized the compelling interest that the police have in investigating and solving uncharged offenses, and if the suspect never indicates any unwillingness to talk to the police about those offenses, there's no basis for excluding what is concededly a voluntary confession to those crimes that might otherwise go unsolved. The other thing I wanted to say, just about the Blockburger test, is that this Court, in the context of double jeopardy and the lesser-included offenses context, has recognized that that test is workable, and is predictable, and can lead to consistent results."

Mr. Coleman has essentially two responses to that, and I'd like you to comment on them. The first response is that if the subsequent interrogation is a custodial one, the Miranda warnings are going to be there, and they functionally will assuage your concern and that in any event, even in a noncustodial case and, a fortiori, in the custodial case, if, in fact, there is a violation of Sixth Amendment right with respect to the first offense, any evidence so given will be excluded with respect to the first offense.

Having said that, in this case, for example, you have a long-term, 17 months or more, attorney-client relationship. Counsel has been dealing with the courts, actively filing motions.

I mean, I can understand the position that, look, once a man has a lawyer -- I have a lawyer for embezzlement. I'm a stockbroker, and I'm charged with having embezzled on May 13th. I'm charged with an entirely separate embezzlement -- or, I'm interrogated about an entirely separate embezzlement on May 14th. I would feel just as strongly as you do about, well, it's only fair they know the man has a lawyer, they shouldn't go to him without going to his lawyer. They know the man has a lawyer to represent him vis-a-vis the police. What difference does it make whether it's factually related or not, if you're going to appeal to that, I don't know, that feeling once you know a guy has a lawyer, you ought to deal with his lawyer?

I haven't been able to work out your factual question far enough down the line, sorry. But I do believe -- in this case, for example, in the Texas statutory scheme, this defendant could have been charged, well, with nine different capital crimes, and three of them, at least three of them are under statutorily different offenses which would have allowed prosecution under Blockburger, even though it's the same offenses, same exact conduct, and where -- we are concerned that under a circumstance where an attorney has been representing a defendant for a substantial length of time, and he consults and investigates on this limited, immediate transaction about various crimes, and he tells, and he consults the attorney about what we're going to do -- for example, in the example it was asked if he was arrested on one offense, he said, by the way, I killed two other people.

In this case there was a considerable interval of time. Defendant was out of custody, he was living with his father, and in that interval he could have talked to his lawyer many times.

Burbine decision that allows police officers to lie to the defendants, and you're getting a conflict, more than likely, which will encourage a conflict of statements between what the lawyer's telling him and what the police officers are telling him."

Yes. Yes. Don't talk to them at all. Yes, yes, I understand. The argument that that suffices, what's wrong with that is that if it suffices here it would have sufficed or ought to have sufficed in Michigan v. Jackson as well. I mean, doesn't Michigan v. Jackson assume that that's not enough? The lawyer's going to tell him, look it, I'm your lawyer now, don't talk to the police without me, and yet Michigan v. Jackson still says, even though the lawyer's told him that, if the police try to talk to him without him, it's a constitutional violation."

He gets a lawyer, and then he's not charged, all right? He's not charged. The next day, although the police know he got a lawyer, he has a lawyer, they call him back to question him again without telling the lawyer. Can they do that?"

When -- and also, in both of those circumstances, if the defendant or the suspect is questioned he can say, at the advice of his counsel, I don't want to talk to you, in other words cuts him off."
