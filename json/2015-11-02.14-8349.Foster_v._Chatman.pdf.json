    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIGHT",
      "speech": "Right. Two answers to that, Justice Ginsburg. I mean, what the lawyers did here was these lawyers have practiced here for a long time in Rome, Georgia. They said the prosecutor always strikes all the blacks from the jury. That's been the historic practice. We think they're going to strike all the blacks on the jury in our case. But last year the Supreme Court of the United States decided Batson v. Kentucky, and we asked the Court not to let that happen in this case. Now, of course, if the prosecutor is willing to avoid a Batson challenge, they could have not discriminated. That would have been the first thing to do. But ­­ but secondly, with regard to the information that's collected here, it doesn't seem like it's information just to exercise strikes when they say, if it comes down to having to take an African­American, Ms. Hardge, or in another place, Ms. Garrett, might be okay. And the district attorney himself said Marilyn Garrett has the most potential of the black prospective jurors. In other words, the blacks were taken out of the picture here. They were taken and ­­ and dealt with separately. And over the weekend, the jury ­­ the questioning ended on a Friday. And the judge said, all right. Over the weekend, you've got your chance to decide who you're going to strike. And they knew exactly who they were going to strike because the ­­ the ­­ the jurors are listed in order. The State goes first, and if it accepts a juror, then the State accepts, and that juror is on. There's no going back. There's no backstriking or there's no striking people here and there. They developed three strike lists. And one of those strike lists was a list headed \"Definite NOs.\" These are the people absolutely are not going to be on this jury. There are only six jurors listed on the list of \"Definite NOs,\" and the first five are African­Americans. The sixth is a juror who made clear during the voir dire process that she could not impose the death penalty under any circumstances. The State moved to strike her for cause. The judge probably erred in not granting that strike. But even she ranked behind the black jurors in terms of the priorities that the prosecution had for ­­ for striking."

That sounds like Batson to me. And then he goes on to say, \"And in addition there is no good reason given, now or then.\" And then he concludes, \"Accordingly, the court finds the renewed Batson claim is without merit.\" So if I read just that paragraph, I would think the reason that the judge found in your favor is he decided the Batson claim in your favor. He didn't have to. He could have gone on some other ground, but that's the ground he did go on. But at worst, why isn't it ambiguous? And if it is ambiguous, then why don't we take, you know ­­ I think it's what's in the ­­ Long, you know, all those cases. If it's ambiguous, then aren't we required to assume that the judge went on the Federal ground? Okay? Now, that's both Alito's question. It's what I think is the hardest point for you to overcome. And I want to hear your response."

      "speech": "Thank you. Very quickly, let me first say that with regard to what Justice Alito quoted that it's just come to our attention since the trial of the case that Ms. Garrett cousin was arrested. That was on May the 1st. That was after the death verdict had been returned in this case. Secondly, if you look at the Joint Appendix on page 56 and 57 where they give the reasons for striking Ms. Garrett, there is no mention of her cousin whatsoever in there. That's the time when she should have been mentioned, after the strikes were made. And yet there is no mention of that at all. So I don't think there's any way ­­ and then six months later, there is a motion for new trial, and now the prosecution is adding new reasons that it didn't give at the Batson hearing. It's saying she was a social worker. She wasn't a social worker. It's saying her cousin was arrested. They didn't know that at the time they struck the jury. They said she's low income, taking another thing out of United States v. Cartlidge. But you can't add reasons on into perpetuity. The reasons are the reasons articulated in ­­ in Miller­El, and the prosecutor has got to stand or fall on the reasons. With regard to the questions, I ­­ I just want to make one quick point on that because there's not much time. But with regard to Ms. Garrett and Martha Duncan, who were both teachers aides, who were at schools that were literally right in the same neighborhood ­­ Ms. Duncan had kindergarten students; Ms. Garrett was Head Start ­­ no questions: What kind of children do you have, Ms. Duncan? I mean, Ms. Duncan, if you look at the ­­ they also said familiarity with the neighborhood. Ms. Garrett lived, like, 18 or 20 miles away. Ms. Duncan lived 200 ­­ her ­­ her school was 250 yards away, and she lived a half­mile from the school. Both of them answered that they weren't familiar with the area where the victim lived. Now then some more questions after those answers would have provided a difference. But instead, Ms. Garrett is treated as a liar, and Ms. Duncan is accepted and actually serves as a juror in this case. And there are other examples, with Mr. Hood particularly, with regard to the child. If you had asked: What about your child who was arrested? He was put on probation ­­ he was ­­ $180 of ­­ can I have just a second? ­­ $180 restitution, and he went off to the ­­ this is in the record ­­ went off to the Navy, served his country honorably, got an honorable discharge, and came back.
