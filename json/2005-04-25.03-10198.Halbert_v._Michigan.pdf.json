Of course, certain issues are waived. Trial issues are waived by the effect of a guilty plea, but many other issues remain. And as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, especially in the guilty plea cases -- this Court well knows the effect of the Federal sentencing guidelines - - very complicated issues of sentencing law arise. And now Michigan has a sentencing guideline system that is perhaps more complicated than the Federal system that's been in effect since the 1980's."

So this is a statute that on its face is -- is taking away the right of the indigent and only the indigent to have -- have an attorney. So I don't agree that is is a -- simply a disparate impact case. But in the context of appellate counsel for a first-tier felony appeal, this Court's cases have -- have not applied the same line of analysis that this Court has applied in other contexts, and I think that's quite clear most recently in the MLB case - -"

We don't even have that here. All we have here is the indigent forced to shift for himself, forced to try and determine whether there are any issues, forced to order his own transcript. Under the Michigan statute, the indigent has to figure out how to obtain his or her docket entries, his or her transcripts, his or her prisoner account statements, all the documents necessary for filing a first appeal that would ordinarily be done by counsel.

Surely you can waive the right to counsel on appeal. If that's not a violation of due process, then your equal protection claim dissolves."

And so the Michigan constitution explicitly still provides a right to appeal, but it changes the method.

And so the State obtains tremendous benefits from this procedure. They obtain deference on habeas corpus review. They prevent the indigent, if the indigent were to ever get a lawyer at some later stage, from beginning relitigation on State collateral review. And so the State very happily argues for all of those purposes that this is a decision on the merits, but then they come before this Court and they say, oh, no, it's not a decision on the merits.

The State maintains that the appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal, and that is plainly contrary to the -- to the actual function of that court because there is a provision that if trial counsel suddenly realizes in a plea case, after sentencing, that there are issues that she should have raised, it allows her to do that. And so the State now argues that that's really the first-tier appeal, and then the application that follows after that to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal. I'll just point out that even the State's amicus doesn't agree with that, and -- and rightfully so in light of Swenson v. Bosler, which has rejected an attempt to reorganize by labeling how one's appeals go."

And if counsel looks at the case and determines that there is no tenable ground for an appeal, could counsel file the equivalent of an Anders brief?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORAN",
      "speech": "Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and in fact, I have done that personally. Before I became an academic, I worked at the State Appellate Defender Office in Detroit and was appointed to represent indigents on plea appeals. And in a significant percentage of the cases -- I can't quote you the numbers off the top of my head -- after reviewing the case, the appellate counsel then concludes that there is no merit, that there are no grounds to proceed, that the defendant in fact got whatever it was she bargained for in the plea bargaining, at which point then either a motion to withdraw may be filed or -- or the equivalent, the Michigan equivalent, of an Anders brief. And so that is done in a number of cases. It is our position that that procedure actually helps improve the appellate process in Michigan because without that process, all you have are indigents like Mr. Halbert, a special education student with mental disabilities, trying to identify his own issues and fall -- and filing, in -- in his case, with the help of a fellow prisoner because he could not have done it himself -- the help of a fellow prisoner, an application that is completely incoherent, misses several issues that are right on the face of the record, correctly asserts that his sentencing guidelines were misscored but -- but without explaining why, without even identifying which sentencing guidelines were misscored. And in fact, he received a minimum sentence that was approximately three times too high under the sentencing guidelines. The State concedes that one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in the State's favor erroneously. We concede one of the -- one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in Mr. Halbert's favor erroneously. But then there were two others, and the most important ones, the OV, Offense Variable, 13. That was scored for 25 points in both cases. And so Mr. -- Mr. Halbert, in fact, received a sentence that was much too high. Michigan requires -- Michigan is one of the few States that requires that ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on direct appeal or they're lost. And so at that point, Mr. Halbert had to figure out a way to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel hearing, which requires an evidentiary hearing at which trial counsel must be called, assuming trial counsel is still available to be called, all from prison, and there was no possible way he could do that. So it's not very surprising that even with the help of a fellow inmate, that his application for leave to appeal was completely incoherent. The fellow inmate actually did write the -- the trial judge and say we need to have an evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel. But under the statute, the judge had no discretion to grant that motion. Under the statute, only if there was already an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines, only then would the judge be required to appoint counsel, and of course, the guidelines, as misscored without objection from defense counsel -- there was no upward departure at that point. If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."

I think Justice Scalia is right in noting that he was told specifically it's under these conditions you'll be appointed a counsel; under these conditions, you might be appointed counsel. From context it's unambiguous that he would otherwise not receive counsel. And what's important is at the joint appendix on page 45, the trial court, in fact, made a factual finding on this point.

That's really the -- I think the heart of the constitutional issue. There are three distinct characteristics of the Michigan system. The -- the nature of the review is discretionary, and I think comparable to the kind of review in Ross that was described by this Court for the North Carolina Supreme Court. Mr. Moran makes a claim that the Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. With regard to applications for leave where there is no right to have the merits reviewed, it is not an error-correcting court.

Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to say the application were discretionary if a defendant would have a claim to have any error corrected. Otherwise, he would have a claim on the court of appeals.

In -- in summary, the -- the Michigan system - - the -- with the limited date to the review and the kinds of issues from plea-based convictions that are at issue are not -- are lesser liberty interest questions because they have to do with amount of punishment. The Michigan system extends the relationship of trial counsel to the defendant and asks the trial counsel to raise the motions regarding post-conviction motions which will enable him to have a factual record from which to advance his claims.

You're going to be left to identify those meritorious claims, raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, and to try to avoid procedural bars that you'll be facing. Every system is going to have to draw that line and to say that at some point you're not going to get appointed another attorney. Just because there's access to the system doesn't mean there always has to be another attorney appointed.

As the Court said in Coleman v. Thompson, a case like this is a case about federalism because it involves the respect that Federal courts must pay to States and the States' procedural rules. Respect for the State's choices is especially important here because, as the Court put it in Medina v. California, preventing and dealing with crime is much more the business of the States than it is of the Federal Government. And therefore, the Court said we should not lightly construe the Constitution so as to intrude upon the administration of justice by the individual States. And -- and as to the question of -- of when to provide State-paid counsel, as Justice O'Connor reminded us in Murray v. Giarratano, that's a choice that should be one of legislative choice, especially since it involves difficult policy considerations and the allocation of scarce legal resources."

Also, if you -- if you subsidize litigation in the name of providing adequate access to courts or meaningful access to courts, then there's going to be a lot of litigation in the lower Federal courts about exactly how much of a subsidy is necessary to reach that standard. And also, if -- and this is particularly important here I think. If you require States to subsidize the exercise of a right that they're not required to provide in the first place, like the right to seek review of a -- of a plea-based conviction, then you give the States a strong incentive to cut back on or eliminate that right altogether. And -- and, you know, who knows? But perhaps that's what's going on in the - - in the trend in the States away from providing this right. Thank you."

Every State in the United States currently allows for appeals from guilty plea -- pleas. The Bulger case did say that. They cited a - -"

      "speaker": "MORAN",
      "speech": "Not necessarily. As I cited in my brief, a number of States allow for applications or petitions from guilty pleas, but every State has a first - tier direct appeal from guilty pleas. The Bulger -- the Michigan Supreme Court in Bulger cited a -- an article from an Arizona Attorney magazine that was simply incorrect on that. Secondly, on the issue of what is the effect of a order denying leave to appeal for lack of merit on the grounds presented, the State continues to rely on McKenzie v. Smith, an earlier Sixth Circuit opinion, People v. Berry, and Bobenal v. Saginaw Investment. None of those cases uses the phrase, lack of merit on the grounds presented. That phrase does not appear in any of those three cases. The Berry and the Bobenal cases, those are Michigan Court of Appeals cases before 1981. Beginning in 1981, in a series of three cases, People v. Douglas, People v. Hayden, and People v. Wiley, the Michigan Court of Appeals held unambiguously that our orders denying applications or remand orders, in that case, for lack of merit on the grounds presented, was law of the case."

      "speaker": "MORAN",
      "speech": "The Michigan constitutional provision? It changes the way in which guilty plea appeals proceed. Before 1994, there were other types of appeals that had to proceed by application for leave to appeal, primarily late appeals. If the appeal was filed too late, it had to proceed by application for leave to appeal. In 1994, as a result of the constitutional amendment, guilt plea appeals now have to proceed by application for leave to appeal. That's constitutional. We have no problem with that, and that is the method by which the caseload management problems have been solved. They have been solved."

      "speaker": "MORAN",
      "speech": "They were saying that first-tier felony appeals in Michigan following pleas require leave of the court, require an application for leave to appeal, like late appeals from trial cases do. But all of those appeals are still decided on the merits with preclusive effect for law of the case purposes. And the Sixth Circuit specifically dealt with that in -- in the Abela case. McKenzie v. Smith never -- never mentions anything about the lack of merit in the grounds presented. The resource allocations point is simply that not all of these guilty plea appeals are -- lead to full argument and full briefing, and that's fine. Michigan can do that. But what Michigan cannot do, as a result of Ellis and Douglas, is for that first gatekeeping part of the appeal, which is where the court has to decide is there merit in this case, to make the indigent shift for himself. And so in -- in Smith v. Robbins, this Court, specifically referring back to the Ellis case, said that the problem that the Court identified in Ellis and that became part of the constitutional minimum in Douglas, was that the old California procedure did not require -- I see my time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
