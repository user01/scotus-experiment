Petitioner attempts to distinguish between offenses that cause bodily injury and those that involve offensive touching. But as this Court already decided in Castleman, that is a fallacy; that distinction is elusive. And that's because States, including those that prohibit the causation of bodily injury, even those offenses may include offenses that are similar in terms of degree to offensive touching. In fact, that was what was at issue at Castleman itself. It was the bodily injury prong of the Tennessee statute, not the offensive touching prong. And ­­ and in that case, the bodily injury could be committed in a way that involved only slight injury. And yet, this Court refused to distinguish, by degree of force, batteries that qualify Section 922(g)(9) predicates. Keep in mind that States overwhelmingly define battery as ­­ only as to the resulting injury. Petitioners' role, which would limit misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence to intentional conduct, would require a prosecutor in those jurisdictions to prove in the underlying offense not only that the contact and the push, the hit, the grab was intentional, but that prosecutor would also have to show that the abuser intended the resulting injury in order to prove the battery offense under the vast majority of State and under Federal law."

And keep in mind, reckless conduct ­­ and petitioner avoids the fact of what reckless conduct is. A reckless conduct is not an involuntary or a negligent, or even an accidental act. Reckless conduct is voluntary conduct. It's conduct where an individual chooses to act in conscious disregard of a substantial and known risk of harm.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "EISENSTEIN",
      "speech": "Your Honor, the rule of lenity only applies where there is grievous ambiguity in the statute. And I respectfully submit that there is no such grievous ambiguity. Congress's intent was clear, and this Court already found as much, in Castleman and in Hayes, which is that there was a class of offenses that Congress intended to cover by the statute which were generally applicable assault and battery statutes. And the rule that Petitioner suggests would exclude all of those offenses and would frustrate that clear purpose of Congress, so lenity doesn't apply for that reason. And there's no ambiguity, not only as to the purpose, but as to ­­ as to what battery itself encompasses. Petitioners have tried to argue that battery, either at common law or in contemporary practice, that there was some requirement of an intent to do harm. And the overwhelming weight and universal weight of authority points the opposite direction. Even the sources cited by Petitioner establish that at common law, there was no requirement for the intent to do harm. And certainly States, in adopting their assault and battery provisions, have modeled that ­­ that formulation. Another way to look at this is ­­ outside of the common law, is the way that Taylor examined the statute of burglary under the ACCA offense, which is to ­­ rather than turning just to the common law, as to view this as covering generic battery. And ­­ and when looked at that way under the contemporary practice, the Model Penal Code and the uniform opinion of the courts of appeals and commentators all have concluded that battery was not limited to a purpose to cause a resulting harm, but included contact that could be reckless. In the face of Petitioner's hypotheticals, Petitioner struggles to even conceive of a hypothetical example of where there is a reckless battery that would ­­ against a family member that would not constitute a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. The converse is that Congress enacted Section 19 ­­ 922(g)(9) to address a vital ­­ vital public safety problem. It identified those who had been convicted of battering their family members as posing a dramatically increased risk of perpetrating future gun violence against their family. This Court should continue to interpret Section 922(g)(9) in light of that compelling purpose. If there are no further questions."

She said in order to avoid a constitutional question, we should decide it in thus such and such a way. So one answer would be, well, maybe so. We aren't facing the constitutional question. We are simply facing the question of what Congress intended. And if this does raise a constitutional question, so be it. And then there will, in a future case, come up with that question. So we ­­ or our point is, we don't have to decide that here."

      "speech": "Your Honor, Congress did not use the word \"battery\" in 921(a)(33). And so the question is, is whether, under the rule of lenity, the Court can then say battery is the standard that we are going to use in order to construe this. And it's a push me, pull you because it is the use of force, but that doesn't have to be a prior battery conviction. It could be any misdemeanor conviction that has a state of recklessness for the state of mind and results in any ­­ any involvement of a domestic partner. And I think that there is enough play within the statute ­­ statute itself, as well as the extent of the common law, so ­­ to say that that is a reason for applying the rule of lenity. There is also the underlying constitutional questions. And this Court, as in being able to abrogate a constitutional right indefinitely based on reckless conduct, I believe also presents extreme due process concerns. And for those reasons, I believe that the Court should conclude that under these circumstances, it is best to avoid that question and to construe the statute the way that is consistent with the words. Thank you."
