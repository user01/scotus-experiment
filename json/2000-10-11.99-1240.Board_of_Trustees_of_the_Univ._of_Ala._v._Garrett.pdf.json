We do not challenge Congress' authority to pass the ADA under the Commerce Clause and, indeed, doubt anyone ever would bring such an across-the-board attack on the law, yet it is precisely the virtues of the ADA as a matter of Commerce Clause legislation, its breadth of coverage, its exacting accommodation requirements, that make it unsustainable as a section 5 law. Now, before this Court has authorized Congress to impose extra constitutional duties on the States, it has required the Congress to show that the States brought this loss of authority upon themselves first by engaging in a widespread pattern and practice of unconstitutional conduct and, second, by showing that the remedial legislation is proportionate and congruent in nature."

Let's draw an analogy to the race cases. If in the early sixties every State in the country banned literacy tests, all right, banned the very thing Congress was trying to get at, it would not be enough for Congress to say literacy tests are causing problems.

The point of section 5 is to give Congress remedial authority. But the point I'm trying to make on the courthouse access to buildings point is that that's not something the ADA addresses.

That truly is evading Article 5 and the requirement that two-thirds of each House approve a constitutional amendment and, most importantly, the States, three-fourths of them, get an opportunity to change it, and that's exactly what would happen, and that's what would be very risky about allowing that hypothetical to justify the ADA."

But there is no reason to have the province of the legislature not intruding upon the province of the legislature and, therefore, you don't need to apply that strict a matter and should respect the congressional judgment that, in fact, there is unreasonable discrimination being exhibited in these States against handicapped people. I would like to get your response to that kind of an argument."

We need that authority to enact these 50 State laws and the 30 Federal laws that protect the rights of the disabled, so there's just no doubt about that at all. But in the section 5 context you've got two other issues, the relationship between this Court and its final Marbury power and the relationship between the Congress and the States, and that's why the section 5 inquiries are always different. You've got a zero sum game. Congress' gain is invariably the State's loss, and just as Congress gets a presumption of constitutionality in enacting these 30 Federal disability laws, so do the States get a presumption of constitutionality that when they pass these 50 State laws, 1) they're presumptively good and 2) they're enforcing them. Now, that can -- you know, that's not dispositive, of course. Ultimately, if it turns out the States aren't enforcing them, they're just shams, well then they're got a problem and, you know, that's why the voting rights laws are --"

But the fact is, Congress is a legislature, and it is not laboring under the judicial disability as a second-guesser, so why do we -- I mean, I go back to the question raised. Why should we apply the same standard that we would if we were dealing with a court's review?"

So if you're going to agree with Justice Breyer and the suggestion in your question, Justice Souter, that there has to be a little more deference to Congress in this area, the last thing the Court should be doing is in a situation where they don't ask the right questions, constitutional violations as opposed to violating a statutory standard, number 1, number 2, are the State laws, all 50 of them on the books being enforced, the last thing anyone's --"

I found two. One of them cites Fullilove, Representative Dellums saying there's a broad section 5 power. Fullilove is no longer good law. The second cites Morgan v. Katzenbach and just has a sentence that says, embracing the broader version of Morgan saying that if there's an antidiscrimination issue out there, Congress can remedy under section 5, but that's not the inquiry, and as early as 1970 it was clear that was not the inquiry in Oregon v.

Congress purported to be remedying, in their words, a national epidemic regarding disability discrimination, and they decided that in order to do that you needed money damages actions, which is really all that is at stake here in light of Ex parte Young. How can they say that it's a proportionate and necessary tailored remedy when they're not only not imposing it on private business in many instances, but on themselves? That just doesn't stand. It's not only the failure to lead by example, just direction, but it doesn't show proportionality. I mean, it proves our very point. This was not needed.

In fact, in City of Boerne this Court invalidated the RFRA. They're back at it again. They're entitled to do that. I will submit that there is a bright line here. It's constitutional violations. U.S. Senators, U.S. House of Representatives Members are not going to lightly find States are violating the Constitution, but we want them to ask that question. That's the very point of section 5.

No State would ever challenge that, and so what's at issue here is quite narrow. Indeed, States are challenging in the lower courts the Commerce Clause predicate for title II of the ADA, and they are arguing that in light of this Court's decisions in Lopez and Morrison that so many State activities and programs are not commercial in character and, thus, cannot be reached by the Commerce Clause, so that were this Court to hold that the ADA is not proper Fourteenth Amendment legislation, there is significant danger that the ADA would be without a constitutional --"

      "speech": "Well, except only -- title II applies only to the States, and so it, losing title II is losing -- I'm sorry. In that sense it applies to State and local governments, and if it goes down under the Commerce Clause then State and local governments will not be governed by title II."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Gottesman, I'm not sure that the record here presents much in the way of a title II claim. I know the Ninth Circuit has said that all employment disputes under the ADA are covered only by title I, not title II, that title II addresses public services, and I know the grant of certiorari covered both, ostensibly, because the plaintiffs' cause of action appeared to address both, and I think this Court probably hasn't decided whether all employment cases fall under title I, but if we thought they did, do we have to address the title II issue?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOTTESMAN",
      "speech": "Well, no. If you resolved in this case, although the question is not presented, the conflict among the circuits as to whether employment discrimination also violates title II, and if you decided, adversely to our position, that it does, the position we advanced in the lower courts, then yes, only title I would apply to employment, and only it would be at issue. But we would hope that before this Court resolved that important issue that has divided the courts of appeals, that there would be an opportunity for briefing. In this case, the petitioners never raised an objection to title II's application to employment, so it never became an issue in this case. Now, I want to turn to the merits of the Fourteenth Amendment argument and we want to suggest as a preliminary petitioners have never really acknowledged an important body of Fourteenth Amendment decisional law, which is that even when we're dealing with groups or classifications that are covered by the rational basis standard, it is irrational for a State to act with a purpose that is irrational. A number of Supreme Court decisions have held that State action that rests on invidious prejudice, irrational fear, false stereotypes that have evolved from those prejudices and fears, desires not to be discomforted by association with disfavored classes, patronization, if that's what actually motivates a State decision, that itself provides the irrationality which violates the Fourteenth Amendment."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

Doesn't it boil down to the same thing? You look to see whether, indeed, there's a rational basis for what's been done. If there's no rational basis, you say it must be motivated by, you know, irrational prejudice or stereotyping, or whatever."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOTTESMAN",

One of those studies was performed by a congressionally created committee, the Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations, whose very function was to police whether Congress was overregulating the States, unnecessarily regulating the States. Its membership consisted predominantly of State and local governmental officials, and it submitted a report to every Member of Congress while the ADA was under consideration recounting the findings of its own inquiries of State officials in which it asked State officials, can you explain why there is such a low percentage of persons with disabilities working for you? And overwhelmingly those State officials responded, yes, the problem is that middle managers, the people who make these kinds of decisions, the personnel decisions in our State, are afflicted with negative attitudes about persons with disabilities, discomfort about working among them, myths and stereotypes about the incapacity of people with disabilities to perform jobs, things that have been -- and the report goes on to say this. Empirical studies over and over and over again have shown that these myths are false, that there is not a higher turnover rate among persons with disabilities."

Our supervisors have qualms about hiring people with disabilities. They're uncomfortable with it. So that's the second body of evidence, and the third body of evidence is the evidence that Congress had about the reality of the psychological attitudes in our society about people with disabilities. In accommodating the spectrum, which was the report of the Civil Rights Commission, they relied upon extensive bodies of professional evidence that showed that there were four crippling attitudes that many people in our society have about people with disabilities. They are discomforted about being around them. They have stigmatic attitudes about them.

Now, this is a case where a statute was enacted before Seminole Tribe and before Boerne, and therefore the paradigm that this Court has created for the words, the precise magic words that we would now expect Congress to use didn't -- can't, I think, fairly be imposed on a coordinate branch of Government. But the answer, Justice Scalia, to the question, I think, is determined by reference to what the legislative record before Congress, not only when it conducted its eighteen hearings and amassed seven separate complete reports in enacting the ADA, but also when it investigated the problems that led it to create the CRIPA statute, the Constitutional Rights of Institutionalized Persons, and IDEA, and others, but looking just -- looking --"

And what this Court said in Cleburne is, we are not going to look first at the facial constitutionality or unconstitutionality of this statute. We're going to require, in the unique context of a history of pervasive invidious discrimination against the disabled, what this municipality's reasons were. And having looked at that, it concluded that the -- that it must have been motivated by an invidious intent, because the proferred reasons were not, in fact, rational. Now, Cleburne, in the context of many other cases in which this Court and Justices of this Court have remarked on the history of pervasive invidious discrimination against the disabled, provided -- essentially gave Congress the blueprint in which it acted in this case, and here's why."

But it is clear that what Cleburne did was, in looking at the actual administrative bureaucratic decision, as opposed to the legislative choice, require an articulation of the actual reasons in the context of alleged discrimination in this unique historical area. And what Congress did essentially was to generalize what this Court did in Cleburne. It took this Court's specific inquiry in Cleburne in the light of the Court, many instances in which the majority of this Court has remarked about the history of discrimination in Choate, Alexander v. Choate and other cases, and it applied it to what Congress had in front of it, which was on the one hand a body of half-a-dozen or a dozen comprehensive studies detailing a widespread problem and historic unconstitutional practices, and over 5,000 narrative accounts that the congressional task force accumulated of individual instances of discrimination against the handicapped, 600 of which addressed State or local governments which for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment and State action have to be considered as one."

I always thought that was the job of the Government lawyer to come before the court -- the inquiry is not exactly what the Government did. It's whether there's any rational explanation after the fact. And, as this Court's decisions prove, there are probably a dozen to two dozen of them. There are some instances where they can't come up with anything, and that's exactly what happened there. Whether it was good lawyering, bad lawyering, the end result, everything they identified was not rational. The second thing, I've not heard anything from the Government or the private respondents in their briefs or today about the second half of the City of Boerne inquiry. There's nothing about proportionality and, as the Court said in Kimel, Florida Prepaid, and City of Boerne itself, the issue on proportionality is whether the statutory standard covers, quote, substantially more conduct than would be found unconstitutional. That itself invalidates this law. Now, the question of discrimination, whether it exists at the society or the Government level, I think this Court's decisions from 1985, one of them written, by the way, by Justice Marshall in Alexander v. Choate, Justice Marshall says in a 9-0 decision, the main problem with disability discrimination is not one of intent. It's one of either trying too hard, needless paternalism, or not trying hard enough, unintentional neglect. That's the problem. That's an Article I problem, and we're happy the ADA was enacted. The only challenges that have been made to it to our knowledge are in the prison setting, and it's about inmates and, if there's one area where maybe interstate commerce doesn't go, it's to a prison, where the very point of a prison is to keep people out of interstate commerce, so --"
