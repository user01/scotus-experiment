The preparation of KPOP in a sense interacts with the United States' representation of the tribes in the Oregon general stream adjudication, because it's the State of Oregon that will be making the final permanent determination as to who has what water rights and in what order of priority and, in connection with that adjudication, the United States has filed claims on behalf of the tribes, on behalf of the project, as well as on behalf of other Federal interests."

That bill would have accomplished an exemption from the FOIA that is significantly broader than the exemption we're asking for here. That is, the applicability of that exemption would not have turned on whether the documents came from the tribes initially and, perhaps more important, it wouldn't have turned on whether particular documents would be privileged from discovery in civil litigation. That is, the focus of the court of appeals' concern -- perhaps I should turn to page 2 of our brief, which sets forth the language of exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act. Exemption 5 states that the requirement of compelled disclosure does not apply to matters that are, quote, interagency or intraagency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency, and --"

This is really part of the Government's operating. The tribe here was not seeking to further the Government's interests at all. It was seeking to further its own interests. I think it's a stretch beyond what most of these courts of appeals cases -- which I agreed with. I mean, I've spoken to that in an earlier case, but this seems to take it a step further, and I can see how you can get to the conclusion that a consultant who you hire, any memorandum produced by that consultant who was hired is an intraagency memorandum. I do not see how you can leap to the conclusion that anything that is given to you by a trustee, by a trust, is an intraagency memorandum. I mean, maybe it should be confidential, but I find it hard to call that an intraagency memorandum."

One of the statements made is that the United States has been routinely turning over what it gets from the water association to the tribes, so the information -- the tribes get information from one side that has a stake in this venture, but that side doesn't get what the tribe is giving to the Government, so it looks like it's not evenhanded."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "I think to understand why, in our view, it is evenhanded, it's essential to explain that there are several component agencies within the Department of Interior, but two that are particularly important here, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Reclamation. Now, both the tribes and the water users corresponded with the Bureau of Reclamation, or BOR, and BOR received a FOIA request from both the tribes and the users association asking for the documents that the others had submitted, and for better or worse BOR turned everything over. BOR was absolutely evenhanded in divulging both tribal communications and the water users association communications. It may be that under our theory BOR should not have been quite so forthcoming, but it was. There was no disuniformity with respect to BOR. BIA was a different story. BIA is set up with the special responsibility of exercising the Government's trust responsibilities to the Indian tribes. It essentially corresponds with the Indian tribes, and it would be unusual for the water users to correspond with BIA at all. BIA was the subagency within the Department of the Interior that refused to disclose some of these documents, with one exception of the seven. One of the adjudication-related documents was addressed to the Regional Solicitor of the Department of the Interior. So primarily we are concerned with documents that were submitted to a subagency within DOI whose particular sphere of duty and expertise is the exercise of trust responsibilities for the tribes, and this Court in Nevada v. United States emphasized the BIA's unique mission, its separate juridical status --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, but isn't the value of that emphasis, if it has any value at all, only proportional to the independence of BIA from the rest of the Department of Interior, because I think the questions of several of my colleagues here have raised the same point. If the BIA is not independent of them, then your analogy between the tribes and the consultants fails. If we accept the consultant situation as being inter- or intraagency, we can rationalize it by saying, as several have said, that the consultants really are doing something that the Department itself might be doing. It's an extension of the Department. It's reportable only to the Department. But if, in fact, the Indian tribes are consulting with an agency which is concerned not only with the Indian tribes' interests, but in adjusting those interests as against the interests of other claimants, which seems to be the case here, then you don't have an analogy with a situation in which the Department and the consultant alone are involved, so it seems to me your whole argument either stands or falls on the independence of BIA, and we know that the BIA is not somehow totally independent of the rest of the Department of the Interior, whether it's preparing a KPOP or whether it's representing the United States in Oregon litigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "I mean, I guess I have two or three responses to that. First, you're correct that the BIA is not an independent agency. It is a subagency of DOI, and therefore is ultimately subject to DOI control. At the same time, the Government is attempting to deal in a pragmatic fashion with the sort of combination of responsibilities that no private party would ever be given. That is, things would certainly be cleaner from our point of view of DOI could either say, we will treat the tribes exactly like we treat everyone else, or it could say, we will treat the tribes exactly as a private trustee would treat the beneficiary, namely, show it a duty of undivided loyalty. It's clear, I think from first principles and from this Court's decision in Nevada v. United States, that the Department can't pursue either of those courses. It must on the one hand fulfill its trust responsibilities but on the other hand it has other responsibilities that would be considered conflicting if they were imposed on a private person, so giving BIA primary responsibility for the carrying out of the Department's trust mission is a pragmatic response to an admittedly messy situation. The other thing I would say is, we don't contend that the tribes are analogous to a consultant in the sense of stepping into the shoes of an agency employee or doing what an agency employee would otherwise do. To the contrary, we think the input from the tribes is essential if the Department is to carry out its trust responsibilities, but that's precisely because the tribes have an expertise and a perspective that no agency employee would have."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, that's true, but I mean the problem comes because the Department has responsibilities to other people, too and it is -- in effect, on your view of the Freedom of Information Act, it is able to favor one side with information while denying an equal, in effect an equal access to another side, and --"

I mean, the point is, most of the work here is supposed to be done by the inquiry into whether there is actually an applicable privilege. It maybe that the threshold language will screen out some things that would be privileged in discovery, but there's no indication, either in the legislative history or in this Court's decisions, that the threshold language is supposed to screen out a lot.

It's in the role of an advocate, or the role of an adjudicator, vis-a-vis the tribe, so that analogy doesn't work, and it seems to me the only way you can win is to say, well, come up with anew exception, or a new interpretation of inter- or intraagency, and I haven't heard what that is yet.

One of the central duties of a trustee in virtually every context is to preserve a duty of confidentiality to the beneficiary, and so it would be strange to say that the tribe's status as a beneficiary, the tribe's interest in the trust corpus, is the very thing that causes its submissions to lose the confidentiality that they might otherwise have."

First, the fact that these are in our view interagency documents doesn't automatically mean that they would even satisfy the second part of the FOIA test. Second, even if they satisfied the second part of the FOIA test in the sense that they would not be routinely discoverable, that wouldn't by itself eliminate the possibility that they could be discovered by a litigant with a particular need. If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time."

This rule does not change due to the existence of a trustee-beneficiary relationship between the Government and the nonagency party, a relationship that itself does not give rise to a civil discovery privilege. As we heard in the discussion preceding this, this Court's decisions and Congress itself have consistently recognized that the dominant purpose of FOIA is disclosure, not secrecy, and that FOIA exemptions must be narrowly construed."

I mean, insofar as they have to give documents to the trustees, all the court privileges would be useless. I'm not saying that means you'd lose, but I want to be sure that's the consequence."

If that's the consequence, then what I'm looking for is, it seems an undesirable consequence, and therefore I wonder if their status isn't unique enough to analogize them to consultants. That's basically -- I mean, it's like nothing else. The Indian tribe relationship is totally unique, and there's a choice of analogies, and I agree with you that it's a stretch of the language, but consultants is a stretch of the language, so shouldn't we try to see if that can't be done in order to prevent the consequence that I just described?"

U.S., this Court's decision in that case did recognize the unique nature that the Government has to deal with, competing interests within water rights adjudications, and while the relationship that the Government and Interior may have with project water, irrigation water users may not approach that of a trustee, certainly Nevada said that the Government is obligated to undertake substantial obligations on their behalf. And when you're talking about the Government making decisions regarding these competing interests, and it's not just the interests of the irrigation interests and of the tribes, it's also competing Federal interests for other federally reserved water rights, one thing that --"

That is, if we held they're not within the agency exception, they are not within it, and therefore whatever documents they give to the trustee, whether it happened to be your situation or any other situation in the world, would be absolutely -- other people would get them. The court privileges would be useless to the Indians, and that would be not only true in your situation, it would be true in every situation, if they don't fall within this. Now, that's what's worrying me."

I mean, there are 30 million lawsuits, or I don't know, 10 million anyway, and in each of those lawsuits they would be unable to use the privileges that are given to every other litigant if they turned over documents, as they normally would in the course of business, to their trustee. Now, is -- you say, well this is a special situation as described. Is there any way to work with that that would make a difference?"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Hitchings, I think that Mr. Stewart said that this case, if we got past interagency, would be on the deliberative process. Nobody is claiming in this case that the United States has an attorney-client relationship that would bring forth a privilege. I think that Mr. Stewart agreed with that, so if we -- if exemption 5 applied at all, we would be looking to the deliberative process privilege but not to attorney-client or work product, is that right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HITCHINGS",
      "speech": "Well, in this case the Government has asserted the deliberative process privilege protects all seven documents that remain in dispute. They have also asserted that the attorney work product privilege protects two of those seven, and that's an additional basis for withholding those documents within the rubric of FOIA exemption 5, and those two documents for which the attorney-client privilege was claimed -- I'm sorry, the attorney work product privilege was claimed, one of them specifically discusses the Klamath project operations plan, one of them specifically discusses the adjudication. So there is somewhat of a mix in the privileges that have been claimed here, but it is true that the primary thrust of the Government's argument in this case has been that all of the documents are protected by the deliberative process privilege within FOIA exemption 5."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "If the Government cannot prevail under section 5, are there as to these two documents as to which work product was -- will the work product privilege protect those independently of section 5?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HITCHINGS",
      "speech": "Our position is that it does not, and it's because they do not -- for the same reasons that it does not work within the deliberative process analysis it does not work within the attorney work product analysis either. They do not have a common goal, a common defense or prosecution against a common adversary here. The Government again, Interior itself has many obligations and many competing interests."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HITCHINGS",
      "speech": "Correct and, in fact, as far as the Klamath project operations plan, there are a number of interests that the tribes are adverse to the Government on, as well as adjudication, too, and the adjudication contests were filed in May of this year, where the tribes themselves have filed contests to claims filed on behalf of the Fish & Wildlife Service for wildlife refuges up there. That's within the Department of Interior. The same is the case for the Bureau of Reclamation's claims that have been filed. The same is the case for the Klamath project operations claim. The tribes contest the manner in which the project is operated if the Government is operating in a manner to benefit project irrigation users, perhaps wildlife refuges, whatever the other Federal interests may be in that case. One of the points that was brought up by the Solicitor General's argument was this alternative test of what the role of the document might play, and our position has been throughout this that that would pretty much bring within the purview of FOIA exemption 5 any document that is submitted to the Government. If the Government was able to withhold a document based upon its affidavit of the role that document played within its discussion, that would include just about anything, and it would provide the opportunity for Federal agencies to cloak all types of discussions based upon that type of assertion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, now I don't understand that. I thought that in order to work, 5, you have to satisfy two things. First, you don't even get there unless it's interagency, and if you are there, it's still not protected unless you can assert a privilege that you could assert in a litigation. Am I wrong about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HITCHINGS",
      "speech": "That's correct, there are those two tests to that."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "All right, so in other words, the only things that you -- the only -- if it applies, it only creates privacy in respect to the following things, those things that, independently, litigation privilege creates privacy for. Now, am I right about that, or not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HITCHINGS",
      "speech": "Correct. You would need to satisfy that threshold test of whether it is inter or intraagency and then meet the secondary test, which is whether it is normally privileged within the civil discovery context."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "That's -- you see, that's why I'm worried, because we're only talking about things that would otherwise be privileged, and now they lose that privilege. I'm just repeating myself, but I'm explaining why I'm worried to try to get from you something that will make me less worried."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HITCHINGS",
      "speech": "Well, I understand that, the worry that is caused by that, but again, I think there may be other circumstances where other FOIA exemptions may apply. It may be in other circumstances that FOIA exemption 4 could apply, because it's a commercial privilege that is -- or involves commercial information, or financial information that is otherwise privileged and confidential. In fact, amici in support of the petitioner in this case brought that very point up, so there may be circumstances where the Government could assert other privileges."
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Medical records, are medical records privileged under FOIA?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HITCHINGS",
      "speech": "That would be within unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, perhaps, or one of the other exemptions --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I think they're specifically mentioned in that provision, medical records and other -- whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, but that provision letters that would not be available, memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation, that isn't -- that goes well beyond just attorney-client material, doesn't it? I mean, I thought that was a fairly expansive provision, and if it were not routinely available in litigation, it benefits from that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HITCHINGS",
      "speech": "Correct. There are other examples, and it is the discovery privilege that have been historically noted, and those would be attorney-client, attorney work product, deliberative process, if there are specific, maybe psycho -- psychiatrist-patient, doctor- patient, those types of discovery privileges, but in this case there is no recognized trustee-beneficiary privilege. There has not been recognized within -- there has not been one recognized within the civil discovery context, and FOIA is not a means to create a new civil discovery privilege. This Court's decision in Weber Aircraft explicitly stated that, and that's cited in our brief."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So you say that the petitioner would ultimately lose, even though satisfying the interagency requirement, because of the routinely available of discovery product."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HITCHINGS",
      "speech": "Our position is that the Government simply cannot meet that threshold interagency test here, because you have a circumstance where they are not serving as a neutral outside, objective consultant. They are -- in this case the tribes are an interested party. The Government is allocating a valuable benefit or privilege amongst not only that interested party but many others, including other Federal interests, and our position is that test just simply is not met here because of those circumstances. Now, granted, there are circumstances where you do have a paid outside consultant that is providing information to the agency because it may be outside of that agency's expertise, but the paid consultant has no direct interest in the decision that the Government is making for which those correspondence are provided, and that's clearly distinguishable from this case."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Suppose that we thought -- I may be taking it out of context, but Justice Scalia once wrote that that's exemption -- said something about including any agency document that is part of the deliberative process. Just taking that phrase, suppose it was possible to read section 5 in that way, would your documents come into that, too, not the ones you want, but your own submissions?"

Granted, we would love to have the opportunity to have secret communications with Interior on the decisions that we're making here, but we recognize that FOIA exemption 5 just is not read that broadly, and should not be read that broadly, and I think in Justice Scalia's dissent, I believe that was in the Julian case, he specifically stated that it talks about a consultant in a governmentally conferred capacity, and that seems to indicate that you're talking about the traditional relationship where you have a consultant that's paid by the Government to give it expert advice."

      "speech": "I'd like to address the question of the role of the Government in allocating a scarce benefit, and particularly with regard to the Oregon general stream adjudication. I think as the Court is certainly aware, the way that a priority system of water rights works is the most senior water user gets whatever rights it's entitled to, and then if there's water remaining the next most senior, and so forth down the line, and the position of the United States in the Oregon adjudication, and a position which was upheld by the Ninth Circuit in Adair, is that the tribes have a priority date earlier than that of the Klamath project. And there are questions remaining as to the quantification of that right, but when the United States presents claims on behalf of the tribe, if the United States believed that the tribes was entitled to a certain amount of water but nevertheless asserted claims for a lesser amount in order that more should be left over for the project, we would be breaching our fiduciary duty to the tribes."
