      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress answered the call of the judiciary by enacting section 1658, a bright line rule that provides a default statute of limitations of 4 years for any civil action arising under an act of Congress after December 1st, 1990. Section 1658 applies to plaintiff's claims because this Court said in Patterson that plaintiff did not have claims of racial harassment and -- and termination and discharge claims. Plaintiff's claims arise under the 1991 Civil Rights Act because that is the act that created the cause of action that plaintiff has filed under. In Rivers, this Court held that the 1991 act, as amended by the 1991 Civil Rights Act, was a new cause of action that created new liabilities and a new standard of conduct. Therefore, under section 1658, under the plain meaning of that statute, the 1991 Civil Rights Act applies. The simple one-sentence statute has been interpreted in such a way as to give it no meaning. The terms, arising under, and the term, civil action, are simple terms used by this Court repeatedly to describe the statute's reach and that reach includes all civil actions arising under an act of Congress after December 1st, 1990, whether it has roots in or references preexisting law."

Does that make sense to to have those two claims both stemming from the original 1981, but one having extended it?"

      "speaker": "GORMAN",

I -- I believe it does, Your Honor, and the reason is that the purpose of section 1658 is to cut down on borrowing and State limitations periods that have been used for the borrowing purposes, and anything that cuts down on those purposes of borrowing is going to be going to the effect of that statute. Now, the fact that there are two statutes of limitations is not unusual in -- in the discrimination cases that I file. There are often many statutes of limitations that someone has to look at. For example, in the Age Discrimination Act, there are two statutes of limitations for willful and not willful. Often claims are filed under section -- under title VII, as well as under section 1981, and we have various statutes of limitations that we deal with in those claims as well."

But it -- the statute is clear that it's for all new causes of action or for all causes of action that arise under acts of Congress after December 1st, 1990, and I think it's very clear that plaintiffs' claims did not arise until the 1991 Civil Rights Act.

We say that Federal courts can take jurisdiction in that situation.

When Congress adopted -- when Congress amended the Telecommunications Act of 1936 to add the Sarbanes- Oxley amendment, it put in the statute of limitations that it knew it wanted to have so it would be consistent with other statute of limitations within that statute.

Originally the act, as proposed by the Federal Courts Study Committee, would have applied a uniform statute of limitations to all existing causes of action. And some Members of Congress and groups believed that that would create retroactivity concerns. So the -- the compromise that was adopted was that the uniform statute of limitations would apply on a going-forward basis with respect to causes of actions that were created by acts of Congress enacted after December 1990. This case involves precisely such a cause of action. Petitioners' claims we know from the Patterson case were not actionable under statute 1981 prior to the 1991 Civil Rights Act. The only reason petitioners are in Court today and have viable claims is because of the 1991 Civil Rights Act. Therefore, we think that respondent's position which results in the conclusion that petitioners' claims arise under the -- the same statute at issue in Patterson, the statute that we know does not create those claims, is an absurd conclusion that we think counsels against their position."

But we don't think it's a problem if the Court concludes that petitioners' claims depend on both subsection (a) of 1981 and subsection (b) of 1981 because petitioners' claims only exist today because of the 1991 act, in that respect, arise under that act, under the dictionary definition of arising under and under the settled definition of arising under that Congress uses in title 28 of the United States Code. Petitioner seems to read the statute's reference to an act of Congress to refer only to an act of Congress that creates the kind of wholly new self-contained cause of action I mentioned."

      "speech": "Respondent. You're right, Mr. Chief Justice. But we think, as -- as Judge Alito concluded in his dissenting opinion in the Zubi case, that an act of Congress is just as naturally read and has to be read to include an act of Congress that creates a cause of action by amending an existing cause of action. And all of respondent's objections about the practicality of our position, which we think is -- is the plain-meaning position of what Congress -- the statute that Congress wrote, have to be weighed against the intractable problems that this Court and the Federal Courts Study Committee identified with respect to the past practice of borrowing State statutes of limitations. Our inquiry focuses the analysis exclusively on Congress' actions and Federal law, and we think that that's where Congress wanted the courts to focus. The prior practice focused the inquiry on State law. It required Federal courts to canvas State law, to identify an analogous State cause of action, and then to try to identify the statute of limitations that would apply in the State to that cause of action, and then to make a separate determination whether that State statute of limitations could appropriately be applied to Federal law. And that had created great uncertainty and great disparity in the application of Federal law. Indeed, under the old practice, a single Federal claim could be subjected to 50 different State statutes of limitations. And that was the problem that Congress was addressing at the -- the recommendation of the Federal Courts Study Committee in enacting section 1658. And it decided, as a result of the compromise, to apply it only on a going-forward basis with respect to new claims that were created by Congress after 1990. Petitioners' claims only exist today as a result of Congress' action in the 1991 act, and we think they're clearly governed by the default statute of limitations established by section 1658. As petitioners' counsel made clear, section 1658 is only a default rule. Congress can always specify a different rule and it has done so several times since 1990. It did so in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of -- of 2002, and that's significant because that act, Sarbanes-Oxley, amending an existing cause of action under the Securities and Exchange Act -- so if -- if Congress had in mind the interpretation of section 1658 that respondent proposes, it's certainly odd that Congress felt obliged to amend 1658 to put in the special statute of limitations for securities laws claims."

It is a -- it is a phrase that is used repeatedly in different contexts, routinely used with a very pragmatic -- in a very pragmatic fashion and does not answer the question whether or not Congress, when it adopted 1658, or Congress, when it amended section 1981, really envisioned this kind of expansive interpretation that would allow an argument to be made that State laws are suddenly subject to statutes of limitations. As Justice Scalia asked, when you make other kinds of adjustments in these schemes, are you going to have to resolve every -- every one of these issues? I mean, the question with respect to the split in the circuits. There is currently pending a proposed change to the Air Carriers Access Act that specifically resolves the conflict in the circuits between the Eleventh Circuit which says there is no cause of action and other circuits that says there is a cause of action. These aren't hypotheticals. These are real issues and if this Court is not careful in how it tries to confine the interpretation of section 1658, it's going to be interpreting the statute for the better part of the next 10 years, which may be good news for me as a practitioner before the Court.

The question is, do you want to create a regime in which this Court is going to have to be resolving questions involving the meaning of section 1658 for the foreseeable future? Or doesn't it make sense to recognize that there is, in fact, a -- a complete set of causes of action to which 1658 will routinely apply and that it will be spared -- the courts will be spared and the litigants will be spared the burden of having to sort out these kinds of issues on a going-forward basis and recognize that we're not going to pick up everything in the interim? But as Congress wants to go forward and create new causes of action, the opportunity will arise, and it can do so. But if it chooses to engraft it on an existing infrastructure, then it seems to me under those circumstances, what the Court should do is say these cause of action arises at this point in time.

I don't think they have to do it in a new title 79 or whatever, but they clearly have to do it by doing more than simply changing the definition of a single set of terms in a statute that is otherwise left utterly unchanged under these circumstances.

That in my mind leaves two options. There are effectively two clear options on the table. One is to apply section 1658 to all section 1981 claims and the other is to -- is to continue the practice of applying State borrowed statutes of limitations to all of those claims. Both of those rules create the same level of certainty, but one of those rules, namely the -- the rule that would apply section 1658 to all section 1981 claims, is plainly inconsistent with Congress' intent and indeed with the language of section 1658 itself in that it would apply to claims that on any understanding arose under preexisting law. Accordingly, the State submits that the respondent's position here is the best among the available alternatives."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But, Mr. Newsom, the reason that Congress grandfathered the claims that already existed, as Mr. Phillips said, was because of expectations that I'm off the hook after 2 years, say. That -- that doesn't exist when a right is created, a right to relief, that didn't exist before."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NEWSOM",
      "speech": "Well, I think the the expectations that Congress sought to protect in -- in section 1658 were expectations with respect to certain categories of claims. In enacting section 1658 Congress recognized that there were certain categories of claims that had developed established limitations rules. For instance, under this Court's then-recent decisions in Wilson v. Garcia and Goodman v. Lukens Steel, section 1983 claims as a -- as a category and section 1981 claims as a category were both subject to single borrowed State statutes of limitations. So I think the expectation that Congress sought to protect was the expectation of a litigant that I have a 1981 claim and it will be subject to the following statute of limitations. So I think the -- that -- I mean, it sounds to me that there is agreement this morning that -- that the appropriate test to apply is the test whether or not Congress has created a new cause of action. I think the clearest evidence that Congress has done that, that Congress has created a new cause of action, is where Congress creates and enacts an entirely new, separate statutory section. And again, contrary to petitioners' suggestions -- and Justice Kennedy is quite right -- there are numerous times that Congress has, since December 1 of 1990, created an entirely new and freestanding causes of action to which section 1658 would certainly apply. Now, Congress' choice in the 1991 Civil Rights Act not to create a new statutory section and instead to -- to work within the four corners of section 1981 and to -- to fine tune the existing cause of action that already existed in section 1981 is a strong indication -­"

The district court did not conclude whether this class of -- this class of plaintiffs' promotion and assignment claims would succeed on a specific set of facts. The problem -- and that we think is the -- the problem inherent in petitioners' position that ties the question of whether a new cause of action has been created to the viability of a given claim rather than looking, as section -- as section 1658 directs the Court to do, what -- to -- to whether or not a civil action is created.

That, in essence, is -- is the -- is the -- the proposition coming out of this Court's decision in Wilson v. Garcia, as Mr. Phillips said, which is that in that case, Justice O'Connor, for instance, made a very good point in her dissent that -- in that 1983 claims run the gamut from police brutality claims on the one hand to -- to school desegregation cases on the other and thought that it just didn't make sense to apply a single statute of limitations to such a wide variety of claims.

So again, if I can just emphasize, Congress -­ Congress acted in section -- or rather in the 1991 act against a very specific backdrop, namely this Court's then-recent decision in Goodman v. Lukens Steel, which held that a -- that a single borrowed State statute of limitations would apply to all section 1981 claims. Now, if Congress wanted to walk away from Goodman and create a new cause of action so as to trigger section 1658's 4­ year statute, then our submission is then it had to be clear about what it was doing. It had to -- in the paradigmatic example, it had to create a new standalone section. At the very least, it had to create a -- a self- contained and freestanding civil action within the confines of section 1681.

If defendant's interpretation is accepted by this Court, then we are basically saying section 1658 is a nullity because we have scoured the statutes enacted by Congress after December 1st, 1990 and we could not find one statute that would benefit from section 1658, because Congress often takes terms or definitions or causes of action from previous statutes and amends, even when it thinks it's creating or it looks like it's creating something brand new."

And I don't think that's what section 1658 is stating. I think if -- even if this Court says, we're relying on old section 1981, as well as 1981 as amended by the Civil Rights -- Civil Rights Act, clearly our claim is still dependent on the 1991 act and therefore section 1658 would still come into play. And as far as confusion, defendant suggested that there was even confusion in this case because the judge in our case did not know if class 2 claims were covered by this section 1658. There is no confusion with the court. It just wasn't briefed before the court. There was no record before the court because we had asked for a slightly different definition in our class certification, and the judge went beyond that definition and established a different class for the class 2. So the judge just didn't have the record and he thought we could figure that, which I think we probably could. And I think the answer is going to be that the class 2 claims also fall under the 1658 statute. The question before this Court is a narrow one: does section 1658 apply to plaintiffs' cause of action for racial discrimination and termination? Those claims were not created until the 1991 Civil Rights Act, and I submit to the Court that section 1658 should apply to those claims. Thank you."
