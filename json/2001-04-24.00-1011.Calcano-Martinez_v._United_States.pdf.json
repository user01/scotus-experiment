Never in our country's history has an alien been subject to deportation without the judicial branch determining the legal validity of the administrative deportation order. We submit that the Constitution does not permit denying judicial scrutiny of the Attorney General's ruling, and that the statute did not deprive this Court and the district court and the courts of appeals of considering the pure question of law presented in this case."

It is as an exercise of discretion, and it's in tune with what I think is the current climate in the legislature.

What the Attorney General has said is that he lacks the legal authority to exercise discretion, on a pure question of interpreting the statute that Congress has divested him of the legal authority to consider applications for discretionary relief. We do not believe that the Attorney General, if he interpreted this statute correctly, would adopt a categorical rule. There's no reason to believe that.

Whether it's because it doesn't constitute a final order within the meaning of the statute as intended, because there's a legal error underlying the adjudication, or whether there is a final order but it's reviewable nonetheless for that legal -- because it lacks legal validity, either way there's review of that determination."

      "speech": "Well, I'm asking if you could make the argument that your client is not removable because the statute does not prevent discretion being exercised as to him, you've asked for discretion, it hasn't been exercised, so there is no final order against an alien who is removable."

Not all of them contain that phrase, who is removable. Subsection (g), entitled, Exclusive Jurisdiction, does not use the term. It says, except as provided in this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this Act. It does not contain the language that you now want to rely upon."

We have no -- our construction of the statute permits that, because we agree that the final order of removal is reviewable in the court of appeals.

I mean, if you're going to read removable, who is removable that broadly, that is to say that any defect in the proceedings which rendered the order of removal invalid causes him not to be removable, you simply open up the whole statute. You say any defect which causes him not to be removable takes him out of (a)(2)(C). I mean, it just cuts a swath through the entire statute."

The question of eligibility for that relief was decided by a legal ruling of the Attorney General that -- and that determines whether or not it was a properly entered final order of removal.

But then the question is whether that conviction constitutes a deportable offense within the meaning of the Immigration Act, and that's a question that the Government agrees is reviewable and, as I indicated, that the question of whether or not the final order of removal was properly entered must be reviewable as well, and if there's been a failure to allow the person to apply for the discretionary relief for which they are entitled by statute, then that cannot be a legally valid order of removal, and again I --"

The Attorney General has construed the Immigration Act to say that our clients are not eligible to apply for the exercise of discretion to which the statute entitles them. That question must be reviewable in a court to determine whether the Attorney General improperly excluded an entire class of people from eligibility for discretionary relief, and this Court's decision in Foti and in Chadha and in other cases recognized that the final order is contingent on the issuance -- the adjudication of discretionary relief, and that means two questions.

We believe that there's ambiguity in the statute, given the severe constitutional questions that would be raised if there were no review at all of this pure question of law, the Attorney General's decision, and that ambiguity can come from the term, removable. We set forth in our brief the reason why we think the term, review, is not sufficiently clear to bar the scope of inquiry that's always been available to review a final order."

It is a statute that seeks to limit the role of the courts, and our contention is that it can do that, but it cannot preclude the courts from reviewing and determining the legal validity of the order, and that that is a question that is, whether there are legal -- in this case, that is a question of whether there is a legal eligibility determination. We think the Accardi case is very significant in this respect, because in the Accardi case, this Court confronted the question of the scope of habeas corpus inquiry to review a final order of deportation. It was a case of an alien who was admittedly deportable, there was no issue about that, and claimed that he had not gotten a lawful exercise of discretion because the Attorney General had refused to exercise his discretion, as was required. In this case -- and the Court held that that was reviewable in habeas corpus during the period when the review was as restricted as it could possibly be, the year after this Court said in the Heikkila case that the only review that was available was that which was constitutionally required. Now, this claim is even more fundamental."

And the Court rejected that, and exercised discretion, and said there's a fundamental difference between reviewing the exercise of discretion and reviewing the refusal to exercise discretion, and this is a case about the refusal to exercise discretion based on the Attorney General's legal ruling that an entire class of individuals is not eligible for relief. And it's our -- our only challenge is to that determination by the Attorney General, that his legal determination as to who is eligible to apply and who is not is legally incorrect, and we believe that claim must be reviewable in a court. It can be the court of appeals, and we set forth why we believe that is entirely possible and appropriate, but it must be reviewable in a court. I'd like to save --"

      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1996, in two separate statutes, Congress fundamentally restructured the Nation's immigration laws. There are amendments of general applicability, and also ones specifically dealing with criminal aliens to ensure that criminal aliens were expeditiously removed from the United States. Briefly, the three amendments of general applicability that are most relevant to these two cases this morning are Congress's elimination of deportation and exclusion proceedings, and replacing them with a single proceeding called removal. Secondly, Congress repealed the prior 1182(c) under which petitioners here seek relief, and replaced it with a new proceeding, or form of discretionary relief called cancellation of removal, and third, Congress reenacted, or enacted a new judicial review provision which channeled judicial review, if it's to be had at all, to the courts of appeals. The two amendments specifically dealing with criminal aliens that are relevant here is that Congress not only repealed the prior 1182(c), but rendered aggravated felons and in some cases other criminal aliens altogether ineligible for cancellation of removal, and secondly, Congress provided in section 1252(a)(2)(C) of the Act that no court, which includes both the court of appeals and the district court, shall have jurisdiction to remove -- to review an order of removal entered against an alien who had committed one of the specified criminal offenses. The theory was that an alien, just like a citizen, would have full access to the courts to contest the criminal conviction in the criminal proceedings, both direct review and collateral attack, but once that was done, the validity of the conviction was established, and therefore, with respect to access to the courts, there was really no further need to test the central basis on which the alien was to be removed."

I'm not sure whether -- perhaps the collateral review court, although I'm not sure why that would be so, because it could be a State collateral proceeding that the alien was trying to have his conviction, State court conviction set aside in, and I wouldn't think that court would have any authority to enjoin a removal under Federal immigration law, so it may be that the alien could apply to the district director and perhaps --"

The word removable refers not merely to their alien status, and not merely to their conviction. It refers necessarily to a statute which makes them removable, and if, as you concede, they can challenge the alien status, they can challenge the fact of the conviction, why, by a parity of reasoning, may they not also challenge the fact that the statute that the Attorney General is operating under doesn't make them removable until discretion has been exercised? How do you draw that line?"

This provision must mean something else, and we think it quite clearly encompasses denial of discretionary relief by the Attorney General, whether that denial is based on an exercise of discretion or the Attorney General's determination that Congress has not conferred on him the power to exercise discretion. In either event, the alien has been denied relief that Congress has specified is discretionary, and as that --"

Now, maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong, but it sounds as if they're making a claim that is a claim of jurisdiction, or very similar to one, and how do you distinguish that very basic claim that there is no jurisdiction because there is no applicable law from the claims that you admit you could hear, which include, I am not the alien, I am not removable -- you say in your brief they could hear whether the alien is removable, whether the ground of removal is one which precludes judicial review, whether the statute is unconstitutional, and whether the proceeding is fundamentally unfair.

Congress -- in other words, what Congress did with respect to the question at issue here was to vest the final determination whether to grant discretionary relief in the Attorney General, whether that is based on an interpretation of the statute, or the exercise of discretion, or sometimes a combination of the two."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "Well, one thing to bear in mind is that the petitioner in Accardi argued the case in terms of a due process violation. What was alleged there was that the Attorney General had engaged in prejudgment and had deliberately subverted an administrative scheme for adjudicating discretionary applications, and the petitioner argued that that was a violation of due process. Now, this Court subsequently has said in the University of Missouri, in 435 U.S., that Accardi did not state a rule of constitutional law binding on the States, so in light of subsequent understandings of what Accardi stood for, it would seem odd that if it didn't state a fundamental rule of constitutional law that is binding on the States, that it would nonetheless be the sort of thing that Congress would be compelled to provide judicial review of under the immigration laws. I wanted to respond to two statutory questions, and then perhaps explore this point further. Petitioners have relied on the Foti and Chadha cases with respect to the final order of removal being contingent upon the exercise of discretion, in those cases suspension of deportation. That -- the Court explored that, though, solely for purposes of deciding which court would, as a statutory matter, have jurisdiction over the particular claim there, and what the Court said is, sensibly it only -- it makes sense for suspension of deportation claims to be heard in the courts of appeals because the Attorney General has chosen to adjudicate applications for suspension of deportation together with the substantive basis for deportation in one single proceeding. But the Court made pretty clear in Foti that the Attorney General was not required to do that, and it would have been equally consistent with the Act for the Attorney General to determine whether to grant relief to particular aliens outside of the affirmative removal proceeding as a matter of discretion, maybe on a sort of certiorari jurisdiction to the Attorney General to decide at the close of the case whether to do that or not, and that remains the case under the current law. Nothing in the Act requires that the Attorney General adjudicate an application for 1182(c) relief, or for cancellation of removal before entering a final order of removal. The regulations provide that method of adjudication, but nothing in the Act does, and the question, I think, for purposes of whether judicial review is compelled is whether there is a statutory right, because after all, Congress has plenary power over immigration, over the jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts, and broad power over the fashioning of the writ of habeas corpus, as this Court said in Felker, and Congress could legitimately decide if there is not a statutory right to have an application for cancellation or 1182(c) relief adjudicated in a particular --"

And Congress enacted IIRIRA against the background of great frustration with the inability of the system to remove criminal aliens from the United States, and because of the potential for criminal aliens to tie up the courts in trying to stave off the removal. This is an example of this in this very case, that these aliens unquestionably are removal -- removable, have conceded it, and yet we are litigating a number of years later on the question of whether the --"

      "speech": "May I just interrupt you, Mr. Kneedler, with this question. They are unquestionably removable, and there's no right to discretion if your construction of the statute is right, but sort of in the background of this case is the question whether convictions obtained before the enactment of this statute have the same legal significance as convictions obtained afterwards, and am I correct in understanding that the Government's position is there's no way in which a Federal court can decide whether that's correct or not?"
    },

      "speech": "What you are doing when you say that, it seems to me, is reading the words of the statute that says, removable by virtue of the criminal convictions and so on, to mean not removable, but to mean ordered removed by the Attorney General. You are taking a statute that says removable, and you are reading it to say, ordered removed, thereby insulating the courts, or the alien from the possibility of challenging the correctness of the statute under which the Attorney General is acting."

One says, review any final order, so that's the passage that deals with there having been an order entered, and then it says, against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense. That is simply identifying which aliens, which ground of removal triggers the preclusion of review --"

I think it does no more than identify the -- if I could mention one other thing. The word removable is defined in the Act, but for -- this is in 8 U.S.C. 1229a(e)(2), which is not reproduced in the papers, but since the question was raised, it is part of the provision that deals with removal proceedings, and it says -- now, again, it says in this section, meaning the section dealing with removal, and the next section, which deals with cancellation of removal, the statute says, the term removable means, in the case of an alien who hasn't been admitted, that the alien is inadmissable under 1182 of the Act, or, in the case of an alien admitted to the United States, such as the aliens here, that the alien is deportable under section 1227 of this title. In other words, the term is meant to identify the substantive ground on removal that --"

They're challenging the Attorney General's operation under a statute that they say doesn't apply, and removable can cover that just as well as it can cover the substantive grounds relied upon for the removal."

I mean, if you take removable in the broad sense to mean all of the conditions have been complied with to make the removal proper, if you take it in that broad sense, this provision makes no sense, because in that broad sense, nobody is removable solely by reason of having committed a criminal offense."

I was trying to envision what such a challenge would be, given the tightness of the statute."

      "speech": "We -- I think not. I think that the -- I think the only thing that could be done would be to challenge the constitutional ground of removal. Congress -- as we point out in our brief, the one thing that is clear from the legislative background of the passage of IIRIRA and AEDPA is that Congress wanted to expeditiously remove criminal aliens from the United States, and it regarded the entry of the judgment of conviction as a sufficient ground for doing so. It did not want to provide -- first, in our view, we believe Congress eliminated discretionary grounds for removal, but it surely would not have intended to have litigation over that."
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but that's all perfectly clear with respect to convictions after the statute is passed, but the problem is, it's not quite as clear, as least, as to convictions before the statute was passed, and that's why we have the problem."

    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "It is, but it wouldn't be at all surprising that in the climate in which Congress acted, what Congress wanted to do was to vest the final determination on questions such as that in the Attorney General. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the Attorney General could have just decided, taking into account the recent legislative enactment, simply, even if the Act applied, to say, I'm not granting relief to anyone whom Congress has identified as an unworthy to remain here, and there's no question that that would be a permissible exercise of discretion, which shows that it can't be a fundamental right --"

    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "Well, this is a statute -- again, looking at the statute, in which Congress has given the power to the Attorney General, but unlike, for example, the asylum provision, the asylum provision says in section 208, the Attorney General shall establish a procedure for aliens to file applications for asylum, meaning that the Attorney General has to at least be in a position to receive an application and do something with it. There is no such provision in this Act that requires the Attorney General to receive and consider a particular application for relief from deportation, just as there is nothing to require the President to actually entertain and pass upon an application for a pardon, and this Court said in Jay v. Boyd that this relief is to be regarded much as the application for a pardon to the President of the United States. One final point I want to make clear is that, whatever else may be true with respect to judicial review, the court of appeals was certainly wrong to say that judicial review would be in the district court. It would stand this Act on its head to suggest that criminal aliens whom Congress wanted to remove from the country with particular emphasis would be able to go to the district courts, get a level of review there, go to the court of appeals, and then perhaps to this Court."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, what was wrong with the court of appeals saying, if there's nothing else, there's always the general habeas, unless Congress says specifically -- mentioning the statutory provision by number or name. That essentially was the Second Circuit's position, was it not?"

      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but the answer -- the Second Circuit was saying, we accept what the Government tells us, there's no review in the court of appeals, but Congress has not deleted the general habeas authority."

    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "Congress did two things before IIRIRA was enacted in section 401(e), in a provision called, Elimination of Habeas Corpus, Congress repealed the prior provision for habeas corpus relief and secondly, in the provision enacted here, it channeled all review to the courts of appeals."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "The Government says that those cases came out that way simply because the Attorney General had, as a discretionary matter, decided to determine the discretionary element together with the merits determination, so as a matter of fact, it happened to have been preceding the order of deportation, but that there was no legal requirement that that be the case."

      "speaker": "GUTTENTAG",
      "speech": "There continues to be the case that the regulations require that, Your Honor. There's no doubt about that, that the regulations require the immigration judge to adjudicate an application for relief. That, in and of itself, is a duty. Secondly, the cases do say that the final order is contingent on the determination, and this is not about the exercise --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Do you have a regulation number for that, or --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTTENTAG",
      "speech": "It's 212 -- it was 212e(b)(2), I believe, and it's currently also the regulation governing the current version of that, which is the cancellation of removal, and I'd be happy to provide it at the next case, if that's -- that that final order -- and I don't believe the Government would actually contend that under the statute as it's currently implemented, and as it has been since 1917, and under the regulations that govern, that a final order could be entered with the immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Attorney General simply say, I refuse to adjudicate your application for relief. If the Attorney General determines that the individual is not legally eligible, then so be it, but that claim is reviewable. If the Attorney General exercises discretion, then that is not reviewable, and we concede that. The -- what the -- what this Court has said about the pardon analogy to the discretionary decision goes to the exercise of discretion. That's very clear from the Jay v. Boyd case. It's clear from the Yang case, Your Honor, where the exercise of discretion is not reviewable, but the question of whether the Attorney General has properly construed who is eligible, the Attorney General in this case has said that an entire class of individuals is ineligible because I determined that, Congress instructed me to apply this law retroactively. Whether the statute applies retroactively or not is a question that the courts must decide. That's what Landgraf said, and it's for Congress to legislate clearly and specifically what the temporal scope of the statute is, and that's not for the Attorney General to determine. I also, in regard to the particular provision governing the review of discretionary decisions that Mr. Kneedler referred to, that refers to particular determinations there in the -- that are in the discretion of the Attorney General. For example, asylum claims remain reviewable, so it's clear that the preclusion provision here still would do a significant amount of work, and as far as the definition of what constitute -- of what removable means, that definition does not specifically apply to the term in section 1252, in the judicial review provision. It is a definition, but it does not specifically apply to what we have at issue here. And finally, in terms of the Government arguing that the Attorney General could simply decide to deny any exercise of discretion, that is the Chennary principle, that the decision of the Attorney General must be, correct or not --"
