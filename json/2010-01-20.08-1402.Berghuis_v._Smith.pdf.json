      "speaker": "RESTUCCIA",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is really a case about the law of habeas corpus for this murder conviction that was obtained in the Michigan courts. The issue was whether the Michigan Supreme Court unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court precedent in rejecting Mr. Smith's claim that his jury was not drawn from a fair cross-section of the community. The Michigan Supreme Court did not act unreasonably in concluding that there was no unconstitutional underrepresentation and that there was no systematic exclusion. This Court's decision in Duren did not require a different result on either point, and this Court should reverse the Sixth Circuit. I think it's important to note that there are two prongs at issue: The fair and reasonable representation prong and the systematic exclusion prong. And it’s also significant to understand that the disparities at issue here are relatively small, that the time period at issue runs from -- from April of 1993 to October of 1993, where there was information -- for those 6 months for which the processes at play were measured. And the percentage of African-Americans that appeared in the venires during that time period was -- they comprised 6 percent of the venires, where the jury-eligible population was 7.28 percent. So your -- so there was a 1.28 percent absolute disparity during this 6-month time period. That can also be measured as an 18 percent comparative disparity. Now, if you compare that to the disparities that are issue -- at issue in Duren, they really are a magnitude of difference, that the disparities in Duren involve the exclusion of women in Missouri, where they comprised -- women comprised 54 percent of the population and only 14.5 percent of the venires over an 8-month period of time."

I was teaching, and they said the only way you could figure out what -- what's what here is you use something called “binomial theorem,” and you have to have, like, urns, and you imagine that there’s an urn with 1,000 balls, and 60 of them are red, and 940 are black, and then you select them at random, and -- and 12 at a time. You know, fill 12 -- fill a hundred with 12 in each. And when we tried to do that, just for the interest of it, I -- I found that you would expect, with these numbers, something like a third to a half of juries would have at least one black person on it. Now, that may be wrong, because I am not a mathematician, but -- but putting that together, it looks as if there is a pretty big disparity."

Now, if you look at the one month that's been placed at issue, in which Mr. Smith is indicating that there was a 35 percent comparative disparity for that one month, if that becomes the threshold, the standard used, which the Sixth Circuit concluded was ­ - established a violation of the second prong, then if you think about the practical application that -- for Michigan, for Kent County, if you take your 158 jurors in that jury pool, you’d expect for that one month for there to be four or five Latino-Americans, two Asian- Americans, and one Native American."

And so I think there’s a different standard, that it doesn't have to have gotten it right; it had to have been objectively unreasonable. But setting that aside, you’ll find many cases in which there are disparities of 5 percent and 7 percent which have been rejected. And the reason is you have neutral processes, processes that everyone would agree are reasonable on their face, which result in disparities for distinct groups."

And unless that can be done at the outset, why struggle with these statistics? Now, here, to illustrate, the aspect of the jury selection process that the Sixth Circuit thought was unreasonable was the prior practice of choosing the jurors first for the district courts, the misdemeanor courts, rather than the circuit courts, the -- the felony courts. But the -- the trial judge, it seemed to me, address this in -- in a very thoughtful way, and he said there just isn't any proof that this old system had that effect. And it's hard for me to see how it could have that effect, unless the -- the number of jurors chosen for the district courts in Grand Rapids was disproportionate to the number chosen for the district courts in the other jurisdictions within the county. So that seems to me to be the end of the case.

So you have two different pools that are being compared. The -- if you look at page 13 of the blue brief, it outlines what the disparity was according to Mr. Smith's expert for the time which the assignment to local courts occurred. And in that diagram, it shows, at the end, that there was an 18 percent comparative disparity. And that's the final column in the totals. Now, that's what occurred at the time of which the jury assignment to the local courts occurred first.

And the reason I say that is this: You have -- the Federal courts, on direct review, have looked at voter registration and challenges to voter registration. Voter registration may have a disparate -- or affect distinct groups differently. In the same way that the Second and Tenth Circuit have looked at cases where they failed to follow up on non-returns, that -- if you don't follow up on non-returns, it may affect distinct groups differently. The analysis of the Federal courts on that issue has been that the decisions to exempt yourself from jury service or the failure to respond to an invitation for jury service is outside the system. Even if it occurs regularly and is persistent, it's still not inherent in the process. That's what the Michigan Supreme Court said here about the excuses for hardship and transportation -- for the excuses. But it's also true that the process by which you select jurors in district courts is not something that is a systematic exclusion of anyone. It's -- on its face, it is neutral, and if you -- if this Court concludes that neutral practices like sending out -- using a certain body, whether voter registration or if it's driver's licenses and Michigan identification cards, or not following up on non-returns, or allowing excuses for hardship, or -- or assigning jurors to a district court first, if that is -- can result in systematic exclusion, what's going to happen is that all these neutral processes that Michigan has may result in disparities. And so, as it stands now, Kent County doesn't identify the race and ethnicity of all of its jurors. Well, it's going to have to if it's going to have to have this perfect correspondence of the jury­ eligible population. It will no longer have this kind of blind neutrality --"

      "speaker": "RESTUCCIA",

The question is: Does the court -- does the State ever wish -- ever wish to be in a position of having to be subject to the challenge? But -- but I think I want to come back to -- one of the prevailing points of all of this is that this is also the Michigan Supreme Court. There’s no question that it had reached the merits and was entitled to AEDPA deference. And the -- the question was: Was there adequate guidance to the State of Michigan to know that this was both systematic -- that this was systematic exclusion and inherent in the process? And Duren was not clear on that point. The -- the analysis of the Michigan courts really corresponds quite closely to what the Federal courts have done, so it cannot be objectively unreasonable.

And then, further -- systematic -- if the card was not returned, if a card sent to a woman was not returned, it was automatically assumed that she did not wish to serve. There was no follow-up.

After all of that, then Justice White tells us, the State could still come back and say yes, that's true, but there were other reasons why women didn't show up. Maybe they were disproportionately elderly, or maybe they were involved with child care. That's what -- that's what Duren said, that the -- showing a systematic factor was the plaintiff's burden, and then the State could justify why the numbers came out that way."

Or is it the defendant's obligation to point to some aspect of the selection -- of the -- of the system that causes the disparity?

Now -- and so most of them would rather serve nearer where they live.

And if you do it the way they’re doing it, you'll lose those one or two people, but you will let people serve closer to home. So I just think -- as a person, not as a judge -- that's why I am letting you answer it as a judge -- but I mean, I’d say, well, it doesn't sound like much of a big deal.

I bet members of this Court have a longer commute.

Then Grand Rapids takes back simply the number of people it -- it took, its set, which would be 10 percent, and it takes black -- takes back all of the blacks, who are the Grand Rapids residents.

But what -- but now you’re forcing them into this legal rubric. So what about a decision, which you wouldn’t like, probably, but it would say we can't say that they’re unreasonable in respect to not having all of these, but there -- who knows?

And its conclusion, I think probably the easiest analysis here is the conclusion that there was no showing of systemic exclusion, because Mr. Smith failed to show that there was any underrepresentation that arose from the jury assignment process, is probably one of the strongest points, because if you look at the 3 percent comparative disparity, that's less than half of 1 percent absolute disparity. No one claims that that’s statistically significant. So I think whether it's reviewed under 2254(d)(2) or 2254(e)(1), this Court should reverse. Thank you."
