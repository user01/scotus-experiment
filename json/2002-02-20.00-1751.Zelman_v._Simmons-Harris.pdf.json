Under this Court's decisions, especially Mueller, Witters, and Zobrest, and in light of this Court's teachings, most recently in Agostini and Mitchell, the Ohio program is constitutional because it offers a neutral program that offers true private choice to parents. First, the principle of neutrality. There are two criteria that determine where the benefits will go under the program. First is residence in a school district that is or has been taken over by State control. Second is family income. Neither of these criteria has anything to do with religion, but even beyond these basic elements --"

The third and final prong of the neutrality here is the benefit itself. It is, of course, money. It is inherently neutral. There is nothing about that benefit that suggests any sort of reference to religion. The second prong this Court has looked to is the true private choice available for receiving the benefits.

The difference is that in fact there is only one alternative, if you don't take account of the community schools, the suburban schools say no, they don't want any part of this, private schools can't make it on that low tuition, so in fact, isn't it true that something like 99 percent of the students who were receiving these vouchers are in religious schools?"

There is also the affidavit of Paul Peterson, at approximately 98 of the joint appendix, a very lengthy affidavit that describes the different kinds of options available and what their benefits are. The benefit for a community school is, it is considered a public school. There is some amount of accountability that might not be there with respect to a private school, but for a parent who's looking for an alternative to the public schools, that might be a good option for them."

      "speech": "It does point the other way, Your Honor, but we think that there are a number of distinctions which this Court has drawn between the programs at issue, say, in Mueller and Witters that distinguish it from the New York program at issue in Nyquist. The New York program took a class of beneficiaries, that is, the students already within the private schools, and offered them a benefit. The Ohio program approaches the problem very differently. It approaches the problem from all of the schoolchildren in Ohio, or in the Cleveland Public School System, and offers them a benefit which --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but doesn't that simply then go back to this neutrality point, and you're saying because it's neutral, in the sense that it's offered in an even- handed way, query -- your friends on the other side dispute that, but just accepting that categorization, because it's neutral in that sense, that's a distinction which ought to make a difference in the result. But as you agreed earlier, the neutrality that you're talking about is a necessary condition, but it's not a sufficient condition of constitutionality, and at the end of the day, I think what's bothering me about Nyquist and, I suspect, Justice O'Connor, too, is that Nyquist depended not merely on a question of neutrality, but on the effect, and at the end of the day, the effect is a massive amount of money into religious schools in Nyquist, a massive amount of money into religious schools here. That, I think, is the sticking point here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRENCH",
      "speech": "We, of course, disagree, Your Honor, that there is a massive amount going to religious schools as a result of something that the Government is doing. It's true, it's very true --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, your adding a term as a result of what the Government is doing, which is a separate issue as to what the significance is of the private choice, but the effect that Nyquist was concerned with, and the effect that I think has been shown here, is a substantial amount of money, aid to the schools themselves, in relation to the amount of money spent on the program, and in those respects the two are identical."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRENCH",
      "speech": "Well, in that respect, Your Honor, there's no question that there is money that is ending up in religious institutions, because that's what the parents have chosen, but that nondiscrimination provision that I spoke of earlier did not exist in Nyquist. The New York schools at issue in Nyquist could discriminate based on religion, and that, of course, means that the program, the New York program was not open to all-comers."

In Mueller, of course, the percentage of religious schools or the number of parents receiving benefit because they paid tuition to religious schools was 96 percent, and this Court has been very clear that where there is private choice, that percentage that changes from year to year is simply not relevant. The wisdom of that rule --"

      "speaker": "FRENCH",
      "speech": "I would suggest Witters, Your Honor, because it's a financial aid going to, there it was a college student, but an adult, to make a decision about where to send the money. Here, it's an adult parent making a decision about where to send the money on behalf of the child."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRENCH",
      "speech": "That's true, Your Honor, but in Mueller the Court did address that concern, as Justice Powell said in his concurrence in Witters, that it didn't matter that there was only one person, Mr. Witters, using the money for seminary, for the Inland Empire School of the Bible, nor did it matter in Zobrest that there was only one child or one parent, set of parents for a child looking for an interpretive or religious school. Mueller teachers that the percentage that changes from year to year is simply not relevant."

I think it's different in that we fall under the question that was reserved by the Court that there, because they didn't have the nondiscrimination provision, because of the purpose behind that Nyquist program was specifically to aid the private schools, that's very different from the Ohio program that's at issue here.

I would refer specifically to 463 U.S. page 398, and there this Court, when it distinguished -- in Mueller, when it distinguished Nyquist said, in this respect, as well as others, this case is vitally different from the scheme struck down in Nyquist. There, public assistance amounting to tuition grants was provided only to parents of children in nonpublic schools -- pardon me -- in nonpublic schools. This fact had considerable bearing on our decision striking down the New York statute at issue, and then it goes on. It talks about Allen and Everson.

Additionally, two brand-new secular schools were established by reason of this program, the two HOPE schools. They remained in the program until the Community School Act was adopted. That, indeed, doubled the amount of money available to the families. In other words, the maximum scholarship grant, $2,250, and -- but if those same children elected to go to a community school, the State would pay for each child at least double the amount that it would pay if they selected the scholarship --"

I'd like to hear what you say about the endorsement point that Justice Souter initially raised, and my thought is, I'll assume no discrimination, and I'll assume it's a fine program, but imagine you came from Europe or Africa, or a different place, and said, what do they do in the United States by way of educating their children, and you're told, well, $60 billion a year, $40 billion, or some very large amount of money is being spent by the Government to give children K through 12 what is basically a religiously oriented education taught by a parochial school. Wouldn't you then say, in the United States of America, like France or like England, the Government of the United States endorses a religious education for young children by putting money up, massive amounts? Now, I'm putting it that way to get your response, and that's the problem that bothers me most about the word, establishment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOUNG",
      "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. There is no governmental endorsement of religion in this program, and there are several reasons why there isn't. The first, Your Honor, reason would be the amount of money that is spent, first of all, on a public school education, which is approximately $8,000, the amount of money paid for a community secular education, $4,500, and the maximum amount provided to a family that selects a nonpublic school, $2,250. So if -- the first thing you look at is the amount of money that is spent depending on the nature of choice made by the child, and the preference, the -- in that instance is clearly a preference for the secular schools. Secondly, Your Honor, if you look at the history, as well as the context of this particular program, this program was adopted because of one of the most serious educational, public school crises in the United States, and I think anyone trying to determine what was the Government doing, was it endorsing religion, no. The Government was trying to permit low income educationally disadvantaged children who were trapped in a failing system to exercise an alternate choice. So I think any person -- the Cleveland district has been in litigation, Your Honor, for some 20-plus years, in Federal court, because of the difficulties that have been encountered in the public school system. I think anyone looking at this legislation as it was adopted and as it was implemented would conclude that there is certainly no Government endorsement of religion. The Government was trying to resolve a problem of these disadvantaged low income children, and giving them alternate choices, which parents ought to have in any event so that's certainly another reason. When no money flows, not a dollar flows to a religiously sponsored school under this program, but for the independent, private choice of a parent. The State does not direct a dollar to a religiously sponsored school. No --"

Let me emphasize that in response to the question Justice Souter raised at the very beginning of the argument, it isn't just neutrality, but there is clearly neutral criteria here for opting in or out of the program.

Originally it was something much lower, something like 62 percent, except that two of the schools, two of the largest nonsectarian private schools, decided to be come community schools, so originally it was a much different percentage. Are we supposed to examine this program year by year to see what the percentage is?"

Let me give you the percentages, if I may, just to track what you have done. This started out in 1996 with 80 percent of the schools being sectarian and 80 percent of the students going to those schools. By 1999, 2000, the universe had become even more skewed toward the religious. It was 82 percent of the schools and 96 percent of the students."

      "speech": "Well, but now, wait a minute. Why do you not put the community schools and the magnet schools in the universe of choices? That's the problem I'm having with your argument. You say the figures are skewed, but they're skewed only because you will not look at those choices. Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANIN",
      "speech": "We do not look at them for two reasons, Your Honor. One is that the Court in Nyquist explained why it did not go beyond the program itself. It said this. If you extend the -- if you look at the choices that parents have to go to public schools as well as the vouchers in the private schools, you allow, through the tuition grant program, to do precisely what the Establishment Clause prohibits, which is to use tuition grants to pay totally for private, sectarian religious education, the Court said. It's a back-door approach to do precisely what the Establishment Clause prohibits. Secondly, people talked a moment ago about perception, and I think they're completely mistaken. This is the perception. The reasonable observer does not look at public education and the multiple, changing, various programs that are offered. The person looks at this. The State of Ohio has set up a special, well-publicized program which allows a certain number of students to escape from a troubled school district, and appropriates a pot of money into that program, and what the reasonable observer sees is, that program and that pot of money ends up 99.4 percent giving children a religious education."

We don't need community schools. We should just say, you people have 57,000 options. You can stay in the Cleveland public schools, or you can leave that school district, take public money, and go get a religious education. The magnet schools, the community schools, they're not unique. They're part of the way in which a State provides a public education. There are small classes and large classes. There's distance education, and face-to-face education. Magnet schools have been around for 50 years."

      "speech": "Well, because you have a basic proposition that we build our case on, which the Court has adopted, and it is this. If public money that is reasonably attributable to the State is used to pay for a religious education, it violates the Constitution. The only way in which it's not attributable to the State is if it doesn't go there by virtue of a State action or a State decision, but the circuit is broken, and the circuit is broken because in between, standing between the State and standing between the schools, is an independent party with decisionmaking to divert it away. There is no intervening party with decisionmaking here. The parents play a ritualistic role in the transmission process, and if I am a parent, and I am holding a voucher in my hand, I can say, where can I use it, and 99 of my 100 choices is, send my child to a religious school."
    },

I mean, our decision, I take it, would have to govern lots of programs in lots of school districts, and suppose that a particular program in a particular school district was set up for the best possible reason, educate the children, and there's no other way, and suppose, too, that you would have very, very good parochial schools, and also some very, very good private schools, and let's suppose the numbers were several hundred million dollars, and so parents getting the money, about half of them sent them to parochial schools and about half of them sent them to private schools. Now, suddenly, does the constitutional balance change?"

It said, Witters could choose from a huge variety of options, most of which were secular. It said that only a -- an insignificant portion of the total program money will end up going to sectarian schools. Those were the criteria. It seems to me there may be a case, a different case, in which the Court will have to determine what do the words, substantial portion, significant amount, huge array of choices mean, but the Court does that all the time.

Suppose the suburban schools had been included in this mix, that instead of saying, come in if you want, and then the reality is that none of them do, suppose all those school districts surrounding the city were made to be part of the program, and the parents had the choice of sending their children to those public schools, or to the religious private schools, would you then say that -- would it make any difference, that is, if the public schools in the suburban communities were made to participate in this program?"

We just have to provide diversity, let parents choose a good education. Now, it so happens that the only up-and-running schools that happen to be in the inner city are religious schools, educating the poor people in the city at relatively low rates. The State of Ohio adopts a program which allows suburban schools to accept these inner city kids, but the suburban schools say, oh, heck no, we don't want the inner city kids come into our suburban schools. How does one get from here to there? The only schools that happen to be there right now are religious schools. This doesn't mean that the program will always be that way. The experience in Milwaukee was that as the program continued, there were more and more nonreligious private schools, but right now, to start off with, of course they're mostly religious, and that is going to destroy the entire program, so that we can never get from here to there."

There are problems being solved in urban school districts all over the country without voucher program. We have not said much about the educational value vel non of voucher programs, because we don't think that this is a forum for an educational policy debate, but they are a lousy option, and we refer you to the amicus brief of the National School Boards Association.

There is no evidence that competition improves the lot for the 96 percent of the students who remain in the troubled Cleveland Public School System with less resources and even worse problems.

As was just pointed out toward the end of what Mr. Chanin was saying, you had a determination sometime ago by the supreme court of the State of Ohio that its system of public school financing is unconstitutional under Ohio's own constitution. Now, we in our submissions early felt that that was an important threshold question to be looking at, very possibly before you got into big, Federal constitutional questions, and so we have briefed it.

Certainly, as you compare the subject of affluence from district to district, which was the guts of the Ohio decision that I refer to, the problem of comparative qualities changes quite markedly, and you don't have the same kind of problem.

Well, there we are. We're served up with a voucher program, so we look at it, and looking at it, we have argued, and Mr. Chanin has sufficiently covered that, that it is unconstitutional, and we think their effort to defend it is somewhat slap-dash, especially, for example, when they try to defend proselytization in a few hasty paragraphs, overturning 50 years of precedent, as they would hope, and saying proselytization with Government money is okay, where we say that the law since 1948 has been to the contrary, and that's because this voucher program came in, as it were, by the ears, while they were busy working on other, more fundamental things that may well -- and I don't know, Mr. Justice Scalia, and I don't think any of us knows that may well go far to solving --"

First and foremost, the Ohio supreme court upheld the constitutionality of this program under the Establishment Clause, and approved its use as one solution for solving the problem in Cleveland and for any school district that might find itself in a similar unfortunate situation. Second, it appears that respondents have either ignored or do not accept the last 20 years or so of this Court's jurisprudence. Each of the legal principles they have raised here today and in their briefs have been expressly rejected by the Court. Their reliance on percentages was expressly rejected by this Court in Mueller. Their arguments about substantiality of the aid going to religious schools was rejected by five members of the Witters Court. Their question about indoctrination, or proselytization, has been specifically rejected by this Court in the cases involving true private choice, Mueller, Witters, Zobrest, and confirmed again in Agostini and Mitchell most recently. Third, and Your Honor, I believe this goes to your question, Justice Breyer, and your concerns, Justice O'Connor, about the breadth of options that are offered to all Cleveland students, the State of Ohio has looked to every conceivable educational option available, to include all Cleveland students, to include all-comers in terms of students and schools."

If they have -- if they don't have enough spaces available for all who have applied, they must accept students on a lottery system the way that a public school would have to accept all-comers. The scholarship program, though, among all of this array of options, is really the poor relative. They get less money, parents have to pay tuition, and they get no tutorial grants. Perhaps the best way to describe the array of options is that at the eye-level of parents. This Court has said it is important in Rosenberger and again in Justice Powell's concurrence in Witters, that it is important to view all of the circumstances, view all of the consequences as a whole. What respondents seem to want us to do is exclude the religious schools as an option. This Court on many occasions has told us that we can neither inhibit nor advance religion, and that would certainly be the cause there. Finally, it is apparent from the Court's questions and respondents' arguments that the Ohio general assembly had a number of competing and conflicting considerations before it in the face of and in an environment of an educational crisis it needed to solve, and to solve quickly. It seems that Ohio did it right. It didn't take too much money away from the public schools, but gave enough for a limited program that is targeted to the most needy, the poorest of the poor, the low income students who would not otherwise have choice. It is for that reason that we ask the Court to overturn the decision of the Sixth Circuit and uphold this program. Thank you."
