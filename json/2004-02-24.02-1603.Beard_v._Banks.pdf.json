      "speaker": "EISENBERG",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At his trial in 1983, George Banks' team of three defense lawyers presented 23 mitigation witnesses, including three forensic psychiatrists, his mother, brother, and co-workers, a priest, and two nuns. The trial court instructed the jury that it must consider any mitigating evidence unless it was unanimous in rejecting it. Now Banks claims that Mills v. Maryland, a ruling of this Court made after the completion of his direct appeal, entitles him to re-open his death sentence for the killing of 13 people. In fact, Mills creates a new distinct rule regulating the manner of conducting a death penalty hearing that is not applicable retroactively and that in any case was reasonably applied by the State courts attempting to interpret it. The primary issue in this case, though, is whether the Mills rule which prohibits unanimity requirements at the mitigation stage was merely a minor application of existing law dictated by prior precedent or whether it's instead Teague-barred. Mills does cite Lockett v. Ohio for the general proposition that it's beyond dispute that the sentencer, quote/unquote, may not be precluded from considering mitigation. But before Mills, the sentencer, quote/unquote, always referred to the judge or the jury, never to individual jurors. That was a leap made for the first time in Mills. That was new. Even with a unanimity charge, although there wasn't one in this case, as we'll address, a jury still considered the evidence in the manner that juries historically have considered evidence, that is collaboratively. Until Mills, the Constitution had never been read to forbid unanimity as to verdicts, whether general verdicts or special verdicts. And even since Mills, as this Court recently said in Jones v. United States, we have long been of the view that the very object of the jury system is to secure unanimity by a comparison of views and by arguments among the jurors themselves. So the question of jury unanimity, we believe, remained open not only after Lockett but even within the understanding of members of this Court at the time of Mills and thereafter. In fact, in McKoy v. North Carolina, decided 2 years after Mills, four Justices of the Court rejected Lockett as supporting, let alone compelling, a rule against jury unanimity. Now, whether the dissenters in McKoy can be said to be right or wrong about the meaning of Mills is irrelevant in this Teague context. The question is that they believed that Mills, not to mention Lockett, did not resolve the unanimity question presented here. exactly what you mean by jury unanimity because, you know, most States require jury unanimity in the -- in the final verdict."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EISENBERG",
      "speech": "Excuse me, Your Honor, yes. I mean only at the stage of finding whether particular mitigating circumstances are present. That is the -- the jury unanimity question that was decided in the Mills and McKoy cases, as I've said, subject to dispute, strong dispute, among the Court that continued even after Mills. Because this is a Teague case, the question, as I've said, is not whether Mills was right or McKoy was right or which side can be better defended now, but whether State court judges reasonably could have known what the outcome would be. And since even within the Court there was such continuing controversy on the matter, it cannot be said that State judges reasonably could have known, and therefore the case is Teague-barred. But that uncertainty continued even beyond McKoy because in the next similar case before the Court, Walton v. Arizona, the issue was presented on essentially the same basis as the Mills case had been. The single hold­ out juror scenario, that a single juror because of a unanimity requirement in Mills or because, in Walton, a preponderance of the evidence standard, could block consideration of mitigating evidence and thereby mandate a death penalty case."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "On -- on the instructions in the red brief at page 8 and then at page 9, there are two different instructions set out. This is in the respondent's brief. And then the jury form which has to be checked is set out on pages 9 and 10. In your view is that all we should consider when we interpret these instructions, or do you have some additional instructions that you wish us to refer to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EISENBERG",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I think that the instruction here was basically the same throughout, that the message as to unanimity regarding mitigation or not was basically the same throughout the instructions. It's in the joint appendix at page 21. It's repeated at page 26, and we think embodied in the jury form -- I'm sorry -­ also at pages 66 and 67. And in each of those cases, the jury was instructed first that it must be unanimous to find aggravation or no mitigation and then that it must circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances. But, of course, the threshold question is whether the State courts could even have known that there was such a thing as a rule against unanimity, whether or not unanimity was actually required on the facts of this case. And the Walton case, as I've mentioned, is relevant to that question because in Walton the same argument was at issue, and the argument was that because of the preponderance of the evidence standard, a hold-out juror or even really 12 hold-out jurors, so to speak, could be somewhat persuaded by mitigating evidence, could think it significant, but not quite past the tipping point required by the preponderance standard and yet be precluded from considering that evidence at all in the weighing stage. And yet, the defendant lost that argument in Walton. And again, the relevance for Teague purposes is to leave the State courts in the position of trying to determine before Walton, before McKoy, before Mills, in this case in 1983 that the Eighth Amendment through the Lockett case somehow precluded the establishment of unanimity."

Now, one thing that could have meant -- one thing -- is that you cannot execute a person unless 12 people think that not only that crime is unusually outweighs in this person's life any good things he wants to bring in. That's his character. And 12 people have to come to that ultimate judgment. Now, if that's so, 12 people have to come to that ultimate judgment, 12 people have not come to that ultimate judgment when in fact 11 would let him off, but one blocks it by saying I don't agree that this is the mitigating circumstance. So if that's what Lockett means, it would be obvious that that wouldn't satisfy it."

In the Penry case, there were three questions before the jury, three mitigating categories given to the jury. The defendant said, I have some evidence that doesn't strictly fall within one of those three categories. In Lockett, there were three categories of mitigation given to the sentencer, and the defendant said, I have some categories of mitigation that don't fall within those three categories that my sentencer was limited to.

And the court of appeals, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, said that that instruction was not inconsistent with Mills, and it said it was not inconsistent with Mills because an instruction that requires unanimity as to aggravation but doesn't mention unanimity as to mitigation is not an instruction that requires unanimity as to both. It's the same theory that we have been presenting in this case all along.

So in order to apply the first phase of the instructions, they have to decide whether all of them find no mitigation. If all of them don't find the absence of mitigation, then they go to the second stage, and at that point, they are all required to look at mitigation, even if they might have voted against it the first time. So the statute appropriately tracks the kind of mitigation that all of them are required to consider in the weighing process. The second point I want to make, however, Your Honor, is that, of course, this is not the first time that a verdict form like this and an instruction like this have been looked at. And I must emphasize this is a deference case under section 2254. As I explained, the Third Circuit in 1991 looked at a verdict form like this and said, no, this is not a violation of Mills.

But in reference to your question concerning arguments of counsel, in fact, there was no argument of counsel from either side here that the jury had to be unanimous about mitigation. In the same manner that Your Honor has suggested, presumably the prosecutor, had he believed that the jury had to be unanimous about mitigation, it would have been to his advantage to say so and to argue to the jury, all 12 of you have to find these before you can consider them. He didn't say anything like that. And in fact, here's what the defense lawyer said in volume 6 of the trial transcript at pages 2300 and 2301. He wasn't, I believe, specifically referring to mitigation, but he said, quote, think individually, decide this individually. All it takes is one person to save his life. Now, in light of the manner in which the case was argued to the jury and in light of the manner in which the judge presented the charge and laid out the verdict form, we believe that the jury would not have -- cannot be assumed to have come to the wrong conclusion here, and surely that the State court and, as I've mentioned, every Federal circuit court looking at similar instructions and verdict forms, could not be said to have acted unreasonably in finding the absence of a Mills violation.

When we look at Mills and take into account the decision in McKoy, the unanimity instruction in Mills, in a weighing State such as Pennsylvania, essentially was a different type of barrier which precluded jurors to give effect to mitigating evidence. In a non-weighing State, the unanimity requirement would probably be appropriate, but in a weighing State, what happens is a single juror can say to other 11 jurors, I don't believe that this particular piece of evidence satisfies a mitigating circumstance, and that single juror can preclude those other 11 jurors from giving effect."

The Court dealt with different pieces of factual evidence relating to character and background and circumstances of the offense. When the Lockett rule was initially announced by a plurality of the Court, the Court could not perceive in the future every different type of barrier that may come about, and so what happened over a period of time, when you took the Lockett rule, you were essentially applying it to a variety of factual different situations, and each time the Court would look at a particular barrier, which it had not perceived in the past, and if it precluded a juror or a jury from giving effect to mitigating evidence, it struck down that barrier. And that's where we're coming from here. So when we say that it is a stretch of Lockett, I don't believe so. I think it is a logical consequence of Lockett. I think it is dictated by Lockett and the cases that followed after that."

If you look at McKoy -- and I think this is a question that Justice Breyer had posed about a case -- in McKoy at 494 U.S. at 438, the Court says in the majority opinion, we reason that allowing a hold-out juror to prevent the other jurors from considering mitigating evidence violated the principle established in Lockett v.

I'd like to go back a minute on the -- the question on the jury question -- or the jury instructions. Jury instructions in capital cases to begin with are very difficult to get across to jurors. Just traditionally we've had a tough time. When you look at a case like this and you have the jury going through the guilt phase of the case, that jury is already conditioned to a unanimity requirement in finding guilt. When you then carry them over to a penalty phase and you take the instruction that we have here and you give that instruction to them, given the fact it's the way they've already been conditioned and listening to that instruction and hearing the word unanimously repeated and repeated, there is a substantial likelihood that the jury would interpret that instruction as requiring unanimity both as to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. And that's the problem with the instruction. And then when you take the verdict slip and put that on top of it, I think that compounds everything under the circumstances. And that's the problem here. When we -- staying with this, when the State supreme court looked at the Mills issue -- and they decided Mills on the merits in 1995. It was not decided during the direct review process. Pennsylvania has a very unique procedure dealing with finality in capital cases. In 1995 when the State supreme court applied Mills on the merits, what they simply did was they said, we interpret our statute as not requiring unanimity. They looked at only a portion of the instruction, I believe approximately three sentences, and they say, the instruction tracks the language of our statute and therefore there is no violation of Mills.

Teague itself speaks in terms of conventional notions of finality, but that doesn't mean a State can't develop its own concept of finality to which the Federal courts should give respect. After all, States have the primary responsibility for establishing rules of criminal procedure and protecting the rights of an accused. With that in mind, concepts of federalism and comity which underline the basic precepts of Teague are not offended if a State court decides to keep open its direct review process and on collateral review say, look, here's a decision that came down from the United States Supreme Court. We are going to apply it to the facts of this case because we want to be absolutely certain that execution of an individual is beyond constitutional reproach."

As to the last point concerning finality, Your created a unique form of collateral review, which is really just direct review, that would be news to the State supreme court which declared this very case to have become final at the conclusion of direct appeal in 1987. Moreover, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has on numerous occasions applied the Teague rule in cases arising on collateral review to hold that the claim at issue was a new rule. Obviously they couldn't have done that if they didn't think that their own collateral review occurred after the point of finality. And -- and furthermore, in -- in response to the argument that this Court may not have been fully aware of the supposedly unique nature of Pennsylvania's procedure, Mr. Flora made exactly that argument in the brief in opposition to certiorari that preceded this Court's previous summary disposition in this case. Concerning the general argument that Lockett is not a new rule because it forbids any barrier to the consideration of mitigation, of course the whole question of what's a barrier that qualifies for Lockett protection or not -- and that question has by no means been clear, as I mentioned. That was the exact argument that was at issue in Walton, and the majority of the Court held that to the extent the preponderance standard is a barrier, it's an acceptable barrier. But, of course, even in those cases where the Court has held that Lockett applies, to create a rule against a barrier to consideration such as Simmons and such as Caldwell, the Court has, nonetheless, held that that rule is new. Saffle is certainly additional support for that proposition, although in Saffle the Court declined to create a rule. In Simmons and Caldwell, the Court did find that the rule was required by Lockett, and yet in later cases found that the rule was new. Now, one of the reasons I think that the alternative view or the -- the failure to see Lockett immediately as a case that precluded unanimity is because we must consider what the nature of consideration of mitigating circumstances is, Your Honor. It's not merely a fact finding. It is really a mixed question of law, in fact. The jury is not required to find fact A, fact B, or fact C. It is required to find a mitigating circumstance. And given that that is the nature of mitigating circumstances, it was all the more reasonable for the States not to understand Lockett as precluding unanimity for the purposes of making that mixed fact -- mixed fact and law determination at the mitigating stage. But in any case, as I've said, given the dispute even on this Court, it was certainly reasonable for the -- for the State courts not to know. And given the dispute among the other courts about the -- the nature of the application of the Mills rule to verdict forms and instructions like this one, it was certainly reasonable for the State courts to -­"
