And, three, Congress's objectives in enacting the Prison Litigation Reform Act's exhaustion requirement are directly facilitated by a rule in which inmates must comply with administrative grievance procedures, including filing deadlines; whereas, those objectives are invariably irrelevant for purposes of how Congress would have understood the term \"exhaust\" in enacting the statute. The definition of the \"principle of exhaustion\" in to comply with the agency's grievance proceedings. And so, that is the definition of exhaustion that Congress was just generally used in the administrative context.

But, moreover, it was another iteration of the purposes that Congress sought to achieve through enactment of the statute. So, speaking to the third point, which was purposes of the statute, our position is that those purposes are directly served by a rule in which inmates are required to comply with administrative grievance By contrast, those rules are subverted by a rule in which an inmate is permitted to file an untimely instance. And this is because, under the former version of the statute, the CRIPA, Congress had required that grievance proceedings comply with specified standards, the statute, Congress dispensed with those requirements.
