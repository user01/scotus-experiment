Now the first, and probably most significant, factor is that the text of the statute uses the classic language this Court has identified for opening up a reservation for settlement without creating a diminishment. But secondly, and I think very telling and specific to this statute, at the same time there is no language in the statute that supports a finding of diminishment. I think there is language in the statute. Specifically, the final proviso of Section 8 that is very inconsistent with the idea that what Congress did is draw a new western boundary to the reservation, because the ­­ that proviso gave Tribal members the right to take their allotments east or west of the right­of­way.

I don't take him to be opening up an entirely different route to finding immunity ­­ diminishment, rather, that doesn't go through an act of Congress. And I think that's the only way to read the opinion as a whole because when the Court starts the opinion, it says the very first principle in this area is that only Congress can diminish a reservation. And it's perfectly compatible with that to say that when we get to the third factor and we're looking at all sorts of things, we'll look at settlement patterns as part of that. But I don't think it's consistent with that world view to then say that, actually, the third factor is a standalone alternative route to find diminishment, not by congressional action, but by market reaction to a surplus land Act."

And he winds up the sort of general principle section with this last thing about de facto/de jure ­­ de facto diminishment, and then that ties up exactly to his discussion of settlement patterns in the third factor of Solem. And I really think that's the right way to read that opinion. I would like to make one other very important point here, though, is I think the Court should understand that if you were to rule in favor of Petitioners in this case, the parties would essentially have to go back and reconstruct the right­of­way because the railroad is no longer there. There's no Rails­For­Trails program in Thurston County. So if you take a Google map and look at this area, you can't even tell where the right­of­way was. Now, I think that's significant, because if there really was a contemporaneous understanding in the 1950s and 1960s, when the railroad literally pulled up its tracks and left, that the right­of­way was the boundary of the reservation, then I think there would have been some effort to sort of preserve that jurisdictional boundary."

In this case by contrast, first of all, we're not just talking about the Tribe's jurisdiction. We're talking about the jurisdiction of the United States as well. And second of all, we're not talking about a claim of inherent authority. This is authority exercised pursuant to a Federal statute, 18 U.S.C. 1161.

And the United States in the Federal register, as official as can be, said the entire reservation remains intact.

As my friend pointed out, Pender is the county seat. I think it's implausible to know that the ­­ to assert that the State of Nebraska wouldn't know that its own law specifies that all of Thurston County is within the reservations of the Omaha and the Winnebagos. I would also like to address, if I could, the tipping point theory that I think emerges from Petitioner's reply brief, and that's the idea that in 1872, Congress tried but failed to diminish the reservation because there were only about 300 acres sold. But in 1882, it succeeded because a lot more land was sold. I think there are a lot of problems with this theory. First of all, if that was what Congress had in mind, presumably it would have specified some way to know when the tipping point had been reached: Some percentage of land sales, some other measure of success. There's nothing about that in the text. There's nothing about that in the legislative history. Second of all, the concept that Congress could attempt but fail to diminish a reservation, as my friend said that it did in 1872, is a concept that is wholly foreign to this Court's jurisprudence, which makes clear that Congress has plenary power. And finally, I think this Court should be very reluctant to assume that Congress implicitly transferred any part of its authority to change the borders of an Indian reservation to private parties and made it contingent on what this Court in Dakota referred to as uncertain future sales."
