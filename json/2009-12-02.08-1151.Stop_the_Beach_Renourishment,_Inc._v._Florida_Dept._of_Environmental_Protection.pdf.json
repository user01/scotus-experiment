    "speech": "We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-1151, Stop the Beach Renourishment v. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Mr. Safriet."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Today we ask this Court to expressly recognize that a State court decision, unpredictable in terms of relevant precedents, which redefines century-old property rights to no longer exist, violates the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Florida Supreme Court suddenly and dramatically redefined littoral property rights, converting oceanfront property into oceanview property to avoid the finding of a taking. It did so in the context of a beach restoration project which could have been accomplished without taking any private property at all. Given this Court's jurisprudence that a State's legislative and executive branches cannot violate the Fifth Amendment, we see no reason why the judicial branch should be treated any differently."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "I thought your basic position in the litigation in Florida was that the Florida legislation violated the takings protection, and so it's kind of strange to switch your target from the legislature, which enacted this measure, and then say, because the judiciary upheld it, the judiciary somehow is complicit in this violation by the legislature implemented by the administrative offices."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "That is correct, Your Honor. Below, the case was litigated as one of a taking by the legislature when it passed the Act. When it passed the Beach and Shore Preservation Act, it contained a provision within section 161.141, which is a savings clause, that said to the extent the beach restoration cannot be accomplished without taking property rights, the requesting authorities have to use eminent domain proceedings to take those rights. At the First District Court of Appeal, they agreed with us that the littoral rights were being taken by the Act of the legislature and that those had to be compensated for. When we arrived at the Florida Supreme Court, again, all of the parties were arguing those issues, whether there was a physical taking of these rights or a regulatory taking of these rights by the Act and whether the savings clause would apply. To everybody's shock, the Florida Supreme Court said: We're going to go back to step one and decide you don't have any littoral rights. The legislature didn't eliminate any protected littoral rights that you thought you once had for over a hundred years as the relevant precedents in common law indicate. So it was that decision of the Florida Supreme Court, that said you have -- no longer have property, that gives rise to the issue before this Court is, can the Florida Supreme Court redefine those 100-year-old rights to no longer exist?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Applied in a new situation. It was never the kind of situation involved here with the beach restoration project. The -- the precedent did not involve the kind of situation that this case presents."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. There is no precedent with respect to the Beach and Shore Preservation Act as it has ever been applied. We do concede that. However, there are two fundamental principles of Florida law that have existed for more than a hundred years, and those are property that must –- property that borders the mean high-water line and must remain in contact with the mean high-water line to possess common law littoral rights. If that connection is not there, there are no common law littoral rights. Common law littoral rights are constitutionally protected and cannot be taken without due process and just compensation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, they're -- they're eliminated -- at least the right of contact with the water can be eliminated by an avulsion, right? When there's -- when there's avulsion, even at common law and under Florida law, it -- it can happen that some land between the property owner and -- and the water will be owned by the State."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "That is correct, Your Honor. Under the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, why wasn't this an avulsion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "Well, because the avulsion in this case, Your Honor, was the hurricanes that the State cites as the reason for the beaches being washed away, and -- and it was --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, well, well, well. There were -- there were two avulsions. One was the avulsion of its being washed away and the other was the -- the rapid replacement of sand. That -- that is not a natural, gradual phenomenon."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "That is right, Your Honor, but the -- there is no case law in Florida or no principle that says avulsion can occur by artificial means. So there is -- the beach restoration, where they placed sand on the beach, is not avulsion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "If there’s no case law, it seems to me you've lost your case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "No, the case law specifically says that avulsion is a result of natural occurrences, by the action of the wind and the water. That's what avulsion is in Florida and has been -- you know, for at least 50 years, I believe. It's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "They have a new situation. It's sort of like an avulsion. It's sort of like an accretion. The only precedent of -- you keep talking about a hundred years -- it seemed to me some dictum in a case called Sand Key, which does say that the upland property owner has the right to touch the water. So in this case, the Florida Supreme Court says the purpose of that was to make certain that the upland property owner could go to the water. And so here we have a case that assures he can go to the water, and they have a new situation, which, as I think Justice Scalia said, looks an awful lot like an avulsion, though of course there are differences. So it sounds like a typical common law situation. A new situation arises. You try to apply old precedent, and they reached the result they did. Now, what's your response to that? Because that's the argument the other side makes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "The response to that, Your Honor, is the doctrine of avulsion -- as part of the doctrine of avulsion is the doctrine -- or the right to reclaim what was lost by the landowner. So when an avulsion event occurs, the landowner that has lost property has a right under common law to reclaim what they lost."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "You didn't lose any. It just went out the front door there. The land ended here, and the new avulsion comes in and extends it further. You didn't lose one inch. All you lost was the right to touch the water. But the court here says you in effect have that right because you can walk right over it and get to the water."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "What -- what was lost in this case, Your Honor, is the right to contact the mean high- water line, and I think there's a distinction between the right to contact the mean high-water line and the water's edge. The Florida Supreme Court didn't address the former issue, contact with the mean high-water line. That's --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "You say “absolutely not.” I thought there was a provision in this law that said they cannot put anything on that strip which destroys your right of enjoyment of the upland right. Now, if they put a noisy hot dog stand that keeps you up at night, doesn't that violate the statute?"

That is, there -- this -- what is referred to as “the foreshore,” was that wet all the time? I thought the suggestion was that that was in effect beach, public beach, that people could walk on, not swim in."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "The foreshore, Your Honor, is typically the land area between the mean high-water line and the low high-water line, and depending on the tide cycles of the day, some of that foreshore is dry, and then at other times --"

    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "There's -- the foreshore, Your Honor, which is periodically dry on any given day and periodically wet -- the public can use that, and they have always been able to use that. That is State-owned land, and they can use that to traverse up and down the beach. But, again, because it's wet every day, you don't have hot dog vendors putting hot dog stands in the water. You don't have people laying their blankets in the water to enjoy that beach. And what we're talking about here is the exclusive right to use the dry sand area that stays dry all of the time in our case, which in our case was a 200-foot stretch of beach before this project began, and we had 200 feet of beach, and we had the right to exclude commercial vendors or anybody else from that property. Now what we have after that, according to this project, is another 80 feet to 100 feet of dry sand beach owned by the State where the landowners have no ability to exclude commercial vendors or any other obnoxious uses of that property."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Who owns that land? I mean, when it was submerged it belonged to the State. And is it your position that the owners in your organization, that they have title to that land that was once owned by the State?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "Absolutely not, Your Honor. It's our position that the State, as a matter of public use under the Takings Clause, can condemn that property and make a public beach in front of a private one. They absolutely can do that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "No, I mean -- I mean, without condemning it, you say the title is held by the private owners even though the title was held by the State when the land was submerged."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, I'm not saying that the landowners own that new 80-foot stretch of beach now, as it currently exists. What we argue is we own to the erosion control line, which is the property boundary that the State created in this case. And the State, by operation of the Act, claims title to the new 80-foot strip of beach. And what we're trying to obtain here is the State to go through eminent domain proceedings to pay us compensation for the loss of littoral rights that they're taking by creating this public strip of beach. Now, the State may at the end of the day say, well, we're not going to claim title to that; we're going to reinstate your boundary as the mean high-water line -- that would be 80 feet further out -- and no compensation, in that case, would be due. But --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It would be -- what would your position be, assuming you still have title, you still have the right of littoral title, contact with the water? Would you concede that the State has different regulatory interests with respect to that new strip of land versus the old strip of land? It's still your property. The State can regulate your property. Presumably, they regulate your beach property now. Would their different -- would their authority to regulate be greater with respect to the new area?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It's still your property. You know, the State regulates property all the time, in zoning -- would their authority be broader with respect to that new land than with respect to the old?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, I don't think so. The State already has broad authority to regulate property already, and then would -- I wouldn't see any need for them to have any broader authority for that new strip of beach if our members owned it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Sometimes -- and I don't actually know what the law is on this. Sometimes the State builds, you know, sidewalks in front of people. Maybe they do it on their own land, and they say: We're putting this easement, and people can walk across it. Would this be in the same category of public project? They say, well, it's your land because you have a right to the mean high-water land, but we built it so we have greater rights with respect to regulation than we might have with respect to the natural beach."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, I don't think they would have any greater rights to that. I mean, if -- if the landowners are the fee-simple title owner, then the State has its basic police powers to regulate as it would any other land, absent some type of easement or reservation of our agreement with the landowners that give them greater rights and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "The State gave you some quid pro quo for this, which is to say this new sand is projected to last 6 years, has to be replaced regularly, because your -- your property is being eroded, which is the reason the State went into this. And what the State has given you in exchange is that if and when there is further erosion, you will continue to own up to whatever this new line is called."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "The ECL. You will continue to -- to own up to there, despite the fact that under common law when there's more erosion, your -- your line would recede to the new mean high-water mark. So, you know, who -- who knows? Maybe that's sufficient compensation. You know, if you go in and ask for compensation, the State might say, you know, we've given them -- given them this property right in exchange, and the difference between that and what they have now is two dollars."

You have a beachfront area, beachfront home, in which there's a hurricane and there's a loss of the beach and a sudden drop, so that it's now a 60-foot -- a 60-foot drop. The State comes in and says the only way we can fix this is to extend the beach and make it a larger beach on what was formerly our submerged land. And it does that that. Under -- and it -- and it has the same rule. Under your view, is the State required to pay you for the loss of your right of contact to the beach, your littoral right, because there's let's say another 100 foot of new beach? Are they entitled to offset that against the enhanced value to your property by reason of the fact that they've saved it from further erosion and have given you a beach where there was none before?"

  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, they are able to offset that, and the -- the statute provides for that offsetting such that in an eminent domain proceedings whatever value the landowners lost as a result of their -- losing their contact with the mean high-water line, that any benefit provided by the additional sand would be offset --"

As I understand the supreme court's opinions, you have several special and exclusive -- or exclusive -- or exclusive, common law littoral rights: right to have access, right to reasonable use of the water, right to accretion and reliction, right to the unobstructed view. They can't sell that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "The -- the hypothetical is the State says that the property owner, the upland owner, has these rights. The Chief Justice asked you, could this property be sold? I think the answer would be yes, but it would be subject to the continuance of that easement in the dominant estate. That has to be the answer under the supreme court's opinion. Now, you may not agree with that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "Under the supreme court's opinion, yes, because it purports to reserve common law rights across this new stretch of State-owned beach. It's our contention that all common law rights have been lost when we lose connection to the mean high-water line."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "All right. That gets to the question, if we agree with you that there is such a thing as a judicial takings, what is the standard by which we decide when the Federal courts can and must intervene to disagree with the -- with the State law and to characterize it as a taking when the State has said that it is not? Would we just find all sorts of adjectives -- it’s sudden, unexpected, unfounded -- we just have a string of adjectives, sort of like an adequate independent State ground rule or something?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, that would be the test that we would suggest, as Justice Stewart noted in his concurring opinion in Hughes. And the test we would propose is that a judicial taking occurs when a State court effects a sudden and dramatic change in State law, unpredictable in terms of relevant precedents, that have no fair or substantial support in well-established background principles of State law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Okay, I'm familiar with that opinion. Now, in this case, number one, it seems to me that in order to do that, we have to become real experts in Florida law. Number two, once we do that it seems to me that this opinion really addresses something that's -- that's new, and it's -- it’s grounded in common law doctrines. It's a close case. It might have gone either way. Let's assume that. Does there have to be some finding that the State decision is clearly unreasonable? I mean, if it's a close case, does the State win under your test?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I think the test ­ -again, the fair and substantial support -- provides adequate deference to the State court. And in objectively reviewing the precedents, this Court doesn't have to become an expert in State law. It merely has to review those precedents to make sure that the Florida Supreme Court in fact relied on background principles of law rather than creating nonexistent rules of State substantive law --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, it seems to me that, reading the opinion, I -- I can get there. There was some talk about the Belvedere case as helping you. I thought it did not at all. That was a very odd case where the easement is wholly separated from the dominant. It's the reverse. They take the main property and leave the easement, rather than vice versa. So I just thought that was irrelevant."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "Yes, the case law, Your Honor, and the incremental changes that we are dealing with here that would be part of your test is the government or the State can gradually change these property rights or property laws so long as they leave the owner with the rights. And in this case what the Florida Supreme Court has done is said: We're not just gradually changing them and leaving you with these common law littoral --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "It's not weird, because in 1987 in the Sand Key case, the Florida Supreme Court said that the proposition that the State has cited that  case for was not the issue there in that case. It said that case dealt with a property boundary dispute. It didn't deal even deal with the doctrine of avulsion or reliction or accretion."

Number one, this idea of artificial avulsion that was discussed earlier, the Bryant v. Peppe case, which cites the Martin -- that was discussed in the Martin case, talks about when the State comes in on its own property and either lowers the water or, in this case, puts sand on the -- on the State side of the property line, that that's an artificial avulsion, the State retains title to its State lands, the upland owner, the private property owner retains ownership of their land."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I suppose it depends on -- or maybe not -- how quickly it all happens. I mean, if the State project is such that they add a foot a year, is that an avulsion or accretion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Well, it would be an avulsion. It would still be the State adding sand to its side of the line."
  },
  {

    "speech": "Well, is your view whenever the State does it, it's an avulsion?"
  },

    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "If it's on -- if it's on its property, that's absolutely the case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Why is that? I thought avulsion by definition is a sudden change."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "No, no. Under, Florida Law the Bryant v. Peppe case, which was an avulsion case that arose out of a hurricane, where there was land that was previously submerged, it came up, it was over State property, the private owners wanted to get the -- get it, and they asserted that it was theirs in accretion, and the court said no, and it cited to Martin. There’s no right to having contact with the water."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

Does that mean the State could come in and knock down the house and say this is an artificial avulsion?"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Yes, talking about a label, and putting the avulsion label and the accretion label on something that the State does, doesn't -- doesn't eliminate the fact that there's been a fundamental change. You have taken a doctrine that applies to things that occur as a result of nature and you've applied it to things that are produced by the State."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Well, there's no question under Florida law that the State has the right on its sovereignty lands to control those lands and use those for the public trust. And what the Florida legislature did 40 years ago -- keeping in mind this has been on the books 40 years, 200 miles of beaches have been restored over those years, and no one has complained that this is a taking of property. That -- it's a reasoned response for the Florida Supreme Court to come in and say, okay, they're challenging the Act. They say it denies them two things: the right to future accretion and the right to have contact with the water. Martin v. Busch and Bryant v. Peppe say, look, if -- you don't have a right of contact with the water, if you have avulsion or if you have it in -- in Martin, it was a State drainage project."

All right? And -- and then -- so that's sued. You -- you sue under that, and the court says: Yes, of course, that's a taking; our precedents have always said it's the mean high-water line and nothing else. Florida has judicial elections. Say, somebody runs for election for the Florida Supreme Court and says: I'm going to change that law. I'm going to say that it is not a taking. I think people should be able to walk right up to the land. And that person is elected, and the law is changed. Now, is -- is that a judicial taking?"

There is no case they can point to, to say that we have a right of contact --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Well, what they say is the following -- this is what they say, I think: They point to a case called Sand Key, and in Sand Key it says littoral property rights include the following vested rights: One, the right of access to the water, including the right to have the property's contact with the water remain intact. That's what the court said. And in the court's opinion what it says about that is it says, in this case, the Act expressly protects the right of access to the water, which is the sole justification for the subsidiary right of contact. in Sand Key, and they're asking why was it there in Sand Key, and that's what they come up with. Now, after this sentence I just read you, there is no citation. So I want you to add anything you would like to say why this is, that sentence I read you, justifiable under Florida law."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Sure. What they're citing to is some dicta in Sand Key that had nothing to do with the holding of that case, and if you try to go back and look at the citations to the cases that Sand Key cites for that proposition of contact with the water, none of them have to do with contact with water. Instead, the most important point is to look at Martin v. Busch, which was a case where the State lowered the water in a lake, the upland owners at -- the property line was determined not to have moved, they didn't have any contact with the water any longer, and the submerged sovereignty lands became the State's property. There's no right of contact there. It’s --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Sand Key's statement strikes one as -- as correct simply because I think that's -- that's the view of the common law. I -- I don't think that's unique or distinctive to Florida. I think it would be very strange to have a principle that all the -- all the littoral owner gets is a right to access the water and not the right to be on the water, to have his property on the water. I think -- I think in every State, beachfront owners would be astounded to learn that that's the case. So, I -- you know, I thought that Sand Key was just expressing what -- what was the common law. And the notion that -- that the only purpose of the contact with the water is so that you can have access, that is -- is that not silly?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "No. Well, two points here I would like to make. Number one, let's assume there was an avulsive event that added sand on the State's property along the beach line, so now we have the property line not changing, it's exactly where it was before, but now we have, say, 75 feet of sand, new sand seaward, over the State's property. That's the State's property --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "But that's not the question. I mean, you just said that, let's assume the -- assuming the property line doesn't change. The other side is saying the property line is the mean high-water line, and so if you -- whoever adds sand, the State, mother nature, you dumping it -- I guess you can't do that, but whoever adds it, the property line is the mean high-water line."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "But -- but -- well -- but under this avulsive event where there is sand added seaward, the contact by the upland owner with the water no longer exists, and that's been on the books in Florida for --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Yes, but that's because you think the property line is the ECL rather than the MHWL."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. What I'm talking about is put the Act aside and just say at common law in Florida. If the sand is added through avulsive events, the upland owner has no contact with the water any longer. They certainly have access. And the Florida Act is so solicitous of protecting the property rights of riparian ownership. You go through the statute, and you see they preserve common law littoral -- littoral rights. They have a section --"

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Would that person still be considered a littoral owner?"

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Absolutely, absolutely. And that's a major misnomer in this case, is that the upland owner here, even after the beach restoration project, has riparian littoral property. That's what the Florida Supreme Court has held, that's what the Florida legislation says. There’s --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Well, I -- I agree that's what they have tried to make it about. What they've said is the State now has this swath of sand. It's a barrier to protect against erosion. It's no wider than this courtroom."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, suppose that -- suppose that a city decided that it wanted to attract more students who are going to the beach in Florida for spring break, and so therefore it decided it was going to create a huge beach in front of -- of privately owned homes. Under the decision of the Florida Supreme Court, I don't see anything that would stop the city from doing that. So you could have -- you could have televised spring break beach parties in front of -- of somebody's house. Now, in -- as a practical matter, doesn't that have a real effect on the value of the property?"

    "speech": "No, I understand that, but if the -- but the Florida Supreme Court said that there isn't any right -- if there is a manmade extension of the beach, there is no right to exclude people from it; it's -- the beach is owned by the State. So all of that could take place, couldn't it?"

    "speech": "Well, why do we have to say that? I mean, they're writing a -- a -- an opinion here against a background of an act, and as I read that opinion -- you can add something to this if you want -- I make a list of what they say in effect provides, not perfectly, but provides, roughly, the same kind of protection that the Sand Key statement provided. One, you can go to the water; two, you have a right of ingress and egress, if that's any different from the first. I'm not positive. Three, you have a right under the Act that nobody can put anything on that strip which is injurious to the upland owner. All right? So those are at least three things, and I think there's a fourth. Yes, the fourth is that nobody can build anything there that is harmful, except if it's to do with the environment; that's not harmful, that's helpful to the beach owner. It's supposed to be helpful. And, five, you get your beach guaranteed. So all of those things are things you get under this Act in an intermediate case where it's a little like an avulsion and a little not like an avulsion. Now, do I add anything to my list? And do you have to go beyond that?"

They put the width in there. And in this particular instance, it's about 75 feet. And it's going to erode away. That cannot be increased without the consent of the owners."

It's only -- what you have lost is only worth $20,000. And a court will review that and say yes, no, whatever, and that's what you get."

That is a conventional takings claim and that is the way I think it is most useful for this Court to approach it. Rather than seizing on particular statements in the opinion of the Florida Supreme Court and regarding the Florida Supreme Court's judicial act as itself a taking, it's best to focus on the Act itself. And with respect to the Act itself, what -- what has happened here is the State has exercised, not just sovereign regulatory rights; it has exercised critical sovereign proprietary rights."

That's not really a -- there's no need to fashion a new judicial taking doctrine when you have --"
  },

And the court of the State upholds it on the ground there is an implicit easement under Blackstone to take land for power plants without paying for it; it's called the power plant easement. Okay? Now, in such a case, it would be the judicial taking because their ground is not -- whatever you normally have, but their ground is you never had that property right in the first place. Now, how -- if that ever were to happen -- and that probably, perhaps, is not this case, but if that ever were to happen, wouldn't there have to be a remedy under the Constitution for it?"

It -- it could be looked at that way. But if I -- but if I could turn to the -- the operation of this statute, what -- what has happened here is -- as this Court has recognized in numerous cases, the authority of the State over its submerged lands is a critical aspect of sovereignty. It is held in trust for the public and for public uses, and what has happened here is the State, with respect to its own sovereign lands, has filled that land.

This Court's decision in Hughes v. Washington, which dealt with accretion, responded to the -- to the point that was -- that was made there and said, well, the -- the littoral property right is vulnerable anyway because the owner of the adjacent submerged lands can always take action on his own lands that could affect what the upland property owner did. And this -- and this Court said, yes, that's right, but we're talking, here, about natural causes. And in -- in Hughes, the Court cited two cases, one in Washington State, for example, where the -- where there was an absolute right to fill the submerged lands even if that completely cut off access.

These Petitioner’s members own to the mean high-water line. They have a right, not only under Florida common law to own to the mean high-water line; under their deeds, that's what they purchased.

    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "Under the doctrine of reclamation, they can reclaim the boundary line. If that's by depositing new sand where the water is to reach the mean high-water line, where it was prior to the hurricane. They can do that. Conversely, if sand is washed up as a result of a hurricane, they can remove the sand to bring the water line back to them."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "That wouldn't be State -- they can -- the common law allows them to reclaim what they're lost -- what they lost, Your Honor. And the Florida Supreme Court tries to rely on this doctrine of reclamation in this case. It asserts that the State is only doing what it was allowed under common law, reclaiming the land that it lost. But in this case, the Florida Supreme Court -- or the State of Florida didn't ever possess any dry sand land, so they can't reclaim any dry sand land. The only thing they have ever owned was the foreshore and the sovereign submerged lands. So that's the only thing they can reclaim. I think there was another question about the support for this case. There is more than five landowners that don't support this case. In the lower courts, there was another group, Save Our Beaches, that had, I believe, roughly 150 members that opposed this project as well in the City of Destin. In this case, we're also dealing with a physical taking."

    "speech": "Lack of standing at the administrative hearing, Your Honor. What we're dealing with in this case is a physical taking. What rights were physically possessed by the Respondent’s members -- the Petitioner's members in this case are now possessed by the State. It's a wholesale transfer of these rights, along with the transfer of the deed -- or the description of the deed. We're not asking this --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "They have, under your theory, much more property than they had before. They have a wider beach that's theirs, so they have gained property, but that doesn't count?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAFRIET",
    "speech": "Well, they haven't gained property, Your Honor, because the State's claiming title to that new beach. So our -- the Petitioner’s members owned exactly what they owned as of September 7, 2003, when the property boundary was changed, and the new boundary would -- the new land would be State-owned."
