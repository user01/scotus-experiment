That claim cannot be brought into the conciliation process until it exists.

And that's perfectly consistent with all of this Court's Title VII timeliness cases. If you look at, for instance, Evans, if you look at Ricks.

And the Court said, well, that may be so, but that's the way the statute was written, the limitations period was written, and so be it.

And let me again extend my answer to you, Justice Alito, which it is true that constructive discharge could be unique in the sense you're suggesting in the Title VII case, in the Title VII area. But let's remember that constructive eviction, constructive business termination are treated the exact same way. Your Honor, I ­­ I do want to go back to some of the practical implications. As I ­­ as I began saying, the Tenth Circuit rule would inject unnecessary complexity. By contrast, the date of resignation is easy to identify. Most administrative claimants are laypeople and are unlikely to be cognizant of the last­act rule posited by the Tenth Circuit. Reasonable intuition; that is, common sense, will tell an employee that I cannot and certainly need not bring my claim that I was forced out before I was actually forced out."

This rule about being when definitive notice has ­­ is ­­ is given for a termination, Justice Scalia, you were saying that when somebody says I quit, my last day of work is three months from now, therefore, he hasn't actually quit, that's Ricks. The Court concluded that when the employer there said you have been denied tenure, here is your terminal contract, you will be working here for only one more year, that the relevant date was the date on which the operative decision had been made and it had been communicated to the employee.

That's why the Court described it as a second ­­ as an additional ­­ as a graver claim. And in the discussion of amending the complaints that ­­ that the amicus invokes in the EEOC's management directive, the reason why the court of appeals and the amicus can say that the employee could always just amend a timely complaint about the underlying discrimination and add a claim for constructive discharge is because the EEOC considers this to be a new incident of discrimination.

And so in the court of appeals, the court was just considering the antecedent question of whether we should only look to the act of the employer or also the act of the employee. And so this factual question didn't actually come up before the court of appeals. We noted in the statement of facts in our court of appeals brief that the agreement included his ­­ the settlement agreement included his agreement to retire, but otherwise we did take the case on his premise, and the court of appeals did not address this. So we do think that it would be appropriate for the Court here, if it agrees with us, if this agreement is sufficiently clear, to say that Petitioner will lose on the facts of this case. If you want to remand and have the court of appeals consider whether the district court was correct in reaching that, that would also be appropriate. But we think that this wouldn't be that different from what the Court did in Irwin where in Irwin the Court said, well, the court of appeals was wrong about finding that there was no possibility of equitable tolling; nevertheless, there is no way he will ever satisfy equitable tolling on the facts of this case, so he loses. And I do think that one final thing I would like to say is that the Court should be able to take some comfort from the real­world evidence that we have. It's not much. We don't have evidence of cases from the five circuits that have adopted a version of the notice of resignation rule between 1987 and 2000 that indicates that employers are being besieged with stale discrimination claims that are being revived by employees' attempts to quit some months or years after the fact.

In this case, we think that the things happened on the same day. Even under Petitioner's approach, he had some weeks to make his decision. But the reason why he wasn't prejudiced by being able to take some weeks to make his decision is precisely because he was using annual leave, he wasn't suffering the consequences of a hostile work environment, he hadn't taken the pay cut, he hadn't had to move 400 miles away, and so this was an unusual case where he would have been able to take that much time. And so it looks like, as in ­­ in practicality's sake, that ­­ that it hasn't made a big difference. And that's why we think it would be useful for the Court to say this is effectively the Ricks rule. It should apply to both cases of actual and cases of constructive termination.

So I don't think the inclusion of the word \"matter\" by itself makes a difference. After all, it doesn't just say matter. It says matter alleged to be discriminatory, and we think that has to be read as a whole to clearly focus on what is it that is the target of the claim. And that language is ­­ it does not become ambiguous just because it might be challenging to apply it in a particular fact pattern. I think this Court's decision in Morgan is an excellent example of that where the Court said we have a clear rule that requires us to identify what was the alleged unlawful employment practice and when did it occur, and that's the analysis here."

That's why it is a discrete unlawful employment action triggering a fresh limitations period. In constructive discharge, you know, the analysis that the second separate event, the employee's decision to resign is itself the actionable thing, that is the analysis that the court of appeals had applied in Suders. In Suders the question was: Do we treat constructive discharge as a tangible employment action for purposes of determining vicarious liability. The Third Circuit said, well, yes, we treat these as equivalents for all intents and purposes, so naturally, when there's a constructive discharge, that means there's been a tangible employment action. This Court rejected that analysis and said, no, the legal fiction does not extend that far. To be sure, the Court says, we treat those two the same for remedial purposes in the sense that an employee who has been constructively discharged can recover for that to the same degree and for the same extent as if he or she had been actually discharged. That makes sense because you have this background duty to mitigate and, in the circumstance of a constructive discharge, we don't think the employee should be tagged with the consequences of having, you know, so­called failed to mitigate damages.

And as this Court explained in Suders, the constructive discharge entails both predicate discrimination ­­ and we do think it has to be independently actionable. We think the Court recognized that when it said in Suders that for Ms. Suders to prove her hostile work environment claim was quoting necessary predicate to her constructive discharge claim, and that's also the uniform holding in the courts of appeals. There has to be predicate, unlawful conduct by the employer and a subsequent decision by the employee to resign. When you have a provision that singles out as the start of the limitations period one of those two components, then the fact that the claim hasn't accrued yet is not something that the Court can rely on to override that clear language. I think this Court's decision in Pillsbury is a really excellent example of that, where under the Longshoremen's Act, there was a provision that ran from the time of injury. And the plaintiffs pointed out, well, that we can't actually recover compensation for our injury until a disability has manifested, so we should say that we should interpret injury to mean disability. And the Court said, well, no. I mean, it's true that that will run the limitation period before the claim can accrue, but the language says what it says. For what it's worth here, I don't think that this reading is actually going to cut off claims except in cases of, you know, real lack of diligence, because here, it's not the case that there's no claim available after the initial act of discrimination by the employer, there is a claim available, the employee can initiate counseling on that, and as a matter of the conciliation policy, he or she ought to do that promptly in order to bring about the best chance of a prompt and informal reconciliation."
