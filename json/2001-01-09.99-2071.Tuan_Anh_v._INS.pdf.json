      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case raises the question of whether differential treatment of mothers and fathers under federal citizenship law violates the equal protection component of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Joseph Boulais has raised his out of wedlock son from infancy. Under 8 USC Section 1409, an out of wedlock mother of a foreign-born child can establish her child's citizenship at birth upon proof of three things: U.S. nationality at the time of the child's birth, parentage of the child, and prior physical presence in the United States. Joseph Boulais meets all of these criteria. However, solely because he's the male parent, the law imposes two additional criteria. First, Mr. Boulais, as a father, must produce a signed statement that he will support the child until his 18th birthday. The father here supported his son, but he never signed a statement. Second, the father must before his child's 18th birthday, either legitimate, adjudicate paternity or formally acknowledge paternity, and here the father has formally acknowledged paternity, but not until his son was in his 20s."

    {
      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "speech": "Your Honor, the Fiallo case concerns the situation of some individuals who are citizens applying for special immigration preferences for children of those citizens or relatives of those citizens. The Court here ruled that that was covered by the plenary power. Here the issue concerns only citizens applying for trying to transmit citizenship at birth, benefits to -- to parents, and so the difference is the question of what the extent of plenary power is. And we believe that plenary power should stop, at the very least, before it reaches a situation where a citizen, here Mr. Boulais, is seeking to transmit citizenship benefits to a child who, as the statute indicates, once citizenship is recognized will relate back to the date of birth. So I guess there are two basic distinctions. One, that there's a relation back issue, so the citizen's child -- the child here, once his citizenship is recognized, will have been deemed to have been a citizen from birth, and therefore there isn't any of the concern about transfer of allegiances that's the case in naturalization or also potentially the case in immigration sorts of situations."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, wait. Why is there no problem with transfer of allegiances? I mean, it's fine to make it retroactive as far as the law is concerned, but that doesn't change the reality of it. The reality of it is he's not an American citizen until these conditions are -- are met, and he's proclaimed to be such. Prior to that he's not an American citizen, is he?"

    {

They were coming in as preference, preference-eligible aliens, and now you're saying, the distinction that you're making, if I grasp it correctly, is these people, if you are correct, will never come in as aliens. The application is that the citizenship should be recognized immediately. That's the distinction you're making?"

      "speech": "Not at all, Your Honor. What we're saying is the immigration statute makes a distinction between citizenship at birth and other forms of immigration status, and that because of that distinction, the plenary power that shields in some instances immigration actions from full constitutional review should not apply here. It should stop short of barring full constitutional review or ordinary constitutional review of transmission of citizenship from a citizen to a plenary citizen."

If -- if -- if -- if you admit them without making them citizens from birth, you have plenary power, but if you do even the greater thing, admit them and make them citizens from birth, suddenly your plenary power disappears. It seems to me, if anything, it ought to be the opposite."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "speech": "Your Honor, here what we base our argument on is the structure of the statute as well as the long history of jus sanguinis citizenship, and this Court's ruling in Rogers versus Bellei which also indicated that citizenship at birth was subject to ordinary constitutional scrutiny, even though there isn't a right under the Fourteenth Amendment to that citizenship, even though Congress could change the rules of citizenship tomorrow, still the statute itself, the history of jus sanguinis citizenship and this Court's construction of that, of that law in Rogers versus Bellei we believe supports limiting the extension of plenary power authority to a situation where a citizen here is seeking to transmit citizenship to his child who will be a citizen at birth at the time that citizenship is recognized."

      "speaker": "DAVIS",

      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I think it would depend upon what the term naturalization meant even at that time. We know what it means now because Congress itself has defined it in the statute to apply only to those individuals who have citizenship that is prospective only, and here Mr. Boulais and his son come forward with a claim for citizenship that relates back to birth, so it's clearly not in the same category as naturalization is defined under the current statute."

      "speech": "But if you were to reexamine Fiallo, I suppose under your view, the amendment in 1986 to the statute involved in Fiallo that adopted the position of the dissenters in Fiallo would also be unconstitutional because it basically followed the same pattern as this statute does."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVIS",

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Miss Davis, may we go back a few steps because you said something that surprised me. I know that the Solicitor General took the line in its brief that there are only two kinds of citizens -- born in the United States, and everybody else for constitutional purposes is naturalized. My grandson was born in Paris of U.S. citizen parents. I had never considered him a naturalized citizen of the United States, but is that his correct status?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "speech": "Your Honor, we don't quarrel with the construction that Rogers versus Bellei adopted, which is that citizenship at birth is a form of naturalization. However what we argue is that the Congress in implementing that power has made a distinction between naturalization under the statute and citizenship at birth under the statute, and the implications of that distinction are that the plenary power of Congress to regulate immigration does not extend to citizenship at birth because citizenship at birth relates back to the date of birth because naturalization is defined to be prospective only because there isn't a requirement of an oath of allegiance in order to have citizenship at birth acknowledged."

Or -- yes, for a jus soli citizen. So, for example, the conditions placed on the individual in Rogers versus Bellei, who was a citizen at birth, the residency conditions are permissible under the Constitution even though if those conditions are not filled, the individual will lose citizenship at the time that they fail to comply with those conditions."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I thought your argument hinged entirely upon the fact that there's no problem about changing allegiances, and this would require him to change allegiance, to swear allegiance to the United States over whatever other country he had come from."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I don't know what opinions -- it seems to me so artificial to say that simply because you make the admission retroactive and say he shall be deemed to have been a citizen from birth, somehow the power of Congress to make people who are not born in this country and therefore automatically citizens, citizens somehow becomes abridged. I don't -- I just don't see how the retroactivity -- it's such an artificial device. Congress could make it retroactive or not retroactive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I believe that the argument that I'm making reflects the construction of the statute. The statute itself makes a distinction between citizenship and citizenship at birth and naturalization. It lists in the section 1401 jus soli citizenship along with citizenship at birth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I understand that, but we're not talking about the statute. I can agree that you can -- you can make a statutory distinction between those two situations, but does that convert into a constitutional distinction? And that's what you're arguing before us, that there is some things you can constitutionally do when you make the person retroactively from birth a United States citizen or things that you can't do when you do that that you could do if you didn't make him retroactively."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, that assumes the person is not an alien simply because Congress says the person shall be retroactively deemed a citizen.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "speech": "Right. Well, in fact, Your Honor, you mentioned natural born citizen, and many commentators believe that citizens at birth are deemed to be natural born citizens, so this is a category of citizenship that traditionally has had a different status than naturalized citizenship for many, many years, for centuries."

Mr. Boulais doesn't have standing to challenge those. He meets both those physical presence requirements. If the remedy that we seek is imposed, those physical presence requirements will remain and will continue to do the job that the government says they are needed for in terms of addressing the potential for statelessness, but even beyond that, even assuming that it is in the case, the risk of statelessness is not gender specific. The -- there are a number of nations that -- and this is set out in the Equality Now amicus brief which was submitted to the Court, there are a number of countries which have laws that are gender neutral so that there isn't any greater risk of statelessness for children of mothers than there is of fathers.

Well, by age 28, the child of a U.S. father, the father can no longer transmit the citizenship to the child, so in fact that child of U.S. father is at much greater risk of statelessness than a child of a U.S. mother who had a child with a Canadian citizen abroad. So the government could much better address its concerns about statelessness by either having a more generous physical presence requirements across the board because it's -- any requirement increases the risk of statelessness, so it could have more generous require -- more generous provisions across the board or it could have one that's tailored to the specific countries where statelessness is at issue for mothers or for fathers instead of --"

For example, if it was procured by fraud, but the other important -- and this was significant in Rogers v. Bellei, which had to do with the constitutionality of a condition subsequent for a citizen, a person who was born abroad to United States citizens. In that case, it was the parallel provision here in 1401 (g) until, I believe, it was 1978, someone in that situation had -- the child had to reside in the United States for some period of time after birth in order to establish the requisite connection with the United States, and that was challenged on the ground that the person having been declared a citizen at birth, there could not be a condition subsequent to perfecting it. And this Court upheld that provision in Rogers v. Bellei, and importantly, it did so by distinguishing the children of U.S. parents born abroad from those who are born in the United States with the suggestion that Congress has greater latitude with respect to the naturalization of those persons than it does to others, precisely because they are not encompassed by the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment refers to citizens who are born or naturalized in the United States, and the Court pointed out that persons who are born to United States citizens abroad do not fall within that description and therefore are not citizens for Fourteenth Amendment purposes."

In fact, with respect to Fiallo, we think that all of the reasons why deference to the political branches in this area applied to immigration in Fiallo apply equally here, first of all in Fiallo itself, the Court lumped together immigration and naturalization at page 79, I believe it's 792 of its opinion, in describing Congress' plenary powers. And also first of all a reason why Fiallo applies is it's a question of who is going to enter our society. Certainly the children or parents in Fiallo were seeking to come into the United States with the hope eventually of being citizens. In Fiallo it was a two-step task. Here it's a one-step, but we don't think that the analysis in Fiallo should change on that. And therefore deciding who should be a citizen is also an aspect of who is an alien. They are flip side to the same question. And Congress has plenary power to control which aliens will be entitled to enter the United States. Third, it's intimately tied up with foreign relations, and again this is a point that was made in Fiallo itself. There the Court rejected the proposition at page 730 that the concerns about foreign relations only have to do with situations where there are grave threats to the national security or the general welfare of the United States. The Court said it had never deferred to the branches depending upon whether there was some threat of that nature or some more individualized determination as to who will be entitled to enter the United States."

You would surely have a huge statelessness problem if you didn't recognize that the child born abroad to U.S. citizens is a U.S. citizen because, as you point out in most countries in the world, they go by blood, not by land of birth. So -- but you don't have that situation with -- an alien coming to our shores is a citizen of someplace.

In this very case, petitioner Nguyen could have applied for citizenship in his own right after he became an adult and did not do so. The idea is that under these naturalization -- this naturalization provision, while one is still a child, one is under the care of the parent. After adulthood, that's not so.

When you have a child born to married parents, you have a legal relationship with mother and father at the moment of birth. With the mother by virtue of the birth and with the father by virtue of the marriage to the mother. That marriage legitimates the child and establishes a legal father-child relationship. Where you do not have married children, there is no lawful relationship -- or legal relationship between man and woman, that in turn creates a legal relationship between father and child. Something else needs to be done. In the case of the mother, the mother's relationship to the child, the legal relationship is established at the moment of birth in the same way as it is for a married mother. The mother's name will typically be on a birth certificate or, at the very least, the birth will be witnessed by all present. There will not be any question, just to the biological maternity --"

      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",

With all respect, it is an attempt by Congress to equalize two situations that start out quite unequal because, as I described, at the moment of birth the mother has a legal relationship with the child, that is true in the United States. It is true virtually throughout the world. The child is born to the mother, the mother has custody as a legal matter, and before that child can be taken away from the mother, the mother would have to give it up, relinquish rights, legal rights, or they would have to be taken away from her. In the case of the father that is not true until paternity is established in some formal or legal way, and all that Congress has done here is said that that has to be done before the age of 18, and as this Court's --"

You have the formal legal relationship which can then be a springboard for a practical relationship between parent and child, but not only that, citizenship itself is a formal relationship between the citizen and the country, and Congress could reasonably conclude that in order to recognize a formal legal relationship between a child in the United States, a central element of that, the relationship of the child to parent should have a comparable formality and recognition so that it is recognized by the father and child and by those looking at that relationship as not just a biological relationship, perhaps even a deep biological relationship, but a lawful, formal recognized one that the rest of the world and this country can look to, because citizenship, in fact, carries rights and responsibilities on behalf of both the citizen and the nation, rights of protection, rights of duties to serve in the Armed Forces, and Congress could reasonably decide that it is not sufficient that out there somewhere during a child's minority there was someone who was a biological parent. It is necessary that the formal legal relationship be regarded as in existence during the minority."

I mean, what's the -- or you could be in a country where it doesn't descend one way or you could be in a state where they have different relationships.

This Court pointed that out Lalli decision and pointed it out -- we quoted page 34 of our brief from this Court's decision in Lehr v. Robertson which we think is very instructive. There the Court said the mother carries and bears the child. In this sense her parental relationship is clear. The validity of the father's parental claims must be gauged by other measures. And again this is not just proof."

We think that's true for several reasons. For one thing, if this Court were to broadly declare that a whole new category of persons were United States citizens there may be some question as to whether Congress could undo that. That, coupled with the point that this Court made in Ginsberg and Pangilinan that it's questionable whether a court can ever declare someone to be a citizen when Congress has not so declared, we think way powerfully in the direction of striking section 1409 and letting Congress decide what is the proper remedy in the situation."

If one thing is clear from 1940 until 1986, it is Congress did not want U.S. citizenship to pass solely by virtue of mere biological paternity. Congress insisted on something more in 1940 and 1952 and 1986, in 1952. In all of those situations, Congress moved to make things easier for U.S. citizen fathers to transmit citizenship. From 1952 to 1986, only legitimization, which often meant marrying the mother, was adequate. In 1986 Congress tried to ease things to make it easier for U.S. citizen fathers to put themselves in the same position as U.S. citizen mothers, by providing for the acknowledgment of the child in writing so that it would not be necessary to resort to the varying state laws regarding legitimization or elsewhere. The last point I would like to make with respect to -- two other points. One, this is a transaction that occurred abroad, not in the United States. It involved one alien and one U.S. citizen. This is not a situation in which the heightened scrutiny under our Constitution would ordinarily be thought to apply because of a solely domestic setting, but I should point out that --"

In fact, the statute has progressively gotten more liberal, and I think that that underscores the fact that in -- as this Court looks at the intent of Congress in crafting a remedy that the Court should take into account, that Congress has progressively gotten more liberal in addressing this issue. Most recently in 1986, the Congress eliminated the -- or reduced the ten-year residency requirement down to five years. Now, that had presumably a significant effect on the additional numbers of individuals who could seek transmission of citizenship under this law. Yet, there was no mention of that in the legislative history as being a factor that was influencing in any way Congress' view of this. In addition, there are other indicia of Congress' intent.
