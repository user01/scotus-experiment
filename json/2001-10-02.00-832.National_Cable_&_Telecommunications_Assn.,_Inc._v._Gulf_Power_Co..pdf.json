The question presented in this case is whether two particular types of attachments are covered by the act. The first is an attachment to provide cable television service and commingled Internet access. That means that over that particular wire at the particular time is traveling both cable television service and Internet access at different frequencies. The second type of attachment at issue is an attachment used to provide wireless telecommunications services. The FCC determined and the most natural reading of the act requires that both types of attachments are covered. The operative provision, the basic coverage provision, defines a pole attachment as any attachment by a cable television system or provider of telecommunications service."

We've got to decide whether, in fact, there's anything left under the general power, and if we decide that and say the answer is no, only then do we get to the question whether this -- whether this is a proper jurisdictional exercise under (d). And we should not have to go, it seems to me, through that sort of byzantine reverse decisional tree when the agency itself could tell us up front what it was acting under. And, therefore, I'm suggesting that maybe on this part of the case, the wise thing to do would be to vacate, send the thing back, and say, tell us -- you know, come to grips with us and tell us what you believe you're operating under and we'll review that."

      "speaker": "FELDMAN",
      "speech": "I realize that, but that -- that issue, it seems to me, is not a difficult one. If you look at (d), for example, (d) -- Congress knew quite well, when it was dealing with rates, not when it was dealing with terms, conditions, or mandatory access, which are also at issue in the statute -- when it was dealing with rates, it was quite clear this subsection -- that's (d)(3) -- shall apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by a cable television system solely to provide a cable service. Now, if Congress wanted to limit the -- the coverage -- the general coverage of the act, it could have used exactly that same language, and in (a)(4), it could have said, the term pole attachment means any attachment by a cable television system used solely to provide cable service. But Congress actually made a distinct choice. For purposes of the rate, it did want that to govern, and it had a reason for doing that, which I can go into."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I can give you -- I can give you another -- another plausible explanation. Indeed, I think it's -- it's to my mind the most plausible explanation. I think Congress divides the world -- the world -- of what can go on poles into cable and telecommunications. There are these two categories. That's the only reason people are going to string wires: cable or telecommunications. Then when it got to prescribing the rates, what are you going to do with something that overlaps between the two? You can provide one rate for cable, another rate for telecommunications. What about one that is both? You solve that question by, in the first rate section, saying if it's cable only, it has this rate, and if it's telecommunications, which is everything else, including the mingling of telecommunications with cable, it's another rate. That would be a perfectly plausible explanation of why Congress put cable only in the later section and in the earlier section just talked about cable because it thought anything else that cable does will be telecommunications."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FELDMAN",
      "speech": "Well, if Congress thought that -- again, the result of -- of if that were true could be that the (e) rate might apply to this thing, but it would still be that the (e) rate applied. It would not be that this -- that these attachments are not protected at all. And I would add that in 1996, when Congress passed this statute, the FCC had already determined in several cases that a cable attachment that's also used to provide data transmission services was still an attachment by a cable television system and still entitled to the protection of the Pole Attachment Act. That -- that decision was affirmed by the D.C. Circuit in the Texas Utilities case in 1993, and the FCC had applied it in several cases after that. So, by the time Congress -- and Congress did not change any of the relevant language that was important for that decision. It still left it the pole attachment means any attachment by a cable television system. I mean, I would add if the -- whatever the FCC is to -- is going to determine about what the Internet access is, whatever they would determine about that, the attachment would still be an attachment by a cable television system. I don't see how you can construe it to mean it's not any longer an attachment by a cable television system. It may be something else as well."

The court of appeals started by saying the question in this case is whether the FCC has jurisdiction over Internet access. The FCC doesn't purport to have jurisdiction over Internet access. And if you were dealing with a wire that only provided Internet access, that would be a completely different question."

    {
      "speaker": "FELDMAN",
      "speech": "Yes, because I think that what Congress wanted to specify when it said when it's cable only is it wanted to ensure that -- and this is actually fairly clear -- is when the cable companies went into -- into the business of providing telephone service to people, that they would be charged the same rate as the telecommunications providers who were newly added to the act. But that was not their intent. With -- with respect to Internet access, they didn't have a specific intent like that. They had an intent that Internet access should be characterized however it should be characterized. What you do know is that if, at one and the same time over that same wire, are proceeding -- is a -- a cable television service and Internet access, it is an attachment by a cable television system. And the fact that the cable television system is providing something else through that wire doesn't preclude the application of -- of -- doesn't preclude the FCC's jurisdiction."

And in fact, if it were outside the act, it's -- it's not -- it's very difficult to understand why Congress didn't take that solely by a cable -- solely to provide cable television services and put it right here in (a)(4) in the basic coverage provision."

I'd like to reserve -- well, maybe I should address the other issue just for a minute. The other issue seems -- is -- really rests on the same basic premise, which is an attachment by a wireless telecommunications provider is an attachment by a telecommunications provider. The statute defines the provision of telecommunications service as the offering of telecommunications to the public regardless of the facilities used, and it therefore precludes making a distinction between wireless and wireline telecommunications providers. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."

Section (a)(4) defines pole attachment as any attachment by a cable television system. And, Justice Scalia, cable system is a defined term in the act. Section 522, subsection 7 defines a cable system as the physical equipment that constitutes the cable network. It's on --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "You say the attachment of a cable system. It says an attachment by a cable system. You make a big deal of that in -- in the brief, and I don't see that it makes any difference whether it says cable company or cable system. It is still an attachment by a cable either company or system. It doesn't say the attachment of a cable system."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEISLER",
      "speech": "Well, it's an attachment by a cable television system to the pole, and the system itself is defined as a set of closed transmission paths and associated signal and generation/reception control equipment that is designed to provide cable services which include video programming. These wires which are attached to the poles are one of those closed transmission paths that constitute the cable system under that definition. Now, it's -- it's not the case I think, Justice Scalia, that Congress could have divided the world solely into cable services and telecommunications services because there are lots of services that don't fit either definition. Telecommunications service is the offering of telecommunications, which is defined in section 153 of the act as the transmission of information of the user's choosing without change in the form or content. Internet access, the commission has found, changes the form of the information. An Internet service provider engages in something called protocol conversion so that the message that goes out from your computer can actually talk to the service and computers that comprise the worldwide web. So, it is not a telecommunications service. The commission correctly found that. And applying telecommunications service regulation to everything that's not a cable service would mean applying a whole host of legacy telecommunications statutes and rules to a whole sector of the economy that has always been unregulated, information service providers. And, Justice Souter, I don't think a remand to the FCC would be appropriate. Essentially -- unless you conclude that they're wrong on the theory of the case on which they resolved it. But you suggested, Your Honor, that the commission could have reached the same result through an alternative path. It could have said, well, this is a cable service, therefore the (e) rate applies. But I think the question for this appeal is was it arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law for the commission to resolve the case the way it did. If the commission's legal interpretation of section (a)(4) is correct, that it applies to any attachment by a cable television system, and a cable system includes wires that commingle Internet access and video programming, then it's not arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law for the commission to resolve the case the way it did. And I think beyond that, it was perfectly reasonable. The question of whether this is a cable service is a very big question with immense regulatory consequences that determines again whether a whole host of regulations that go well beyond the Pole Attachment Act will be applied to this service. The commission said we don't need to decide that here since we would choose to apply the (d) rate anyway. We'll postpone that to a later proceeding where we can gather a record. That proceeding is going on now, and that's going to be resolved in that proceeding."

Or it could be wrong because it was arbitrary and capricious for them to exercise their authority under subsection (b) to choose this particular rate rather than another rate. But again, nobody has sought review on that question before the court of appeals or before this Court. The sole claim that respondents made in their petition for review is that we are out of the statute entirely, completely unregulated, that we get kicked off the system the instant we provide any service other than cable only or telecommunications. And that's just not a plausible reading of the statute. They have not been able to posit a single plausible purpose for that result. In fact, their brief actually refers to it as an unanticipated consequence of the way the statute is written. But we know the Congress wanted to promote Internet access. It said so in the statute itself, section 230. We know that Congress believed that cable television systems needed continued rights to access poles. It said so in 224. The only way to serve both objectives is to cover commingled attachments."

They said the commission has no authority to set any rate at all. And that can't have been Congress' purpose. Congress has always understood that the cable wire into the home is potentially capable of carrying many, many services other than simply television programs. That's why they were so careful to define cable system as a facility designed to provide cable services which include video programming, not which are exclusively video programming, but which include video programming. There was testimony before Congress, findings of the FCC that the cable wire had potential of becoming a broadband communications gateway. And the packing of multiple services into this wire was considered a good thing, good for consumers and good for competition."

And (d) and (e) provide two ways. Nothing there purports to be the exclusive way. Indeed, I think an economist would say that neither (d) nor (e) is the economically correct way. They're approximations. So, why don't we have simply here two ways among -- I could give you 50, frankly. So, could you. So, what is it that says if you happen to have this, you use this way; if you happen to have that, you use that way? If you happen to have something we're not too interested in because it's not that common, but if you should have it, you can try yet a third, a fourth, or a fifth way.

This is a case where the electric industry here, which is principally regulated by other agencies, is now being regulated also by the FCC. Congress -- people were very concerned about giving the -- the communications agency jurisdiction over the electric industry. The White House's Office of Telecommunications Policy wrote two letters to Congress expressing that concern when the act was being considered, and Congress said, in the legislative history, quite clearly we're giving the FCC a very narrow grant of jurisdiction.

But if Congress had intended the FCC to regulate the wireless siting market in this peculiar kind of way, just utility sites, clearly they would have said something about it.

It would be if it's a cable service or a telecommunications service, it would fall within (d) or (e). What the FCC has done here -- and the reason that we're in this awkward posture -- is they've refused to make that classification, but they've decided that, nonetheless, cable modem service, even though we don't know what it is, is going to be treated under (d), which Congress has said will be applied solely to cable service.

One is that -- that indeed what Congress was doing here, as the petitioners have pointed out, was dealing with the fact that cable companies were going to be getting into the telephone business. And this Texas Utilities case, which the Government mentions in its brief, stands for the proposition in the pre-'96 era -- in the pre-'96 statute -- that if you're a cable company in the telephone business, you get a regulated rate for your attachment, and -- and therefore can compete against the ILEC's, which is what the larger purpose of much of the '96 act was about. But if you're -- if you're a CLEC, if you're a telephone company, a communications company, that's in the same business and providing the same service, you don't get a regulated rate. That was a regulatory anomaly, as the legislative history calls it, and Congress dealt with that head on in the statute. And it provided in section (d) and section (e) -- it -- that -- that where you have -- it added telecommunications carriers to the statute, although it exempted the ILEC's. Remember this. The cable companies' biggest competitors in high-speed services business, the DSL lines, or the local phone companies, don't have regulated pole attachments. And that's what, in many respects, is driving the cable companies."

And if you're going to be right on the main point, my main question on the main point is I thought that the purpose of this act basically is that Congress discovered that the utilities have poles everywhere. There are new competitors coming along that could use those poles to transmit their networks at lower cost, but the utilities have a monopoly. And we want to make sure that a monopoly, a monopoly into -- a monopoly does not charge a monopoly price and, therefore, we want them regulated. And, therefore, they wrote very broad language to throw into what is going to be regulated virtually everything related to communications that will meet that kind of problem. Now, that's my -- I'm -- I'm saying this to get you started on what I consider the main point."

      "speaker": "STEINDLER",
      "speech": "Yes, but it also doesn't include commingled cable and Internet service. And the reason that it doesn't include that is that Congress specifically -- as Mr. Keisler pointed out, Congress specifically defined a cable system in the statute. It's -- it's reprinted. The definition is reprinted at page 19 of the brief of the respondents, American Electric Power Service Corporation. But remember -- remember what we're talking about. We're talking about a pole attachment definition which is any attachment by a cable television system. Congress has defined this term. Now, Justice Scalia remarked earlier that it was -- it's an attachment by a cable -- a cable system, not of a cable system. And, indeed, there is awkwardness in this language, but I would submit to you that the express definition of cable system will trump any awkwardness in grammar."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, there's an awkwardness that I don't understand. The '96 act was extending the benefit of attachment a group that hadn't had that benefit before. What is there that makes sense of saying, cable company, if you dare to go into the Internet business, you are going to be, in the words that were used before, kicked off the pole. That's it. If Congress was trying to encourage development of Internet service, it also wanted the cable system to get onto that pole at a rent that was not a monopoly rent. What sense would it make to say, cable company, you dare to go into the Internet access business, you are off the pole entirely?"

A cable system is a set of facilities, but where you're a common carrier -- that is to say if you're in the phone business and you're regulated as a common carrier -- the definition says you are a cable system only to the extent that you provide traditional video service. That dovetails here with what Congress has done with respect to cable service in 224(d). It gives this lower rate only if you're providing cable service.

Congress, in 1978 as a premise of this act, decided that the telephone companies and the utilities had a lot of -- and we cite the -- the committee report that makes this point -- had -- had interconnection agreements. Some owned -- the utilities owned some poles; the telephone companies owned other poles. They had a longstanding agreements by which everybody used everybody else's poles because everybody had to get a complete network to all the houses. Now, under -- so, therefore, that is why Congress did not include the so-called ILEC's, the old- fashioned telephone companies, in this act. They already had access to poles. They either owned them or had agreements with longstanding arrangements with -- with the utility -- electric utilities. On the other hand, there were CLEC's, which are new entrants in the telecommunications business. Those were protected by the (e) rate regardless of whether they do or don't provide Internet access. Similarly, cable companies, the FCC decided, should be protected by the (d) rate similarly so that if they provide Internet access, they're not penalized thereby and kicked off the pole. Under Mr. Steindler's rule and under the Eleventh Circuit's decision, if a cable company provides Internet access, it's off the pole."
