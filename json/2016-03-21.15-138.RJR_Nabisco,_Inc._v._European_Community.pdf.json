And ­­ and here the difference between the substantive prohibition and the private right of action is clear from this Court's private right of action jurisprudence over the last 30 or 40 years which made clear that the decision to prohibit certain underlying conduct is fundamentally different from the decision to provide a private right of action for violation of substantive law.

In other words, once the Court had decided that the presumption against extraterritoriality had not been rebutted, then there was an additional argument that had been made like, oh, this really does involve domestic conduct. And so the Court used this focus test to decide whether it was the domestic conduct or the extraterritorial conduct that was the focus of the statute. But that doesn't seem to answer the question whether the presumption is rebutted at all, and it doesn't seem to answer the question that I think you're trying to get at, and it's an important question, as to whether we look at that presumption question section by section or for the statute as a whole."

The related point, this isn't just the presumption against extraterritoriality. We also have the background common law rule that causes of action to redress private injuries are governed by the law of the place of the injury. Here we have only foreign injuries. Congress legislates against the background common law rule, and just as the cause of action in RICO picks up background common law rules, approximate cause, so too it picks up this lex loci delicti rule, again absent some clear indication to the contrary.

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to talk about both the enterprise and the injury points, but I'd like to start with the enterprise point, because Section 1962 most directly affects the government's ability to bring RICO prosecutions and RICO civil actions. And as some of those questions have pointed out, there are a number of predicates that are incorporated into RICO, into the definition of racketeering activity, that have extraterritorial applications. Some of them have solely extraterritorial applications. And that is a clear indication that RICO itself extends extraterritorially to the extent that the predicates that are alleged in the case do. And that is true both of the pattern itself, the conduct of the crimes, and also of the enterprise. And you can see that, if you look at the kinds of predicates that we are talking about here. As was observed earlier, many of them were incorporated into RICO after 9/11. Many of them involved terrorist conduct. And the natural way in which the provisions would operate and Congress would have understood this is that they would have swept in activities by foreign enterprises as well as the foreign conduct itself. We've given a number of examples of those kinds of provisions in our brief: The killing of the U.S. national abroad, taking U.S. hostages abroad, shooting at aircraft with U.S. citizens abroad with missile systems. There is another example that is, I think, a very clear one, that is Section 2339D, which is receiving military­type training from a foreign terrorist organization. Although I suppose it is possible that somebody could go and receive that training in connection with their activities with a domestic enterprise, the very natural operation of that provision is going to be that they are going to be carrying out the affairs of a foreign enterprise ­­ in fact, a very foreign terrorist organization ­­ that is holding the military­type training and has those training camps. And so we think that it's clear that the provision has ­­ that Section 1962 has extraterritorial applicability, both with respect to the foreign pattern of conduct and with respect to the enterprise, to the extent that a predicate with extraterritorial applicability is implicated. I've heard Petitioners talk about two reasons why they think that might not be true, both of which I think are incorrect. One is that the government could just prosecute the underlying crimes themselves and not use RICO, and the other is that ­­ well, in situations in which you have some people in the United States, you could kind of break them off and call them a domestic enterprise. And I don't think either of those is a workable approach to Section 1962. With respect to just prosecuting the underlying crimes, of course the very point of RICO was that Congress thought, where there were patterns of serious crimes, that just prosecuting the crime itself was not a strong enough tool for the government, and that it was important for the government to have these special advantages that RICO confirms in order to root out the things that are causing these patterns of crimes."

And I'm wondering why that shouldn't cause us to be more concerned with respect to the comity interests that are at stake when you're talking about extraterritorial applicability."

It's on the private side, under Section 1964(c), where you have private parties bringing treble damages actions, that the concerns about comity, I think, are much greater, because private parties don't have that same ability or incentive to regulate. When they are bringing actions, they are trying to get their treble damages."

And the country where that conduct and that injury took place may very well have its own interest in regulating, may not be appreciative of plaintiffs being able to come to the United States to get remedies here, particularly treble damages remedies, which, as this Court pointed out in Empagran, is something that often causes foreign countries a great deal of consternation ­­"

EU officials have gone over every single line and compared with the positions taken by Member States in other cases. And the reason why this isn't important to the EU, and the consistency with which those positions is made, rests on four very important principles. When Congress extended RICO extraterritorially, there are one of four components that is present in every single one of the 40­some statutes that the Solicitor General puts in Appendix B: The victim is an American; the defendant is an American, the perpetrator; there is effect on U.S. interests; or there is conduct that occurs in the United States. Every one of those four components tracks with an important principle of international law. The extraterritoriality principle, the nationality principle, the passive protective personality principle, and the protective personality.

In those cases, like the Alien Tort Statute where you did not have a cause of action that had been drafted by Congress and so, therefore, you did not have a legislative determination of the effect on comity interests internationally, you're left with a situation where you had judge­made law, and this Court, I think appropriately, followed the guidance and advice of foreign nations which said, be careful how far you extend judge­made law.

Our point is that it can't be the case where, for centuries, the United States courts have been open to allow foreign plaintiffs to come in alleging injury caused by U.S. actors under U.S. law, that somehow we're going to read the Morrison principle as a way of constricting the available remedies. Nothing in Morrison suggests that you would do that kind of extraterritorial slicing and dicing, where once you had concluded that the underlying action here was one that observed and respected international norms and went to extraterritorial lengths provided in this case, that there is a tie to the United States. And whatever remedies are available are available. And after Pfizer, a number of U.S. companies were concerned about it, and they went to Congress and they asked Congress to restrict it. And the hearings that we have laid out in our brief ­­ and this is page 45, note 11 ­­ goes into the legislative history of this. And the State Department, Justice Breyer, took exactly the opposite position, because the State Department said, reciprocity demands that we be allowed to go into other nations' courts and the availability of our courts for foreign nations to come in for violations of the U.S. And if you look at footnote 13, which is on page 55, the State Department testified to Congress that the United States had brought more than 50 actions in nations around the world. So the idea about comity is one that, respectfully, is a decision that is made by Congress, and it is not for the executive branch to change its position for the purpose of trying to snuff out a remedy that otherwise would be available to a foreign plaintiff."

So there is a direct reference to the definition of \"racketeering\" that has the some 46 predicate acts that have a clearly textual extraterritorial effect. So I think that by incorporation, you would interpret it that way. And the second thing is that when Congress used that language in 1964, it was tracking the Clayton Act. And the Clayton Act had a ­­ a predetermined and pre­understood meaning as to what those words meant."

The same words are in the Clayton Act as they were adopted in 1970, and as Justice Kagan pointed out, the case has only become stronger with the Money Laundering and post­PATRIOT Act additions of those predicate acts. But the third answer I would give you, Justice Alito, is that even in Morrison itself, the Court's opinion says once we have found there to be extraterritorial application, it's not for us to be deciding that there are different provisions that shouldn't have that. And that's essentially the argument that is being made as to take an extension of Morrison beyond where the Court was ­­"

      "speech": "And my answer is, Congress has addressed some of those concerns in the antitrust area with various amendments that affect ­­ that ­­ that only go to conduct. And classically, what Congress is getting at is conduct, not remedy. But in the conduct area, what Congress has done in one of the antitrust amendments for the Sherman Act was to say, we are only going to affect foreign conduct if it has a domestic effect, but it is still a focus on conduct and not on remedy. Congress is very well­equipped to deal with this issue should it proceed that ­­ there to be a concern, but Justice Breyer, I would point out that it would be odd to suppose that Congress is intending to turn the United States into a place where criminal activities could occur from the United States that was affecting our closest allies and there was nothing those allies could do about it by going into the United States and trying to vindicate and ­­ and seek redress for those harms. That would be a very, very stark departure from this country's long history of having respect and ­­ and provide a remedy for foreigners who are harmed by actions of the United States and its citizens. If I could just address the ­­ I think I've addressed the Empagran question, because that's the statute that was affected. And if I could just note that the PATRIOT Act ­­ footnote 10 of our brief points out that then­Senator John Kerry, now Secretary of State, was very conscious of the effect that this would have on foreign nations and foreign litigants. And when the PATRIOT Act extended certain of these predicate acts into RICO, he stated on the floor ­­ we cited the provision in our brief ­­ the reason for doing that was to give foreign nations that had been affected and who were treaty allies an opportunity to come and seek redress in our courts. The last point is that Mr. Katsas noted the choice­of­law principle, where there is a foreign injury and there is a decision to apply foreign law, and he says, why shouldn't that apply here? That only applies where there is a conflict between the laws that would apply here ­­ we are asserting that there is a U.S. statutory violation by a U.S. company for actions that it committed in part in the United States. There's no reason to apply a choice of law, because you have a foreign company that is ­­ or foreign interests that are asserting a violation of U.S. domestic law. In every instance where Congress made the decision to apply RICO extraterritorially, it imposed important domestic proof requirements. That is the limiting principle on which the Court ought to decide this case. Thank you."

      "speech": "Justice Breyer, you asked about government's positions. The United States is the party that has to live with the consequences of your decision one way or the other. They are telling you here that there is a comity problem with respect ­­ there is no inconsistency with what they said before. In Empagran, they told you the same thing: That providing remedies for foreign injuries caused by largely foreign conduct would be a problem. The EU is here as a party in this case, but take a look at what they said in many other cases where they were in the more detached position: As an amicus in OBB, in Kiobel, in Sosa, and most importantly, in Empagran itself, which is the case involving foreign injuries caused by largely foreign conduct. They said in that case there would be a huge comity problem with extending American law. With regard to comity, Justice Kagan, you asked is it ­­ is it too policy­ish. It's not because you have all of these background presumptions and principles. I spoke about the presumption against extraterritoriality and about the common law background rule of lex loci delicti. A third principle is the Charming Betsy canon, that you construe Federal statutes not to violate international law absent a very clear statement to the contrary, and that's what we have here, because Empagran says that applying U.S. law to provide redress for foreign injuries caused by largely foreign conduct would be unreasonable, and therefore, a violation of customary international law. You also ask why draw the line at injury? Once you established the underlying, the underlying predicate applies extraterritorially. First reason is that the decision to create a private right of action is ­­ is different from the decision to criminalize the conduct. The money laundering statute applies extraterritorially, but there's no private right of action for people injured by money laundry. The second reason is that Empagran applies that principle to the question of injury, and specifically does so with regard to the very antitrust provisions that were in effect pre­1982, in effect when RICO was enacted to say there's this category of cases involving foreign injury where the government can prosecute but the private party cannot bring an action for civil redress. And that's an important distinction precisely because private parties are not constrained by prosecutorial discretion. It is aggressive to apply American criminal law, but at least the government ­­ the Justice Department has to talk to the State Department and take into account any comity concerns, any problems that particular prosecutions might bring. That is not the case with respect to private plaintiffs."

Petitioners are four transactions removed from the original problem in Europe, and two transactions removed from the cigarette sales. All of ­­ all of those involve European transactions. And Reynolds' alleged conduct involves transactions in Europe, Central and South America."
