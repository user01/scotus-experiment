      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Twice the driver in this case tested positive for illegal drugs, and twice the company that employed him to drive its 25-ton vehicles in West Virginia tried to fire him. Each time an arbitrator ordered the driver reinstated. The second time the company went to court, arguing that the reinstatement award should not be enforced because it was contrary to public policy to put this driver back behind the wheel. The district court and the court of appeals, however, rejected that argument and concluded that because reinstatement was not illegal, the public policy exception to the enforceability of contracts, quote, does not apply, unquote."

      "speech": "Yes. The agreement said that in the case of a positive drug test the driver was subject to sanctions up to and including termination, and the arbitrator concluded that in this case they hadn't established just cause. That, of course, is the predicate for the application of the public policy exception in every case, the fact that the contract provides a result that is different from the one the parties are arguing for under public policy."

The driver, before he can go back to work, has to pass the minimum requirements, which is just evaluation by a substance abuse professional and pass a return-to-work test, and then whether or not the driver gets his job back is left to private ordering. Now, if that private ordering takes the form of a contract, a collective bargaining agreement, that contract should be subject to the public policy exception just like every other contract is. There is not --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "That's right, and for a very important reason, is because the doctrine that we're talking about is a doctrine of contract law.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Oh, but there is something very much that constrains the company's choice in that situation, and that's tort law.

It is always the case when the public policy question comes up that the contract provides something else."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Yes. The public policy exception is the one this Court articulated in Town of Newton, which is that courts have not only the authority but the obligation to decline to enforce contracts that are illegal or that violate public policy. Now, to determine whether they violate public policy, what this Court did was adopt the Restatement test, one that has been developed over centuries of common law, which asks whether the interests in enforcing the agreement are outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy harm by the enforcement of the agreement."

Now, that policy is well-defined, because Congress and the executive have said what those positions are, not the courts. Congress and the executive have said it covers these substances, not the courts, and the policy is so strong that Congress has said, we're going to test you to make sure that the policy is implemented, and Congress and the executive have said how that testing should be done, and how often.

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "With respect to the one strike I think the regulations would prevent that in most situations, because they contemplate that in some circumstances you can be reinstated, so there should not be an absolute rule of one strike and you're out. Now, the objection Your Honor raises is the same objection that could have been raised in the Town of Newton case. How do you tell which release dismissal agreement violates the policies underlying section 1983? It's an objection that has been raised with respect to the public policy exception since the beginning. Go back to the Muschany case and even before that. And yet the exception has endured because the courts have recognized that if courts do not ensure that contracts do not violate public policy, no one else can."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Well, one -- yes -- well, in the testing, but what the Court said in Muschany, repeated in Grace and in Misco, is, courts just don't pluck these policies out of the air. You have to look to the laws and legal precedents. You look to the testing act, the DOT regulations, the drug-free work place acts, and one thing they establish is a strong policy of deterrence. They didn't think that by imposing this testing regime they would catch everybody who's using drugs. What they thought was, if people knew they were going to be tested and consequences were going to flow from that, people would stop using drugs."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "I -- first of all, I think that's the policy as a general matter. I don't think -- again, this is not an area where the Court adopts general categorical rules. For example, if the two tests are 15 years apart, or something like that, perhaps in that situation it doesn't make sense to say you cannot be reinstated. That of course is not the situation here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Roberts, the indeterminacy of all this I think is what is bothering a lot of us, and let me put the question slightly different from the way others have done. It seems to me that in considering a public policy exception here we are in a different -- we at this particular Court in this context are in a different position from courts simply sitting in the traditional common law circumstances in which you have two independent contracting parties, and we're in a different position because in fact we've got a labor contract here, and we have a body of law which I assume we can rely on which places tremendous value on the process of arbitration under CVA and respect for the arbitrator's agreement -- determination. So that if we are going to provide a public policy, or recognize a public policy exception here, it seems to me that it's got to be one in which the force of the public policy thought to be inconsistent with the arbitrator's award has got to be very, very, very clear and strong and so on. It's not the kind of, or the degree of public policy that might satisfy a traditional common law context. Given the high degree of persuasiveness that the policy has got to have to overcome these presumptions, is there any way, practical way to administer it short of what the Court did, and that in effect is to say, look, you've got to have inconsistency with positive law?"
    },

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "You have a common law rule that authorizes and obligates courts to apply this, and the argument, as I understand it, and it is the union's argument, is that you should have an exception to that rule in the labor area because we defer to arbitrators, but we defer to arbitrators because they have expertise in the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement. That is not the question when it comes to public policy. As this Court --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, except that up to a point it is, because as I understand the DOT regs in effect -- I think the phrase that has been used, leave the issue of when you can fire, or whether you can fire for a repeat offense, to private ordering, so it is in fact an issue of the meaning of the contract, and the arbitrator is right smack in the middle of what the arbitrator is best at doing when the arbitrator makes a decision like this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Well, no. That depends on what the collective bargaining agreement provides, and collective bargaining agreements do not shape public policy. They shape a private agreement between an employer and a union, and as this --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, they don't, but the -- when the agreement -- when the private ordering addresses this subject, and the arbitrator is applying that agreement, the arbitrator is acting in sort of a quintessential arbitrator's role, so that it's quite true the arbitrator doesn't -- isn't a separate source, perhaps, of public policy, but the arbitrator's decision is entitled to the greatest deference that it's ever entitled to."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "No, Your Honor. I think they're both entitled to the same weight, and all that the arbitrator's decision does is tell you what the parties agreed to. They say, this interpretation is binding on the parties. Well, that just poses the question that is presented. When you have an application of the public policy doctrine you assume that the parties have agreed to something else. In the Kensington case, Mrs. Bleaker signed an agreement limiting her -- the liability of the company to 250 francs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "All right, so in this case, then, to get right to the facts of it, which -- facts-intensive, we assume that the parties agreed that an appropriate remedy for a person who is found with marijuana twice, and there are extenuating circumstances, is a $10,000 fine, in effect, and rehabilitation, and reinstatement if he tests negative. Now, how can we say that's against public policy? If you were in California the criminal law provides the most severe penalty that could be attached to a second possession of 26 grams is a $100 fine. So here we have 30 million people in the State of California saying a $100 fine is the appropriate thing. In West Virginia, I take the highest fine would have been $1,000 under the criminal law. And now here, the arbitrator says it's going to be $10,000 and testing negative, rehabilitation, reinstatement, so how could we say in this case it's against public policy and he has to be fired?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

If, in fact, it is so clear that the deterrent effect would be vitiated unless there were a firing and so on, why didn't DOT provide it, and the fact that DOT didn't provide it seems to erect a caution sign in my mind in the face of a court that purports to be able to infer the clear public policy that you rest upon."

The Solicitor General is arguing against the exception today, but when it was a Federal postal worker that they were trying to fire and an arbitrator ordered him reinstated, then the Solicitor General was saying no, the court should vacate that arbitration award. These situations come up with sufficient regularity, sometimes the shoe is on one foot and sometimes on the other, but the fact of the public policy exception has to be recognized, and the one thing that is clear, it seems, is that the lower court approach, which said this is not illegal, therefore there's no role for the public policy exception, is inconsistent with this Court's decision.

What Misco taught us is that in the 301 context, a court may refuse to enforce an arbitrator's award because it is contrary to public policy if and only if it violates an explicit public policy that is well-defined and dominant, and is ascertained by an examination of laws and legal precedents, and not general supposed notions of public interest. Only if there is an explicit conflict with the public relevant public policy can the arbitration award or contract in the 301 context be struck down. Eastern challenges under the guise of public policy an arbitration award that was rendered pursuant to the parties' collective bargaining agreement, which reinstated an employee who had tested positive for marijuana. The policy that it uses is the policy embodied in the omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 and the regulations issued by the Department of Transportation pursuant to that statute. An examination of the statute and the regulations reveals a comprehensive public policy. It is not merely deterrence. It is not merely to take employees out of driving dangerous vehicles, although we agree it is in there. It also has a statutory purpose of rehabilitation and a return to duty for these employees. The basic framework of the statute, as we see it, and the regs issued pursuant to that, is detection of these employees, removal from the safety-sensitive position --"

I mean, it's just a limitation upon the first public policy. I don't know that I would express it to be a policy in and of itself that there should be rehabilitation of people, and that people who have violated proscriptions against the use of illegal drugs and driving dangerous vehicles, we want these people to be rehabilitated.

We believe that that framework has worked, for the most part. We think it should be affirmed just as we originally had it in Grace, and we see what happened in Grace is that the Court's explicit recognition of a public policy exception in the 301 context perhaps encouraged courts, invigorated them to look at labor arbitration awards under the public policy exception, and the Court had to come back in Misco and remind all of us what it meant in the Grace decision, and we think that the Misco standard --"

Those really don't come in under the Misco analysis as directly as under the Enterprise Wheel analysis. Misco says that there must be an articulated, well-defined, dominant public policy in the laws and legal precedents, and only if that policy is violated by the award can it be struck down in the 301 context."

Initially there was a proposal that would have a sanction for a second offense of a 60-day period outside the safety-sensitive position, or removal from work, suspension. After receiving comments, the agency did not adopt that standard. What it did do is remind us that the sanction for failing the rehab program, which is in essence what happened, is the same as in alcohol testing, which is you will be removed, rehabilitated, and eligible for return to service."

Once he satisfies all of those prerequisites, he should be able to return to his MEO job."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

So I agree with you on the interpretation of the award, but I don't understand how you can think that the Secretary, by not addressing recidivists, is in effect saying recidivism doesn't matter. It seems to me the fact that they didn't apply automatic disqualification for recidivism only means, you know, there are all sorts of circumstances that may exist, and we're not willing to say categorically that somebody can never come back, but that doesn't answer the question, certainly, whether, when you have a person whom -- in my hypothetical, the arbitrator acknowledges that there is significant risk that this person will be under the influence of drugs again behind the wheel. When the arbitrator finds that and nonetheless puts him back behind the wheel, public policy isn't violated. I don't think the failure of the regs to address that situation is anything except silence."

Two, we need to look to the DOT regulations, which give us the public policy that we are looking for. Three would be the collective bargaining agreement, which authorizes an arbitrator to make these sort of just cause decisions, and the fourth would be Arbitrator Barrett's award. If you view the award through the prism of Misco, it's clear that the award should be enforced. We think that that's how easily this case can be resolved. But if the Court does intend to reach the second question, we believe it is important that the Court analyze this within the section 301 jurisprudence.

As we understand the common law notion, the courts, whatever powers they may have, had under the public policy exception, they did not act in a position in contradiction to the legislature. The legislature is the traditional body that establishes public policy. In enacting the National Labor Relations Act, we believe that the legislature, Congress, did establish the public policy. If you look at sections 171 and 173 of title 29, it's 201 and 203 of the act, it clearly tells us that labor contracts really are something different than commercial contracts. We are balancing public policy of collective bargaining, telling the bargaining parties that they should privately order their own affairs, and so long as what they do is lawful, we're not going to interfere with that."

So long as the arbitrator is staying true to his commission he can and should look at those other considerations. That's why people select the arbitrators, is they have the specialized judgment, as the Court recognized in Gateway Coal, to resolve those questions. Certainly an arbitrator can look at those external sources and use the benefit of those to craft a remedy."

It accommodated and acknowledged both the interest of the public and the safety of the highways and the interests of the employees in being rehabilitated and returned to service, and the interest of employers.

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The arbitrator in this case treated the employee's drug use as a serious offense. He considered it worthy of serious punishment. With respect to those aspects of the arbitrator's decision, the petitioner really has no complaint. Petitioner contends that the arbitrator's award is contrary to public policy only in that the arbitrator chose to impose a suspension of slightly over 3 months plus costs of the arbitration in lieu of outright discharge, and therefore the question is whether the punishment imposed by the arbitrator can reliably be said to conflict with public policy. This Court emphasized in Misco that a court asked to vacate an arbitral award in the labor context on the basis of public policy must draw that policy from positive law, from statutes and regulations."

      "speech": "Mr. Stewart, what's the Government's position on question 2 that's presented?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "We would say that there are limited circumstances under which an arbitral award can be vacated even though the award would not compel the employer to violate positive law, and to give you a hypothetical example, the Department of Transportation has a regulation that says that a driver who is convicted of driving under the influence is disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle for a period of 1 year. Now, in a hypothetical case in which an employee was believed to have driven under the influence, was not convicted, but conceded at the arbitral proceeding that he had, in fact, driven while under the influence of alcohol and drugs, in such a case, if the arbitrator imposed a 3-month suspension and then put the person back behind the wheel, that would not literally compel the employer to violate positive law because there would be no conviction. But given that there was an alternative basis for feeling highly confident that the prohibited conduct had occurred, such an award would be explicable only on the ground that the arbitrator disagreed with the policy judgment reflected in the DOT regulations. But we do -- while we don't think that the vacatur of the award is limited to those situations in which a violation of positive law would otherwise occur, we do think that the relevant public policy must be drawn directly from positive law, and therefore the question is, is there anything in the testing act or the DOT regulations that identifies discharge as the mandatory penalty for a second drug offense or not, and in our view there's no way that the regulations or the statute can fairly be read to compel that conclusion."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, they can't compel that conclusion, but wouldn't you say it's part of the public policy, a clear part of the public policy, that a -- that where there is a substantial possibility that a person who has been a drug user will be under the influence of drugs while driving, that person should not be put behind the wheel?"

      "speech": "We wouldn't say that, because in our view the DOT regulations provide an alternative basis for preventing that, that feared result from occurring. That is, regardless of whether the arbitrator orders this person reinstated, the person is not eligible under the regulations to drive a commercial vehicle until he complies with DOT's rehabilitation requirements. And if he's evaluated by the substance abuse professional, if the substance abuse professional certifies that he has complied with the recommended course of treatment and that the employer is therefore legally free to employ him again in driving a truck, that provides the basis for assurance that a person who poses a substantial risk will not be on the roads, and --"

      "speech": "The SAP's, as we refer to them, are not -- they're not certified by the Department of Transportation, but the regulations do specify the categories of people who are eligible to perform this service, and the regulations also make clear that the choice of a particular SAP is up to the employer unless the employer has delegated that power away through collective bargaining agreement, so the employer has the ultimate power to ensure that this important decision is not being entrusted to someone, somebody that the employer believes is insufficiently protective of the public safety."

      "speech": "Mr. Stewart, do you think that there is a difference and that public policy overrides, say, something that would just come under the FAA, a question the Chief asked, say a consumer contract that's drawn by the seller, and that's dictated the contract, and a -- adding on top of the collective bargaining contract public policy in the case of a -- of an employer-union negotiated contract?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "Well, we would certainly agree with the Chief Justice that there is also a strong policy reflected in the language of the Federal Arbitration Act in favor of enforcement of arbitration agreements in the commercial context. There is in the labor context the additional consideration of preserving industrial peace, but we don't -- I don't know that we would say that the two are different in kind. Now, certainly in the State system it is up to a State government to determine how it wants to allocate power among the branches, and therefore State courts may assume far greater authority to devise public policy to set aside contracts that violate it even if they aren't drawing the relevant public policy from positive law. That's up to the State system. But within the Federal system I think even whether within the FAA, or under the labor management statutes, there is a strong policy in favor of enforcement of contractual choices. And so in 1992 to 1994 the Department of Transportation conducted an extensive rule-making, it heard comments from a number of interested people, and its mandate from Congress was to consider both the need to protect the public safety against the ill effects of transportation employees who use drugs, and the testing act also included a congressional finding that rehabilitation is a critical component of any testing program. And it was the Department's mandate to balance those potentially competing objectives, and specifically with respect to the problem of a recidivist drug user, the initial regulation proposed by the Department of Transportation would have mandated a 60-day disqualification period. And I think, as Justice Breyer suggested, part of the irony of this case is that if that provision had been adopted, we think the petitioner would have no basis for challenging the arbitral award here, because if DOT had said, suspension of at least 60 days, and the arbitrator had imposed a suspension of a little over 3 months --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "I think it all depends on what powers the parties elect to confer upon the arbitrator. That is, if the collective bargaining agreement specified that the punishment for a first positive drug test will be a 30-day suspension followed by reinstatement if the individual has complied with the DOT regulations, I think there would be no room under the contract for the arbitrator to say, I'm not sufficiently confident that this person can do the job again, and therefore I'm ordering him discharged. And conversely, if the collective bargaining agreement said, anybody who violates the drug policy twice will be dismissed, the arbitrator wouldn't have authority to determine that really the policy in favor of rehabilitation was more important and therefore he should be given another chance. But where, as here, we have a collective bargaining agreement that gives the arbitrator very broad discretion to decide whether there is just cause in a particular case, we think the arbitrator would naturally look to public policy considerations, among others."

It seemed clear to us that if that provision had been adopted, the 90-day-plus suspension that was imposed here couldn't be said to violate public policy, and although it's not terribly clear from the Federal Register notice exactly why the Department declined to adopt that provision, it's very clear that the Department understood that the consequence of deleting that proposed rule was to leave to the contracting parties the determination whether reinstatement would occur even after a second positive test. That is the public policy as determined by the Department of Transportation. If there are no further questions --"

    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. I have just three very brief points. First, the lower courts did not address the questions we have been discussing this morning. They adopted the position that because this award was not illegal, the public policy exception does not apply. I understand the Solicitor General's representative to agree with us that that is an incorrect statement of the standard. At the very least, then, it seems appropriate to vacate the decision and send it back for the lower courts to at least apply the correct standard. Second, take no comfort in the certification of the substance abuse professional. My brother for the union said that he certifies that the employee successfully completed rehabilitation. That is not correct. All that the substance abuse professional certifies is that the employee properly followed the program, not that it worked, not that it was likely to work, and certainly not that the employee does not present a risk to the public, and also keep in mind that the professional obligation of the SAP is to the employee, not to the public safety. He could easily determine that it's best for this employee to be back on the job, even if that represents a threat to public safety. Finally, you can look through the regulations in excruciating detail. You will not find a provision addressing the problem of a recidivist. The Department may have considered some things. It didn't adopt them. It seems an awful lot of weight to place on the failure to adopt a provision to conclude that someone who violates these rules 20 times is to be treated exactly like someone who violates it one time. That is insufficient to protect public safety. What the regulations provide is that this issue, reinstatement, is left to contract. If it is left to contract, the public policy exception applies. In the reported cases alone, you will find examples of arbitrators ordering the reinstatement of nurses who prescribed the wrong medication and stood by while patients were dying, the helmsman of a 635-foot oil tanker who was on marijuana and ran it aground, the nuclear plant operator who diffused the safety system at the plant so he could leave early for lunch, and the pilot of a 727 who flew it while blind drunk. The public policy exception is needed for those types of cases, and we respectfully submit that the case of a driver of a 25-ton vehicle in West Virginia who has twice failed drug tests fits in that category. Thank you, Your Honor."
