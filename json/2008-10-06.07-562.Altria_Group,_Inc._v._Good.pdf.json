    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents' state law claims track nearly verbatim the Cigarette Labeling Act's pre-emption provision. For example, the complaint challenges promotions of light cigarettes as less harmful and safer to smokers than regular cigarettes. But the statute, Congress, explicitly preempted any requirement respecting the promotion of cigarettes based upon smoking and health. In short, the Respondents are seeking in state court precisely what Congress pre-empted. There is no space --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Mr. Olson, what if the state law claim did not require any inquiry into the relationship between smoking and health? Something along the lines of saying our studies show that light cigarettes are healthier for you, and in fact their studies show the opposite. So all you, all the plaintiff would have to show is that there was a deception, a disconnect between the studies and the ad. It wouldn't matter whether light cigarettes were healthier or not healthier. Is that the type of action that could be brought?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, I think the facts could differ from case to case, Mr. Chief Justice. But the inquiry is going to be generally, I think, simple: Is there a requirement? Is it based upon smoking and health, and does it appear in an advertising or promotion of a cigarette. Now, I suppose there might be conceivably circumstances where it's impossible to tell that the requirement is not connected in some way with smoking and health, but it's certainly clear here. The complaint specifically talks in terms of promoting cigarettes, purporting to be less harmful or safer, despite serious health problems associated with smoking. These appear at the beginning in paragraph 2 of the amended complaint which is at pages, beginning Joint Appendix pages 26 through 28. I invite the Court's attention to paragraph 2 of the amended complaint and paragraphs 15 and 18 of the amended complaint. In fact, the words \"promotion,\" \"cigarettes,\" \"smoking,\" \"safety,\" and \"health,\" the very words that appear in the Labeling Act statute, appear, I counted at least 12 times in the amended complaint."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Is it a question of just how you phrase it, Mr. Olson? Is there any scope -- does your argument leave any scope for attorney general, state attorney general imposition of state law remedies against a deceptive practice involving advertising cigarettes. To give you concrete examples, suppose a state attorney general said in every - suppose the practice were in every carton of cigarettes the cigarette manufacturer includes an insert that says: If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes; if you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes. And the state attorney general goes after that statement in the carton as false and deceptive advertising. Would there be any scope for that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "I think that there is. In answer to the general question that you ask, Justice Gins burg, there is plenty of room for an attorney general to pursue deceptive advertising. Another example -- and I'll come to the one you mentioned -- is that someone might misrepresent the number of cigarettes in a package or other things having to do with cigarettes. That would not necessarily be related to smoking and health. So there is not a pre-emption if there is not a relationship between the prohibition and smoking and health. The example you gave might require some sort of inquiry as to what is motivating the attorney general. The motivation is what you referred to, your Court referred to in the Reilly case and I would say --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Mr. Olson, doesn't your answer in effect, in practical terms, exclude the possibility of inserts like that? I mean, what else would they be addressing except smoking and health? That's the only subject on the table."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "I think that's probably true in most cases, Justice Souter, that the reason why there might be regulations at the State level having to do with cigarettes and advertising by and large is going to have to do with smoking and health. The Court went through the same inquiry in the Reilly case where it had to do with billboards and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "So your answer then to my specific example would be the attorney general could not go after such a statement, \"If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes\"?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "If -- if the courts were to conclude that it had a relationship with smoking and health, the answer is yes, Justice Ginsburg, but there might be some case in which someone said, well, the issue about nicotine and content of nicotine is being regulated because it doesn't have anything to do with smoking and health, but in the environment in which this -- this statute was passed and this litigation was pursued, there certainly isn't any question here. Now, I think Justice Stevens, even in his dissenting opinion in the Reilly case, focused on the content. He said and the -- your dissenting opinion in that case said, as opposed to location, that the Labeling Act was focusing on the content of advertising."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, there could be -- the States may regulate the sale of items. The Labeling Act provision only relates to promotion, marketing, advertising, and that sort of thing. The State can prohibit the sale of cigarettes. States and municipalities have done that sort of thing. This statute has three provisions in it: Is what the State is attempting to do a requirement or prohibition. There's no question that that's involved here. Does it have to do with the advertising or promotion of cigarettes? There's no question that this complaint is aimed at the advertising and promotion of cigarettes. And does the advertising or promotion have to do with smoking and health?"

And let me say with respect to the Cipollone plurality opinion, which was found to be baffling, confusing, litigation- generating, easily abated by the labeling of the complaint, and superseded by a number of subsequent decisions by this Court, it should be set aside and restated. However, the very case that the Cipollone decision in the plurality did decide was pre-empted even under that plurality opinion, and this is at page 527 of the opinion, is an advertising that purported to neutralize, minimize, down-play, negate, or disclaim the warning label on the packages. This complaint is precisely that claim. You could probably not have written a claim more squarely --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Excuse me. The reason I think the plurality wrote this, I'm guessing, is that when you read through this statute it seems as if what Congress had in mind in the statute was not setting aside State law, which is tradition, about not making false statements, false and deceptive advertising law. It was concerned with a different thing. They said, to the cigarette companies: You have to put on the label \"Smoking is dangerous to your health.\" We don't want States telling you to put other things like that on the label, and we don't want States forbidding you to put a picture of the Marlboro man or Lauren Bacall with her cigarette. We don't want States to tell you that you can't do that. That would be focused on the object of the statute, which no one said had as its objective setting aside traditional unfair and deceptive advertising law. I think that's the argument."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "That is the argument, and the Respondents are making that argument. I submit that that argument is squarely answered by the text of the statute, which this Court has said again and again you have to turn to. The text of the statute says no requirement or prohibition; it doesn't say no requirement or prohibition except one which is expressly misleading. And the reason you mentioned, Justice Breyer, what was the background for the statute or what was Congress intending to do, well, fortunately on section 1331 of the Labeling Act, which is on 1A of the blue brief, Congress declares its policy and purpose squarely, unequivocally, and in what this Court said in Reilly was sweeping language: Any relationship between smoking and health. And then Congress went on to point out that with the labeling requirements, it intended for consumers to receive certain information about the smoking of cigarettes with specific labels, and then went on to say, without hurting the commerce and the national economy to be protected from confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations that might be \"non-uniform, confusing, or diverse.\" Now, Justice Stevens again in the Reilly opinion when he was distinguishing in his concurring opinion -- I can't recall whether it's a concurring or dissenting opinion -- focused on the fact that different requirements by different States might cause those very diverse, confusing advertising. If one State says, you've got to put something else in there about this; one State says that so-called descriptors are misleading, as was the case under this case, and another State says, like Illinois said in another case, that they are not misleading; that national advertising becomes impossible. That's inconsistent and Congress expressed what its policy was. And, Justice Breyer, the Court went through the same process in the Morales case and the Wolens case in connection with airline and deregulation and whether or not misleading advertising might be expressly pre-empted. The Court went through the same sort of process in the Riegel case with respect to medical devices. The Court went through the same process in the Rowe case, decided on the same day as Riegel in connection with another context. And again, with respect to the Reilly case, the Court --"

    "speech": "But the prohibition you're talking about is in 13 -- in your express pre-emption argument -- 1334(b). And I was just going to ask you, is a State requirement prohibiting false statements about smoking and health a requirement based on smoking and health?"

  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, the statute contains the words both \"requirement\" and \"prohibition.\" And in your plurality opinion in Cipollone on page 527, the same page I mentioned before, you made the point that a prohibition is merely the converse of a requirement. And either a prohibition or a requirement with respect to advertising if it relates to smoking and health is pre-empted."

  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Yes. And to the extent -- no, we are not saying that the Massachusetts unfair- practices statute is preempted in all respects. It's only when the statute, like a common law tort provision which the Court considered in Riegel, has application to the context of smoking and health. If the Court starts with the Morales case through the Wolens case, through the Bates case, through the Riegel case, through the Reilly case, it's the application of the statute in the Reilly case. It was a -- it was a statute of Massachusetts very much identical, virtually identical, to the Maine statute here. And in the -- in the Reilly case the attorney general was attempting to apply the generalized, unfair-practice statute to the advertising of smoking and cigarettes near schools. This is a similar statute, which is attempted to be applied in the context of these labels and the advertising of cigarettes. It's the application of a generalized statute. This Court repeatedly said, and specifically said in the Riegel case, there is hardly any common law requirements which are requirements, the Court has repeatedly held -- and the Respondents don't dispute that; they specifically acknowledge it -- when it's the application of a general standard to the circumstances of the case. That's where the pre-emption occurs. Congress didn't want to pre-empt general common law standards about fraud or misrepresentation or anything like that except in the context of the marketing --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Well, why -- why would Congress -- I mean the difficulty that the other side raises here is just what Cipollone said. I can understand totally why Congress would not want 50 States telling cigarette companies what to say about health and smoking or taking off pictures of the Marlboro ad. I can understand that. What I can't understand is why Congress would want to get rid of, in this area, the traditional rule that advertising has to tell the truth. Now, what you said was you could end up with different applications of that in different States. Of course, every national advertiser faces that situation at the moment. Everyone who advertises across the nation could find deceptive -- anti-deception laws differently administered in different States. Yet, they'd survive. There is no evidence even that there is a problem. So why would Congress want to get rid of that particular statute?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, the Court -- and this Court recently in Aetna v. Davila specifically said that pre-emption can't be decided based upon the label that the plaintiff puts in the complaint. Now, as I think every member of this Court would know, a creative plaintiff's lawyer can call a claim misrepresentation, willful misrepresentation, concealment, failure to warn, and so on and so forth. It's just a matter of how they change the label on the complaint. Now, what Congress didn't want -- and I just gave an example of a situation where Illinois decided that the descriptors, which are an issue in this case were not misleading; and it was not -- and they could continue to be used. What happened in this case in applying the Maine statute is a court decided that they were misleading and -- and couldn't be used."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",

In fact, the panoply of this Court's decisions say that it doesn't matter whether it's a statute -- a generalized statute that's being applied or a common law standard that's being applied, and it does not matter whether it's an attorney general interpreting and enforcing general provisions -- I give you Morales and the Wolens situation -- or it's whether it's a common law tort action being brought by a plaintiff to submit a case to a jury a la Riegel."

But I have -- hasten to say, as I did at the beginning, because some parties entered into that master settlement agreement I don't think changes the Federal -- the congressional intent is very clear. It wanted the -- the statement -- Congress wanted the statements, certain statements, on cigarette packages. It didn't want any confusion about what the marketing or promotion of cigarettes would be. I can't imagine, Justice Ginsburg, a clearer statement. It says no requirement or prohibition in section 1334(b). And in 1331 it says \"comprehensive Federal programs that deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and health.\""

And that line of reasoning is this: You agree -- everybody agrees -- that the FTC can represent -- it can regulate advertising and -- and supposed deception on matters that do affect -- relate to smoking and health. It is pretty much hornbook law at this stage of the game that the -- that the FTC's regulation of deceptive advertising does not exclude State regulation of deceptive advertising as a general proposition. In fact, the FTC is very happy to have complementary State regimes. That state of the law is just as clear. It is at least as clear as you say the language is here. Now, given the fact that the FTC can regulate advertising of cigarettes in -- in the -- in the respect that matters here, why don't we have to give some recognition to this complementary regime of State regulation, which, as a general proposition, survives it?"

The general principle that I'm making that I think Congress understands, and this Court has clearly understood, is that there is a background principle that the Federal Government is not pre-empting deceptive practice regulations except when Congress specifically says so. Now, one more point because I think the white light will come on: the United States Government did not address in this case the express pre-emption argument. But a few years ago, in the Reilly case, having to do with the very same statute, the Cigarette Labeling Act, the United States Government said that the labeling act pre-empted State laws concerning the content of cigarette advertising, the content of cigarette advertising. That's what the government said then and the Acting Solicitor General during the argument in that case, in response to a question by one of your members of this Court, specifically said the -- the statute would pre-empt State laws about filters or the safety of a particular cigarette. That was the position of the United States Government a couple of years ago and they have not changed. Mr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve the balance of my time."

And Congress said, we will wipe away the prospect of state imposing warnings by having a congressionally mandated warning on the cigarette packs and in cigarette advertising. The Congress said nothing about having anti-deception laws be displaced by States. So that in, in the hair hypo that you gave, I think Mr. Olson would have to acknowledge that the cigarette companies were not asking at the time of the '69 Labeling Act to be free of anti-deception laws.

The Kessler order does address the deception by lights and low tar, and the reason is temporal. When the master settlement agreement was entered into in the late '90s, the tobacco companies had not yet acknowledged publicly that they had been engaged in deception with respect to studies regarding low tar and light cigarette. That came to light in 2002, and as a result of the discovery that occurred in the government's case and in State cases, the studies that the cigarette companies knew for decades that there was no difference in the yield for low tar and light cigarettes came to light. And so, the master settlement agreement was not -- it had certain provisions about the way cigarettes could be marketed but -- but the Judge Kessler opinion, in the government's RICO case, actually makes findings of fact on this score. And the complaint here essentially tracks the allegations in the government's. All we seek to do is to provide a remedy to consumers that have been defrauded by Philip Morris over these many decades."

In an injunctive situation, adjudicatory facts can evolve. A company can come forward and say the facts have changed, circumstances have changed, please modify the injunction.

That was not believed at the time that the Commission issued its guidance back in 1966 and '67 to present a significant problem. But it is evident now. The scientific community indicates and certainly the findings of fact in the RICO case are that the -- that the tobacco companies have known since 1967 that in fact compensation is nearly complete, and for that reason, the tar and nicotine yields via the Cambridge test method are not indicative of the yield to a true human smoker.

In 1978, the Commission issued a notice requesting comment about whether lip drape in fact occluded the holes that dilute the concentration of the air, and the tobacco companies did not respond to that, even though they had their own studies showing that it was a problem. So it is -- it is true that the Commission has only now issued the notice proposing to withdraw its earlier guidance; but the Petitioners themselves should not be able to benefit from their own misleading of the Commission. But again, I think it's more fundamental than that, is that their arguments rely upon a misconception of what the Commission does. As Justice Souter noted, it is Supreme Court law the Commission does not supplant State law; it acts cooperatively with State law. The Commission does not act as a gatekeeper like FDA in approving things. It acts as a law enforcement agency. It goes after fraud when it is aware of it. But that is not to the exclusion of State law enforcement agencies or other Federal law enforcement agencies."

As far as you know, is the government's position still the same, the position that you delicately did not bring to our attention?"

Now, first of all, with respect to what the Solicitor General on behalf of the United States says, and this is in response to the point that Justice Scalia was just addressing -- page 1 of the Reilly brief, the Attorney General is responsible for enforcing the Labeling Act. So it is the government's responsibility, according to them, to enforce the Labeling Act. Then on pages 8 and 9 of their brief, distinguishing between the location of the billboards in that case and other things that would be pre-empted, pages 8 and 9, the Government said the Labeling Act preempts State laws concerning the content of cigarette advertising with respect to smoking and health. And the Acting Solicitor General on page 25 of the transcript of the argument that day in this case was asked that question, what is pre-empted? And she said it pre-empts State law claims about filters or the safety of a particular cigarette. That is this case."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "That's the government's position. Now, if that's their position, isn't it just one additional step to say depending on what the history of the statute is, that it pre-empts regulations about content that don't have to do with lying about the content?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "It has to do according to what Congress said about the content of the advertising and the promotion of cigarettes; that's what this case is about when it has to do with smoking and health. Now, my opponent seems to run away, in answer to your question, about what if we take out smoking and health from their complaint? Well, they can't take out smoking. That is everywhere in the complaint. I asked the Court to sit down and compare the labeling statute with the complaint. And the words are indistinguishable, and they say over and over again and on page 4A of -- then Mr. Frederick's saying well, all they want is economic damages. They are really not -- they are just concerned about they got one cigarette and they wanted to get another cigarette. Page 4A, this is the way the Court of Appeals understood it. This is page 4A of the petition appendix: the plaintiffs explain that the relative levels of these substances bear on a reasonable consumer's decision on which cigarette to purchase, because consumers understand that reducing the quantities of tar and nicotine in cigarettes reduces their adverse health effects. That is what this case is all about. Now, I will just conclude in this way. The statute in the language of this Court in the Reilly case, uses \"sweeping language.\" The language is every bit as sweeping as the language in the airline deregulation act that uses the phrase relates to, I submit. So there is three requirements. Either -- the statute prohibits, any and it uses the phrase \"any,\" you can't get more expansive than that; and it uses the word \"no\" requirements or prohibition. The Court has dealt with requirements and prohibition in Reilly, Cipollone, Bates, Wolens, Riegel. The statute that we are talking about here in this case is the same statute essentially that it was dealing with in Reilly. It's the State Unfair Practices Act. It was Massachusetts/Maine; but I compared the statutes side by side. They essentially the same. Is the requirement based upon smoking and health? Well, the complaint specifically says so. The relief is based upon the relationship between smoking and health and is it in promotion or advertising of tobacco? Again, they've said that over and over again. I submit that the statute could not be more clear. This particular complaint seeks to impose a regulation --"

However, Justice Stevens, I believe when you talked about in that -- the plurality opinion, you talked about minimizing, reducing, negating the effect of the warning labels. That's also this complaint. This as a complaint is identical so what you were referring to on page 527 of Cipollone."
