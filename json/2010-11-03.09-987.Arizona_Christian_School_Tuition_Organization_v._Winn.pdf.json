    "speaker": "KATYAL",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For 13 years, Arizona has permitted private citizens to contribute money to private organizations set up by private individuals and has let those organizations use that money towards scholarships when individuals apply for them. The Ninth Circuit erred first in finding that the taxpayer plaintiffs had standing, and second in striking the program down. On standing, this lawsuit fails each of the three necessary elements. Regarding injury in fact, the key point is this: Not a cent of the Respondents' money goes to fund religion. If you placed an electronic tag to track and monitor each cent that the Respondent plaintiffs pay in tax, not a cent, not a fraction of a cent, would go into any religious school's coffers."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Mr. Katyal, their point is that this tax money does belong to the State that the private individuals are using, because it is money that, even by the new amendment, says either you pay it to the State or you use it for this purpose, but it's the State's money, and it's giving you by its largesse the right to redirect it. That's their argument."

  {
    "speaker": "KATYAL",
    "speech": "There are two problems with that. One has to do with injury in fact. The other has to do with redressability. With respect to injury in fact, our point is, as you track the taxpayers' dollars, it doesn't actually fund any religious program, unlike the -- unlike Flast and other cases in which this Court has considered taxpayer standing for religion. Their complaint is not that the government is spending money that the taxpayers has been -- money that has been extracted and spent of the taxpayers. Their complaint is that someone else's money is not being extracted and spent enough. And the relevant language in Flast says that for taxpayer standing to occur, that, quote, \"his tax money\" must be extracted and spent, and here that's not occurring. Now, with respect to the other argument, not injury in fact, but addressability and causation, our point is this: It's speculative as to whether or not that chain of events that you spelled out, Justice Sotomayor, would actually happen. As this Court said in Cuno, for example, when a tax credit is given, sometimes that actually reduces the amount of money the government has to spend. It doesn't increase it. And so that's different than the direct outlay that was at issue in Flast."

Here's what the system will be: The taxpayers who are religious will be able to check a box, and the check that they send to the IRS -- it's a possible system -- what happens is that that check is cashed by an official, and the cash is given to the local priest to say prayers for the individual who contributed the money. And, in your view, there is no one who could challenge that?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATYAL",
    "speech": "Well, I don't see that in Flast, Justice Ginsburg, but be that as it may, I think this Court in Valley Forge was very clear to say that if, at the end of the day, you can't find a plaintiff with standing, that is not an excuse to relax the -- our general requirements of Article III standing. And here, if you granted the plaintiffs standing, what you would be granting is, for the first time, a -- a tax credit which is a complaint about someone else's money not being spent to a high enough level."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",

That the Court was without authority to decide any of those cases, but that somehow nobody on the Court recognized that fact, nor did the SG recognize that fact. The SG participated, I believe, in each of those cases."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATYAL",
    "speech": "Right. So let me say two things about that. First is, I do think it's very much just like Frothingham, in which Frothingham had to deal with this exact problem. The Court had conferred standing in taxpayer standing case after taxpayer standing case, and then, when it was teed up and presented to the Court as a question about Article III standing, the Court said: No, we shouldn't have granted taxpayer standing in those cases. So my answer to you is yes. Now, I do think that this Court's decision in Hein, I think, reiterated some of the fundamental principles and the limits on Flast. And I think the Court -- the plurality made quite clear that it would go no further than the facts of Flast. And to grant standing here, you have to go -- tremendously depart from what Flast is about: a direct government outlay of funds out of -- taking money out of someone's pocket to fund religion."

  {
    "speaker": "KATYAL",
    "speech": "The first footnote in the brief, Justice Ginsburg, acknowledged the fact that standing hadn't been pushed or pressed below. But I acknowledge that, particularly in the wake of Hein, should another case arise, the Government will -- will acknowledge the standing defects and brief them as we are here. Our point on redressability is not simply that the -- that the tax -- that the cost of the program is speculative. It's also that the relief that the plaintiffs are seeking in this case won't redress their problem. That is, if you gave the plaintiffs everything they're asking for, the very same religious schools and the very same religious STOs would continue to be funded. The very same religious STOs would continue to be funded because they would leave in place -- and this was my answer to Justice Breyer -- the tax deduction, the 501(c)(3) tax deduction. And so there would still be government revenue being spent in favor of these religious STOs under their program. It would just be at the level of one-third instead of 100 percent. I don't think that satisfies their problem. I don't think James Madison 's remonstrance would be satisfied if they were -- if Madison were told: Well, you're not going to be taxed three pence; you'll be taxed one pence. The principle is what matters, the principle of Flast. If I could reserve the balance of my time."

    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Arizona's tuition tax credit does not violate the Establishment Clause, because it's a neutral law that results in scholarship programs of private choice. It's neutral because, like the tax deduction that the Court upheld in Mueller, it's one of many tax-saving devices, including some 26 other credits that are available to Arizona taxpayers on a neutral basis."

Could you tell me why Arizona adopted this sort of scheme rather than the more typical tuition voucher scheme? In other tuition voucher schemes, the State just gives the -- the voucher or scholarship or what have you. This is so much more complicated and complex and unusual. And it just left me wondering why it was chosen, or what the State thinks the advantages are of it now?"

    "speech": "Well, what the record shows is that there have been -- there's a large amount of contributions. There is $55 million. It doesn't -- we have Arizona Department of Revenue reports that list the number of contributors and who contributes -- or not the individuals who contribute.

The -- the programs are programs of private choice, because any aid that reaches religious schools does so after -- only after at least four levels of private decisionmaking. Arizona sets up the neutral rules for the -- this tax credit, and after that, private individuals and organizations take over. Anyone can form a school tuition organization, and the increase in the number and diversity of school tuition organizations over the 13 years that the tax credit has been in existence demonstrates, in fact, that -- that this is free for everyone to participate in."

Under -- under Respondents' theory, any money that the government doesn't take in would then be the equivalent of State money, and that would then undermine 501(c)(3) corporations and all kinds of charitable organizations. What you need to look at in -- when Arizona decided to give a tax credit for this is it was thinking is this a worthy public purpose to not take in certain money that -- that the State would normally be entitled to if they give contributions to that purpose. So, it's not a question -- and that -­ that type of purpose has been upheld by this Court in Walz, in Hernandez. And there, again -- there is not a basis for distinguishing here between what Arizona is doing and other 501(c)(3) organizations that have for years been able to enjoy the benefits of -- of tax savings, tax benefits, and help give scholarships to religious organizations."

You can't keep it. It's not that all of your money is the government's money; it's that this $5,000 that you owe the government as income taxes is the government's money."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BENDER",
    "speech": "The difference is -- that -- to me, the broad difference is that the tax deduction is given for charitable contributions. And I think the Court would decide if it faced the question -- I don't think it's ever had to -- that it is constitutional for the government to support private charity. And if the government is going to support private charity by letting you deduct charitable contributions, it can't leave religious charities out of that program. That would violate the Establishment Clause. So if you believe that the charitable deduction in the Federal income tax is a constitutional thing for the government to do, to support private charity by picking up part of the tab -- that's true when there's a deduction -- then you have to give the deduction to people who contribute to religion. So, yes, there is a government support for that private charitable contribution, but it's a charitable contribution. The money in this case is not a charitable contribution. Mr. Katyal says that it's not the government's money. Whose money is it? Is it the taxpayer's money who gives the $1,000 contribution? No. If you don't take my word for it, look at what the STOs say on their Web sites about this program. One of them says quite frankly: Hey, you can give charity with someone else's money; it's a miracle. Another one says: It won't cost you anything; you can give charity with other people's money."

You can't set up a program that gives you a deduction for giving to educational institutions but not to -- not to a religious organization. That would be unconstitutional.

He could take a vacation. He could give it to a charity. He could -­ he could buy clothes with it. He could buy food with it. It's a completely open system. Nobody tells the taxpayer what he has to do. In this case, when the taxpayer writes that check to the STO, the taxpayer can't keep that money, can't use it on a vacation, can't use it for buying food, has to either pay it to the State or, with the State's authorization, pay it to an STO."

And it's just Property Clause, Tax and Spending Clause, it doesn't really matter; it's the bottom line on the treasury. And this Court said no, that isn't the case."

    "speaker": "KATYAL",
    "speech": "I disagree on two levels. First is I don't think that's what Flast is. I think Flast is about that micro-fraction of a cent that is coming from your pocket and being used to fund religion. And that's what Madison complained about. It may be very small; it may be 3 pence. But there's a special harm of conscience when it's your money, your hard-earned money, being used to fund a program directly as to which you don't like."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "Flast talked about a nexus in the way that Justice Breyer said. And here, there's a taxpayer challenging a provision of the tax code, enacted pursuant to the tax and spending power, that -­ that grants a tax benefit. That's as close a nexus as you are going to get using the language of Flast."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KATYAL",
    "speech": "Again, I think that doesn't deal with the direct injury on the taxpayer, which is the language of Flast. Even if we -- even if you disagree with me, the relief -- the harm here is a lot more speculative, just like Cuno, because you have to posit, in order for the harm to exist to this taxpayer, that tax credits will cost the government money, not save it, that his tax burden will go up as opposed to someone else's tax burden, a corporation and the like, or you have to posit that the government won't cut spending in order to make up the shortfall in revenues that he says is going to exist. You're going to have to do all of those things, none of which you have to do in a Flast situation because it's just a direct outlay of funds. If I could just can spend a moment on Justice Kennedy's question about State action, which, of course, they didn't advance below as the Ninth Circuit said. I think this Court's precedents are quite clear in saying that the fact that the government regulates or funds something doesn't transform it into a State actor. If it did, then all 501(c)(3)'s would become State actors, and that, I think, would be an enormously damaging precedent for this Court to follow. Rather, I think what Blum says is that it requires the performance of a traditional executive prerogative -- traditional government prerogative. And here all the STO is doing is just funding -- it's handing out money. It is doing so on a neutral basis. Anyone can form an STO, and anyone can fund one."
