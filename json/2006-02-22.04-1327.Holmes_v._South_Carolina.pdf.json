      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: In this case, the South Carolina Supreme Court took the second of two recent steps that dramatically curtail a defendant's ability to create a reasonable doubt as to his innocence by presenting evidence that another individual committed the crime. The first step came in 2001 when, in State v. Gay, the court held that the admissibility of third party guilt evidence was dependent on the strength of the prosecution's case. The second step, which occurred in Mr. Holmes' case, holds that third party guilt evidence is inadmissible whenever the prosecution has presented strong forensic evidence of the defendant's guilt."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Now, there's some dispute as to whether that -- that is really what -- what it held. And there's a big difference. If -- if you just say whenever you -- whenever the prosecution has a strong case, you can't introduce other guilt, or whether all that the court is saying is that one of the elements that you consider in determining whether to admit this -- this third party is not just -- it's the comparative weakness of the third party case. You don't blind yourself to -- to the strength of the prosecution's case. Will you say it was bad even if it was the latter that the court was -- was referring to? Are you saying you cannot consider the strength of the prosecution's case at all in determining whether to allow in third party guilt evidence?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUME",
      "speech": "Yes, Justice Scalia, I am. It's not necessary for a ruling in our favor in this case. It's not contingent here because at a minimum, the South Carolina Supreme Court rule here in describing it, they said in State v. Gay we held that in cases where there is strong evidence of guilt, including strong forensic evidence, evidence that a third party committed the crime is not admissible. That is a categorical rule of exclusion no matter how you cut it. But even if you deemed that there is some discretion left in the system, it is still unconstitutional because what the South Carolina system requires is a reasoning backwards, that the admissibility of evidence of the defendant's innocence is conditioned on the judge's assessment of the likelihood of the defendant's guilt."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
      "speech": "Well, I -- I suppose that in a purely discretionary system -- I -- I can't quite think of the hypothetical -- the strength of the prosecution's case may bear on the assessment of relevance and materiality as to the evidence the defense wants to introduce. If -- if the evidence of identification is -- is quite clear -- is quite clear -- and then there's some witness of marginal credibility that says he was in another city, I think that may affect the trial court's balance. I -- I take the thrust of your point, that the strength of the case makes it more important to introduce the third party evidence, not -- not less. I -- I take that point. But just as -- as an absolute rule, I'm not sure that the strength of the case is always irrelevant. That's what I'm saying."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUME",
      "speech": "I think that it is possible that under some circumstances not the strength of the State's case but the evidence as a whole may shed some light on whether the third party guilt evidence is relevant. For example, if the uncontested evidence is the crime occurred on Tuesday, January 3rd, and the third party guilt evidence shows that the third party was in Acapulco on January 3rd and had no possibility to be there, that's not a strength issue. That is relevance. But when the touchstone for admissibility is whether the defense evidence overcomes the prosecution's case -- and in the South Carolina rule for -- just to be clear, it's not even considered that you consider the evidence of guilt. The defense evidence of third party guilt has to overcome the prosecution's forensic evidence."

That's true of 60 percent or so of all chain of custody cases, and that is not sufficient to overcome what it shows.

And even they admitted that due to the very small amount of DNA that was recovered, that Officer Mobley's actions could have been the source of the DNA on the clothing. In addition to that, there were a number of other suspicious activities, including Officer Mobley locked everyone else out before he inventoried, processed the scene. And then there were problems with contamination there. And then at the bottom -- at the end of the day, the defense presented a DNA expert, the only non- forensic scientist, but the most qualified scientist in the case from the New York University Medical School, and he said, look, this DNA doesn't mean anything. There are things that science cannot explain. There are dye globs here which should not be present. There's also a spike that does not belong to Mr. Holmes or --"

      "speech": "Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I don't find that surprising at all, given the facts of this case. It's, you know, seek and ye shall find, or don't seek and ye shall not find. In this case, they took none of Jimmy White's clothing to test to see if there was any incriminating DNA on that. They didn't take his shoes, even though they had the shoe print. This was not a case in which the DNA pointed to a single perpetrator. There were no vaginal swabs or rectal swabs which contained any information of any value whatsoever. And by the time they finally got around to doing the DNA testing in 1996, numerous items of clothing, including several items belonging to the victim, had disappeared and no one could explain where they had went. So the fact that they didn't find Jimmy White's DNA on Bobby Holmes' clothing I think is of no significance whatsoever. The main -- one of the main thrusts of the defense case here was because of the incompetence or the malfeasance of the police officers in this case, that the evidence against Holmes was unreliable."

I -- I worry about criminal trials turning into circuses in which -- in -- in which the police are put on trial, which is part of what is happening here and what has happened in -- in a famous recent American case. I worry that -- that that will be the -- the result if -- if we take your suggestion, which is to prescind from any consideration of the strength of the prosecution's case and simply look at the -- at the alleged third party guilt evidence on its own without -- without any consideration of its relative -- its relative strength.

When I read that, it said -- I thought to myself it sounds as though they are saying he must present evidence or make a showing, a preliminary showing, that it is more probable than not that he is innocent despite the State's evidence. But they never spell that out, and is it spelled out anywhere?"

      "speaker": "BLUME",

But I think if you read the sentence before that in the opinion where it says -- they describe the Gregory rule, which was the old rule, with which we have no quarrel. The rules are similar to that in other jurisdictions. It says, further, we held in State v. Gay that in cases where there is strong evidence of guilt, especially forensic evidence, evidence of third party guilt simply is not admissible."
    },

Now, how can you tell whether it raises a reasonable inference in a vacuum without regard to the evidence on the other side? If the evidence on the other side is -- I understand you dispute it in this case, but let's say unobjectionable DNA evidence that your client was the person there, and his third party guilt evidence is it wasn't me. How can you tell whether that creates a reasonable inference or not without looking at what's on the other side?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUME",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

If your claim of innocence is, as it may be in this case, that the DNA evidence doesn't show what you think it shows, fine, that evidence comes in. If the evidence you're trying to get in is somebody in the jailhouse said he heard that somebody else did it, and the -- and you don't challenge the DNA evidence that places your client there, then maybe that doesn't create a reasonable inference, while it might in a different case, depending on the nature of the prosecution's evidence."

Footnote 8 in the opinion makes clear that in establishing whether the third party guilt evidence overcomes the State's evidence, you look only at the State's evidence, and the defendant's counter forensic evidence is deemed irrelevant. So you have to overcome it with a stacked deck."

That is -- that is putting the judge in the role of the jury, and that's what the South --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
      "speech": "Yes, but the State doesn't go that far. If it doesn't require the defendant to persuade the judge of the defendant's likely innocence, then there's no constitutional violation. If the -- if the rule of State law simply requires a consideration of the strength of the prosecution evidence in relation to the defense evidence, that's -- that's all right?"

    {
      "speaker": "BLUME",
      "speech": "I think it depends what consideration means. Consideration, for example, in terms of is the third party guilt evidence relevant in some way, that is not constitutionally objectionable. But when you have a weighing procedure like South Carolina does and the admissibility of the evidence of innocence depends on a judge's assessment of the credibility of the defendant's case and the prosecution's case, that is what juries do."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

If it's -- if the rule is that the defendant has to raise a reasonable inference of innocence and you take into account the strength of a prosecution's case in making that determination, you don't just accept the defense evidence and -- and see whether -- how -- how strong an inference of innocence it would raise if it's believed. I mean, where is the line?"

      "speech": "What if the -- what if the court says, we will weigh it to the extent of determining whether, in light of the State's case, the proffered evidence, if accepted, would pass the laugh test? That's weighing. Is -- is that -- is that legitimate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUME",
      "speech": "I think that that is problematic. And -- but the -- the point I think is no other State does it. Now, they would -- if it didn't pass the laugh test, it wouldn't pass the laugh test on its own terms. If you read the cases of exclusion, it's where the defendant wanted to present evidence that some dude named Duke that nobody can find had a motive to kill the person. And the courts say, well, no, you can't do that. Or the -- someone is on trial and they want to prove that the -- for killing a man's wife, and they want to show, well, the husband had $1 million in life insurance policy. And courts said, no, you can't do that. If all you've got is motive, if all you've got is propensity, if all you've got is opportunity, that's not in this -- they're -- in all the other 49 States, they're looking at it on their own terms. Nothing this Court will do in Mr. Holmes' case will disturb the law in the other 49 jurisdictions."

You can't say that the -- I don't think you can say that the existence of the million dollars in life insurance is irrelevant. It's just that it doesn't prove much unless it can be combined with certain other kinds of evidence. And when you say you've got a standard that looks into that, then you have crossed the line from mere relevance to probative force, haven't you?"

Then they also -- many of them have -- they articulate it different ways, but it's basically relevance with a 403 type of exclusion, that if the evidence doesn't meet the third party guilt evidence on its own terms, doesn't meet a certain quantum, back -- doesn't get over the laugh test, then it's not admissible. Other States do it and they say, well, it's got to create a reasonable inference of innocence. That's fine. Or it must create a reasonable likelihood about the defendant's guilt. That's fine too."

You -- you think the two have to be treated the same."

      "speaker": "BLUME",
      "speech": "Yes, well, I do for the following reason. The -- that case may make it an easy call, but it's still the jury's call, just for the same reason that a judge couldn't, in a very strong case like that, say, I'm not allowing the defendant's alibi witnesses to testify."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "But that's the -- that's the problem. That's why this is a special category of evidence. It's not any evidence. It's third party guilt evidence because that's evidence that any defendant could try to introduce in any case. In any case, the defendant can say somebody else did it and compile whatever kind of evidence he can get, whether it's jailhouse informants or -- or whatever, where the person who did it was often somebody who's just recently died and -- and is not there to present an alibi of his own. In every case the defendant can come up with this evidence, and so you have a special rule that's designed to deal with that. And all, it seems to me, that the State court decision is saying, when you look at the prosecution's case, is if -- if the prosecution's case makes that an -- unreasonable under the Gregory test that you agree with, the reasonable inference, if it's unreasonable to suggest that somebody else did it, doesn't mean that you're guilty. You may have all sorts of other claims that you can make, but you just don't get to present that type of evidence because of the susceptibility of prejudice and the susceptibility of fraud and all that kind of stuff."

Or the government's case may have some bearing -- not the strength of it -- on whether the third party guilt evidence is relevant to some, you know, issue in the trial. But it also would have some significance on the back end if a judge excluded it in determining whether any error was harmless or not. And that's traditionally the place on appeal where you consider the strength of the government's case. There's no other category of evidence in our system where we take into account the overall strength of the case to admit it. If that were true, then why don't we allow judges to direct verdicts? Why don't we allow judges to exclude defendant's testimony? Look, the government's evidence is strong. The DNA evidence here is overwhelming. Anything this defendant says, when he gets up there, is going to be a lie. I'm not allowing it. We don't do that. Juries in our system make credibility determinations and that's what the rule, which requires you to -- where you have to weigh the defendant's evidence against the government's evidence, usurps the function of the jury. Finally, in this case the -- there is a contention that the error was harmless, and I wanted to briefly respond to that. Now -- and then if the Court has no further questions, I will save the remainder of -- of my time for rebuttal. But there are three principal reasons the error in this case was harmless.

It is wrong in that it ignores that even that agent admitted that the DNA could have been produced through the contamination of Officer Mobley, through his -- through the bags. So that could explain the results. And it also ignores the fact -- the footnote does -- that a defense expert, Dr. Peter D'Eustachio said that that's not a fair and accurate representation. In my opinion, in my expert opinion, there -- you cannot do any DNA calculations on this. These charts are completely unreliable. So that's all it is, and it's -- it has, I think, no significance here in light of the evidence as a whole. It's a factually inaccurate statement of the record as a whole. But in addition to the evidence, the most -- a very significant factor in determining whether this error was harmless or not is having succeeded in convincing the trial judge to exclude the evidence, the prosecutor in his closing argument said, look, they've indicated that this evidence was planted. They've indicated this evidence was contaminated. If Bobby Holmes didn't do it, who is -- where is the raping, murdering thing that did? So he took complete and unfair advantage of the absence of evidence in the trial court's ruling in securing the conviction here. And this Court has said on a number of other occasions, in Satterwhite and Clemons, that a prosecutor's argument is an important factor in determining whether an error was harmless. And finally --"

This Court has said that on a number of occasions, that what is in the argument is a factor in harmless error. And then finally, excluding -- not allowing the evidence deprived Mr. Holmes of presenting an alternative counter-theory. You can see a jury saying, well, you know, we've heard all this. This is a bunch of contesting evidence, but almost asking the questions the prosecutor did, which certainly they would have asked after it was, well, you're right. We didn't hear any evidence of that. Bobby Holmes had a powerful counter-story. He should have been allowed to tell it. The South Carolina rule is unconstitutional. The judgment should be reversed."

I took that to mean doesn't tend to show that the appellant is innocent. And you do have to have when faced with guilt. It's not relevant if it doesn't tend to show he's innocent.

That was lacking in this particular case. I see my time is about up, but I would --"

However, the engine that drives the train in this Gregory analysis is the confession by Jimmy McCaw White. And then he goes on to say that that, of course, can't be introduced because it's hearsay. So it -- it seems as though he says that if it is to be believed what Jimmy White says, it meets the Gregory standard.

The South Carolina Supreme Court's opinion was a harmless error analysis, but more importantly, in addition, that -- that we do not believe and continue to assert that the matter wasn't properly preserved before this Court based upon the manner and only the manner that it was raised before the South Carolina Supreme Court in the direct appeal briefs."

      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In my time today, I'd like to focus on two basic issues. The first is that this case does not approach the outer limit of due process set by this Court in Chambers. As the trial court found in three specific instances, there is no evidence to corroborate these confessions. And the confession evidence itself in Chambers was far stronger than the confession evidence in this case. Second, I'd like to respond to Justice Breyer's question about the nature of the Supreme Court of Carolina's opinion and to remind the Court that it's reviewing the judgment primarily, not the opinion. And it seems to me that Petitioner's argument is essentially criticizing the opinion for the absence of a word, the absence of the word automatically, and that the opinion would look very different if it said where there's strong evidence of guilt, the defendant's third party guilt evidence doesn't automatically raise a reasonable inference of innocence."

But that would be very helpful to us."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
      "speech": "Well, one of the problems is I don't know what it requires. On -- on the -- on the second page of the opinion that I quoted, it is used with the word overcome, which certainly suggests that it is supposed to raise a probability of innocence in light of all the evidence. Sometimes it is used without overcome, as it was earlier in the opinion. I don't know what they mean by inference. Do they mean evidence from which one might reasonably conclude, from which one -- there is a reasonable possibility of concluding? I just don't know what the terms mean. So I hope you'll give us a suggested formulation with -- with terms that -- that are defined that -- that you and the States that you represent would -- would think was an acceptable and constitutional standard."

And I think if you look at the South Carolina Supreme Court's opinion carefully, in light of the -- the supreme court's decisions in Gregory and Gay, you see that in fact what the court was doing was simply saying this case is like Gay. There's strong evidence. We're going to look at the evidence on both sides. And there's a -- there is certainly language in the opinion that makes it sound like an automatic or categorical rule, but in fact, they did go on to look at the defendant's evidence."

In addition, we collected, I believe, four cases in our brief, in addition to the California Court of Appeal and the D.C. Circuit's opinion in Cabrera. There's the Kansas v. Adams case which very clearly looks at the State evidence. In that case, the issue was the defendant was on trial for shaking his baby to death, and the medical evidence of the prosecution showed that the death took place within a certain time period.

But in addition to that case, you have these other three published cases, and we stand by the description of them in our argument. Kansas v. Adams was a case where the court said the issue -- the State's evidence shows this baby died within a certain time period, and although the wife had a history of violence against the child, the court said it's not getting in because it's -- there's no evidence that she had access to the child during the relevant time period.

So if you have a strong case that this guy did it, don't let them even introduce that evidence unless you have some reason to think it's really going to show this guy didn't do it.

There was eyewitness testimony that the third party was at the scene of the crime with the gun in his hand. There was -- there was testimony from the gun dealer that he sold the person the type of crime at issue -- the type of gun at issue both before and after the offense.

On 135, he also found there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could believe that Jimmy White confessed to being the perpetrator, and there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that Jimmy White had in the past committed acts against women. And then he made the mistake of fact and a mistake of law. He treated White as unavailable and therefore he excluded the statement made. That was wrong. White was available. Under South Carolina law, he should have been able to have been called. He could have been impeached, and the prior -- these statements would come in as substantive evidence. It was also wrong, even as the statement gets penal interest. The only corroboration is was the statement made, not is it true. That's the -- and in that case, he found the statements were made.
