      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Tort Claims Act waives the sovereign immunity of the United States for the torts of Federal employees when private persons in like circumstances would be liable. But instead of applying private-person principles of liability, the Ninth Circuit looked to the State and governmental-entity principles of liability. It concluded that the United States could be liable here, because Arizona has decided to hold its governmental entities liable when State employees are negligent. That decision is wrong, for two reasons. First, it is contrary to the plain text of the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Federal Tort Claims Act makes clear that the liability of the United States is to be judged by the principles of private-person liability in the place where the tort occurred. In section 1346(b)(1), the Federal Tort Claims Act allows jurisdiction and waives the sovereign immunity of the United States under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred."

When looking at whether or not a police officer had -- a Federal officer had lawful authority to enter, one might then look to Federal law to determine whether or not the officer had authority to enter, but you would still be applying the principles of private-person liability.

And often States would look -- if the guard happened to be a Federal officer, would look to Federal law. And that can be appropriate, I think, for -- under, potentially, three different -- for, potentially, three different reasons. One, the language of the defense in 2680(a), which provides the United States with a defense to liability in circumstances where , with due care, you're carrying out a Federal statute or regulation. It -- another source of authority might be the State-law principles simply look to what the authority of the person doing the conduct is, and then you would look to Federal law for the source of that authority.

And some States, as respondents claim Arizona does, look to it establish both duty and a standard of care. But, putting that aside, if -- to respond directly to your question -- if a State adopted a Federal statute and used it to apply to private persons, you would be most of the way home in getting Federal Tort Claims Act -- at least the creation of potential liability against the United States. However, I think in that instance, there would still be a question as to the intent of Congress, in the Federal statute itself that was used, as to whether Congress intended to foreclose any private action, any private enforcement, such that the States -- if the State has misinterpreted, in other words, a Federal law, that presents, I think, a Federal question."

Here, though, it's clear from the cases we discuss in our brief, including Easter and Papastathis, that Arizona -- when private parties perform safety inspections on the property of another, Arizona applies its Good Samaritan doctrine.

In other words, courts, when they -- these are all factors that take into account whether someone will have a duty, pursuant to the Good Samaritan doctrine -- one of the factors is that you must have undertaken to render services to another.

Respondents have submitted a new argument to this court contending that governmental-entity law and private-party law in Arizona is equivalent in this situation. But that is wrong. It is clear that the State of Arizona, as a public-policy matter, has decided to create broader, actionable tort duties on its own governmental employees, and to expose itself and open its own coffers to -- when -- to claims when its employees have injured its citizens. But that is not the same law that they apply to private persons, and we know that from the Daggett case, which we discuss -- I believe it's on page 6 of our reply brief. In the Daggett case, that was a case involving an inspection by a county of a swimming recreation area, pursuant to mandatory State and county regulations that required such inspections. The Arizona Court of Appeals there held that there was a duty by the county to a person who had -- who dove into the swimming pool and was injured as a result of hitting the bottom, that there was an actionable duty running against the county there as a matter of the State of Arizona's decision to create tort duties when its employees and governmental entities violate mandatory obligations or perform them negligently."

The Daggett court went on to decide that the county, although it had a duty to the injured party pursuant to governmental entity law, similar to what the Ninth Circuit applied to us here, there would be no actionable duty if one applied the Good Samaritan doctrine. It found that none of the second three prongs of the Good Samaritan doctrine were met, and it also raised the question as to whether or not someone in the position of the county would even be rendering services into another sufficient to meet that part of the Good Samaritan doctrine.

It -- the Daggett case did not hold, as the Solicitor General maintains, that under Arizona law there would be no duty under the restatement sections 323 or 324. In fact, what the Court says in remanding the case because they found a duty under the county regulations, is, \"We assume, without deciding, that there is a claim under 324 and -- 323 and 324, and note simply that there are no allegations in the plaintiff's complaint that would satisfy those issues.\" So, they simply say, because there's additional litigation coming, they were giving heads up to the party that he needs to amend the complain to assert the Good Samaritan elements."

That -- a point of interest in that case is that in that case, the State -- because Arizona is a pure comparative-negligence State -- alleged that the Federal mine inspector was partially at fault and that, therefore, Mr. Olson and Mr. Vargas' damages should be reduced, just as, in our case, if we had proceeded beyond the motion-to-dismiss phase, we could have anticipated, as is common, that the Federal Government would have identified the State of Arizona and the mine operator to be non-parties at fault, as well, so that those individuals -- the negligence of those individuals would reduce the plaintiff's damages against the Federal Government."

I hope that's clear. But, generally, workers' compensation carriers have a right to get repaid if there's some private settlement, and concessions were made on that right, because of the -- suing the parent company, and that case was never resolved on the merits. To begin, Your Honor, this came to the Ninth Circuit from a motion to dismiss.

So, the Ninth Circuit was essentially asked a hypothetical question by the Federal Tort Claim, and it was asked to resolve that question on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which the standard is, of course, that we can set -- we can prove no facts which would -- which would establish a cause of action. And what the court really did, because the court applied a body of law -- the Ninth Circuit -- that began with the Louie doctrine -- is, the court looked at Arizona mine- inspector law as a predictor to what Arizona private- person law would be.

It didn't proceed that way at all. It says, generally, the United States can be held liable only when liability was attached to a private actor. However, the United States may be liable, quoting from one of the Ninth Circuit's earlier cases, for the performance of some activities that private persons do not perform when a State or municipal entity would be held liable under the law where the activity occurred. I don't see they are saying, \"We are trying to predict what California would do in a private situation.\" They have set forth a rule that, where there's no cause of action against a private person, we look to whether there would be a cause of action under -- against a State or subdivision of the State."

And the D.C. Circuit found, no, it would follow Louie and Crider, and say that the best predictor of the State law, when you can't find an analogous private person, is the liability statutes that concern the law enforcement, but, following Indian Towing, it would not apply the gross-negligence standard that the D.C.

The other extreme, you have the Ninth Circuit, which could -- which says as long as the Government was involved in regulation, there is no analogous private person, because private people don't regulate.

Should we suggest, \"Look, you try harder to find a private analogy, because there's almost always a private analogy.\" Every Government official has some similarities to private people, and some differences.

And the case I would refer to is Martinez versus State, which is simply a case where a road washes out, and the Government reroutes the road for a -- for a period of time across a private land, and, for a period of time, grades it, and then stops grading it. And, in that circumstance, the Government was held liable simply for having, for that period of the time, assumed a duty.

And, to the extent that that's at issue, Your Honor, I would think that that would be a question, under State law, of whether the Government had assumed the duty. And if not under State law, it would be a question under the Federal Tort Claim of whether an -- there is an exception that has been met. And there is no exception. I think that this Court, in Berkovitz, said that regulatory conduct can be actionable under the Federal Tort Claim if it -- the discretion isn't met -- or the discretionary exception isn't met.

Just to be clear, Justice Scalia, the point that I was making is, the only private-person law to which respondents pointed below was that of the Good Samaritan doctrine. That -- whether or not respondents can make out a claim under the Good Samaritan doctrine would require meeting all of the elements of that doctrine. That would be primarily a State-law question, but we do think there's an ingredient of a Federal question there, especially, for example, in deciding whether or not they reasonably and detrimentally relied. Other courts of appeals, including the Sixth Circuit, in Myers and Raymer, have said that the language of the Mine Act is relevant to whether or not a party can simply rely on the very -- just the bare existence of the MSHA -- of MSHA's existence and its inspections, and held that, given the language in the Mine Act that expressly leaves the safety of the mine to the -- primarily to the mine operators through the assistance of the miners, that it would be unreasonable to rely. Here, it -- this was completely appropriately decided by the district court on a motion to dismiss, because they came forward with affidavits that say nothing more than that they relied upon the existence of the MSHA scheme.

I think if you say yes, you could look to that law and conclude on this record that there can't be liability. Justice Ginsburg, if I may turn back to your point about Muniz, I think you're correct that they didn't specifically -- the court in that case didn't specifically suggest what the private analog might be on remand, although it did suggest perhaps it would be personal- injury law as it relates to private persons in like circumstances. But I think the important point in Muniz on that point is akin to what I was just making to Justice Scalia, which is that the court said there is consent to sue here, so the prisoners may sue. Whether or not they're going to be able to ultimately make out a claim under private-person law is a different question. So, the Federal Tort Claims Act is not a guarantee of monetary compensation from the United States. And one cannot do what the Ninth Circuit did, which is to keep looking for possible analogies in -- under which the result would be that the United States is held liable. Sometimes, just like with private-party analogs, just like with private safety inspectors, the answer will be: the private party can't be held liable under the applicable private-person law. And in -- the private-person law in Arizona, I think it's clear, is the Good - - I'm sorry. My Time is up."
