You can imagine someone who is a month short of his 18th birthday, and you are saying that, no matter what this person does, commits the most horrible series of non-homicide offenses that you can imagine, a whole series of brutal rapes, assaults that render the -- the victim paraplegic but not dead, no matter what, the person is sentenced shows no remorse whatsoever, the worst case you can possibly imagine, cannot -- that person must at some point be made eligible for parole. That's your argument?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, that's -- that's correct. The life -- yes. A life with parole sentence would be constitutional, and that may mean that person you describe still spends his entire life in prison, but life with parole gives some hope to the adolescent who has an inherent capacity to change. It gives him some hope that later in time he may be released."

    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, our position is that it should be left up to the States to decide. We think that the -- the Colorado provision would probably be constitutional. We will have to see what different States do. I mean, but -- but, yes, even that long amount of time would give at least some hope to the adolescent offender."

All that would have to be required is a meaningful opportunity to the adolescent offender to demonstrate that he has in fact changed, reformed, and is now fit to live in society. It -- that's all. That's all we are asking for. We are not asking that it be automatic right to get back out. If Terrance Graham or Joe Sullivan --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

But if you concede that it's all right to have a sentence of 50 years and then a consideration where 1 out of 20 people are granted parole, I think it suggests that the line you would draw is -- is pretty artificial -- or certainly suggests that the next case we will get is somebody with life with parole after 50 years."

    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I'm saying that this sentence that we are here today before is unequivocally, unmistakably a condemnation that you will never be released from prison, and so this sentence clearly falls on the line of being cruel because it tells an adolescent, for an adolescent mistake, you can never live in civil society. There will be other sentences that people will argue are the equivalent of this sentence, and -- and people may argue that with a 50-year sentence. But this sentence here is unequivocal, and there is no question that it’s cruel because of -- of the fact that it rejects any hope that the adolescent can be changed."

One is the assumption of the argument seems to be that there are in place parole -- throughout all the States -- parole systems which are effective, which are operating, and that they have the capacity to make accurate judgments about rehabilitation. What can I read -- what -- what studies do you have to -- that -- that comment on that? Secondly, unrelated, at some point I think you ought to talk about the procedural bar, which is something you go over very, very, very -- let's see -- that's Sullivan."

But on the first question, Your Honor, I would point you to the amicus brief filed by the various correctional officers that talk about the types of programs that can be done. I think that that has -- is very thorough and -- and would answer it far better than I can in a couple minutes up here. But, yes, to answer short, we -- we believe that -- that the parole systems in place can be effective to do this, and in all seven States where there are currently non-homicide juvenile offenders, they all have functioning parole systems. Even Florida has it. Even though it -- it abolished parole in 1983, Florida still has 6,000 parole-eligible inmates and last year they heard over -- they made over 1,700 parole determinations. So the -- the administrative burden to the State of adding these –-"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "And Florida could choose to make that sentence and instead impose a sentence, as its prosecutor recommended here, a 30-year determinant sentence, if Florida doesn't want to reinstitute parole. We are not saying it has to do parole. That’s just one of several constitutional options."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "What -- what would you do if there were a crime spree and there were different jurisdictions? One jurisdiction imposes for 35 years, the next jurisdiction for another 35 years, to be served consecutively."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Well, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I think that the -- that you would get into the question about whether that sentence is the equivalent of life without parole, and there could be an argument made that if you -- obviously, if you sentence someone to 150, 200 years, there’s no conceivable hope of ever release, 150 years without parole."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "So the second jurisdiction has the obligation, but not the first? Is that the way it works?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "I would think that the -- if you had that -- I would think that the -- that the judge making that sentence would have to take that into consideration, that this sentence is going to -- based on all adolescent conduct -- it has to be all adolescent conduct, not if some of the conduct is post-juvenile. But, yes, I would think that the -- that the second sentencing judge would need to take that into consideration."
  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Your -- Your Honor, there would definitely be a -- a difficult line to draw at that case. Life without parole, though, is unequivocal. And even that sentence that you are describing, there is some difference between it and life without parole, because only life without parole makes the unequivocal assessment that the adolescent cannot be returned to civil society."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "We have -- you are arguing for a categorical rule."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Your friend on the other side is arguing for a categorical rule, always permissible. But we have a precedent that suggests in -- in an individual case, you assess the proportionality of the sentence to the crime. Now, we know from Roper that death is different, and we know from Roper that juveniles are different. Wouldn't it make sense to incorporate the consideration of the juvenile status into the proportionality review? So that if you do have a case where it's the 17-year-old who is 1 week shy of his 18th birthday and it is the most grievous crime spree you can imagine, you can determine that in that case life without parole may not be disproportionate. But if it's -- and I know you would argue that these are the facts here -- if it's a less grievous crime and there is, for example, a younger defendant involved, then in that case maybe it is disproportionate. Why -- why doesn't that seem more sensitive? And it avoids all of the line-drawing problems we have been discussing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Well, two things: First, Your Honor, Roper states, and the science -- states it based on the science, that at that age we cannot make a determination about whether or not the adolescent will or will not reform. Even an expert psychologist, psychiatrist cannot do it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Oh, I understand. But I don't think they'll say that we can't make that determination at 17 years 51 months, but we can make that determination at 18 years 1 month."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Well, anywhere you draw the line, Your Honor, you're going to come up with an example where you are 1 day before or 1 day after, and the Court in Roper struggled with where to draw the line between maturity and immaturity, and it concluded, rightly so, to draw the line at 18 based on both the science and the legislative determinations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "But that is because, as they told us, death is different. And you do -- once you decide that, you do have to draw a line somewhere. I'm just wondering why we have to go all the way in with you or all the way with your opponent when our precedent allows us to consider an issue of this sort on a case­ by-case basis."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "I think it's because adolescents are different. Adolescents are different in that we can't tell at this age whether they are going to reform or not. And all we are proposing is that an adolescent not necessarily be released, but that he be given a later opportunity. And it boils -- it just comes down to adolescents are different, Your Honor, and the determination can't be made at age 17 even for the most heinous crimes that are committed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Is there any difference in the terms of incarceration making this harsher than otherwise? I think you suggested in -- in your brief that educational and vocational training is not given to people who are in for life without parole because they will never be out on the street so they don't need to be transitioned back."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "If I understand your question, would it be different if those type of programs are made available to life-without- --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Is that -- that’s so?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Yes, that is generally true. And the -- and the very website that the State of Florida cites makes a point of saying that the programs are for the purpose of reentry into society, and so those are obviously the opposite of what life without parole is. You are never going to reenter society. And it's generally true that those programs are not available to offenders who get life without parole, and that's what makes the sentence so particularly cruel, to give up on a kid at that point in his life."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "So what are the terms of incarceration? They just stay in their cells and –-"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I think it varies obviously by facility by facility. But the sentence means you are going to stay in your cell and die there. You are going to stay in your cell for 60 or 70 years, whenever you reach your natural death, and die there. You know, they -- they do have some limited freedoms, as the State of Florida has pointed out, the same types of freedoms that people on death row have. But ultimately both sentences mean that you are going to die in a State-controlled institution. And they are very hopeless --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, I doubt whether this varies. I -- I don't know of any principle where if you are in for life, you are in solitary."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Well, I’m not -- I’m not -- you are correct. I'm not suggesting they are in solitary confinement. But they are locked up for the rest of their life, and they're not allowed to rejoin civil society even if, as some of the former juvenile offenders who filed a brief in this case, can demonstrate that they have become model citizens."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "And why isn't the -- the most sensible way to deal with the problem that you are raising, the one that the Chief Justice suggested, to permit as-applied proportionality challenges that take into account the particular circumstances of the juvenile in question, rather than this per se rule that you are advocating, which would deprive the State of Florida from reaching the judgment that there are some -- there are some juveniles, some individuals who are short of their 18th birthday, who cannot -- who deserve imprisonment in -- life imprisonment without parole? Some of the actual cases that -- in which this sentence has been imposed in Florida involve factual situations that are so horrible that I couldn't have imagined them if I hadn't actually seen them. Raping an 8-year-old girl and burying her alive. Are you familiar with that case?"

    "speaker": "GOWDY",

  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, I am familiar with that case. Your Honor, the reason, first of all, the Court has said and said so clearly in Kennedy that murder is different. In the Kennedy decision, you also said: Horrible facts, someone who raped their stepdaughter. But yet this Court drew a line and exempted from capital punishment adult defendants who commit horrible crimes. But to get to the core of your question as to why not do it on a case-by-case basis, because you can only make the determination about the adolescent later in life. And I -- we would agree that there should be a case-by-case determination as to -- as to whether or not that offender should spend his whole life in prison, but we say it needs to happen later, once he has matured, once he's reached past adulthood, because when you’re --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "You assume -- doesn't your argument assume that the only purpose of punishment is deterrence in the sense of protecting society from this person in the future, so that, you know, once that's no longer a problem, we should let this person out. But that isn't the only purpose of punishment that we've acknowledged. One of the purposes is retribution, punishment for just perfectly horrible actions. And I don't know why that value of retribution diminishes to the point of zero when it's a person who's, you know, 17 years 9 months old."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "We are not suggesting that it goes to the point of zero. We’re not -- and we concede the State has a right to -- to exact retribution from the juvenile offender. And in this case, 30 years would have been a lot of retribution for Terrance Graham, both --"

    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, we -- but a Juvenile is -- not only does he have an inherent capacity to grow; he is less culpable. And so to exact the most -- for a non-homicide crime whether you are adult or juvenile, this is the most severe punishment you can receive, and to exact that most severe punishment for a less culpable offender that the Court has recognized is a less culpable offender doesn't -- is too much retribution. We are not saying the State can't exercise retribution, but that life without parole is -- is too much for those types of crimes."

We -- we concede that the State of Florida may continue to prosecute juveniles in adult court and that makes sense in order to get a term of years that is longer than you can get in juvenile court. And in this case, if the judge had gone along with the prosecutor's recommendation, it would have meant a 30-year sentence for my client, which would have been far longer than he could have gotten in the juvenile court. Worse --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "The logic in Roper was very straightforward. It says, \"Death is reserved for the worst of the worst.\" I think that was the quote. We know that juveniles are not the worst of the worst, for the reasons you have articulated, that they are not fully developed, don't have moral sense to the same extent as an adult. But life without parole is not reserved for the worst of the worst, and so it seems to me that the logic of our precedent suggests that you can't necessarily rely on the juvenile status to exempt them from a penalty that is not reserved for the worst of the worst, but perhaps it makes sense to consider in a particular instance whether the penalty is disproportionate, given the juvenile's characteristics that you suggest."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",

The three trends are: The strong punishment for juveniles that States have enacted over the last 15- 20 years; the various transfer and waiver laws that States have enacted over the last 10, 15, 20 years allowing juveniles to be transferred into adult court; and then finally, what is really at issue is parole. Parole has been eliminated in many States. Fifteen States have totally eliminated it in the last 10, 15 years. So what they are seeking is a categorical rule that goes against the national consensus and the national trend. The concession here was that Graham's sentence could be even up to life as long as there is the possibility of parole. We believe that’s very telling. In their brief, they point out that Graham could have been sentenced to something just short of his actuarial life. His actuarial life is around 64 years old, which means just about a 46-year sentence. And the standard that we suggest here is that there cannot be any categorical rule, for the  reasons Justice Alito pointed out. We have --"

First, look at the legislative structure. Florida structure doesn't -- Florida structure is a very balanced, thoughtful approach, in waiving children into the adult court only when it's a violent crime and only under certain -- when certain ages are in play. Look at the age. It does play a role. The judicial discretion plays a role. The trial judge --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Well, the legislature has set the line at 14-15 for certain crimes and 16-17 for others. And then for indictment, where it goes to a grand jury, there is no age limitation. That has been on our books for the better part of 50, 60 years, allowing indictment -- allowing the grand jury to make a decision about whether the particular juvenile shall be brought into the adult court. So --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "But then the -- what is your objection to an approach that when you are dealing with life without parole, for the reasons that your brother has articulated, you must as a matter of Federal law consider the juvenile status of the defendant before that sentence is imposed?"

    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Well, sure. And as I say, there's the three factors I would ask the Court to look at. First, the structure that we have here in Florida, which many States have, that deal with the age. Age does matter. Ninety-nine out of 100 juvenile offenders in our system do not go into adult court, and an even smaller percentage of that ultimately get into the adult sanctions. The trial judges in Florida, unless -- unless it’s a very violent crime, have some discretion to sentence as to age. If you look at the transcript here in the joint appendix, the trial judge here struggled with this, struggled with age, and said: Juvenile sanctions are inappropriate; youthful offenders -- youthful offender sanctions are inappropriate; I'm going to sentence you to -- to adult."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "Yes, but could I interrupt with one question? Isn't it correct that the age is relevant on whether or not to transfer the person to the adult system, but once he's in the adult system, age is entirely immaterial?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "That's not accurate, Justice Stevens. Under the statute 985.226, 227, and 225, we have a system in which the grounds are set for when juveniles can be either mandatorily or discretionarily brought into the adult system. And then under the statute 985, the punishment is graduated. In other words, for the lower offenses, the juvenile sanctions must be considered and the youthful offender sanctions must be considered. It's only in certain limited instances, like indictment, where it's a life offense, where the juvenile has been indicted for life, that the trial judge is forced to do adult sanctions. In this case, Graham was under the discretionary direct -- direct file, meaning that the prosecutor had discretion whether to bring the case or not. He brought it into the adult system. Graham accepted being processed as an adult. He was put on probation, and then --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "I still don't understand. Just to make sure I get the point correct: After the decision has been made to have them prosecuted in the adult system, at that -- after that decision has been made, is the age of the defendant a relevant factor in sentencing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "The age -- they get a presentence report. The age is woven in --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "I understand, but statutorily? As a matter --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Well, the statute doesn't specifically say the trial judge --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "The answer is no. It's -- under the statutes, it's totally irrelevant after he has been transferred to the adult stage. Is that correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Not exactly, because the range of remedies the trial judge can impose is based upon what method by which the juvenile was transferred or waived into the adult court. In Graham's case, he was allowed to have juvenile and youthful offender sanctions considered because of his age. I mean, that's the way --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

    "speech": "But the statute doesn't draw any distinctions once he is in -- in the adult --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "And -- and there's -- well, I guess that answers my question. He is not required to as a matter of Federal law. He can say: I am not considering the fact that this is a juvenile because I think his crime should be treated as an adult crime."

    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "No -- I mean, certainly not under any Federal constitutional principle I am aware of."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "That's -- that's one of the problems, is the individual sentencing judge might think that Graham is a very bad individual, but the prosecutor had a different judgment of it.

That was within the trial judge's discretion, and particularly given the seriousness of the offenses that Graham committed. We are talking about violence. And violence does matter. This Court has said -- and certainly in oral argument in Solem and others, the -- violence versus non-violent acts plays a major role in sentencing, and it should play a major role as well when it comes to juveniles. I don't read Roper to say that it takes off the table lengthy sentences for violent crimes by juveniles."

He got the life sentence under that charge, which is then all part and parcel of the violation-of-probation hearing. There were these secondary -- these second incidences of home invasions where Meigo Bailey was the codefendant who got life for murder and also for armed burglary as a part of one of the home invasions.

That it's only after a period of time has gone by, and you see, has this person overcome those youthful disabilities? That's why a proportionality review on the spot doesn't accommodate the -- what is the driving force of the -- your -- the Petitioner's argument is that you can't make a judgment until years later to see how that person has -- has done."
  },

Here we are in a different context that deals with these -- these terms of years, and there -- there’s no constitutional right to parole. And certainly that is a purely legislative decision to be made, and States have said we are not going to have parole."

You really can't tell how redeemable this individual is until he is in prison for some time; and, therefore, you should not give anybody life without parole. They -- they may all be savable. So we should defer -- defer. We shouldn't have any non-parole sentences. Everybody should be evaluated, which was indeed the approach that -- that many jurisdictions used to take. Wasn't that so --"

  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But they don't make it on a case-by-case basis. They say no juvenile can drink -- no juvenile."

    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "That's true but at the same -- by the same token, the juvenile justice system in Florida -- and keep in mind we had a juvenile justice division -- department established in 1994 because of the severe problems as we outlined in our brief -- that Florida has a -- has committed resources and -- and programs and so forth to the juvenile justice system. So given all of that, that what the Court -- I am sorry -- what the State has done as -- as to age, that's why we say that it matters. What we are concerned about is that to pursue the categorical rule that they seek, the Court would have to, of course, abandon the various firewalls that would stand between terms of years and also the death penalty. But, in addition, if the Court decides to go down the proportionality route, my concern is the five principles in the Harmelin concurrence about the States having the ability to have diverse juvenile justice programs and not have the -- sort of a lawnmower coming through and making them all uniform. The Harmelin concurrence, Justice Kennedy, talked about the deference in structuring these. And there’s going to be differences. Some States are going to have the most harsh laws. The Eighth Amendment doesn't dictate any particular penological theory. There’s great -- and it -- it would turn the Eighth Amendment analysis on its head to first allow this diversity among the States and allow strong medicine for certain types of violent crimes and then to kind of compare them and say, well, gosh, Florida is unusual; it's different; and that shouldn't be the case whatsoever."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "If we look just at deterrence, my initial instinct is that the difference in life and life without -- life with parole and life without parole is just not a factor in deterrence. I -- I don't know how I'd confirm that one way or the other, but let's -- let's assume that there is some basis for that intuition. Then, insofar as the deterrence prong is concerned, since it's not a deterrent, and if you assume that there is rehabilitation, what is the State's interest in keeping the accused, the –- the defendant in custody for the rest of his life if he has been rehabilitated and is no longer a real danger? What's the State's interest?"

    "speech": "Well, I think certainly the State of Florida's interest as among other States is first of all to punish. Certainly I think deterrence plays a role. We recognize that deterrence may have less impact on some juveniles, but it doesn't have -- it doesn't have zero impact. It does have some impact --"

    "speech": "I thought the question is: Will the difference between life with parole and life without parole deter anybody? I mean any -- that -- that's what we are talking about.

  },

    "speaker": "MAKAR",

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "May I ask this question? There are an awful lot of amicus briefs in this case, and I haven't been able to read them all by any means. Do any of the briefs or any of the materials with which you are familiar discuss the rate of -- the difference between the danger of recidivism of a young offender and one who is, say, 40 or 50 years old?"
  },

    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "I -- I don't have that at my grasp, but --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "But it seems to me sort of -- as a matter of intuition, Justice Kennedy made the same sort of point. It seems to me that the older people are less likely to be recidivists than the younger ones, but is -- is there any empirical evidence that says that’s an incorrect or correct judgment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Well, in terms of recidivism, I think, number one, violence matters. I think there are studies -- I can't quite put my finger on -- that says that the violent offenders tend to recidivate more than the non-violent. And that as one ages -- I think Judge Posner has written a book called \"Aging and Old Age\" that talks about -- in one of its chapters about how age matters, and that crime rates go down as -- as the population ages. So I mean there are those sorts of things out there that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, along those lines -- and, again, maybe this was in the amicus briefs. Do you have a study about what age cohort is responsible for most violent crime?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "There are -- there are studies everywhere, and I have looked at many of them, and it appears that it certainly increases from age 13, and it goes up to 14. And it keeps going up until about 16, 17, and 18. It peaks. It depends on the crime, and it depends upon what jurisdiction, and so forth. But it tends to peak in the early 20s, the late teens or early 20s. So that's -- that's -- I think that's typical. One thing I would point out that I haven't had a chance to say: The empirical question in this case, I think, is very important because they are asking that a constitutional rule be established on studies that have just been generated literally over this summer and have not been subject to meaningful review. We have a concern with that. We think that the definitional questions that they have raised, you know, about the offenses and what is life -- is life -- the studies tend to focus on life. But what is life? Well, in Florida we have some juveniles who are serving prison terms that have 50-, 60-, 70-, 80-year sentences, but they are not included within that study. We also have in this case, for example, Graham, he had a -- let's say that the judge decided to give him 30 years for the main offense and 15 for the second and made them consecutive. That's 45 years. Graham's actuarial life --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, we are not sure that those 70-year sentences are any good, either, because your -- your friend on the other side, you know, is not willing to -- to pick a number at which the sentence amounts to life without parole. Maybe a 70-year sentence does."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "Well, they’ve conceded, in their brief, that what this all boils down to is that if Graham wins and he gets to go back and be resentenced, that either the Florida legislature has to pass a law to reinstitute parole for this category of offenders, or the trial judge could say, okay, the actuarial table says you are going to live to be 64.2, we're going to -- I'm going to sentence you to something less --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "I thought that there was a parole system still functioning, so -- although it will be phased out over time, but for people who were incarcerated under the old regime -- and I think the suggestion was that that system would take care of the handful of people, not more than that, that this decision would involve."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "There is still a parole board. Its functions have been minimized greatly. It has not been applicable to anyone since 1983. It would take a legislative act or perhaps even an executive act of some sort to reinstitute that board and to take account of these cases."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Can you tell us just a little bit about the Florida correctional systems, the policies with respect to rehabilitation programs? If they don't have parole, then you might say, well, they don't need rehabilitation programs or that they might need them more. Had the rehabilitation programs been increased or decreased since the phasing out of parole? Or is it about the same? Or are they -- are they non-existent?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MAKAR",
    "speech": "No, no. They are in existence. I cannot specifically answer that, Justice Kennedy, because I don't know all the different programs that are available. There's the various programs that deal with drug offenses and alcoholism and so forth. And there -- there are certain educational programs. For example, when Graham was in the county jail -- that was the county versus the State -- he was able to go to school. I don't believe there is anywhere near sort of the total absence and deprivation, sort of a Weems case, sort of we put you in a cell and you rot there for the rest of your life, at all in our system. There’s all these various rights that we pointed out in our brief that are -- enable -- they are able to have familial relationships. They can have the Maslow's hierarchy. I mean, they -- physiological needs and emotional needs and so forth are still available to be met in prison. So I can't give you specific programs, Justice Kennedy, but in Florida’s system, they do exist. If there's no further questions --"

    "speech": "Why does a juvenile have a constitutional right to hope, but an adult does not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Because the juvenile is different than an adult. A juvenile is less culpable. He's -- we know over time he will change and -- and potentially reform, as opposed to an adult. Once you are fully formed, you are more culpable and you don't have that same inherent capacity to change."
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Because the Court, up to this point, has said that death is different, and the rules -- the Eighth Amendment rules in capital cases are entirely different from the Eighth Amendment rules in -- in all other cases."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Well, I -- first, we -- we are not asking that the procedural rules in the intricate individualized death penalty sentencing scheme be transported or moved over to the noncapital cases."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "I know you are not asking for that, but that -- isn't that where this, logically, is going? If death is not different, then there should be uniform rules across the board."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Absolutely not, Your Honor, because those rules make no sense when you are talking about adolescents, who are different, because those -- which a Court recognized in Roper, that those rules can't be applied to adolescents because we -- you can't, as a sentencer, predict the future. And so, though death is different, it's not different in any critical respects here because the punishment, life without parole, just like death, says that the offender is forever irredeemable, is forever unfit to live in society, and must die in prison."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Why does it say that? Why doesn't it just say that, in this particular case, what this individual has done is so bad that, even if this person can be rehabilitated and would not present a danger to -- to society at age 60 or 70, that this person is -- should be sentenced to life without parole? That's -- that's what it means for an adult offender."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",
    "speech": "Your -- Your Honor, I think the only difference here is -- between life without parole and life with parole, is that there will be a determination later, at age 30 or 40 or sometime thereafter, as to whether that is the right sentence. And the -- the parole official, just like the judge, can consider the offense as the offender, as a juvenile. We're just saying that you can't make that complete determination at such a young age, and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

    "speaker": "GOWDY",

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "One reason States and the Federal government moved to abolish parole in -- in recent decades was, with depressing regularity, prisoners released on parole committed crimes again. And I'm just -- is there any empirical evidence that tells us how often people, say, from 17 -- 17-year-olds, when released, commit crimes again, as opposed to 18- to 20-year-olds?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOWDY",

    "speaker": "GOWDY",
