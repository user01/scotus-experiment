But if you take that and say, look, this is an absolute obvious case where there was just wrong sentencing, it's not actual innocence, it's wrong sentencing, but it's so obvious, it's so clear that this is just unjust.

This Court specifically rejected the notion that it should consider discretionary factors in the capital context mitigating evidence. Thus, Your Honor, our rule about statutory eligibility is tethered specifically to the Court's ruling in Sawyer. Additionally, Your Honor, that rule that we propose is well-rooted in this Court's habeas doctrine dating back to Townsend v. Burke, Your Honor. This Court has recognized that a sentence that falls -- the severity of a sentence that falls within a statutory range is not amenable to habeas review. Additionally, the recent case, Your Honor, of Harris v. the United States, where the issue was whether Apprendi applied to mandatory minimums. This Court held -- actually, part of the opinion is a plurality opinion, but the holding is that the -- it does not matter if the sentence is more based on some false fact. The issue is, is it within range of punishment authorized by the legislature, Your Honor."

And I -- there's just as much injustice there, it seems to me."

    {
      "speaker": "ALBRITTON",

I mean, that's -- what I don't understand about this area, and you've read the cases and so you may able to be clearer than I am and can correct me, I've thought that the real key concept is not actual innocence. It's very hard to apply that to a sentence. You're guilty of the crime, you're not innocent of the sentence. That doesn't make sense, but rather manifest injustice, and the key word is manifest. And so one could have manifest injustice in millions of possible situations. You don't need absolute clarity as to it applies to in between the guideline but not beyond the guideline, but the key word is manifest, and it has to be unjust and injustice first and foremost has to do with being behind bars when the law says you shouldn't be, directly and simply, not through some procedural device.

It's not surprising that the same evidence would be involved in this situation, Your Honor, because, after all, the inquiry is extremely similar, and that is the innocence of the petitioner and whether or not the state proved as a due process matter the allegations that it was required to.

As the Court discussed in Sawyer, that's an important consideration in determining whether or not the exception should be applied. The issue presented to a Federal district judge of actual innocence of a non-capital sentence is easier to determine and it's more objective than, for instance, the determination Federal district judges are called upon to determine whether or not a petitioner is statutorily eligible for the death penalty. For instance, in the State of Texas, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner constitutes a future danger. In the State of Louisiana, for instance, the state has to -- one of the statutory aggravating factors are that the crime was committed in a heinous manner. Those inquiries are more subjective and less objective than the inquiry required under the application the -- of the exception that we propose. Additionally, Your Honors, the equities weigh sentences. Justice Scalia asked a question as to why this rule may be necessary because there would always be ineffective assistance of counsel, and frankly there's an answer to that. And that answer is, there will not always be a meritorious -- under a meritorious claim and there will not necessarily be ineffective assistance of counsel for one reason at least, and that is, under Carrier, this Court held that to rely on the ineffective assistance of counsel as cause in Federal court, that claim had to have been raised below in the state court. So there could be a scenario, this scenario, if Mr. Haley had not properly raised ineffective assistance of counsel below in state habeas or on state appeal as required by state law, he would not be entitled to rely on that ineffective assistance of counsel for cause in Federal court, and so the court would be presented again with this fundamentally unjust situation."

Mr. Haley's case is a perfect example. Even though Mr. Haley was diligent and filed his state writ very shortly after the court of criminal appeals in Texas denied discretionary review, he's ended up spending 4 years more in prison than he was even authorized for under the statute. Additionally, Your Honor, in discussing the state's interest in this case, it is the Federal habeas court that in actuality is vindicating the Texas substantive law. Now that does not mean, of course, that there is no interest of the state in its procedural laws. However, that recognition indicates that, in effect, there's a wash of the interest here, which would not undermine the application of the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception in this context."

And in this case, we think that it is quite relevant that you're discussing -- and it would be so in all cases such as this that, under the rule we propose, because the sentence would always be outside the range authorized by the legislature for this particular conduct. Your Honors, in relation, briefly here at the end to Almendarez-Torres, we agree with the Solicitor General that if Almendarez-Torres does not control, then this case is -- is very easy and there need not be any application of Sawyer, and that is because, as I said earlier, he would be actually innocent of the enhanced offense of theft by habitual offender. As pointed out in our brief, Almendarez- Torres is not controlling because in this case there is an additional -- there is something else that must be proven in addition to the fact of the prior convictions, and that is the date of the commission of the second prior felony offense.

When sequence is used, it is shorthand to describe the -- when the second offense was committed, and the date of commission of that offense is something separate and apart from the fact of those prior -­ of that prior conviction. So, Your Honor, we would respectfully suggest that takes this outside of Almendarez- Torres, and therefore the Court can -- can determine that Mr. Haley is actually innocent of the enhanced offense of theft by habitual offender. Finally, Your Honor, in conclusion, I would respectfully request the Court not to remand to the State of Texas -- excuse me, to the courts below, unless it reaches the question presented and decides it contrary to the Fifth Circuit. If the Court decides that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim should have -- or cause and prejudice should have been reached first, since it was not presented in the question presented, the Court should not reach any issue in this case. Mr. Haley should be able to go about his life and not be subject to a day more in prison that the state concedes is unlawful, and as the court advised -- as the state advised the district court, if this Court were to reverse, it intends to put Mr. Haley back in prison for an additional 10 years that it specifically admits is unlawful and not authorized by the legislature, and a remand presumably would result in the same sort of injustice visited upon Mr. Haley by the state. For those reasons, Your Honor, I respectfully suggest that the Court affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and hold that Mr. Haley has sufficiently established that he is actually innocent, reach the merits of the claim, and -- and that's the only issue the Court needs to resolve.

I'd like to quickly revisit an exchange Justice Scalia had with Mr. Albritton concerning Almendarez-Torres, and make the point that even if this Court were at some future date to decide to overrule Almendarez-Torres, which I don't believe is presented in this case, that would not necessarily mean that the actual innocence exception would extend to non-capital sentencing. The inquiries are altogether different. The former, what was at -- the case at common law at the time of the founding. The latter is, as the exchange illuminated, a question of what 28 U.S.C. Section 2254 provides. And I would note 2255, with respect to Federal habeas, explicitly includes in its statutory text as one of the grounds for granting habeas that a sentence is, quote, in excess of the maximum authorized by law. That's in 2255. It is not in 2254. The only ground for granting habeas in 2254 with respect to a state conviction is if someone is held in custody of violation of the laws or Constitution of the United States. And so it is altogether possible that this Court could decide at some future date to -- to overrule Almendarez-Torres and then yet nonetheless decide that in looking to the ends of justice that now repeal language from the habeas statute, that there is not an obligation to excuse procedural default for every single conceivable sentencing error."

Cause and prejudice can address situations where relief is merited, such as perhaps Mr. Haley's. On the other side, there is the risk of expanding that. Non-capital sentencing, unlike actual innocence, I didn't do it, of the crime, unlike actual innocence of death, non-capital sentencing is virtually ubiquitous. Interestingly, Mr. Haley's amici law professors in footnote 13 of their brief acknowledge the ability of the slippery slope to extend beyond just increasing the statutory maximum to sentences within a range and to a whole host of factors that the states used for sentencing factors, facts -­ factors such as the amount of drugs, such as the value of stolen goods, such as the status of a victim, whether the victim is elderly, whether the victim is a police officer."
