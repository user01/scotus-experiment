And so the question here really is how judicial review should be accomplished, and we’ve maintained all along that the way judicial review should be accomplished here is the way that it’s accomplished in all sorts of cases, by bringing an action in the Federal district court seeking injunctive relief.

It’s very complicated. This individual, even though he classifies it as a grievance where the union is supposed to take it up and the union tells him we’re not going to take it up, we don’t believe in your claim, that then he can run in to a Federal judge. Now, that -- that I find surprising, and I’d like you to explain how in your theory that works."

Now, on a claim like this, for the very to figure out what the facts are."

Just as, for example, the employees did in the NFFE against Weinberger case on which you sat in the court of appeals where the Government again there tried to argue there was no subject matter jurisdiction, and the court really gave that argument the back of its hand because traditionally the way that someone who wants to allege, someone who is an employee or not who wants to allege, that there -- that he’s seeking injunctive relief for a constitutional violation, goes to the Federal district courts under 28 U.S.C. 1331, not to a negotiated grievance procedure that was not intended and cannot operate in the way that the Government seems to hope --"

He wants a survey to see if he’s being picked on. If he is, there would be redress. So it seemed like this was the kind of complaint that was best handled in that kind of procedure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARLAN",
      "speech": "Well, I have two somewhat different answers to your question, Justice Ginsburg. One, which I’ll turn to in a moment, is about the specifics of this case, but I want to give the more general one first. And that is, that the negotiated grievance procedures that unions set up are for the benefit of employees who believe that that is the best way of seeking to resolve their complaints, and most complaints, quite honestly, will be done that way. Most people are not going to go into Federal court, especially not if all they can seek is injunctive relief and they have to pay a filing fee and it’s going to take a long time to go there. Now, Mr. Whitman had two problems that made it unlikely he was going to go through the grievance process here. The first of these problems is that the joint appendix, the two stages of which he has control -- and I can return in a moment to what happens after to talk to his supervisor and to talk to the facility manager. When it comes to drug testing of the kind to which Mr. Whitman was subjected here, his supervisor does not have authority over that. It’s done from outside the facility. So talking to his supervisor will not get him anywhere."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
      "speech": "Yes, but that simply means that the grievance procedure is more valuable in this case than merely talking to his supervisor. And -- and the -- the issue -- maybe -- maybe we’re missing it, but the issue is why isn’t there a very good reason to require him to go through the grievance procedure, number one, to -- to cut down on needless Federal court actions and, number two, under the -- sort of the general policy of favoring what collective bargaining agreements negotiate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARLAN",
      "speech": "Well, if his union had negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that required exhaustion, then it would be appropriate to make him go through it, but they didn’t do that. question. That would be an easier case. But why shouldn’t we require an exhaustion for those two"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARLAN",
      "speech": "Well, if I could go through the grievance process, I think you’ll see why this grievance process cannot be turned into an exhaustion process without this Court, in words that Justice Ginsburg used last week, inserting a lot of carets into the statute. That is, there are two stages of this grievance process over which Mr. Whitman has control. He can go to his -- his supervisor in an informal conversation. There will be no factfinding. There is no right to call witnesses. There is no right to present evidence. If he doesn’t like that -- and he has only 15 days to do it -- he can then appeal to the -- to the supervisor of the facility. Again, he has no right to present evidence. He has no right to any kind of factfinding. He has no right to a reasoned decision. Those are the --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARLAN",
      "speech": "They may and I’ll turn to that answer I was giving a moment ago to Justice Ginsburg, which is one of the problems here is that our client alleges in his supplemental complaint that when he first complained about this, he was singled out yet again for retaliatory testing. And so this is precisely the kind of case in which someone who is being subjected repeatedly to retaliatory tests would be worried. Now let me turn to the question of --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONNOR",
      "speech": "Well, Ms. Karlan, let me put one other element in here. Was -- was your client specifically told by the FLRA to bring a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARLAN",
      "speech": "He was -- he wasn’t told. He was advised by someone who said the FLRA has no jurisdiction here because this isn’t an unfair labor practice. Now, of course, what the Government wants him to do is to exhaust by going back to the FLRA which has already told him that it has no expertise on this matter. So let me turn to that third stage of the arbitration, or at least he asks his union to because under section 7121(b)(1)(C)(iii) of the statute, only noted, as long ago as Vaca against Sipes, that unions invoke arbitration in only a minuscule handful of cases, so that in Vaca against Sipes, it was 1 out of 900. There was a recent study, the most recent study I could find that was published, about Federal Government employees, dealt with civilian employees of the Army, and it looked at how often did the 31 different unions that represent civilian employees of the Army actually invoke arbitration vis-a-vis the number of grievances that were filed. And it found that in the years it looked at, no more than 6 percent got arbitration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
      "speech": "Well, why isn’t the thing to do here -- I -- I see that you are raising a significant question in respect to -- at least in my view, in respect to the -- an action that violates a regulation that violates a statute. Leave the Constitution aside, but it might violate a number of practices, good practices, et cetera. But why isn’t focusing on that the thing for the plaintiff here to do and 7 of your brief -- and he says, I would like you to invoke arbitration? And they might do it. Now, if he then -- they might file exceptions and they might win. But what you’re worried about is if they don’t win or if they don’t do it, they can go to court only if it involved an unfair labor practice or a major adverse personnel action. That’s what’s worrying you, I take it."

    {
      "speaker": "KARLAN",

The second is that the statute simply doesn’t say that. I can understand -- honestly, I can -- why this Court is in favor of exhaustion requirements.

It’s partly because of the word final in the APA, which applies here as well, and it’s also because of the common law of administrative law that requires people to exhaust their remedies."

Souter, because I think this Court has traditionally allowed individuals who are bringing constitutional Nothing in the CSRA changed that, and if I can explain why for just a moment, I think it’ll be helpful. If you look at this Court’s opinion in Fausto or you look at this Court’s opinion in Bush against Lucas or the opinion in Karahalios, which I think are the three leading cases from this Court construing the Civil Service Reform Act in -- in this kind of fashion, you’ll notice that they repeatedly refer to those acts as being comprehensive with regard to personnel actions. Personnel actions is not a casual phrase. It is a defined term in the CSRA. It’s defined in section 2302(a), which is -- was discussed in the Government’s brief at page 5, note 5. And you will notice there, if you read it, that they do include -- indeed, Congress in 1994 amended the statute to add to the list of personnel actions orders for psychiatric testing.

Now, drug testing is not attendant to his performance of his job. It is the condition of his holding the job in some sense that he pass the test.

Because petitioner failed to invoke the grievance procedures of the applicable collective bargaining agreement, his suit was properly dismissed. And if I may, just in a -- a moment or two, summarize the Government’s position as to the steps that an individual in petitioner’s position would have to take in order to obtain judicial review of a constitutional claim like this one. efforts to utilize the available administrative remedies under the CSRA itself, including any instance, the first two steps of the grievance process, talking to the immediate supervisor and then to the facility manager, would have been within petitioner’s control. And if those steps had proven unavailing, petitioner should have requested that the union take the case to arbitration, and then, if necessary, to the FLRA. Second, if at the end of the administrative process an avenue of judicial review is available under the CSRA itself, the employee must seek relief pursuant to that provision. And I think petitioner really concedes that point to be true; that is, if petitioner were raising a constitutional challenge to a major adverse action, such as dismissal, petitioner concedes not only that he would have been required to exhaust administrative remedies by -- by appealing to the Merit Systems Protection Board, but petitioner also concedes that we -- he would have had to seek judicial review in the manner specified by the CSRA, that is, by filing a petition for review of the MSPB’s decision in the district court. And finally, our position is that if at the review is unavailable under the CSRA, the employee may then obtain review of his constitutional challenge alone in district court, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure -- Procedure Act.

I can understand the constitutional provision which says Congress can -- can make exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Federal constitutional claims. But when Congress has gone to the trouble of providing for judicial review of any claims that are significant and just saying any other insignificant action, even though a constitutional violation is alleged in connection with it, if in fact it does not harm you that much, we’re not going to allow judicial review, what is -- what is wrong with that?

Now, in the ordinary case, when a Federal statute places limits on agency personnel and a particular category of plaintiffs falls within the zone of interest that was intended to be protected by that provision, then even if the statute that limits agency discretion itself doesn’t provide a private right of action, the Administrative Procedure Act would entitle a claimant to get into court and argue that the agency’s decision was contrary to law, namely the relevant statute. So if there were no question of CSRA conclusion, we would agree that the claimant could go into court raising a statutory challenge notwithstanding the absence of a private right of action in 45-108 itself.

And -- but again, I think all of these are perhaps potential alternative bases on which this complaint could have been dismissed, but it doesn’t alter the fact that an adequate basis for dismissal was available under the CSRA and the collective bargaining agreement. it’s simply a question of when the individual can file suit is to presuppose that the grievance procedures won’t work. And there’s no reason to assume that that will happen. That is, Congress manifested -- Congress in the CSRA enacted congressional findings to the effect that collective bargaining and -- and union activity in the public sector are in the public interest.

Congress has clearly manifested a preference for the inclusion of grievance procedures in collective bargaining agreements, and -- and given that express congressional preference, it doesn’t seem right for this Court to assume that the grievance procedures won’t work. And this seems to be an ideal example of a case that potentially implicates constitutional issues but that still falls squarely within the expertise of the union, the arbitrator, and the FLRA. That is, the dispute here concerns whether, in fact, petitioner was tested more frequently than his colleagues, and if so, what was the explanation? Was it simply random deviations? Was it potentially a -- a glitch in the computer program that was used to generate a random list of names, or was there some invidious motivation as -- as petitioner has suggested? The resolution of those types of questions falls entirely within the even though constitutional law per se is not what labor arbitrators are best at. to -- to Justice Scalia’s question about why shouldn’t the CSRA be read to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims altogether. I mean, we certainly think that if -- in a sense, that’s -- that’s a debate we would be happy to lose. That is, the Government has not suggested that we have an affirmative interest in preserving judicial review of those claims, and if the Court were looking for a -- the simplest solution to the problem, that solution would be -- have just as much to recommend it as petitioner’s solution, which is that you go straight into Federal district court. However, we don’t think that Congress has spoken with the degree of clarity that this Court’s decisions demand to preclude all judicial review of constitutional challenges, and we think the best way of reconciling that presumption of judicial review with the comprehensive nature of the CSRA scheme is to provide that claims -- constitutional claims are reviewable if, and only if, the plaintiff has made all reasonable efforts to utilize the available administrative remedies."

And we set this out quite carefully in our brief, as do the two union amici, as to what the purpose of the grievance procedure is here. It is not to create an exhaustion regime and certainly not to create an exhaustion regime with what the Government, at least, concedes under the statute, as now written, is not a personnel action. That is, the CSRA is quite comprehensive with regard to personnel actions, but it leaves to traditional sources of judicial enforcement things that are not personnel actions. And as this Court’s opinion in Bush against Lucas makes absolutely clear, a warrantless search of the kind to which our client was subjected is not a personnel action and, therefore, is not within the comprehensive scheme of the CSRA for dealing with personnel actions.
