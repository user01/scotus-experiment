      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The harmonized tariff schedule employs more than 9,000 individual categories and more than half-a-million words to classify every conceivable article of commerce for tariff purposes. This massive document was drafted initially by an international commission, and in 1988 it was enacted in its entirety as a law of the United States. Two terms ago in the Haggar case this Court held that courts should defer to the reasonable interpretive regulations adopted by the customs service to implement these complex tariff provisions. In the present case, however, the Federal Circuit held that it would give no weight whatever to the interpretive rulings adopted by the customs service to apply the tariff provisions in specific situations under the very same statutory provisions. The court, having concluded it would give no deference to the agency rulings, then held that the particular item involved in this case, known as a date planner, would not constitute a bound diary within the specific meaning of the tariff provision we have here before us. In our view, the court's method of analysis and its ultimate classification determination are both incorrect. In enacting a harmonized tariff schedule, Congress specified that -- its understanding and intent that the customs service would be responsible for interpreting and applying these provisions, and for that purpose Congress gave broad and varied types of interpretive authority to the agency. In particular, in 19 U.S.C. 1502, Congress provided that the agency could adopt rules and regulations for the classifications of goods under the tariff schedules, and it was under that provision that this Court applied Chevron and Haggar to say that reasonable interpretations of ambiguous provisions set forth in regulations should be applied by the courts. Now, Congress understood, however, that the regulations alone would not be sufficient to address the infinite myriad of small interpretive problems that arise under this kind of tariff legislation, and so Congress specified and gave authority to the agency to adopt binding interpretive rules for the purpose of applying the statute in these discrete situations."

What happened was that when Haggar was before this Court, the United States did not press the lower court to apply what is now to be called Haggar or Chevron deference because the Federal Circuit had said in Haggar that it would give no weight to customs service interpretations, and so at the time the case was in the Court of International Trade, that court was not asked to give that type of deference to the agency's interpretation --"

One is that the vast majority of these rulings, as I understand it, are just you'll classify this, you'll classify that, with no reasons elaborated, and the other is that you don't have one decisionmaker, as you would have, say, for the EPA. Instead, you have decisions that are dispersed among 45 ports of entry."

Citibank the Court had a similar situation where there was a subsidiary determination that was then reviewed by the headquarters office to result in a final agency determination, which is the process that we've gone through with respect to these rulings, and the Court said, well, that doesn't result in a change of view, it results in a proper application of the agency's ruling process. With respect to the first point, the respondent says, well, there are 10,000 a year of these kinds of rulings made in the head -- in the regional offices. In fact, we do not claim that there's -- we are unaware of any of those rulings in which there would be what the Court, in the opinion you authored for the Court in the Variable Annuity case call the deliberative conclusions. It is only the deliberative conclusions that set forth the actual interpretations of provisions that the Court can look to to defer to. It's not simply the result. And in most of the simple tariff entry at issue determinations, of course it's a very simplified procedure. It has to be, because of the volume of transactions at issue, and those kinds of entry-level port determinations are very simple, and the Trade Bar Association brief acknowledges they contain almost in every instance no discussion. They just contain the sort of a statement that 12 apples come in as apples."

How did Congress intend the agency to function? The best evidence of that is probably the agency's regulations pursuant to the authority that Congress gave the agency to provide for a binding ruling program. The agency's regulations specify that the port service's rulings are precedential and binding, but they don't go on to say, because it's up to this Court to say, the extent to which those precedential binding determinations are to be given deference by the courts, and all I was trying to say was that it seems to me that when this Court has addressed interpretive rulings in prior cases, like Variable Annuity, PBGC v.

What it says is, the Court of International Trade shall make its determinations upon the basis of the record before the court. The importers tell us, the textile importers tell us there's hardly ever a dispute of fact. You know, this is what it is. Everybody knows that, that almost all these things concern how you apply a tariff or -- to the facts and the Customs Trade Bar tells us that if we set down the distinction you want to make between facts and application of the tariff, this whole thing's unworkable, because people would never be able to figure out, or hardly ever, what's going on, which is which. So that would seem to be a pretty strong argument that Justice O'Connor's initial characterization was right as opposed to the application of these tariffs, and I'd like you to respond to that."

      "speaker": "JONES",

There are other doctrines, burden of proof, presumption of regularity, that go to about how you decide what facts are and how the facts apply to law. Chevron is simply a doctrine about how does a court decide what the law is, and in this case the agency made a determination about legal issues and said what it believed a diary was, for example, or what it believed the law, properly interpreted was, bound for this purpose is. Having made that legal determination, it's then up to the Court of International Trade to decide whether these facts represent such an item. Of course, the agency's binding rulings state its own view of what the facts are and how they apply to these legal interpretations, but that's what the Court of International Trade has the right to do de novo, to decide whether these facts fit within the legal determination, the legal interpretation that the agency has expressed in the binding ruling."

It's to be upheld if it's reasonable.

Correll, this Court held that revenue rulings should be upheld when they're reasonable, and the Court emphasized that it was based on the expertise of the agency and the fact, to quote the Court, that it doesn't sit as a committee of revision to perfect the administration of the tax laws. The Congress told the agency to do that by authorizing it to issue all necessary rules and regs. Now, the tax counsel amici says no, that case was really about a regulation, not about a ruling. Well, that's simply and flatly, clearly wrong. The regulation they cite had something to do with the procedures as used to make a claim for a deduction. When Justice Marshall was Solicitor General, he filed the Government's brief in the Correll case. His successor, Solicitor General Griswold, filed a reply brief. Neither of those briefs mention any regulation. They rely just on the revenue ruling of the service and ask the Court to defer to it, which is what Justice Stewart's opinion for the Court said was appropriate."

There were Treasury decisions issued by the Secretary, and there were Commissioner's rulings that were published in what's called the Cumulative Bulletin. The Cumulative Bulletin pointed out before 1960 that the Commissioner's rulings were not approved by the Secretary, therefore they weren't binding on the agency. In 1961, the Commissioner was given interpretive authority in a regulation we've cited in our brief, and that interpretive authority is subject, however, to the approval of the Secretary, and since that time, what are now called Revenue Rules, with a capital R, are issued by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary. They are functionally the same as Treasury decisions were before 1960, and in the cases before 1960 the Court had pointed out Treasury decisions were entitled to substantial deference, and even in Skidmore the Court pointed out they were often decisive. After Correll -- I'm sorry. After Correll and indeed, I think after Chevron, but in any event in that time frame, Justice Marshall wrote an opinion for the Court, bringing this full circle, in which he said that a Treasury decision issued in connection with a customs ruling should be given -- should be accepted if it's reasonably -- if it's sufficiently reasonable. That's the way -- that's why I pointed out that revenue rulings and Treasury decisions and customs interpretive rulings have followed a path that should lead to the same result."

And again, I think I can make this more concrete by pointing out that the -- here's the way it worked in this case. The ruling said that a diary is a book for the keeping of a record of daily events, and that that definition is broad enough to encompass the commercial usage of that term, which is a business diary, which has been commonly employed and, under cases like Stone and Downer, the agency and the courts are supposed to consider in deciding what the terms of the tariff provisions mean. Now, what the court of appeals said was, well, we think that -- we want to add two things to that. We want to say it has to be room for extensive notations, and it has to be retrospective, but the diary definition doesn't say that in the dictionary. There -- you can find alternative dictionary definitions, and the commercial usage is inconsistent with that."

By comparison, the headquarters rulings are thorough, they provide a definite description of the text, and internally the agency has advised its regional offices to not include a full discussion of text, and I'm going outside the record, but I have to answer your question, and internally the understanding is that if the issue is complicated enough it will get referred to the headquarters. Now, that doesn't mean that complicated issues aren't resolved at the field office, but it does mean that when the field offices ordinarily determine them it's not with a deliberative explanation.

Haggar arose when Congress passed a particular provision of the tariff schedule that left a gap to be filled, and they delegated that filling of the gap, specific gap to the customs service. It was matters incidental to assembly outside of the United States, and it listed such as, it left obvious gaps for filling. They went, and on a notice and comment basis, had a regulation promulgated that furthered that definition. I don't view it as interpretive. I view it as legislative, and that's what the customs service did, and this Court found that that created normal law similar to a statute. That --"

It relates to what things are made of. The schedule, this particular provision, this particular chapter, 4820, relates to paper, and what this explanatory note says, if things come with packaging that has metal, leather, et cetera, they will still be classified as paper that the other substance, the other material will not predominate. Everything here in 4820 has to be held together in some fashion, because the chapter note says that these -- this provision does not cover loose sheets, so everything has to be --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Coll, there's one piece of this, before we get to the application of it, that I find vastly puzzling. Maybe there's an easy answer to it. You talked about the provision that says, de novo review, but then you quickly said, and yes, there's a presumption of correctness. Those two seem to be at loggerheads. Why are they not? You told me that the facts found by customs get a presumption of correctness. On the other hand, the facts are gone over de novo."

    {
      "speaker": "COLL",
      "speech": "It's a burden-of-proof issue, Your Honor. It's a matter that because there's a presumption of correctness, then the burden is slightly different on the plaintiff, the importer, than it might otherwise be, that he has a presumption that is working against him, and it's a burden of proof. It doesn't relate to deference. But focusing on chapter 4820 and why this is not appropriate interpretation and would be unreasonable even under Chevron, though we don't believe Chevron applies, the statute is fairly clear. The statute tells us that there are diaries, and there are similar articles, and then breaks it down further to diaries bound in all these other items that would be similar articles."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but I had a little difficulty with your argument there. If you turn to pages 17 and 18 of your brief, on page 18 you make that argument. You say, in effect, diaries bound is to be contrasted with other, and one reason that you say that a diary does not fall -- one reason that you say that this does not fall within the diary category is that it's not adapted for exhaustive recording of past events. It's a schedule. But in the statute itself, which you quote on the preceding page, on 17, there is the term in 4820.10.20, which you quote only with ellipsis, and that term refers to diaries. It also refers to notebooks and address books, bound, which does not seem to carry the same connotation. The notebooks and address books don't seem to carry any connotation one way or the other with respect to either recording past events or noting future schedules. If we don't engage in the ellipsis that you did and we refer to these other examples as having some bearing on what a diary is, your argument is considerably weaker, isn't it?"

      "speaker": "COLL",

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but I assume that they're not intending to -- you know, to exclude the interpretive rule, you know, noscitur a sociis. We sort of know each term by those associated with it, and if that interpretive canon applies, then there isn't a simple contrast between diaries and others. There's a contrast between diaries, notebooks, and address books and others, and notebooks and address books and others do not have the kind of connotation that you want us to read so clearly into diary."

      "speaker": "COLL",

The chapter notes tell us -- and the chapter notes are statutory, and the chapter notes tell us that we have to start at 4820. We can't start at 4820.10.20, or at 4810.40. We have to start at the top, and our argument is centered on the fact that it's diaries and similar articles."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I understand your point there perfectly well, but by the same token we can't ignore 48 -- 4820.10.20, either, and it seems to me that as the statute becomes progressively more detailed, it becomes progressively more indicative of what it may have in mind by similar articles, and it seems to me that by the ellipsis as you quote 4810.20 on page 18, you are in effect telling us to ignore whatever interpretive value there might be to considering notebooks and address books, and that does have some interpretive value, because notebooks and address books do not have a connotation of time past, time future, in the sense that your argument assumes."

It does not enhance their whole case, because I believe that it does not enhance the particular point, which is that these are conclusions of fact and law as to which one cannot dissect neatly those interpretive legal norms that would be required for Chevron deference. But in terms of process, in terms of notice, in terms of procedural regularity, it certainly is better than receiving a letter in the mail 2 years after you've gotten a classification ruling telling you that the classification ruling no longer is effective."

      "speaker": "COLL",
      "speech": "As I read the Haggar decision, there was an argument made at that time that Haggar, or the class -- the regulation at issue in Haggar was not entitled to Chevron deference. It was not entitled to any deference because of de novo review. We have a legislative regulation there and as I understand the Court, the Court was trying to explain how those two elements, a statutory regulation that creates a legal norm, would -- could still be harmonized with the de novo review feature, and used as an example there that could still be applied to the facts. We don't have that neat dissection. One can't surgically pull out the interpretive law from the fact in these types of classification rules."

      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "Thank you. I think I have two points. Justice Breyer, as we understand the issue that you've been addressing, the Court expressly confronted and resolved it in the Haggar case. The Court quoted the same provision of the statute that you're quoting and said that the responsibility of the Court of International Trade to make its determinations on the record before it, meant that it was to assemble the record and make factual determinations and apply those facts to the law, but in -- the Court said that deference can be given to the regulations without impairing the authority of the court to make factual determinations and to apply those determinations to the law de novo. And what the Court said in Haggar was that the regulations, the interpretive regulations of the agency were part of the law that the Court of International Trade was to apply, which is our position precisely in this case. I believe that -- I want to say one more thing about this deliberative conclusion point. Now, the cases that have described, that you look to the deliberative conclusion to find -- in the interpretive ruling to decide whether to give deference to the agency's reasonable conclusions, involve rulings in particular. In Martin v. OSHRC, Occupational Safety & Health Review Commission, the Court applied the same principle of Chevron deference to an agency's citation when the citation had been issued in the -- precisely in the format that Congress authorized for interpretive purposes, so I think you may need to look to the nature of the regulatory ruling -- rulemaking program to decide, you know, what sort of specificity is required. But in the context of the customs service rulings, I think as a practical matter you're going to be looking at headquarters rulings that contain the deliberative analysis to find out what the agency's reasonable interpretation is."
