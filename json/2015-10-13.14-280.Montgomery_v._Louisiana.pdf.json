And the Supremacy Clause States that when, quote, \"the laws of the United States,\" unquote, apply, quote, \"the judges\" ­­ and this is ­­ these are the key words ­­ \"in every State shall be bound thereby.\" There is no such thing as supreme Federal law that depends on whether a particular State voluntarily makes Federal precedence binding.

A major advantage here is if you say that the State courts are bound by the Teague exceptions by the Constitution, then when it goes to Federal habeas, there will be very deferential AEDPA review. If you say that the redress question, as the rationale of Danforth indicated, in State court is a matter of State law, then when the issue goes to Federal habeas, AEDPA will not apply because the State court will not have decided the Federal issue. And that is a ­­ it is a major difference. You would actually be weakening the Federal habeas statute to recognize jurisdiction in this case. And this Court will benefit from having de novo percolation in the lower Federal courts, the lower habeas courts, all of which will be out the window if there's jurisdiction in this case, because the lower Federal habeas courts will only be able, and the courts reviewing them on appeal, to apply the highly deferential AEDPA review."

Standard Oil is like Miller itself, where the issue was: What does the Eighth Amendment require? That's a Federal constitutional issue it applied. In Standard Oil, as a combination of statute regulations and Federal common law, Federal law controlled the question.

The only other time that this Court has ever invalidated a mandatory sentencing provision was Woodson v. North Carolina in 1976.

And as Justice Alito's opinion for the Court in United States v. Rodriguez recognized, even the top of a mandatory guidelines range was not truly mandatory. So even under the mandatory guidelines, which for Sixth Amendment purposes were treated as if they established elements of the offense, for the purposes that we're looking at here, they are not mandatory in the same way, so that Booker brought about a procedural change."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DREEBEN",
      "speech": "Justice Sotomayor, I don't think there is any substantive, to use the word, daylight between Petitioner's position and ours. The description of the crime at issue as punishable by mandatory life imprisonment and treating that as a category, I think, sums up the reality of what is happening. We broke it out into its component parts because I think it facilitates the analysis of it to understand that Miller does have a procedural component. Sentencing courts must now consider the mitigating characteristics of age, but it also, and more fundamentally in our view, contains a substantive component that required a change in the law. Now, the change here was expanding the range of outcomes. Previously when this Court has analyzed substantive changes in the law, there have been changes that restricted the form of outcome; say, for example, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, forbidding punishment at all. But I think that if you trace back the origins of the substantive category to Justice Harlan's opinion in Mackey, this is still faithful to what Justice Harlan had in mind. Justice Harlan said the clearest case of an injustice in not applying a rule retroactively is when it puts off­limits altogether criminal punishment. He did not say that it was the only case. And I think that if you consider what is going on in Miller and the reasons for the rule, the Court made very clear that it believed that of the 2,000 people that were in prison and under mandatory life for juvenile homicide, the Court believed that that penalty was frequently disproportionate, that it would be uncommonly imposed in the future, and that it was not a sentence that was consistent in most cases with the mitigating characteristics of youth that have been recognized in Roper and in Graham and then in Miller."

      "speaker": "DREEBEN",

The Court has said that a substantive rule creates a significant risk that the person is serving a sentence that's not appropriate for that person, maybe not even legally available for that purpose. It did not say absolutely conclusively proves it. It said significant risk. And in contrast, when the Court has talked about procedural rules, rules that govern the manner in which a case is adjudicated, it has said that the likelihood or potential for a different outcome is speculative. And I think if you put this case on the speculative­significant risk axis, this case falls in the significant risk domain precisely because of the reasons why the Court said it was deciding Miller. The reasons why the Court decided Miller had to do with the reduced culpability of youth and the capacity of youth to mature, change, and achieve a degree of rehabilitation that is consistent with something less than the most harsh sentence available for youths who commit murder ­­ a terrible crime, but still the harshest sentence, the Court thought, would be reserved for the worst of the worst, which is, in fact, what Louisiana said when it amended its statutes substantively to conform them to Miller. It said life without parole should be reserved for the worst offenders who commit the worst crimes. And so when you combine the fact that this is not a rule that ­­ that only governs procedure ­­ it doesn't just govern evidence; it also mandates changes in outcomes as an available option ­­ with the very genesis of the Miller rule in a conclusion that, for the people in this class, the appropriateness of the punishment of the harshest degree, life without parole, will be relatively uncommon, it seems clear that the Miller rule falls on the substantive side of the axis rather than on the procedural side of the axis."

We're in an odd position with respect to jurisdiction because we won below and we'd win in the Fifth Circuit on Federal habeas, which has found that Miller is not retroactive. Why then do we not contest jurisdiction? We believe and still believe that this is a straightforward case. Not ­­ and Justice Kagan, it's not a standard Michigan v. Long case, but it's an interwoven case, meaning that the ­­ the State court took Teague lock, stock, and barrel. Now, there is no doubt, Justice Scalia, that in the ­­ in the Taylor ­­ in the previous Louisiana Supreme Court opinions, that the State said we are voluntarily adopting Teague. There is no doubt about that. So we think the question is whether that raises the possibility of an advisory opinion from this Court. And why do we say it doesn't? Well, because in cases like Coleman v. Thompson and Eddings v. Oklahoma, the Court said where the Federal law holding is integral to the State court's disposition of the matter, there is no risk of an advisory opinion. And later, in Coleman, the Court said only if resolution of the Federal issue in court could not affect the judgment is it at risk of an advisory opinion. So here we don't think there is a risk of an advisory opinion. Of course, it is within the realm of possibility. We doubt that it's going to happen, but it could happen that on remand the Louisiana Supreme Court could say, well, we've seen what you think about Teague and we're going to adopt our own retroactivity standards, as some States have done. They could do that. The question is: Does that make this Court's opinion advisory? And we think not.

    {
      "speaker": "DUNCAN",
      "speech": "I understand that. But making the sentence different doesn't necessarily mean make it substantive under the Teague framework. Here's another way of looking at it. The defendant in a ­­ a juvenile murderer who committed ­­ who committed murder and is serving a life­without­parole sentence today, pre­Miller, is not facing a punishment that the law cannot impose on him. And we know that from Miller because Miller said the Court's decision does not preclude that punishment. And so that goes to finality. The finality interests underlying convictions do not yield where the State still has the power to impose that punishment. Finality interests yield ­­ Justice Harlan explained in Mackey and this Court adopted in Teague, finality interests yield only where the State lacks the power. That's where the finality interests crumble, so to speak, because the State no longer can impose that category of penalty. So that would go for Roper. It would go for Graham. It would go for Justice Breyer's sedition or witch crimes. If ­­ if ­­ if somebody's in jail because they were accused of being a witch, then the State has no finality interest in keeping that person in jail. But by the same token, if ­­ if ­­ if the punishment is death for a juvenile, the State has no finality interest in doing that. So leaving the punishment on the table is crucial. If he doesn't take it off, it's not substantive. The second policy reason for Teague is avoiding the adverse consequences of retrial. And we think Miller is even more clearly not substantive under that standard, because categorical rules apply retroactively, Justice Harlan explained, because they don't carry the adverse consequences of retrial. They don't make you go back and redo the trial and unearth old facts and ­­ and drain State resources and come up with distorted ­­ distorted retrials. Miller, by its nature, envisions a fact­intensive hearing that considers multiple characteristics at the time of the crime."

Miller is about the step before whether to give a parole hearing, whether the person can be eligible for parole at the outset. That's the inquiry that we're talking about in Miller, and that's quite different from a parole hearing. The fact of the matter is, though, is that applying Miller retroactively inevitably turns the Miller ­­ the retroactive Miller hearing into a parole hearing, which ­­ which shows that it doesn't quite work in terms of adverse ­­"

And the ­­ the ­­ the rule that a mandatory can't exist is central to making that ­­ that was the whole point of the Miller opinion. So if that's the correct analysis for watershed rule, procedural rule that's retroactive ­­ if I'm right about that, why doesn't it fit within that category?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUNCAN",
      "speech": "Well, let's take the first one, the point. It's not just implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. The way that the ­­ the watershed rule has been stated, the first ­­ the first prong of it is it has to alter our understanding of bedrock procedural elements necessary to fundamental fairness. And this would be a strange case to find that in, because Miller itself doesn't represent a bedrock revolution in sentencing practices. It takes a sentencing practice from another area and puts it in this new area. So it's an incremental change in that sense. It's not a wholesale discovery of a new bedrock procedural element, the way we had in ­­ in a case like Gideon v. Wainwright. So ­­ and ­­ and I think this Court explained in Whorton v. Bockting that it's not enough that the rule be fundamental in some ­­ in some abstract sense ­­ right? ­­ but it has to itself represent a change in bedrock procedural understandings. And we don't think Miller does that. We also don't think it's necessary to an accurate determination of a sentence. It would enhance the accuracy of the sentence, but it's not necessary. And the other point there is this Court has never hold that a ­­ held that a pure sentencing rule can qualify under watershed, because, after all, this Court has on many occasions said that a watershed rule is necessary to the accurate determination of guilt or innocence, and here we're talking about a sentence. So we ­­ we agree with the United States that watershed procedural analysis is not the way to go here, but it does raise an interesting question. In Summerlin ­­ because, after all, we do ­­ we do part company quite strongly from the United States when ­­ when the United States says we need an outcome­expanding alteration to the definition of substantive rules under Teague. We say that's ­­ that's not just a slight tweak to Teague. What that is is a change in the understanding of what a substantive rule is. Substantive rules under Teague analysis have never depended on the frequency with which new outcomes might ­­ might come about under the new procedures. In fact, in Summerlin ­­ and this goes back to my original point about the framework. Summerlin explained that a criminal defendant under a procedural rule does have the opportunity of getting a more lenient outcome under the new procedures. So ­­ and nonetheless, Summerlin said that such procedural rules are not applied retroactively. And so, as ­­ Justice Alito, as you were saying, the difference between a substantive and a procedural rule under Teague is not whether it's very likely or very, very likely to result in a new outcome. It's about whether the new rule categorically removes the power of the State to impose a category of punishment. That's what a ­­ that's what a categorical rule does. That is not what Miller does, right? Miller may express an expectation about the way that Miller hearings will come out. And that may or may not come ­­ come to pass in the future. Who knows, right? We can point to cases where criminal defendants have had Miller hearings and have still received life without parole, and I can point to several in particular from the State of Louisiana under its new Miller procedures, but the point being is that the idea of changing outcomes, which is what the United States' entire argument depends on, is built into the procedural side of Teague and not the substantive side.

And you can go down the line with all those cases, the Beard case and the Sawyer case. Those are cases in which the defendant could have said, well, seriously ­­ seriously diminished accuracy.

And this Court didn't make that rule retroactive, and found that it was procedural and non­watershed at the same time. So we take issue with that. Just a few more words about the United States' proposed expansion of Teague.

And so that ­­ if ­­ any defendant in these capital sentencing cases we've just been talking about, O'Dell and Sawyer and Beard, would now have the argument handed to them by the United States new rule that says, well, that new rule gave me the opportunity for a better outcome.

      "speech": "Well, I just have to ­­ just have to push back on the premise a little bit, where ­­ our ­­ our position is not that a substantive rule is about what punishments are on the table. A substantive rule is about whether a State categorically no longer has the power to impose a category of punishment. Here, it's clear from the Miller opinion and from the Grayer ­­ from the Graham opinion that the relevant category is life without parole. The State still has the ability to impose that punishment. And that's what ­­ that's a sharp distinction from what a procedural rule is. And the United States' new conception of what a substantive rule is would blur that. It would blur that, and it would call into question all of the capital sentencing cases. And I heard a question ­­ I don't remember which Justice asked it ­­ about Booker. And my reaction to that is ­­ but Booker as a matter of the Sixth Amendment made a sentencing guideline non­mandatory, and it surely opened up new sentencing outcomes. And so by ­­ by what reason could a ­­ could a Federal habeas petitioner now not say under the United States' new test Booker is now retroactive, or Alleyne, for that matter? Alleyne overturned the mandatory minimum under the Sixth Amendment, opening up new sentencing outcomes. Why couldn't a Federal defendant on Federal habeas say, now I ought to get the benefit of that rule retroactively? Our position is those cases ­­ Booker, Alleyne, Apprendi ­­ are clearly procedural, as this Court explained in ­­ in Summerlin ­­ Schriro v. Summerlin. They're clearly procedural under the Teague rubric. And what the United States would do is blur those categories. If there are no further questions."

      "speaker": "BERNSTEIN",
      "speech": "What this fantastic discussion has shown is why the Court, as it always has in the past, should keep the Teague exceptions a matter of equitable discretion, rather than constitutional requirement. The Court has much more freedom, generally speaking, on the matter of equitable discretion than it does on constitutional requirements. There is no way to look at the prior precedents of the Court in Teague in any of those courts to say, oh, here's what our equitable discretion is. The only time you get retroactivity is when the Constitution requires it. That would have been a really short opinion. And that was not that. Now, to turn quickly to the cases that have been cited: The critical difference between this case on the one hand and Merrell Dow and Three Affiliated Tribes on the other hand is that jurisdiction under this statute is question by question under Murdock. In Merrell Dow, the question of whether the defendant's conduct had violated the Federal drug labeling laws was a Federal question. The Court never would have gone on to say, and we're also going to Federalize the remedy. We're going to decide whether it's lost profits or out­of­pocket costs. Similarly, in Three Affiliated Tribes, there was no question that there was a Federal statute that limited State court jurisdiction. The only issue was the scope of that statute. Here we have the opposite. There is no question that the Federal statute does not apply to the State court, and yet people say you should decide the scope question, even though the underlying issue may be one of State law. And then, finally, to the Solicitor General's new cake­and­eat­it­too argument that there is going to be review in this Court and de novo review on habeas: The statutory language in 2254(d) is pretty broad. Quote: \"Any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceeding.\" The only claim in this case is remedy. This case was filed after Miller was decided. The only issue in this case is redress. And it would be a very wonderful turn if you could say on the one hand that 2254(d) doesn't apply, but on the other hand, 1257 applies when it ­­ when it requires a, quote, \"right claimed under Federal law,\" which gets to your question, Justice Kagan. Is it enough that a State court says, we voluntarily want to be bound? And the best answer to that is not only in the cases I would recommend ­­ Moore, which is cited in Merrell Dow, which goes out of its way to show how Federal law is binding on the intrastate commerce conduct in that case before saying the Court could review it ­­ but it's also plain in the language of the Supremacy Clause. Binding Federal law means binding in all 50 States, and that's why the statute also says \"right under Federal law.\" Thank you."

A second point on the merits: Miller said that juvenile homicide offenders should not have to die in prison with no chance for rehabilitation and no consideration of youth. That important rule changed the substantive outcomes available. Indeed, this Court said that life without prison should be uncommon.
