      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Well, it -- it's certainly much older today. It's about 40 years older today. The condition the -- the legislative history doesn't discuss the condition of the fort in particular detail. It's important to recognize that the military fort was built for temporary use -- today, some -- almost a century ago, and in 1960 had been built for temporary use, you know, more than 50, 60, or 70 years ago. So it wouldn't at all have been surprising if there had been a state of decay in 1960. And of course, when Congress passed the 1960 statute, there was no indication at all -- certainly not on the face of the statute, or in the legislative history that's contained in respondent's lodging -- that it had in mind a historic preservation goal, or that it had in mind that -- that it would require the Secretary of the Interior to undertake the enormous financial responsibility of having to restore a century-old fort."

As we point out in note 1 of our reply brief, the Department of the Interior has spent more than $3 million over the past decade or 15 years on repair and maintenance projects at the fort. It's also true that the tribe itself has engaged in historic restoration efforts at the fort with the support of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the Interior, and with the assistance of private, State, and even -- in some cases -- Federal tax dollars."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Well, when Congress places land in trust for Indians, it has two well-settled meanings that this Court has recognized. First, it places a restraint on the alienation of property, and second, it immunizes the property from State taxation. And if you look at pages 6 and 7 of the respondent's lodging, that indicates that in 1958, when there was discussion about what to do with Fort Apache, the tribe itself encouraged the Department to have Congress place the land in trust so that it was in a nontaxable status like the surrounding reservation lands. Now, we know from the first Mitchell decision decided by this Court that simply placing property in trust does not in itself create a substantive right to money damages."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But there was an enormous difference in that case in that the Indians managed the land. Under the General Allotments Act, the idea was to make the individual owner autonomous. Here, I think it's not disputed that this land has been operated by the U.S. Government, and the U.S. Government has exclusive control."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, that -- that may be true in the factual sense, but the 1960 act -- that is, that the Federal Government is using the property, but the 1960 act -- quite unlike the General Allotment Act -- specifically reserves to the Government the right to use the property for Government uses. And in that respect, we think the trust relationship created by the statute in this case is much more limited than the one that was created by the statute in Mitchell I, and the existence of factual Federal control cannot in itself give rise to a damages action under the Tucker Act."

    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Well, I -- I think generally, the \"administrative use\" can refer to executive uses, and is a very broad term. In that respect, I think it's instructive that Congress used that term. Nevertheless, I think that -- that \"administrative purposes\" has to be read with school purposes, and can be read to refer to both uses for storage and the like, and also for administrative purposes used by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to undertake activities at Fort Apache or -- or on the surrounding reservation. So in that respect, it's administrative for the purpose of the Department of the Interior, who operates activities there through the local agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Now --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Oh, well, our position would be that the vast majority, if not all, was -- well, that's not true. The -- the vast majority of the property has been within the Government's control, but it's important to recognize that the court of appeals' decision remands for building-by-building, in a sense, trial on the existence of Federal use and control. And the tribe does have access to the Fort Apache property. The tribe is there. The tribe even has a -- a cultural museum that it operates on the property. So it's -- it's not as though this is a Federal enclave --"

      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "If you look at appendix A to the tribe's complaint, which -- which has a detailed building- by-building analysis of the ways in which the building don't meet certain requirements, I think it's fair to say the tribe's damages claim extends to all the buildings at Fort Apache and that, therefore, it may extend to buildings over which the Federal Government is not -- have any active use or -- or control. But we don't think that a damages action can be brought against the United States based on some fact- bound, manipulable notion of Federal control."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, if -- can we talk just for a moment about the analogy? And we'll call it just that, the area of private trusts.

      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "That is true and it's much unlike the typical common law trust, but the -- the most fundamental reason, Justice Kennedy, is we don't think that a court should have to plumb through the common law to determine whether or not Congress established a right to damages against the United States in this case. And it's also true -- if you look at the common law, the first thing you -- you're met with -- with -- is with the general rule that you can't get breach of trust damages against the sovereign. So you'd have to get -- not only you'd have to get around the courts --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but that -- but, I mean, that's the whole purpose of the Tucker Act. I mean, to -- to plead sovereign immunity begs the question. That's exactly the question before us."

    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Well, and I agree, Justice Scalia, and we think that that question should be answered by looking to the act of Congress on which the tribe relies, which is the 1960 act."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but it would have seemed to me, following Justice Scalia's question and my own, that if the law of trusts gave a clear indication one way or the other that there was a liability, then the Tucker Act analysis might -- might be different accordingly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "With respect, I disagree. And I think the Mitchell I case establishes that. In Mitchell I, both the Court of Claims and the dissenters on this Court reasoned that because the General Allotment Act placed land, quote, in trust, that therefore one could look to the common law and therefore one could import into the Tucker Act all the liabilities that would follow against a private trustee, even liabilities that would result in damages actions. A majority of this Court rejected that analysis. Now, in Mitchell II, the Court specifically affirmed the result in Mitchell I, and it emphasized that Mitchell II was different because in that case, the Court had statutes and regulations that created specific management duties that could be fairly interpreted as mandating the payment of compensation for the breach of those duties. Now, the court of appeals recognized at page 18a of the petition appendix -- and the -- even the tribe recognizes on page 11 of its brief -- that the 1960 act doesn't set forth any specific management duties on the part of the Government."

This case involves a breach of trust action, a claim for damages based on the alleged breach of trust which the tribe grounds in the 1960 act, and --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, I understand. But part of the question we have is to what extent did the Government assume duties beyond immunizing the property from State taxation and preventing its alienation. Did they have any additional duties? And I'm not clear on whether you've told me they had a duty not to destroy it or not."

Then the tribe might have a claim for just compensation. The tribe has referred to some just compensation cases in its brief, but it hasn't brought a just compensation claim in this case. The tribe also might seek to bring a damages action under the Federal Torts Claimed Act -- Tort Claims Act for some kind of destruction of property. The tribe hasn't brought that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So you are -- to this extent, you're differing from counsel's position before the Federal Circuit, because I believe at that level, counsel was asked if the United States could dynamite all the buildings to the ground with no liability to the tribe, and the answer was yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Well, it's -- it's not clear to me the context in which that question came up. But I also think that it's true that if the Secretary decided that it was necessary to level a building because it proves an attractive nuisance to school children, or because it was desirable to build a more -- newer and better educational facility at the fort, that the 1960 act would authorize the Secretary to do that. But -- but we do recognize that there are other principles in this area stemming from the Fifth Amendment, a source of substantive law, stemming possibly from the Federal Torts Claims Act, another source of substantive law, which aren't invoked in this case, which might be implicated based on the Government's management of the property."

They -- they specifically govern the generation of profits or proceeds for the Indian tribe, and in that case, the Court held that the violation of those duties, grounded in a statute or regulation, gave rise to a money damages action under the Tucker Act. This case is --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "In -- in effect, I think what you're saying is that there are no trust duties. There's a peculiarity here. The word trust in -- as you're using it in the argument, simply has those two implications: don't give it away and place it in a -- in a condition or -- or, by virtue of the word trust, it is in a condition to avoid taxation."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I think you're saying that there are no fiduciary duties beyond that. If there is any duty beyond that, it's got to come from the Constitution, or it's got to come from a specific provision of -- of a statute creating a duty not necessarily as -- as that of a trustee, but simply as a statutory duty. Isn't that correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "That's correct when the tribe comes into court under the Tucker Act and asserts a claim for monetary damages against the United States Treasury. We're dealing against an area of sovereign immunity where the United States is immune from damages for breach of trust unless Congress --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

There may be some obligations under the Fifth Amendment to protect property, et cetera, but as a trustee, it has no fiduciary obligations other than the ones that are mentioned."

In Mitchell II, the Court emphasized throughout its decision and -- and discussed the statutes and regulations in detail for more than four pages. The control stemmed from specific statutory and regulatory duties that were created by Congress in that case, and the Court found that the violation of those specific duties, which could be fairly -- fairly interpreted as mandating compensation, gave rise to a damages claim against the United States. In this case, the tribe can't point to a single statute or regulation, and the only statute it relies in this case -- in this Court is the 1960 act that creates any --"

And my question is -- Justice Breyer a minute ago was saying, well, what would be different if we added certain words.

Simply putting these buildings in trust does not create any fiduciary obligations. But the Secretary did take control. It's not mandatory; it's voluntary. And that's why this case is exactly like Mitchell II. In Mitchell I, there's no nexus between the General Allotment Act and managing a forest.

And we said, what do you mean they're -- they're ours? With an $8 million repair bill and you had total control, and you feel you have the right to destroy property that you don't own? And this deprives Congress of the benefit that Congress intended. So here's the executive branch saying, we don't care what Congress gave you. We'll make sure you don't get anything except a -- a pile of rubble. And someone has got to pay for that, and the tribe should not pay for that. And that's the point of the damage claim. We went to the Secretary and they said -- after a year of wasting my time at the solicitor's office, they said -- finally, the Special Assistant to the Secretary said, you're going to have to sue us because we're not going to give you the money, and we feel we have the right to destroy this property. And that's -- whether it's demolition by neglect or, as the Department of Justice said in the circuit court below, since you don't have title to this property, contrary to the plain text of the act, we have the right to dynamite it. And somehow it's been held in some kind of purgatory state where what Congress intended to give to the tribe wasn't really intended to give to the tribe. It's a -- it's a plaything for the BIA to play with and destroy. And that's not the fiduciary relationship that this Court has been noted for in -- in respect to a one- on-one relationship.

We don't want them to -- they don't have to restore it back to its -- as they say -- Old West shape. We're just asking it -- for the condition that when we got it from Congress, Congress said, here's the gift. Here is the Fort Apache, but we're going to give the Secretary just a limited use, and when that need expires, then the Secretary has no right because but for that act, the Secretary can't even set foot on that property.

That is, the statute, the 1960 statute, gave the Government the right to use this for -- for school and administrative purposes as long as they wanted to. So at -- looking at it from 1960, that could be forever. They might have wanted to use it as a school forever, and then the tribe would have nothing."

      "speaker": "BRAUCHLI",
      "speech": "Well, the -- to answer that question, Your Honor, the measure of damages always could be measured against a reasonable trustee. If they kept using for 100 years, then of course, there's going to be normal -- you know, even normal wear and tear, but there's still -- that's something for the trial court to sort out as to the measure of damages. I mean, what is reasonable -- what is reasonable to repair, what is reasonable not to under the circumstances. That's -- that's a question for the trier of fact as to the measure of damages. But, you know, the reality of the situation is that the need has expired except for about 10 buildings. In this -- I mentioned the Bostwick case because in the Bostwick case, the United States had open, free use -- unrestricted use of a private home, and they -- they committed waste. And there was -- and this Court -- Court -- they were sued. The United States was sued and the Court said that there's an implied covenant against waste even those the lease is silent as to that duty. And I think the analogy is here in the trust situation. When -- when -- it doesn't matter if the statute doesn't say you have to repair buildings when you're using them. It would be unnatural for a statute to say so. That's all I have, Your Honor."

      "speech": "Thank you, Justice Stevens. May it please the Court: The Government is not using the property, and is not required to use the property for the benefit of the tribe as the court of appeals acknowledged at page 14a of the appendix to the petition. It's using the property for its own Government purposes, and in that respect, this case is completely unlike Mitchell II, where the statutes and regulations specifically required the Government to manage the property as an economic resource for the Indians. There are no trust assets to pay for any historic restoration efforts because Congress directed that the property would be used for Government purposes, not for any -- any kind of economic purposes that would generate assets. Congress has a separate regime for historic preservation. It grants millions of dollars each year for historic preservation projects, and as Mr. Brauchli alluded, Congress has granted funds for historic reservation at Fort Apache. The tribe has engaged in its own historic preservation efforts there with millions of dollars of private, State, and Federal funding, and the Department of the Interior has put millions of dollars of its own maintenance and repair efforts into the fort. Thank you very much."
