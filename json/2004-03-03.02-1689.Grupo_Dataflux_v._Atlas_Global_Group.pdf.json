    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The central question here is whether Atlas' post-filing change in citizenship should be allowed to create retroactive diversity jurisdiction in this case. To justify rewriting the longstanding time of filing rule, Atlas relies on the fact that this case was tried to verdict before the jurisdictional issue was identified and raised in the district court."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "May I ask you with respect to that? When you found out that you had this fundamental jurisdictional objection, when did you know that the partnership included partners not only Texas entities but two Mexican citizens? When did you find that out?"

    "speech": "There are two answers to your question, Justice Ginsburg. In terms of when we became aware of the issue, that was after verdict, and that's reflected in the affidavit which appears in the record at volume I, page 1887. In terms of the question of was there evidence in the record that could have been pieced together to identify this issue earlier, the answer to that question is yes. If --if -- it probably could have been identified earlier, should have been identified earlier, but it was not."

First, under the Texas Revised Limited Partnership Act, the -- the partnership can sue -­ the limited partnership can sue on its own without the participation of the limited partners. In terms of all of the counterclaims against Llamosa and Robles, again under the Texas statute, we can choose to sue the partnership itself or we can sue individual limited partners. In this circumstance, our counterclaim against them was predicated not on their status as limited partners, but rather on the fact that Mr. Llamosa and Mr. Robles made affirmative misrepresentations, was our position, directly to us to induce us to enter the contract that led to the -- the lawsuit.

But I would also note that the bottom line here is that -- is that Atlas, the party with unique knowledge of the exact circumstances of its partnership at the time of filing, is the party here who filed the case in Federal court at a time when there was not diversity jurisdiction. There certainly could have been more that we should have done to explore the issue earlier."

There were admissions that jurisdiction existed, but I would hasten to add that pursuant to the longstanding rule that jurisdiction cannot be stipulated to, agreed to, created by estoppel or waiver, that those statements are not effective to create jurisdiction if it does not exist at the outset. And -- and I would emphasize the language that was relied on most recently in this Court's decision in Kontrick from January in which the Court noted that a court's subject matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded to account for the parties' conduct during litigation. And I think that principle addresses that. Is there more that could have been done to explore this earlier --this issue earlier and bring it up? The answer to that question is yes, but I don't think that that circumstance undermines the fundamental rule here, which is that as of the time of filing, there was not a diversity present, and because of that -­"

Watt, Your Honor, is that if the change in circumstances is the result of the addition or subtraction of a party, that's one circumstance, but here we have something entirely different, which is a change in citizenship. It would be the same as if a plaintiff had lived in one State and then moved to another State."
  },

But if -- if a different circumstance is -- is hypothesized where there's a dismissal, then I think that brings rule 21 into play.

Therefore, we are under section 1332 alone, and the -- the longstanding rule that the citizenship is going to be measured as of the time of filing. At -- at this stage where the rule has been followed for some 180 years, I believe that similar to a complete diversity requirement, it is now part and parcel of section 1332. So there -- there's no removal overlay to be addressed. And -- and there's an additional circumstance here that I think in significant part, Caterpillar operates to protect a defendant's right to removal. The -- the removal in that case --the removal right was subject to being lost because of the timing of the dismissal of the non-diverse party.

By process of elimination, we know what it is not. It is not section 1653, because that addresses only defective allegations, not defective facts. It is not section 1441 or 1446 because this is not a removal case, and it's not rule 21.

I take it that if this Court in its unanimous opinion referred to the McMahan case, Knop v. McMahan, that it -- it understood that change in that case and did not dispute the fact, therefore, that the change in a limited partnership is acceptable so that when that change occurs and then there is complete diversity and then there is a trial, that the court has the Article III judicial power to decide the case. Or as -- or as Justice Souter said in Lexecon, while not on all fours with this case by any means, there was no continuing defiance but merely untimely compliance. In this case there was no continuing defiance of the court's jurisdiction. Once the limited partners were bought out of the limited partnership, this court acquired the power, and once it acquired the power, the lineage of cases, the thread of cases from --from Grubbs, Newman- Green, and Caterpillar say this court has the power to consider that case."

    "speech": "Well -- and -- and following on that, but of course, Newman-Green, a rule 21 case, admittedly is very instructive here because Newman-Green -- the court gave the plaintiff the option of dismissing the dispensable party. The plaintiff took the option. While the case was on appeal, the appellate court gave the option. The plaintiff dismissed the dispensable party and the court said okay, we had jurisdiction then to render -­ the district court had jurisdiction then to render summary judgment in that case. The plaintiff could have turned down that power and said, no, I don't want to lose that dispensable party. He may be the money man. He may be the one that I can come after later on. So you do have this Court in Newman-Green approving, if you will, the act of the plaintiff unilaterally to make the decision whether it's going to stay in Federal court or in that case --well, stay in Federal court. Here, there are --there are --the --the petitioner raises two salient issues: removal is different than remand and this was unilateral. I've covered the unilateral in my opinion, and I will say one final thing about -- subject to questions, about the removal. And that is once a case comes to this court by removal or by direct filing, the jurisdictional questions are the same at that point, and that is, is there diversity? And in Caterpillar, it said, well, there wasn't and the court erroneously ruled, but later on diversity obtained and we had Article III jurisdictional power to try the case. I --it's like coming to Washington, D.C. by train, boat, plane. Once you get to Washington, D.C., you're subject to the same rules. Once we be -- came before the Federal court by direct filing, or once Caterpillar in the removal filing, the test was the same. We -- we believe this is a very, very narrow case."

You can't do it after -- we all agree you can't do it on collateral attack. And I don't know why one is any more bright line than the other, unless you get into these ramifications that there's a difference between removal and filing or a difference between the -- the plaintiff moving to another State or -- or adding a partner. Those are all -- it seems to me any one of those would depart from the need for a bright line rule."

Here the whole partnership -­ the nature of the partnership had to change. There was -­ the -- the initial premise for the jurisdiction was wrong based on the identity and the composition of the partnership, not the identity and the composition of all of the parties that are in the complaint.

Number one, in Texas the general partner has the right to bring lawsuits. The limited partners do not have the right to sue or be sued in their name on behalf of the limited partnership. That's a very important distinction here. The -- the second point -- and I think this is more important -- the precedent of this Court does not discuss intent. Caterpillar, Newman-Green, Grubbs did not talk about what were the parties' intent at the time that the jurisdictional Article III power came to this court. Since there is no discussion in those cases of intent, it is my reading that intent is not an issue. It's an absolute. Did the court have jurisdiction or does it not?

I mean, this case involves an alteration in the citizenship of the partnership. What about an alteration of the citizenship of the corporation? They reincorporate somewhere else before the thing happens? What about a -- a private individual who decides to move to another State? Is that covered? Is this bright line when -- when we still have all of these -- all of these future cases in front of us? It seems to me it is not."

That was only cured later, but the overriding consideration in Caterpillar unanimously by this Court is once a diversity case has been tried in Federal court, with the rules of decisions under State law, under Erie v. Tompkins, considerations of finality, efficiency, and economy become overwhelming. If I have to take those words as they are, they are overwhelming, then it is overwhelming in this case because this case is narrower than Caterpillar. Why send this case back? I would ask this Court -- these principles apply regardless of whether the case arrives to Federal court through removal or original filing. I would ask this Court, on behalf of the respondent, that this Court apply these principles to conclude that the trial court in this case had subject matter jurisdiction at the time of trial, and allow this case to return the district court for entry of judgment consistent with the jury verdict."

I would like to elaborate on an answer to Justice Breyer's question, which has been touched on by a number of the questions here, which is what's the worst that can happen. And I --I think the point would be this. Once the efficacy of a post-filing change in citizenship is -- is taken as a given, then I think you're -- you're setting up a situation where the door swings both ways. Jurisdiction can be created and jurisdiction can be destroyed by virtue of post-filing changes."

And that's the real -- the real problem that's -- that's created here. And -- and Justice Stevens had -- had asked the -- the question saying, well, why don't we just draw the -- the line? You want a bright line rule? We'll -- we'll draw it at the time of trial. I think the problem here is that what you're setting up is a circumstance where for some period of time, a trial court, a Federal district court is acting ultra vires, to borrow the phrase from Steel Company, for some period of time prior to whenever you say the --the post-filing change could become effective. You've got a Federal trial court that is operating without authority. It's issuing orders."
