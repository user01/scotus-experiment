      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The Ninth Circuit's conclusion that Mr. Brown is entitled to habeas corpus relief should be reversed for three reasons. First, under Section 2254(3)(16) of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act the trial judge's dismissal of Mr. Deal from the jury is a finding of fact of substantial impairment that is presumed correct unless it is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. Mr. Brown has not presented such evidence because the record before the State court supports the decision to remove Mr. Deal, especially since the trial judge had the opportunity to observe Mr. Deal and the defense had no objection to his removal. Second, under 2254(d)(2) the State court decision was based on a reasonable determination of the facts. Since the finding of fact was correct it is necessarily reasonable. And third, under 2254(d)(2), the State court decision was not contrary to Supreme Court precedent. Since the trial court applied the correct standard under Witt and found as fact that Mr. Deal was substantially impaired and this case is immaterially indistinguishable from Witt, the State court's decision was a reasonable application of clearly established Federal law. Mr. Deal did indicate in the voir dire that he could impose the death penalty and consider it, but his other statements created an ambiguity which the trial judge was in the best position to resolve."

And then defense counsel asked why do you think the death penalty is appropriate?

And the prosecutor specifically asked Mr. Deal, can you think of an example, or a situation of when you would be able to impose a death penalty now knowing there is life without parole, and Mr. Deal at Joint Appendix 71 to 72 said I would have to give that some thought.

      "speaker": "SAMSON",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I would agree that the statements given by the jurors in Witt and Darden were not exactly what Mr. Deal said. But I think the general rule that the deference given to the trial judge would be the same rule. And we are only asking this court to apply the rule."

That is correct. The statements were -- were different. And certainly if the judge viewing a juror of this type determined that the juror was not impaired, then that decision would also be entitled to deference. In fact, an example occurred in this case, Juror Obeso, the judge -- there was a challenge by the prosecutor. There was actually an objection by the defense. And the judge said Mr. Obeso says that he can follow the law and impose the death penalty and I think he can."

The first is it explains why there's no evidence, expressed evidence regarding demeanor or credibility or even an express statement regarding demeanor or credibility or even an express statement as to substantial impairment. The second is that as the Court stated in Witt, it is a significant factor the court may consider in its evidence that show the judge acted appropriately."

I think I got the impression from Judge Kozinski's opinion that he thought that the Washington Supreme Court found that with respect to two out of the three jurors at issue that there had been a finding that they were substantially impaired, but with respect to this juror, that the Washington Supreme Court seemed to rely on the failure to object as the principal explanation for their decision."

It seems the court of appeals judge overlooked that."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",

      "speaker": "SAMSON",

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",

I think that's what Judge Kozinski said."

And this is a judge who, against the background of the entire voir dire, clearly was making a good faith effort to apply the Witt standard. There were 12 objections by the prosecution to various jurors that they should be excused for cause because of inability to apply the law as Washington gives it. The defense objected, I believe, to seven of those; and the prosecution lost on five of those occasions. So the judge basically went with the defense when the defense spoke up and objected. There were two jurors that were excused over the defense objection. The transcript is also in the voir dire on those and it shows that the defense objected and said these jurors can apply the standard under the law, and the judge found that they could not and excused them. In the case of Juror Deal there is no absolutely reason to believe that the judge wouldn't have done exactly the same thing if the defense had objected."

He kept saying yeah, in special circumstances, not always. Then they get into this thing where he's been thinking of a person who will in fact commit a crime again. And then it's put to him directly: Have you thought about that he won't be committing a crime again if he's in jail the rest of his life. He says: You're right; I hadn't really thought it through. I want to know, thinking it through, could you consider the death penalty? Do you think under the conditions where the man would never get out again you could impose it? Yes, sir. So you don't think that if parole was an option, etcetera, repeating it. Death penalty? I could consider it. Then could you impose it? I could if I was convinced that was the appropriate measure. And it's absolutely clear he's not thinking of the repetition. It is clear he is thinking that it's some kind of a mean. And I compare that with Witt, where the person just says no, I can't, and I compared it with this other case, Gray, and they say it's illegal to push him off a jury, a woman who is confused, and finally she says: I think I could."

And the overarching point that I make before I talk about those five instances is that this is a record in which there is confusion and uncertainty about whether Juror Deal really can adhere to the law. And in those circumstances, the only judge who can truly resolve that and determine whether he should be credited is the trial judge. And this Court has made that point over and over again in describing its voir dire."

He hasn't been told what the standards of -- that it was beyond a reasonable doubt. And to say that he should be criticized because when he was asked to give an example he said one thing and not another, it seems if you just read the transcript, that there's nothing disqualifying. So as you said, everything is the weight falls on the demeanor, which an appellate court can't review."

It doesn't mean that there is no judicial review at all, in response to Justice Souter's question and I think the concern underlying your own. There has to be fair support in the record for the conclusion that the trial judge could have resolved the question of a juror's competence to sit in the way that he did. And if you had a record in which everything that juror said was consistent with complying with State law, which I don't think this record is, and the prosecutor objected, and the judge says granted, and there's no explanation, I think that would be difficult to uphold, even if it is possible that everyone in the courtroom knew that the judge was relying on demeanor."

But this Court has said over and over again that there does not have to be because in this case, in particular, since there was no objection, the judge did not elaborate on his reasons at all. But the Court has gone further in Witt and in Darden and building on cases like Patton versus Yount, and made clear that it is implicit in a judge's action in response to an objection that he has relied on the totality of the law and his observations. And here there were two instances during the defense colloquy in which the juror specifically said that his example of when the death penalty is appropriate is a circumstance when somebody is incorrigible and will reoffend if released. And then three times during the prosecution's voir dire, he volunteered, first of all, that it would have to be in my mind very obvious that the person would reoffend. And this was a particularly significant answer because it wasn't given in response to a death penalty question, it was given in response to whether he could apply the reasonable doubt standard to the crime. He again comes back to the reoffend notion after having State law explained to him again, and said, could you consider imposing the death penalty, he said I have to give that some thought."

The first by the trial court is objectively, an objectively unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented, and thus the writ should be granted under 50 -- 28 - - 2254(d)(2)? And the supreme court's decision -- and I'll get to a moment to where I think their decision is, in the record, which conflicts with the State's view of where that is -- was an unreasonable application of this Court's controlling precedent in Witt versus Witherspoon. And I would direct the Court to, in terms of the State Supreme Court's finding, to page 173a of the appendix of the Petition for certiorari. But I would, of course, first like to start with the actual record in this case. In this case, the Washington State trial court's decision to excuse juror Deal for cause was be objectively unreasonable based upon the record, because juror Deal said many times on the record, when presented with the question of whether or not he could impose the death penalty under the sketchy view he had of Washington State's statutory capital punishment scheme, that he could do so."

I think Judge Kozinski's language was a little loose there. I think he probably agrees with me. As to the -- the failure to object, first of all, if the court says, first of all, are there any objections; now again we have admitted that what he said was I have no objection. But the -- under Washington law, the prosecutor, the judge, and the defense attorney all knew that this issue could be raised for the first time on appeal. The prosecutor -- and I'm not saying on habeas review, but in the trial court, a challenge for cause, the burden falls on the prosecutor to articulate a basis."

We know that would prevent him from imposing Washington's statutory scheme because once finding him guilty, the juror will never be released again. So the possibility of release would not be there. And so he would reject the notion that you must consider mitigating factors if there's no possibility of release. We argue in our brief that that's not what he said. And in fact, Juror Deal was a thinking juror, a juror who could, in fact, consider all of the options.

And what he says in that footnote is, \"the most that can be demanded of a venire man in this regard is that he be willing to consider,\" and those are his italics, \"to consider all of the penalties provided by State law, and that he not be irrevocably committed before the trial has begun to vote against the penalty of death, regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge.

So the fact that he's concerned about reoffense is perfectly appropriate.

So the judge is dealing with Richard Deal in one paragraph. The defendant raised a host of challenges, and so there's not perfect consistency with what these two passages in the opinion. But mustn't we take into account what this was? It was the defense brought out every objection they probably could conceive of and they didn't put particular emphasis on this, so it comes out this way."

You said they got it wrong because they said in this paragraph that he got the law you wrong, he made an incorrect statement of the law because he said he would impose the death penalty where the defendant would reviolate if released, which is not a correct statement of the law. We don't know exactly what that court meant by that paragraph, but we do know that the Washington Supreme Court was basing -- I don't know how many objections they were dealing with in this opinion, but a great many."

    {
      "speaker": "ELLIOTT",

There were also challenges to other jurors as well. And there are separate paragraphs where the court -- those jurors that are mentioned in the summary paragraph, where the court then explains the various reasons why it's upholding the trial judge as to those jurors as well."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

    {
      "speaker": "ELLIOTT",
      "speech": "That is true. It appears as though what they did was to, because this is not what the trial judge said, this is the basis for the objection by the prosecutor, that they assumed the trial judge adopted the prosecutor's objection. In sum, there's nothing in the record that supports a conclusion here that Juror Deal could not subordinate his personal views about the death penalty or that he would frustrate the State's legitimate purpose in carrying out the State's legitimate interest in a constitutional capital death penalty scheme. So we would ask this Court to affirm the opinion of Judge Kozinski in the Ninth Circuit and grant the writ of habeas corpus in this case. Thank you."

In response to the questions regarding the Witherspoon language and whether it's still good law, the Court in Witt essentially said that is no longer the standard. The standard instead is the substantial impairment standard, and it is not required to show that the juror would never impose the death penalty or automatically vote against it by unmistakable clarity. And the fact that there were -- in response to Justice Ginsburg's question, the fact that there were so many claims presented to the State Supreme Court may explain in part the summary opinion regarding this particular issue. AEDPA does not require a perfect opinion by the State court to survive review. It only requires reasonableness and an objective standard. In addition, the arguments presented by Mr. Brown are essentially: We disagree and the Federal courts should disagree with the factfinding process done by the State courts. But the fact that a reviewing court reviewing the same transcript may reach a different factual determination is not sufficient. If the view reached by the State court is supported by evidence and is -- thank you, Your Honor."
