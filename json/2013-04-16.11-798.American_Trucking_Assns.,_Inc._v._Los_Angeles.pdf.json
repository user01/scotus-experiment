      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about the plain text of the FAAAA express preemption clause and the continuing vitality of this Court's decision in Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines. I'd like to start by showing why the Port's requirements here fall within the text of the statute and cannot be saved by any market participant exception. The FAAAA provides that no State or political subdivision of a State may enact or enforce any law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to rates, routes, and services of a motor carrier. The only statutory language at issue here is the force and effect of law requirement. And the Port's actions have the force and effect of law under any reasonable interpretation of the phrase. The Port is imposing binding standards of conduct on motor carriers as a condition of accessing a channel of interstate commerce. The Port is enforcing those requirements through criminal penalties --"

    {
      "speaker": "LERMAN",
      "speech": "They -- they did make that representation and we could accept that, but it's irrelevant because the Port is still imposing the criminal penalties on the terminal operators. And when a State is imposing criminal penalties, that is classic governmental action, the State acting in its sovereign capacity, regardless of whom the penalties are imposed upon. And in this Court's decision in Roe, it made clear that States could regulate trucking activity through penalties, in that case civil penalties, imposed only on people who do business with truckers. Here, the State's requirements are coming at the truckers from both ends. On the one end, you have the criminal penalties imposed on the terminal operators to coerce their conduct and exclude truckers. On the other hand, you have the tariff which puts conditions on access to the Port of Los Angeles, which is a key channel of interstate commerce.

So let's get to the first question in my mind. Seems almost impossible for me to believe that the States couldn't require someone to put a little placard like you get at the -- at almost any building that you go into to park your car. They ask you to put a little placard in the front of your window so they know who you are and where you're going in the Port, okay? Why is the placard requirement here any different than that requirement generally? Because if you enter property, you have -- most people tell you put a placard in the window to tell us you got permission to come in."

So Congress carved out a series of exceptions for the FAAAA for safety requirements, which gets to part of your question, for height and weight and size limits, for requirements pertaining to the transport of nonconsensual goods and the like. It did not create a proprietary exception. So a lot of Your Honor's concerns may well be covered by one of these other exceptions. But there is no exception for a proprietary action. If it has the force and effect of law and it does not fall within one of the enumerated exceptions to the statute, then it is preempted under the terms that Congress used."

So by the terms of the statute, Congress wrote a statute that preempts any action with the force and effect of law, and it chose not to carve out an exception for proprietary action which, as you say, Your Honor, was included in the Airline Deregulation Act. So that just lends added force to the argument that the Act here does not contain an unstated exception, an exception that Congress has created not only for the ADA, which is the express model of this Act, but in a host of other statutes where Congress carved out specific exceptions for proprietary actions."

Here, as Justice Scalia notes, we have an express preemption clause, and we have a clause that has carveouts for a lot of things, but it does not have a carveout for proprietary action. And that is -- that is the best evidence as Congress has intended. This Court has stated, when there's an express preemption clause, the plain language of the clause defines the scope of Congress's intent. And here the plain meaning of the clause covers actions as here that are backed by criminal penalties and impose conditions of access to a key channel of interstate commerce. That is the very definition of force and effect of law. The Port is invoking the full coercive power of the State to impose conditions on motor carriers, and that is exactly what Congress sought to prevent. Congress sought to prevent State actions that impede the free flow of trade or that would result in a patchwork of requirements from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. That is what the Port's doing here. It -- it conflicts with Congress's objectives and it falls within the text of the statute. And it cannot be saved by virtue of a market participant exception that, by Respondent's own admission, is untethered from the text of the statute itself for the reasons that we've discussed. Congress made quite clear what it wanted to except from the broad scope of preemption, and this Court has reinforced the breadth of preemption, and did not include --"

If -- if the truck is leaking hazardous material, the port can deny access to that particular truck. The key -- the key problem here is the carrier-level suspension of access. And so saying because that one truck for the carrier might be leaking hazardous material, we are not going to let any trucks, even perfectly safe trucks that don't present any present -- clear and present safety risk into the port until you fix that unsafe truck. And that's the authority reserved by the State in this case, and that is what Castle said is preempted. And so we are not denying the authority to invoke what Castle called conventional forms of punishment, which we would concede includes the -- the type of punishment Your Honor's contemplating, but what it doesn't allow is a -- a suspension of access to a motor carrier as a business entity."

And that remedy exists to this day under 49 U.S.C. 13905. The same statutory scheme that was present in Castle and animated this Court's decision in Castle is present today. So if they have a safety concern, there are ways to deal with it. They can do what Justice Kagan suggested, which is to deny access to a particular truck. They can go to the Department of Transportation and ask for -- for some type of exemption. But what they can't do is assert the veto power that this Court held was precluded in Castle and in the city of Chicago cases, and that is precisely the veto power that they are asserting here."

Look, what they want to do is to not have trucks park in the neighborhood on the street, and they want to put a tag on it. All right. So the second -- you seem to have said what they should have done. You go to the NTSB and you ask, and they do it. They approve it or they don't. And their -- their problem is that they don't want 40 or 50 States each saying a different sticker, all right? So then the whole back fills up with stickers and that's the problem. That's the problem. You go explain, et cetera, okay. But the first part, the parking, it seemed to me of course they should be able to do that. And there seems to me to be a tailor-made exception, the authority of the State to impose highway route controls or limitations. And if that isn't tailor-made for this, I don't know what is, I mean, I don't know what it's doing there. And so why has nobody done that? When I read the lower court on that, they said, oh, it affects fares and it affects services. Every route restriction affects fares and services, you know? So here I see an exception which seems tailor-made for what they want to do. I see all kinds of problems with the proprietary thing. What am I supposed to do?

Now, it could have been the safety exception. The Port argued for that here and the district court rejected it on the record after hearing testimony about the alleged safety and hazardous cargo justifications. They didn't make an argument under sizes and weights. Presumably, they could make that record. You'd have to see about the strength of their justifications. I'd note that I -- it would probably be the case they would have to apply uniformly to trucks of a given size or weight. Here, they were only going after drayage trucks, which are a particular category of trucks. I don't know if they could make that showing with respect to all trucks or if that was their intent here. I would like to turn, if I could, to Justice Ginsburg's question about the criminal penalties in this case. We accept the Port's statement in their brief at face value that the criminal penalties would only fall on the marine terminal operators. But, like Petitioner, we don't think that makes a difference. If, for example, the State Highway Commission said, okay, certain trucks can't use our roads unless you sign a certain agreement. But don't worry, if you don't agree to bide by that agreement we won't do anything to you, but we will throw every person who does business with you in jail. Whatever else you could say about that scheme, I think it would be pretty clear that it would be the act of a sovereign and so it would have the force and effect of law within the meaning of this statute."

So -- so if the criminal penalties were not in the case, is there enough here to still make this the force and effect of law?"

We think not only is there enough here, but there's another sort of a bright-line rationale before you get into the Boston Harbor sort of understanding of if this is regulatory or market participant. And that's the second factor we cite in our brief, which is we don't consider the Port the equivalent of the cement factory in Reeves, like a commercial enterprise that you might see in the private marketplace. This port authority, like I think virtually all other port authorities in charge of these massive container ports, hold land much like a highway commission in trust for the public. This is not private property ownership. If you look at all the different metrics of success the court of appeals pointed to and the district court pointed to and I think the Port points to in their brief, they are not bottom line business metrics like shareholder value and dividends and so forth. It's economic vitality of the region. It's the number of jobs it brought to the L.A. area. That is not the mark of a commercial enterprise. It's the mark of a regulatory body. It's something a mayoral candidate might point to."

But I think what this Court said in Boston Harbor was that, yeah, a private business could boycott labor law -- law violators too, and, in a sense, the private business would be engaged in quote-unquote regulation. But when the government does that, when the government uses its special place in society and its enormous economic power to effectively leverage its power to impose regulation, that's -- that's fundamentally different, and that is not the government acting in a market capacity even though, sure, Wal-Mart or Starbucks could do a similar thing."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BASH",

I mean, our first order argument is criminal penalties and just the nature of a port and -- the Port doesn't contract with the city. The Port is a department of the city, and its members are appointed by the mayor and its revisions to the tariff are codified in city ordinances. So it's in every way a part of the city, it's not just a contractual relationship. We think just the criminal penalties here and the nature of what a port is. A port -- a regulatory body that governs a critical part of public infrastructure is enough to resolve this case. If you think no, the criminal penalties don't matter and this Port is more like the cement factory in Reeves, it's really just a plain vanilla commercial enterprise, we do think the fact that it's leveraging significant economic power, that it's the only place in L.A. to do this business, is part of this sort of Gould market participant analysis."

And they've been done in this case. It is the replacement of these trucks, which was done through a subsidy and incentive program that's remarkably similar to the one this Court blessed as market participation in Hughes that allowed these extensive emission reductions that the Port's seen. That sort of direct participation in the market has all the hallmarks of what we don't have here. It's not enforced through criminal penalties. It's not the -- the Port acting as a regulator of this public infrastructure. It's actually entering the drayage market and purchasing trucks, effectively becoming a part owner of the truck. So I do think that the Port has extensive authority to address environmental concerns within the confines of this preemption statute. The Chief Justice asked about the Castle question, whether it matters or what if you just didn't want a road or what's the size of it? I will say that the court in Castle seemed to think it made a difference, the sort of size of the imposition, but I don't think it needs to make a difference anymore because we have a direct preemption statute. We think that the logic of Castle applies not only in the context of the licensing scheme that has changed but was effectively in place during Castle, but under Section 14501(c) itself. 14501(c) says States can't pass regulations that relate to prices, routes, and services, but it also gives States safety exceptions and so forth. And there needs to be a reconciliation of those two provisions. I think we'd all agree that if a State -- if a truck committed two safety infractions, you couldn't say, well, now we're going to regulate your prices, routes, and services as punishment for that infraction. This -- the framework we've set forth in the Castle portion of our brief I think is a reasonable reconciliation of the State’s --"

The tariff which applies to the marine terminal operators, yes, it contains a criminal penalty, but the criminal penalty is not included in this tariff against the marine terminal operators. It's intended for other purposes. We have no recollection of a cargo operation ever having had a criminal penalty. Yes, it's in there, there is a misdemeanor penalty, but it applies to people like trespassers, people who perform traditional criminal acts. There is evidence in the record. I asked the director, the deputy director of the Port, how do you enforce these requirements, and his answer was, primarily through our lease contract. Obviously, we don't want to do away with the -- with our lessor, but there is no indication, and there is no fact on the record that these criminal penalties, which our opponents keep dredging up, are ever used against MTO's."

Well, I don't know -- I don't know that we do that.

The reason I'm bringing this up is we have an entirely separate and much more robust relationship with our own tenants through the lease. The lease is the way this is enforced. Criminal penalties -- no MTO thinks for a second about the criminal penalty. They think about the contractual relationship. And that's an important point here because what we're talking about and what's central here is the management of land which we own, which we will not, underscore \"not,\" be able to grow and develop unless we have some modicum of control. And we are not talking about expansive control here, but some modicum of control over who enters our land. Let me make one additional point which I think is terribly important. The owner of land, the owner of land has to have some control of the type which ATA and the government says we can't have control over. I will give you a simple example, where we cut a hole in our fence and say the trucks can come in, you can come in on Navy Way, but you can't come in on Prospect Street. That under a strict definition of the statute would be prohibited to us. But you can't prohibit a landowner from saying, you've got to identify yourself."

This -- the city undertakes regulatory activities. It runs a police department, it runs -- it runs a fire department, public works. It does, in the case of the city of Los Angeles, run three enterprises: A port, an airport, and a power and water department. That is substantively different than running the public roads and the bridges. And we believe what's critical to this analysis and what we have extensive findings from the district court is that this was run as a business, like the cement plant, like the Boston Harbor. Boston Harbor I think I would posit is far closer case, it seems to me than what we're dealing with here, which are marine terminals. But nonetheless, in Boston Harbor this Court held that the regulation of who could work in Boston Harbor, the circumstances fell within the market participant doctrine."

Here you have an express preemption clause which contains exceptions, and among those exceptions is not the running of a commercial enterprise, even though that is made an exception in a number of other Federal statutes -- Federal preemption statutes. That's a very high hill for you to climb, relying solely on the fact that you are a commercial enterprise."

    {
      "speaker": "ROSENTHAL",
      "speech": "It's not the only thing, Justice Scalia, I'm relying on. I'm also relying on the language which Congress put in, which are words of the limitation, which is force and effect of law. If Congress had not -- had said any requirement by the Port, any requirement by a city whatsoever, I believe we'd have a closer case. But they're only talking about things which have application to the general public. We submit that force and effect of law almost invites a market participant analysis. Let me also respond to your point about the ADA, the Airport Deregulation Act. The reason there is a limited exception for airport proprietors, as this Court has held, is because there was a longstanding issue about airports being able to impose restrictions about noise pollution on surrounding communities. Congress was well aware back in the 1970s, when this statute was enacted, of that controversy and they wanted to preserve the existing rights of airports. There is no comparable controversy with respect to truck ports or ports or the government that was ongoing in 1994 when this particular statute was adopted. But let me point out that what did -- did occur in 1994 was that Congress was writing against the backdrop of this Court's decision in the Boston Harbor case, in which Congress was told that in the absence of something express, which says that a city or State can't manage its own property when it pursues its proprietary interests, that there would not be inferred -- not be inferred -- a restriction on a State's power to manage its own property. So unlike the situation when the ADA was adopted, when the FAAAA was adopted in 1994, there was, we submit, a background principle, which this Court had enunciated earlier, that there was a presumption that our proprietary powers were to be preserved. If -- if I can, I'd like to go on to the Castle argument as well. Our point -- we make three different points in Castle. First of all, our position is that the Castle decision was predicated upon a very specific statutory regime that existed in -- under the Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935. Justice Black specifically noted the details of that statutory regime, which included certificates of convenience and necessity, very precise rules under which trucks were to operate within -- within the United States. That regime has died. Died several decades ago. And we would submit that the Castle doctrine, as it existed, died with that regime."

I want to know your best case in that one, and I don't see the example yet."

And most trucks, in fact virtually all trucks of this type, have a -- have a frame on the outside where they temporarily put plaques, for example, at times when they are carrying hazardous materials. You probably have seen that color design on the side. Those are temporarily affixed. So if a trucking company, an LMC, wished to just put the plaque on as it's crossing the gate and take it off when it's leaving the gate, it's -- it's fully lawful to do that under our restrictions. Most of them just leave -- leave it on, but that's not required. The plaque is only required as it enters, while it's on Port property, and when it leaves, as it leaves."

      "speaker": "ROSENTHAL",
      "speech": "We have -- we have never enforced it that way. I mean, the enforcement – we haven't used revocation. We haven't used suspension. And generally speaking, our intent has been, as we stated in the lower court and as we stated repeatedly, to use this for continuing violations. But we are really talking about future actions because revocation and suspension have not been common. Let me conclude by making two points here. Number one, this Port undertook these actions as a reasonable and genuine response to the needs to build and grow a port. If we are prohibited from taking what are substantively limited actions to control trucking, then essentially we're going to be in a posture in which this Port will be disabled by its surrounding community from doing what it needs to do to compete. Secondly, we submit you cannot be the owner-proprietor of property without having some control over the conditions under which owner -- under which invitees, business invitees, come onto your property, that this statute of Congress was not intended to constrain that property interest."

So -- so if we decide in your way, what we've done is distinguish precisely the same situation, you from the city of Los Angeles, simply because of the method they have of governmentally regulating the port."

Justice Breyer, in response to your question, rates, routes and services are not at issue in this case. The only issue is whether they have force and effect of law. That's the only issue before this Court. The court below said they lack -- they fell outside the scope of the statute because of the proprietary nature. Mr. Rosenthal talked a lot about the commercial motivations, but the statute doesn't speak to criminal motivations. The statute speaks to actions with the force and effect of law. These have the force and effect of law and are preempted on that ground. Mr. Rosenthal said Castle has died. Castle is still alive. The statutory scheme that formed the basis of this Court's decision in Castle remains to this day in Title 49 of the U.S. Code, and that was the basis for the decision then, and it's the basis today. Justice Ginsburg, the concession agreements gives the Port unfettered discretion to determine whether or not to suspend or revoke access. In this Court's city of Chicago cases, the fact that the city claimed at least some power to deny a license or access to interstate commerce was sufficient and it's sufficient in this case. Thank you."

But once you've gotten your fleet in order and you are in compliance, then we can't punish you for having wronged in the past by saying you're -- you're suspended. That -- that's the position that the government is taking, and I take it you don't agree with that."
