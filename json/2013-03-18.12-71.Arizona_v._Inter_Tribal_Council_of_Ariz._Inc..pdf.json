First, prohibiting a State from effectively enforcing the citizenship requirement is so far-reaching that if Congress had intended that, it would have put the prohibition in the statute expressly, which it did not do. Congressional silence should not disable States from taking sensible precautions to exclude noncitizens from voting. Second, when Congress wanted to expressly prohibit something, it knew how to do it. It expressly prohibited notarization and other forms of authentication. This Court has frequently held that statutory language that indicates -- that prohibits one thing indicates there's no other implicit prohibition: The expressio unius rule. Third, Proposition 200 is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the NVRA because the purpose of the NVRA --"

So I would like, General Horne, for you to respond to a question that's already been raised in -- by the -- the panel that decided this case originally, which was, the statute said -- says each State must accept and use the Federal form, period. That's the end of it. And then it says, in addition to that, the State can do other things.

I came here from Arizona on an airplane. If the airline said we accept and use an e-mail ticket, you don't need to bring a paper ticket.

In response to that, the Respondent ITCA and the Federal government said, no, you can look at external evidence, if it shows that the person is not a citizen.

The EAC chose not to put anything additional on the form, which was their right. It was permissive. But they did set -- set up a system of State-specific requirements. I think that reflects the fact that the States have the burden of determining whether or not the eligible -- the applicant is eligible. That's -- that's our burden. We must accept and use the Federal form as a tool in doing that, but it is not the exclusive tool, and my friends on the other side have admitted that it's not the exclusive tool because they've admitted that if we have documentary evidence the person is not a citizen, we can reject the application."

Other people were caught in their applications to citizenship when they checked and found that they had previously registered to vote and voted. So -- so we are making use of it, but it is not a -- it is not a functional way to determine eligibility. And in 7(a)(1), Congress said that -- that both the Federal form and the State form as incorporated under Section 4 may ask for such additional information, only such additional information as is necessary to determine the eligibility of the voter.

If you don't have any of those numbers, then you can send in one of these additional documents. But that is not an additional form. The reason -- the distinction I draw between the -- incorporating another form or the State form and asking for additional information is the purposes and objectives of the Act. The Act indicates that the State form is an alternative to the Federal form, but cannot take its place.

You must -- you must answer the questions set forth in the Federal form. But secondly, to the extent we add things to the Federal form, those things must be consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act. And I -- and I -- and I justify my assertion that Prop 200 is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act by relying on the findings of the trial court that relate exactly to that question, finding that it was a minimal burden, overcome by a major interest that the State have -- has in protecting the integrity of the system, where the -- where the trial judge found a lot of evidence to show that there was voter fraud going on, although not the fault of the individuals, the fault of the organizations that often fool people into signing the form when they don't intend to -- or they don't intend to break the law; but as -- but as against that, that the -- that the burdens are minimal. And the trial court, the district court, had a lot of findings justifying the statement that the burdens are minimal, including the fact, for example, that if all the rejected forms had been accepted, the increase in Hispanic registration would have only have been .1 percent, which is statistically insignificant, including the fact that out of a population of $6 million, the plaintiffs, who have all the resources one can imagine, if you look at the list of plaintiffs, could only find one person out of six million people that could not satisfy -- who was entitled to vote, who could not satisfy the requirements of the Act; and a lot of other findings by the trial court. And this Court instructed the Ninth Circuit to give deference to the factual findings of the trial court in the Purcell case, and the Ninth Circuit ignored that.

So we must look back to the purpose, not necessarily exclusively the language, of deciding what that particular provision be, in particularly one as you quote adding to, what could it have been? And there the legislative history in my view is helpful because it makes clear, for example, in at least one place that Congress did think they shouldn't add a provision that allows the State to do just what it's doing here because that wouldn't be consistent with the purpose of the Act.

But the Help America -- just to get right to your question -- there's two aspects to the Help America Vote Act that change this form a little bit. When you go through those instructions, what you will see -- here's what those State-specific instructions are: They are the requirement that you put in an ID number that is required by the Help America Vote Act required. Required. So clearly, that is to be on the form because another statute requires it. And then you put on -- it says to put on party identification for the States that have it.

And the particular critical provision is at page 22A of the appendix to the government's brief. And I'm sorry, I know that the provisions are located in a number of areas, but the gray brief at page 22A has the critical provision in our view, which is one that Ms. Millett was pointing to. And that's gg-7(b)(1). Now, what this provision embodies is this understanding: That the EAC is the one who determines what the content of the Federal form is. Not the States, but the EAC. The States do have a role in this scheme, and I think it's important to understand what that role is. The States have a consultative role at the front end. And this is back at page 21A -- I'm sorry for skipping back. But at page 21A at the bottom of the page, the EAC is to develop a form in consultation with the chief election officers of the States."

Now, is it conceivable that Congress intended that the Commission may not require some information that is necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess eligibility, but that the State may not require it either?

And the statute presupposes that the State can conduct its own investigation to crosscheck the information that the individual supplies. And maybe the critical provision to see that is at page 19A of the appendix to the government's brief. And that's a provision that deals with a different qualification, felony history. But it operates on this assumption that States can conduct their own investigation, which makes all the sense in the world. This one -- this provision that's in subsection (g) at the top of the page, which is 1973 gg-6(g), what this does is it tells the United States Attorney's Offices that when there is a Federal conviction of a felony, the U.S. Attorney's Offices are supposed to give written notice of that conviction to the chief State election official. And what's the State -- chief State election official going to do with that? Well of course, what they're going to do is they're going to take a look at the Federal form, they're going to see what the individual said about their felony history, and they're going to crosscheck it – against the information that they got from the United States Attorney -- to make sure that the information on the form is accurate."

      "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor, and I'll apologize in advance for talking really quickly. The -- my friend says in discussing Section 7(b)(1) that it would not be rational to require only the signature. But that's exactly what they did. All they required was the signature, and 7(b)(1) has nothing to do with that; 7(b)(2) requires a signature. So what the EAC chose to do under 7(b)(1) was exactly nothing, zero, which -- which emphasizes the point that this is the responsibility of the States, and that's how they understood it. With respect to the license having -- we cited ARS Section 28-3173, an Arizona statute in our reply brief that provides that you -- you must renew every 12 years. So by 2004, the problem that my friend spoke about was completely erased. Everybody had a new license which would be sufficient for this purpose, 100 percent. They admit that we can reject applications by reference to other -- by reference to other documentation, but they try to draw a distinction between that and asking the person to write down the driver's license number. But there is nothing in the statute that justifies that distinction. A reference to criminal history has nothing to do with -- with whether or not there is a distinction with respect to citizenship between looking at other documents and asking the person for their driver's license numbers. In both cases, it's something outside of the form and they have admitted we can go outside the form. With respect to legislative history, Your Honor, I think the key thing -- Mr. Justice Breyer, in your question was, it's only in one place. There are a lot of other places that go the other way. So we cannot conclude from that one place what the majority of Congress expected. With respect to HAVA, in HAVA, the Congress had another opportunity to expressly state that the State could not look to external evidence and ask for additional evidence, and they chose not to do that. And so I would say that HAVA is further evidence that Congress was not choosing to prohibit us from asking for additional information to fulfill our function, if it's necessary, of being sure that the applicant is eligible to vote. With respect to the Siebold case, the court in Siebold specifically said there will be no preemption unless there is a direct conflict and only to the extent of that conflict, and in that connection -- one last sentence, Your Honor -- if there are two plausible interpretations, ordinary principles of Federalism say one should not choose the interpretation that results in preemption, and the same thing applies with respect to the canon of constitutional accordance. Thank you, Your Honor."
