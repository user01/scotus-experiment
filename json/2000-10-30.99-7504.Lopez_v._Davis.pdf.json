      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Ms. Brinkmann: This case comes to you out of the State of South Dakota, and I'd like to briefly put the setting for all of you. This is from Yankton, South Dakota, which was the first territorial capital of the Dakota Territory. As a result of that, certain institutions were created, one of which was Yankton College. It was the oldest college in the Dakotas and Montana. It's now closed. It closed in the 1980's, and it's now a Federal prison camp. That Federal prison camp has no walls. It looks like Yankton College did for over a century until it was closed. At that place resides today Chris Lopez. Chris Lopez came to the Yankton prison camp from the State of Iowa. He drove across the State of Iowa and was allowed to do so by the district court to self-report to this college campus, now Federal prison camp. We're here today to talk about 18 U.S.C. 3621(e). That statute at the time that Chris Lopez was a convicted person, before he was a prisoner, unambiguously grants to him an incentive, and before he knocked on the door to be let into prison it said to him, if you are a drug abuser, which he admits he is, and if you agree to undergo the program, which he does, if you've been convicted of a nonviolent offense, Congress has made a deal with you. We will allow you, if you successfully complete the program, to be let out of prison up to 1 year early. He had 72 months to serve."

The legislative history is clear that that was considered by Congress, and Congress did not wish to make it a right that if you simply go through the program yet you led the gang on the campus, or you created other disciplinary problems, that the Bureau of Prisons shouldn't have control over the prisoner while that prisoner was incarcerated, but this is something I'd like --"

      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "The statute says may, but let's consider the structure of it. 3621(a) is very clear. 3621(a) tells the Bureau of Prisons that they may not release a prisoner until the expiration of the term imposed, or there's a good conduct section 3624, so when (e) was enacted -- and the legislative history is Congress also amended section 3621(b), which says the bureau shall make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each prisoner the bureau determines has a treatable condition of substance addiction or abuse. All right, they enact that. But 3621(a) would not allow anyone to be released early, so they enacted subsection (c), which is entitled, substance abuse treatment, so section (e), Your Honors, had to be amended to give permission to the Bureau of Prisons that if people took the substance abuse treatment there would be some incentive. The congressional hearings are clear."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "I don't think there's anything necessarily ambiguous if you use another meaning of the word, give permission to. I urge Your Honor that until the enactment of (e), if you had substance abuse treatment, if you had an incentive, the Bureau of Prisons could not turn anyone loose under any circumstances. What I am urging is a plain reading of this. Before Mr. Lopez, so to speak, becomes a prisoner, as you read this you would -- it would indicate that if you're a substance abuse user and you go through the program and you substantially complete it -- in other words, obey the rules within the institution."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

It seems to me that if you're being rational, if you're trying not to be arbitrary, you establish categories, so your argument that may cannot mean you establish categories just leaves me cold. It seems to me that that's exactly what you want the Bureau of Prisons to do, to be responsible, not to just arbitrarily say, yeah, you get it, you don't get it. That's arbitrary. That's irrational. But here they've tried to establish a rational scheme. What's the matter with that?"

Gerlinski, but the answer to the problem, the problem is one of who gets in the classroom. Our argument today is very simple. Congress told the Bureau of Prisons who gets in the classroom -- all --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, everybody gets in the classroom. The question is, having been -- not who is eligible for the program, but who is eligible for the early release afterwards. As you've said to Justice Stevens, there's no exclusion from the drug treatment program."

      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "That's correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And the reason there's no exclusion from the program is that it says that the bureau shall establish the program. If you read through 3621, what is really -- it just jumps out at you, is that it keeps using shall. Shall, shall, shall, until it gets to the period of custody section, and there all of a sudden it shifts from shall to may, which means discretion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "It means discretion, but it is not a grant of discretion to categorically deny nonviolent offenders consideration for the reduction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "May I clarify two things? If you are now leaving your argument that all people who complete the program successfully and are nonviolent offenders must be given this reduction, if you are leaving that, and shifting to an each individual is entitled to an individual determination, not a categorical exclusion, if you're doing that, then mustn't the bureau do the same thing for nonviolent offenders who weren't carrying any weapon? I mean, if it's going to be a one-by-one examination for a defendant that fits in your client's category, wouldn't it also be one-by-one for anyone?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "It could be. I don't have a definitive answer of how to run the Bureau of Prisons, except I'm here saying that this statute clearly tells the Bureau of Prisons how people are to get into the program for the purposes of the incentive, and that is all nonviolent offenders are to be considered, and that's to occur after successfully completing the program. Here they've made that decision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, could they make a decision categorically that all people who are nonviolent offenders who aren't carrying a firearm will get the reduction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "I think they've done that. I think that's the way it practically works, unless they've had disciplinary problems. I think 13 percent, according to one report, the Triad Report, indicates that they were not allowed because of disciplinary problems within the institution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It seems to me your argument has got to be not that there can't be categorization by the bureau, but that Congress has limited the kind of categorization the bureau may use, that Congress has said nonviolent offenders, and the bureau can't go beyond that when it's talking about limiting the availability of early release."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "Chief Justice, that -- I guess that is essentially what I'm saying. I'm saying that for the purposes of the incentive, that everyone starts the program and everyone has the opportunity to successfully complete it, and call that a category if you may, that it's while they're in the institution that they may be -- their activities may eliminate them from this category. It's not something that occurred at the time of sentencing, which was preconviction activity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "You're saying that the only precondition category that the bureau can use is the precondition category which is set forth in the statute, and which implicitly excludes other pre-imprisonment categories, namely, violent offender."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "Well, there are two categories when Chris -- before Chris -- when Chris Lopez is an offender. It's violent, and nonviolent. The courts have considered that the BOP's definition of that. When he hits prison there are two categories, violent and nonviolent, and my argument is that all of those activities have been considered by Congress, have been determined by Congress, and they wanted to broaden the program."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Then why didn't they use the word shall, rather than the word may?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "Because I don't think they wanted -- Congress wanted to create a right that just based on completion of the program, without regard to their other activities as a prisoner, that just the completion of that program meant you were entitled to -- and I think that's the word, entitled to reduction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "You say you don't think that. I mean, is there something in the legislative history that specifically supports that argument?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "Other than that it was clear, and I refer to the legislative history, the report. It's clear from the legislative history that Congress said that this subparagraph we're discussing, they use the word authorizes the Bureau of Prisons to shorten by up to 1 year the term of a prisoner who successfully completed a treatment program. They saw it as an authorization --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but authorization is not equivalent to mandate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "But the converse is also true. Authorization is not a grant of power to create categories which overrule the two made by Congress, violent and nonviolent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, you know, your argument that it relates only to -- your argument would be a lot stronger if the section, the relevant section, 2(b), didn't have the word successfully in it. I could understand Congress saying the Bureau of Prisons may cut a year off the term of somebody who completes the program. Then you could say, well, the bureau can, you know, can decide for itself whether this fellow, although he completed the program, has really been cured or not, or, you know, factors like that, but it doesn't say that. It says, it may release somebody who has successfully treated -- completed the program. Now, what factors do you think the may was intended to let the Bureau of Prisons take into account? It isn't completion of the program. No matter how successfully he completed it, he still is not entitled to it. Now, what could disable him from the year, other than killing another inmate while he's in there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "I think the traditional standards that are applied to good time clearly are going to be the type of criteria for good time release under section 36 -- 18 U.S.C. 3624, would obviously still be used. I mean, you have good-time release, which is the only other way you can get out -- basically you can get out of prison early. That was not affected by this legislation. They added an incentive up to a year. I think you've got to wed those two together, and I think that's the discretion that the Bureau of Prisons has and must have, not to create defining categories of exclusion before they start, but you can eliminate the good time type criteria that the Bureau of Prisons is familiar with, and it would appear from Congress, Congress recognized that this must be a long-term program, 6 to 12 months, that it was not easy, and they said the committee believes that such an incentive is necessary to draw into treatment many inmates who may not be willing to undergo a difficult program otherwise. They recognize that there's an 800-percent greater chance of a drug-addicted person committing a future crime, and Congress --"

      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "I think then, successful completion. A prisoner would have said, I successfully completed this program, I must be allocated up to a year, some period of time off. It is a right of mine, it is a handshake Congress made with me, and I must be given it, even though I violated every criteria for good-time release, this and this alone --"

      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",

It's clear the student has power over the student in the classroom, whether they complete the program, whether they obey, they're in charge of grading, correct, and here the Bureau of Prisons has that. But what the teacher does not have control over is which students enter the school. In this case, that's Congress. Congress has said, for the purpose of incentive, everybody with a nonviolent offense has a right to be a student and pass the course. Now, here the Bureau of Prisons says, well, all nonviolent offenders, yes, get to take the course, but we've already said you kids in this row, you people in this row will, even if you successfully do everything correctly, you don't qualify, not based on what Congress said --"

      "speech": "Yes, but supposing you had a rule that said, but there's a category of students who would normally get a gold star but if they threw an eraser at the teacher, they shall not get the gold star, and supposing you have here a program that said, you are entitled to the year, but if you have taken a poke at the warden you shall not be released. They just have a category, anybody who takes a poke at the warden, even though he's successfully completed the program, shall not get the 1-year benefit. Would that categorical denial be consistent with the statute, in your view?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",

    {
      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "That's correct. Congress took care of that. It created the two categories and left the administration to the Bureau of Prisons. The Bureau of Prisons here has created additional -- numerous additional categories. In my client's case, a nonviolent offender drug case with a sentence enhancement for possession of a firearm. They've created these categories in advance. I'm not arguing that the Bureau of Prisons doesn't have discretion over its institution. That's what the statute clearly says."

      "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
      "speech": "Well, because of the way they constructed this. First of all, subsection (e) on substance abuse had never been the law of the land until Congress identified that this was a serious problem. Okay. So they've got to enact substance abuse treatment, which they do. They require the Bureau of Prisons to treat 100 percent, or make available 100 percent all prisoners. Then they recognize, this is a tough program, let's give an incentive. At first it was to all prisoners, then it was -- the Senate created two categories, violent and nonviolent. Then it came down to substance abuse treatment. They added the incentive that said -- and they couldn't give them any time off up until the passage of part B, period of custody, and they created two categories, violent, nonviolent, and they said to the Bureau of Prisons, as we have given you the discretion over the years on good-time decisions, we give you that discretion as well in determining who successfully completes a treatment program, but we don't want to go the next step and make it a right of release. We want the discretion for successfully completing the program. So the common sense reading appears to be, you don't have to, you can take into other considerations, but nothing in that step-by-step process said, Bureau of Prisons, you may create additional categories that categorically exclude prisoners based on preconditions."

My argument is simply that Congress created the excluding category, and that was a violent offense, that the BOP, having created additional excluding -- not based on any activity in the prison, excluding categories, nothing in this act, legislative history, or the purpose of this, supports reducing the number of prisoners available for the incentive.

It wasn't raised below nor in this Court, nor did the court below address it and, in fact, our understanding is that no court of appeals has addressed that argument, but we do believe, as we explain in a footnote in our brief, that it is not subject to the notice and comment requirement. It could go into effect as an interim regulation, because it is a statement of policy, the way in which the Bureau of Prisons will implement the statute, and then in each case there is a determination of whether a particular prisoner will be granted early release."

It talks about the Bureau of Prisons granting good conduct time, and there are two different standards, and they're dependent on whether or not the prisoner was convicted of a crime of violence, and in fact this program statement also applies to that statute, although there's no discretionary determination, so the crime of violence is determined by the statutory definition."

I gather it's a difficult thing, and there just isn't enough inducement for somebody to force himself through this unless there really is going to be a substantial reward, and it seems odd to me that if that is the object, that Congress would have wanted, for example, to exclude the entire class of gun carriers who are obviously much more dangerous gun carriers, I assume, when they're under the influence of drugs, from the inducement that would lead, if the statistics are correct, to a reduction in the number of drug-using gun-carriers.

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, but the clear text just talks about discretion. The question is, what is the category of discretion in which it can operate. You emphasize the expertise of the Bureau of Prisons, which it does seem to me is terribly important. They're experts on how well the prisoners have done in prison, but are they experts in classifying which people should be eligible for this offense? Why are they experts in saying, for example, hate crimes should be excluded but heroin possession might not, or something like that? Why are they experts in that? They don't even -- the whole notion of abolishing parole suggested that the prison expertise is just about what happens in prison, not what happened before."

    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "Your Honor, we would disagree with that. The Bureau of Prisons has expertise on a daily basis of categorizing prisoners, for example, for security classifications. The first thing that happens to a prisoner when they are placed in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons is a determination of what kind of housing that person should be in. The main part of that determination is their criminal history, their past conduct --"

    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "Your Honor, also it depends on the criminal history of the individual, as does placement in a community correction facility. We would also point out that the statutory text granting this authority does not have any restrictions on other factors that the Bureau of Prisons consider and, as I mentioned before, it's very analogous in that respect to INS v. Yang, where the Court recognized that although Congress had provided a statute that allowed the Attorney General to grant a deportation waiver to an alien who had committed entry fraud, that that nonetheless still allowed the Attorney General to take into account circumstances surrounding the fraud in exercising their discretion whether or not to grant that waiver, and that's particularly the situation here."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Ms. Brinkmann, may I ask how the Bureau of Prisons implements this with respect to possession of drug offenders who do not carry firearms? Is that also categorical?

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "How is that? You've just answered my first inquiry about, it's discretion both ways, exercises discretion to have categories of inclusion, exclusion. If you fit that category you get released, so it's not that they're doing it case-by-case for people who commit nonviolent offenses without guns, but categorically for the other."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",

      "speech": "Yes, but we passed that hurdle. Everyone --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "After all of that is completed, yes, that is when early release is granted. It may not be up to 12 months, because in the exercise of discretion the Bureau of Prisons tempers the amount of early release, depending on the completion of the program. For example, if a prisoner is sent to the community corrections facility the bureau ensures that they complete the 6-month transitional drug abuse program there, and that may cut into their year of early release. They may end up only getting 6 months of early release, for example."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Let's take the case of a nonviolent offender who does not come within the bureau's regulation as the gun, and so forth. Do all of them get some form of early release, even though it's not the full 12 months?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "If they successfully complete the program, yes, Your Honor. There are other categories, of course, as we point out in the brief, that are categorically denied early release, and for similar reasons in the expertise of the Bureau of Prisons has determined that they pose a greater threat to the community when they're released, prisoners with prior convictions for serious crimes such as homicide, aggravated rape and assault, and also prisoners whose current offense involves sexual abuse of children. Those are also categorical determinations, and it is consist --"

      "speech": "In some instances they may be, Your Honor, and the Bureau of Prisons has set forth this regulation in order to further its purpose of consistency and even-handedness in applying this program, and to give fair notice to prisoners. I'd also like to emphasize that looking at the prior convictions and circumstances surrounding an offense, it's reasonable when predicting and looking at the threat to the danger of the community, because in fact that is all conduct that occurs in the community. One can say it's more rational, perhaps, to look at a prisoner's use of a gun when they were in a community when deciding what their conduct may be when they return to the community as a postinfraction during their term --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "The difficulty with that argument, that assuming that the incentive does increase the success rate of the scheme, the Bureau of Prisons argument seems to say, we would rather have gun-carriers using drugs released a year later than former gun-carriers not using drugs released a year earlier, and that doesn't seem quite so rational."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "We think that's precisely the type of expertise, though, that Congress relies on the Bureau of Prisons to bring to this type of decision. That's why Congress did not --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, but the way I just stated it, it seems irrational, and are you saying that the Bureau of Prisons has a reason to say that my factual assumptions just don't operate, that in fact the gun-carriers just do not seem to be subject to this inducement and therefore it's better not even to get into the question of early release? Is that their reason?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "Their theory, as they set forth in the program statement, is that the use of a gun in the course of a drug transaction increases the likelihood of use of force and violence, and for that reason granting early release is not appropriate. The full deterrent effect of serving the entire sentence is something that the Bureau of Prisons has determined is appropriate in those types of cases."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Ms. Brinkmann, can I go back to one of your responses to the Chief Justice? When he pressed you on the question of previous convictions for violent crimes for -- you mentioned some specific crimes, and he asked, are they nonviolent crimes, and you said in some instances they are, but in some instances -- or in some instances they aren't, you said. But in some instances they are."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And I assume that if we read the may, or more precisely if we read the excluded category of violent, of persons in prison for a violent offense as being exclusive, so that the Bureau of Prisons cannot add to that category, the result, I gather, would be that you could have somebody who happens to be in this time for a nonviolent offense, but who was convicted five times before of the most heinous, violent offenses, including murder, and that person would have to be released."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "Precisely, Your Honor. It's the situation where the instant offense is a conviction for money laundering of the hit man who has many, perhaps even a series of convictions, whether in the Federal or the State system. That's exactly the type of categories that the Bureau of Prisons looked to in deciding to exercise its discretion --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "Absolutely, Your Honor, and that is totally supported by the text, because of the point I think Your Honor and some of the other members of the Court made, when you look at the language of the neighboring statute using the word shall to mandate the provision of the substance abuse treatment program. The Bureau of Prisons does not have discretion to not make available the substance abuse program to prisoners who are eligible, and the terminology in the statute for that is someone who --"

The whole regulation isn't quoted in your brief, but the part that you have quoted on page 4 refers to the offense for which -- the current offense is a felony, b) that involved the carrying and so forth of a gun, so the regulation we're fighting about in this case is one that speaks only to the current offense."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "Yes, and carrying over to page -- well, page 3, you have to see that (a)(1) explains that in the exercise of discretion the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons is deeming certain categories of inmates not eligible for the early release. The first one is INS detainees, then we go on to pretrial inmates, contractual boarders, all of which are ineligible for reasons that are clear to the Bureau of Prisons in their expertise of the management of prisons. Subparagraph (4) talks about inmates who have a prior felony or misdemeanor conviction for homicide, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, or child sexual abuse offenses. The next category has to do with prisoners who are ineligible for the community-based corrections program. Then we get down to subcategory (6), which talks about inmates whose current offense is a felony, and then there are four subcategories of those, one being the subcategory at issue here, a felony that involved the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon. One of those other categories are offenses that are felony -- that involve sexual abuse committed against children. The other two have to do with the actual attempt or threatened use of physical force. The other is a felony that by its nature or conduct presents a serious potential risk of physical force against that person or property."

    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "One of the reasons that the Bureau of Prisons set forth these was to ensure that it had exercised its discretion in a regulatory manner because of problems that had arisen with inconsistent statutory interpretations by the lower Federal courts, which create inordinate problems for the Bureau of Prisons because of the -- not only that they have personnel in different areas of the country implementing different standards, but also prisoners are frequently transferred between different circuits. So they set forth -- and as pointed out, some of these offenses could also be covered under the violent offense category, but they wanted to set forth, out of fairness to prisoners also, notice beforehand, and also for the even-handed administration of the incentive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "One argument that's made is, because a couple of circuits said the bureau was wrong initially when it typed people who carried guns in connection with possession offenses, drug possession offenses, typed them violent and then said the -- and then the prison responded, Bureau of Prisons responded by saying, we're not -- no longer categorizing them as violent offenders, we're exercising our discretion to exclude them. That could be characterized as trying to do an end run around the court of appeals decisions that said, these crimes are not crimes of violence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "Your Honor, we do believe that the Bureau of Prisons' initial regulation actually was a permissible regulation. They ran into problems in some circuits because the courts -- because of their reference to 924(c). The court then held that they, the Bureau of Prisons, could not look to anything beyond the elements of the offense. That was really the problem there. So the Bureau of Prisons came back and decided to, as a matter of discretion, exercise that authority and make clear. We don't think there's anything impermissible about that. In fact, it's consistent with well-established administrative law principles that a agency's hands cannot be tied because of the inartful drafting of a prior regulation."

What isn't included, other than embezzlement and false tax returns?"

I can tell you, there's a substantial participation, Your Honor. The Bureau of Prisons informed me that currently there are approximately 16,800 prisoners participating in the program at one of -- either on the wait list, in the residential program, or in the transitional program currently, and --"

      "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
      "speech": "No, Your Honor, it is an incentive. It's a useful tool for the Bureau of Prisons to use in implementing the drug abuse program and, as I mentioned before, the Bureau of Prisons has, in fact, by regulation promulgated other incentives having to do with the prisoner being able to obtain the maximum time in a community correction facility. There are financial incentives for completion of the various phases of the program. So that is the Bureau of Prisons implementing the program and fulfilling the mandate that they make available this program to any prisoner who has a substance abuse program and wants to participate in it."

      "speech": "The bureau -- unfortunately, there is a very high percentage of Federal prisoners that do have problems, but again it goes back to the determination that Congress wanted to provide the Bureau of Prisons with this authority that it could grant this early release. The Bureau of Prisons does not have any authority or discretion without this statutory provision to grant anyone early release. If there's nothing further, Your Honor."

To answer statistically, and my source is the website of the Bureau of Prisons, there -- as of August of 2000 there were 63,621 inmates, or 56.9 percent of all the inmates in Federal prison were there for drug-related charges. The Bureau of Prisons also shows on their website that 2,633 people in 1999 got the incentive."

I suppose you could have a theory that the only thing that's explicitly excluded is an additional disqualification based upon the offense for which you're sentenced, because use of a gun involves the very offense for which he's serving, right? You don't have to carry the burden of saying that recidivism or a prior violent crime can't be taken into account, because that is not the condition that Congress has set forth. The only condition Congress spoke to was the very offense for which you're sentenced."

In the opinion, joined by all of you, it said, it could be argued that if the Attorney General determined that any entry, fraud or misrepresentation, no matter how minor, no matter what the attendant circumstances, would cause her to withhold waiver, she would be exercising -- she would not be exercising the conferred discretion at all, but would be making a nullity of the statute. That's my argument. The BOP is making a nullity of the incentive."
