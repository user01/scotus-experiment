  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "No.  I don't urge this Court that that is the case, that it's an entitlement.  The legislative history is clear that that was considered by Congress, and Congress did not wish to make it a right that if you simply go through the program yet you led the gang on the campus, or you created other disciplinary problems, that the Bureau of Prisons shouldn't have control over the prisoner while that prisoner was incarcerated, but this is something I'd like -- benefit?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It says may."

  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "The statute says may, but let's consider the structure of it.  3621(a) is very clear. 3621(a) tells the Bureau of Prisons that they may not release a prisoner until the expiration of the term imposed, or there's a good conduct section 3624, so when (e) was enacted -- and the legislative history is Congress also amended section 3621(b), which says the bureau shall make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each prisoner the bureau determines has a treatable condition of substance addiction or abuse.  All right, legislative history, Mr. Meierhenry, and those of us who resort to legislative history usually do so only where something is ambiguous.  We're dealing with the word may here in section (b), and what is ambiguous about the word may?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "I don't think there's anything necessarily ambiguous if you use another meaning of the word, give permission to.  I urge Your Honor that until the enactment of (e), if you had substance abuse treatment, if you had an incentive, the Bureau of Prisons could not turn anyone loose under any circumstances. What I am urging is a plain reading of this. Before Mr. Lopez, so to speak, becomes a prisoner, as you read this you would -- it would indicate that if you're a substance abuse user and you go through the program and you substantially complete it -- in other words, obey the ever walked in the institution, has been categorically eliminated because he has a sentence enhancement for preconviction activity.  He is categorically denied because of something that did not occur under the --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But that -- that may be a perfectly good argument, but it -- and it seems to me it takes cognizance of the word may, that Congress has already decided the categories of sentences, but I don't think just bobbing and weaving around the word may does your argument any good."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, everybody gets in the classroom.  The question is, having been -- not who is eligible for the program, but who is eligible for the early release afterwards.  As you've said to Justice Stevens, there's no exclusion from the drug treatment program."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "That's correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And the reason there's no exclusion from the program is that it says that the bureau shall establish the program.  If you read through 3621, what is really -- it just jumps out at you, is that it keeps using shall.  Shall, shall, shall, until it gets to the period of custody section, and there all of a sudden it shifts from shall to may, which means discretion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "It means discretion, but it is not a grant of discretion to categorically deny nonviolent weapon? I mean, if it's going to be a one-by-one examination for a defendant that fits in your client's category, wouldn't it also be one-by-one for anyone?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "It could be.  I don't have a definitive answer of how to run the Bureau of Prisons, except I'm here saying that this statute clearly tells the Bureau of Prisons how people are to get into the program for the purposes of the incentive, and that is all nonviolent offenders are to be considered, and that's to occur after successfully completing the program.  Here they've made that decision."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, could they make a decision categorically that all people who are nonviolent offenders who aren't carrying a firearm will get the reduction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "I think they've done that.  I nonviolent offenders, and the bureau can't go beyond that when it's talking about limiting the availability of early release."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "Chief Justice, that -- I guess that is essentially what I'm saying.  I'm saying that for the purposes of the incentive, that everyone starts the program and everyone has the opportunity to successfully complete it, and call that a category if you may, that it's while they're in the institution that they may be -- their activities may eliminate them from this category. It's not something that occurred at the time of sentencing, which was preconviction activity."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You're saying that the only precondition category that the bureau can use is the precondition category which is set forth in the statute, and which implicitly excludes other pre-imprisonment the program."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Then why didn't they use the word shall, rather than the word may?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "Because I don't think they wanted -- Congress wanted to create a right that just based on completion of the program, without regard to their other activities as a prisoner, that just the completion of that program meant you were entitled to -- and I think that's the word, entitled to reduction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You say you don't think that.  I mean, is there something in the legislative history that specifically supports that argument?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "Other than that it was clear, and I refer to the legislative history, the report.  It's clear from the legislative history that Congress said that this subparagraph we're discussing, they use the word"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you know, your argument that it relates only to -- your argument would be a lot stronger if the section, the relevant section, 2(b), didn't have the word successfully in it. I could understand Congress saying the Bureau of Prisons may cut a year off the term of somebody who completes the program.  Then you could say, well, the bureau can, you know, can decide for itself whether this fellow, although he completed the program, has really been cured or not, or, you know, factors like that, but it doesn't say that.  It says, it may release somebody who has successfully treated -- completed the program. Now, what factors do you think the may was intended to let the Bureau of Prisons take into account? It isn't completion of the program.  No matter how successfully he completed it, he still is not entitled to out of prison early.  That was not affected by this legislation.  They added an incentive up to a year. I think you've got to wed those two together, and I think that's the discretion that the Bureau of Prisons has and must have, not to create defining categories of exclusion before they start, but you can eliminate the good time type criteria that the Bureau of Prisons is familiar with, and it would appear from Congress, Congress recognized that this must be a long-term program, 6 to 12 months, that it was not easy, and they said the committee believes that such an incentive is necessary to draw into treatment many inmates who may not be willing to undergo a difficult program otherwise. They recognize that there's an 800-percent greater chance of a drug-addicted person committing a handshake Congress made with me, and I must be given it, even though I violated every criteria for good-time release, this and this alone --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What are those criteria?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "Well, obviously, obeying the rules of the institution, not having contraband, you know, those type of --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Because if you had contraband you would not have successfully completed this program."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "Exactly.  That's the discretion that obviously Congress had to give to them, because part of successful completion of a program is to obey the rules of the institution as well."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Then it should have used shall.  Then it should have used shall."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "Well, but if you use -- let me use my analogy of the classroom, all right. A student's in the classroom.  It's clear the student has power over the student in the classroom, whether they complete the program, whether they obey, they're in charge of grading, correct, and here the Bureau of Prisons has that.  But what the teacher does not have control over is which students enter the school.  In this case, that's Congress.  Congress has said, for the purpose of incentive, everybody with a nonviolent offense has a right to be a student and pass the course. Now, here the Bureau of Prisons says, well, all nonviolent offenders, yes, get to take the course, but we've already said you kids in this row, you people in this row will, even if you successfully do everything correctly, you don't qualify, not based on what Congress said -- completed the program, shall not get the 1-year benefit. Would that categorical denial be consistent with the statute, in your view?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "I think that is consistent, because it is activities in the prison over which the bureau --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So it isn't the mere fact that it is a category.  Your position is that if it's a pre-incarceration category, it's bad."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "That's correct.  Congress took care of that.  It created the two categories and left the administration to the Bureau of Prisons. The Bureau of Prisons here has created additional -- numerous additional categories.  In my client's case, a nonviolent offender drug case with a sentence enhancement for possession of a firearm.  They've activities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's a very sensible and logical theory, but what in the statute or the legislative history identifies that particular theory?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "Nothing specifically identifies it that way as opposed to my colleague's way.  To me, it is rational, it is something that makes sense, it is something that when you --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's more than that.  I thought -- I mean, come on, you're -- you'll have to give us some text to hang on to. I assume that what your argument is, is the familiar argument, inclusio unius exclusio alterius, that in fact the statute does identify one pre-incarceration factor that will disqualify you from obtaining the year's benefit, and that pre-incarceration factor is conviction an unambiguous statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well now, you -- but Justice Scalia asked you a particular question.  Is that or is that not your argument, and I think you --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "Well, it is my argument.  I -- what I was going to say, first we believe it's unambiguous, but if you get into the determination --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Excuse me.  Why is it unambiguous?  I don't understand what you mean by, it's unambiguous."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "Well, because of the way they constructed this.  First of all, subsection (e) on substance abuse had never been the law of the land until Congress identified that this was a serious problem. Okay.  So they've got to enact substance abuse treatment, which they do.  They require the Bureau of Prisons to treat 100 percent, or make available 100 percent all violent, nonviolent, and they said to the Bureau of Prisons, as we have given you the discretion over the years on good-time decisions, we give you that discretion as well in determining who successfully completes a treatment program, but we don't want to go the next step and make it a right of release.  We want the discretion for successfully completing the program. So the common sense reading appears to be, you don't have to, you can take into other considerations, but nothing in that step-by-step process said, Bureau of Prisons, you may create additional categories that categorically exclude prisoners based on preconditions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So your answer to Justice Scalia's question is basically yes.  Is that correct?"

    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If the Bureau of Prisons had a may not like it, the Court may not like it.  Clearly the Bureau of Prisons doesn't like it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So -- but essentially your argument then comes down to the may means shall.  It wouldn't make any difference if the word shall had been used, or must, that in this context may means shall or must."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEIERHENRY",
    "speech": "It would mean that again the door -- in this case, there is no door to the prison wall, but it would make the difference between the natural discretion the Bureau of Prisons has over the activities of the prisoners inside, as opposed to their activities that occurred when they were just --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So your answer is no.  You don't want us to read may to be shall.  You want us to read may to mean may, but that the scope of the discretion only excludes -- only includes matters other than pre- Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."

  {
    "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether the Bureau of Prisons permissibly exercised its discretion under section 3621(e)(2)(B) as reflected in its regulation and program statement."
  },

    "speech": "Ms. Brinkmann, I take it that discretion was exercised in the regulation adopted by the Bureau of Prisons."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
    "speech": "The regulation and program wasn't raised below nor in this Court, nor did the court below address it and, in fact, our understanding is that no court of appeals has addressed that argument, but we do believe, as we explain in a footnote in our brief, that it is not subject to the notice and comment requirement. It could go into effect as an interim regulation, because it is a statement of policy, the way in which the Bureau of Prisons will implement the statute, and then in each case there is a determination of whether a particular prisoner will be granted early release."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speech": "Because of the broad grant of discretion given the Bureau of Prisons by the express statutory language, Congress using the term may.

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but isn't this argument available to just that point, that it is perfectly clear from the legislative history that the object of allowing the 1-year reduction is to provide an incentive without which the drug treatment program could not be expected to work. I gather it's a difficult thing, and there just isn't enough inducement for somebody to force himself serious categories?"

  {
    "speaker": "BRINKMANN",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that may be, but the concern of the Congress was that we need an inducement to make our program effective.  Why -- if that is their premise, why would they exclude such large categories, or entire categories of offenders from that inducement?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but the clear text just talks about discretion.  The question is, what is the category of discretion in which it can operate. You emphasize the expertise of the Bureau of Prisons, which it does seem to me is terribly important. They're experts on how well the prisoners have done in prison, but are they experts in classifying which people should be eligible for this offense? Why are they experts in saying, for example, hate crimes should be excluded but heroin possession might not, or something like that?  Why are they experts in that?  They don't even -- the whole notion of abolishing parole suggested that the prison expertise is just about what happens in prison, not what happened before. conditions of his confinement while he's there.  Do they have any expertise in determining recidivism and making judgments accordingly?"

    "speaker": "BRINKMANN",

  {
    "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
    "speech": "Your Honor, also it depends on the criminal history of the individual, as does placement the Attorney General to take into account circumstances surrounding the fraud in exercising their discretion whether or not to grant that waiver, and that's particularly the situation here."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "BRINKMANN",

That incorporates any type of infractions, disciplinary community corrections facility the bureau ensures that they complete the 6-month transitional drug abuse program there, and that may cut into their year of early release. They may end up only getting 6 months of early release, for example."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let's take the case of a nonviolent offender who does not come within the bureau's regulation as the gun, and so forth.  Do all of them get some form of early release, even though it's not the full 12 months?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
    "speech": "If they successfully complete the program, yes, Your Honor.  There are other categories, of course, as we point out in the brief, that are categorically denied early release, and for similar reasons in the expertise of the Bureau of Prisons has determined that they pose a greater threat to the community when they're released, prisoners with prior and even-handedness in applying this program, and to give fair notice to prisoners. I'd also like to emphasize that looking at the prior convictions and circumstances surrounding an offense, it's reasonable when predicting and looking at the threat to the danger of the community, because in fact that is all conduct that occurs in the community. One can say it's more rational, perhaps, to look at a prisoner's use of a gun when they were in a community when deciding what their conduct may be when they return to the community as a postinfraction during their term --"

    "speech": "The difficulty with that argument, that assuming that the incentive does increase the success rate of the scheme, the Bureau of Prisons argument seems to say, we would rather have gun-carriers using drugs released a year later than former gun-carriers not using just don't operate, that in fact the gun-carriers just do not seem to be subject to this inducement and therefore it's better not even to get into the question of early release?  Is that their reason?"

  {
    "speaker": "BRINKMANN",
    "speech": "Their theory, as they set forth in the program statement, is that the use of a gun in the course of a drug transaction increases the likelihood of use of force and violence, and for that reason granting early release is not appropriate.  The full deterrent effect of serving the entire sentence is something that the Bureau of Prisons has determined is appropriate in those types of cases."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Ms. Brinkmann, can I go back to one of your responses to the Chief Justice?  When he pressed you on the question of previous convictions for violent crimes for -- you mentioned some specific crimes, and he to that category, the result, I gather, would be that you could have somebody who happens to be in this time for a nonviolent offense, but who was convicted five times before of the most heinous, violent offenses, including murder, and that person would have to be released."

It's the situation where the instant offense is a conviction for money laundering of the hit man who has many, perhaps even a series of convictions, whether in the Federal or the State system.  That's exactly the type of categories that the Bureau of Prisons looked to in deciding to exercise its discretion --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's not the point.  I mean, we're all agreed that it has discretion.  The issue is not whether it has discretion or not.  It's really -- it isn't the may that's the issue here.  The issue is whether that other provision, namely the disqualification of non -- of violent offenders is meant to be exclusive.  That's really the crucial provision here."

    "speech": "May I ask about the regulation?  The whole regulation isn't quoted in your brief, but the part that you have quoted on page 4 refers to the offense for which -- the current offense is a felony, b) that involved the carrying and so forth of a gun, so the regulation we're fighting about in this case is one that speaks only to the current offense."

The next category has to do with prisoners who are ineligible for the community-based corrections program.  Then we get down to subcategory (6), which talks about inmates whose current offense is a felony, and then there are four subcategories of those, one being the subcategory at issue here, a felony that involved the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon. One of those other categories are offenses that are felony -- that involve sexual abuse committed against children.  The other two have to do with the actual attempt or threatened use of physical force.  The other is a felony that by its nature or conduct presents a serious potential risk of physical force against that person or because of the -- not only that they have personnel in different areas of the country implementing different standards, but also prisoners are frequently transferred between different circuits. So they set forth -- and as pointed out, some of these offenses could also be covered under the violent offense category, but they wanted to set forth, out of fairness to prisoners also, notice beforehand, and also for the even-handed administration of the incentive."

That was really the problem there. So the Bureau of Prisons came back and decided to, as a matter of discretion, exercise that authority and make clear.  We don't think there's anything impermissible about that.  In fact, it's consistent with well-established administrative law principles that a agency's hands cannot be tied because of the inartful drafting of a prior regulation."
