      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to address three points. One, the correct prima facie standard under Batson is whether there's sufficient evidence to permit a judge to draw a reasonable inference of discrimination. Two, the challenger's own reasons must be disclosed in order for the Batson process to work and to prevent discrimination. Three, it is improper for a third party to speculate at the prima facie stage as to a challenger's possible reason because what needs to be evaluated is the challenger's own reason and own credibility and own demeanor, and not someone else's guess as a reason. The correct prima facie test is a permissive inference test where there is sufficient evidence to allow a judge to draw a reasonable inference of discrimination. That's equivalent to the test where a judge decides whether there's sufficient evidence to pass a case to the jury, although I'd like to add one small proviso to that, which is in case of doubt, the benefit should go in the direction of obtaining the reason because the goals of Batson cannot properly be enforced unless the reason for the challenge -- the challenge is stated."

One possibly reason was that she had a relative who had been arrested for a serious crime 35 years ago, and the second reason that he speculated was that she had -- was -- did not know whether she could be fair in the case of a death of a child.

But it's not that you have to show anything by a preponderance of the evidence, that -- you don't have to show discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence under title VII.

The employer may not respond, for example, if the employer does not believe those four elements have been established or the jury would find them to be established. However, if those four elements are established in the minds of the jury by a preponderance of the evidence, according to this Court in St. Mary's Honor Center and in -- in Burdine or Burdine, the obligation is on the fact finder at that point to find for the employee if there's no response at step two because a presumption is established. And Furnco expressly states that there is a presumption because the prima facie case if established makes it more likely than not that there was discrimination. The prima facie case in the run of the - - run of the cases we know the reason that those four facts are true is that there was discrimination in the face of silence."

It -- it shifts the burden of production, but the reason it does so is that, in the language of Wigmore, the employee, or in a title VII case, the objecting party, has gone further. The -- that party has not simply removed the obligation to present evidence from which one can infer a fact. But he has gone further and presented sufficient evidence to entitle that party to prevail in the face of his opponent's silence. And Justice Powell, writing the opinion in Batson, clearly referred to the Court's title VII cases, including the opinion that he wrote for the Court in Burdine, which in the footnote expressly stated that the McDonnell Douglas presumption does not adopt the prima facie case in the sense of merely allowing the jury to make a finding.

But then he says the words, prima facie case, can also mean a different thing, and the different thing is what the judge says then is, jury, you may find for the plaintiff, not you have to. And so I guess our question is which of the two meanings shall we take here. And my question to be -- to you is, why not the second?

Under Batson, you do, however, consider information that may refute the inference. Batson tells the judge to do that and to consider the totality of the circumstance. And Justice Stevens's observation about the difference between the two tests is true, but in the -- in the circumstance in which the question is whether it goes to the jury to avoid, for example, non-suit, that is because there is a fact finder for the case to go to separate from the judge, and that fact finder does not have to make an intermediate determination.

There are countervailing interests. In Ristaino there has to be much more than a mere possibility. In Batson, the Court sought to move away from the difficult-to-establish standard of Swain to something that would be more flexible yet still maintain the State's interest in having a peremptory challenge system. Your Honors, California does not stand alone in its interpretation of this test. As I mentioned earlier, there are very few States that have considered this issue. Connecticut, Maryland have done what this Court said it - - they should do, what all courts should do and look at the title VII cases. California has done that. It has not announced a standard that is inconsistent with Batson. It has announced a standard that follows from this Court's direction in Batson. It has required a shifting burden of production which does not occur until there has been either a presumption or a strong mass of evidence, to use Wigmore's term."

The Ninth Circuit has concluded that California's standard is contrary to and an unreasonable application of Batson. That's Wade v. Terhune, 202 F.3rd."

Now, as to whether other rules may apply, Batson has a footnote stating that it was not going to attempt to instruct courts on how to apply its process. That might leave room for other States to come up with alternate systems of proof. What is important here is that California's system is consistent, and as respondent, we are not seeking to require all States to do something. Rather, as the respondent, it is sufficient that California's process is acceptable just as California's process was acceptable in Smith v. Robbins for handling cases in which there are no nonfrivolous appeals on issues. A variety of standards perhaps could be tolerated."

I'm not sure it's more likely than not. I'm not sure it's even enough to go to a jury, but it looks suspicious to me. Why just -- how come you -- you struck all three blacks that were in the venire?

These facts indisputably present an inference of discrimination. The -- my opponent suggests that silence may be a strategic decision. But we have yet to locate any - - any case where any prosecutor anywhere in a situation remotely like this has chosen silence as the proper strategy. The purpose of Batson is -- is to elicit reasons from the prosecutor and then for the trial court to evaluate those reasons and determine whether or not, looking at the -- all the circumstances and the prosecutor's credibility and the type of case, whether or not their challenge is race-based. Reasons are crucial. In the appendix to our opening brief, we examined 84 cases in the last couple years where discrimination was found in violation of Batson. In virtually all of these cases, the decision turned on the evaluation of the articulated reason. In some of those, the articulated reason was unsupported by the record. From that, there was an inference and a finding of discrimination. In others of those, the articulated reason applied to many white jurors who were not challenged. All those facts existed here. The goals of Batson, which are admirable and important, which should apply in all 50 States, not just in 48, require -- need the reasons to be elicited because Batson won't work unless reasons are known and examined and ruled on on the merits and a record is made. We'd ask this Court to bring California into the mainstream and ask that reasons be called for in California under the same standard that they're called for everywhere else."
