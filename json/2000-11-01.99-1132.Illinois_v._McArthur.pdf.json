Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, a police officer who had probable cause to believe that readily destructible evidence was concealed in Charles McArthur's home secured that home from the outside while his partner went to see the judge to get a warrant. By doing so, the police officer, Officer Love, prevented what, as it turned out, would have been the certain destruction of that evidence. He also avoided doing something that this Court has often condemned in its Fourth Amendment cases."

    {
      "speaker": "BERTOCCHI",
      "speech": "I understand that argument, Your Honor, and I don't believe it applies in this case for a couple of reasons. One is that I believe the officers had genuine concern sufficient to allow them to impound, certainly, and perhaps to go in even before they spoke with him. Mrs. McArthur told the officers that she had just seen Mr. McArthur conceal the marijuana under the couch. She told them that when she came out into the house, and I believe that that told the officers not only that there was marijuana inside, which provided them with probable cause to search, I think that also demonstrated to them that Mr. McArthur, or at least would give them reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr. McArthur was interested in preventing them from getting access to the evidence and had already at least once translated that idea into action."

He -- the police had been outside for some time while Mrs. McArthur was moving her items out, and they wouldn't have been very good peacekeepers if they didn't let it be known, or she didn't let it be known that the police were outside while she was moving her items out. So at the time Mrs. McArthur came out and said all this, the police knew that Mr. McArthur knew they had been outside for some time, that they were in the company of his wife, who was angry at him and might be motivated to snitch on him, and she also told them that he had already taken at least some action to conceal marijuana, the marijuana that was inside, from them."

      "speaker": "BERTOCCHI",
      "speech": "Your Honor, she did not say anything -- there is no testimony in the record that she said anything other than that it was marijuana, and that is really one of our central points in response to that argument, is that the officers had no reason to know just what the stakes would be for any number of reasons. One of them was that. It is certainly unlikely that if they had asked her Mrs. McArthur could have said 2.3 grams. At most she might have said, a little, but a little can rise to the level of a felony in Illinois, and even a little little is a jailable crime."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERTOCCHI",
      "speech": "That is correct. Your Honors, Officer Love's conduct in this case was restrained and, indeed, specifically calibrated to intrude no more than necessary while giving full effect to the warrant requirement, and we ask that this Court approve that conduct because it will both protect both evidence and privacy. There are two facts that we believe demonstrate that Officer Love's conduct fell clearly within the limits of reasonable conduct under the Fourth Amendment. One of them, of course, is that there was no entry necessary in this case, and we believe that that substantially lesser intrusion is very important. It interfered only with Mr. McArthur's possessory interest in his home, and while those interests are certainly protected by the Fourth Amendment, the -- they are not -- they do not receive the high level of protection that privacy interests do, particularly where a home is concerned."

      "speaker": "BERTOCCHI",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speech": "But you would say the length of time would be a relevant consideration?"
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERTOCCHI",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I think under Welsh you can't say that it doesn't figure into the Fourth Amendment calculus. We believe that there was ample justification in this case in light of the quantity of marijuana. This is a case which the State of Illinois legislature has decided you can go to jail for. This is a case that the county prosecutor, who is the original jurisdiction prosecutor in the county, has decided was worth a search warrant --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "If it were different -- if, for example -- some counties around the country don't prosecute on cases like this, or maybe the quantity would have to be a little smaller.

      "speaker": "BERTOCCHI",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I think if they had a blanket policy that was known to the police officers, then I think they would -- you know, before they even got to that question they would doubt, or be sure that they couldn't get the prosecutor to approve the search warrant in the first place."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERTOCCHI",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I am not aware of that. I know that Mr. McArthur lived in Sullivan, and that Sullivan is the county seat of Moultrie County, so they didn't have to leave the town of Sullivan to get to the courthouse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Bertocchi, I guess your case is easy if you assume, as you do, that they had authority to enter without a warrant on the basis of exigent circumstances, but assuming I don't agree with you on that point, I'm concerned about complicating the criminal law more than is necessary. You're asking us to establish some standards below the exigent circumstances standard which would dispense with a warrant, and you're saying if you don't actually go into the house we want yet another test that's a little bit less than exigent circumstances. I'm not sure that human beings are capable of entertaining as many variations and figuring out what is less than exigent circumstances but still enough to justify this. Why shouldn't we just have one single rule? It's an exigent circumstances rule. If there are exigent circumstances, you can either go in the house or exclude the homeowner from going back in himself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERTOCCHI",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I agree that impoundment does present something of a complication, but I don't think it's that serious, and I think that the test is not all that different, because it's a balancing test ultimately, always. I think that in this case we also distinguish, as does --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, it's not a balancing test with exigent circumstances. If there are exigent circumstances you can go in. You don't have to say, you know, well, is it a really expensive house, or is it a less-expensive house, or, you know, is this person really concerned with his privacy, or is he the kind of guy who leaves his window shades up anyway? You don't balance anything. If there are exigent circumstances, you go in."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And when you have that test the courts know how to deal with it. Why don't we just have a flat rule, if there are exigent circumstances, you can either go in or you can stop him from going in?"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But the question presented is, is it reasonable under the Fourth Amendment for police officers who have probable cause to believe a residence contains evidence enough to secure the residence from the outside, so your question certainly assumes the existence of probable cause."

Your Honors, as I was indicating in response to Justice Stevens, the intrusion in this case lasted a surprisingly brief amount of time, but another important aspect of its limitation is that it was always intended only as a step on the way to getting a warrant. Impoundment is really not capable of analytical separation from getting a search warrant. It is a step in its execution which is designed to assure that if there is evidence in the house at the time probable cause arises, it will still be there by the time the judge -- the officers come back with the warrant if the judge signs it."

Are we going to have to, in the next case, ask whether, although the police could not arrest him without a warrant on the basis of just that probable cause, they could nonetheless prevent him from putting his hand in his pocket or, you know, follow him around and make sure that he doesn't put his hand in his pocket, which is a lesser intrusion than arresting him, arguably a lesser intrusion than stopping him -- I mean, is there any end to the number of variations of lesser, lesser, lesser intrusion that we'll be confronted with?"

      "speaker": "BERTOCCHI",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, in this case I think if -- that once he had come outside the house they could have arrested him because they had probable cause to arrest him and then, incident to that, I think they could have reached into his pocket.

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Of course, your theory, I take it, is that he could have been arrested in the house without a warrant because the indication that the police had was that he was possessing drugs inside, but they didn't have particularized knowledge that the amount of drugs was only -- only carried the offense to the misdemeanor level, so I take it you would have said he could have gone -- they could have gone in and arrested without a warrant."

      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For three reasons, police officers who have probable cause to believe that a residence contains incriminating evidence may prevent entry for a reasonable period of time in order to preserve the evidence while they obtain a search warrant. First, there's a strong law enforcement interest in preserving evidence pending issuance of a warrant. Second, securing the premises from the outside by preventing entry is a limited and temporary intrusion. Third, it's less intrusive than other means of preserving evidence, and it promotes fidelity to the Fourth Amendment's preference that searches be authorized by a warrant. When a residence contains evidence of a crime, there's an inherent danger that the evidence may be damaged or destroyed if people are allowed on the premises, and therefore, unless police have a means to protect the evidence during the time that it takes to obtain a warrant, the search pursuant to the warrant may often be fruitless."

That's, the fundamental principle of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and if under the circumstances reasonableness required some accommodation of the needs that were -- that the occupants were impeded from addressing because of the seizure, the police would have to reasonably address that.

It lasts only long enough to get the judicial determination about whether there's probable cause to search and seize, and it's far less intrusive than the other alternatives. For instance, if the police officers here had arrested respondent, that would have invaded his personal privacy and his liberty."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Even if the warrant were not issued. As I was saying before, the -- part of the reason that the intrusion is so small, is limited here, and that this is particularly reasonable, is that the other alternatives such as arresting the occupants, such as a warrantless entry, are more intrusive, involve invasions of privacy. They're more serious, and by providing an alternative to immediate warrantless entry this external impoundment option actually encourages police officers to seek a warrant before they search. The Court has therefore recognized a principle that the interest in protecting evidence can temporarily supersede possessory interest in property for the time that it takes to get a warrant in a variety of contexts. As I noted before, the Court's done it in dictum in situations involving securing premises, but the Court's held that that's true in a variety of cases like container cases, where the Court has held that if the police have probable cause to believe the container holds evidence they can seize the container pending a warrant to search it, and the Court's held that if the police have probable cause to believe that evidence that's in plain view is associated with criminal activity, they can seize it. The same principle that underlies that, the interest in protecting the evidence, the inherent danger that the evidence may be damaged or destroyed if there isn't an ability to freeze the status quo while the police get a warrant, the fact that the police are getting the warrant here, all point to the fact that it's eminently reasonable for the police to be able to secure the premises from the outside for a temporary time while they obtain a warrant to search. If there are no further questions --"

The State of Illinois and the United States of America want this Court to issue a broad rule that it is always all right for police officers to seize a home on the basis of probable cause alone. This Court should find that such a rule violates the Fourth Amendment for two reasons. First of all, it does not take into account the high esteem in which this Court's decisions place the home, and it is also not a logical extension of other cases concerning the seizure of property."

In this case you do have the homeowner present, and his possessory rights in the home are being substantially interfered with, and the Government's test of probable cause only simply does not take in to account the high esteem in which the home is held and the fact that it's very intrusive."

      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "No, Your Honor, there is nothing they could do, and the reason I'm suggesting that is, in Welsh v. Wisconsin the officers on that scene were faced with a similar dilemma. The only way they had to preserve evidence of Mr. Welsh's blood alcohol level is to do what they did, which was to enter the home without a warrant and arrest him before his blood alcohol level went down. This Court found that because that was a minor offense, the police officers could not do that in order to --"

      "speaker": "JONES",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, is that important, Ms. Jones, to your argument? I mean, supposing there had been a large stash of heroin. Would that make this case different?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, it would make this case different, for two reasons. First of all, I'm suggesting you reject the probable cause only test and stick with the probable cause plus exigent circumstances test, and the reason the quantity of the drugs would be important is because that goes to the exigency. As this Court observed in Welsh v. Wisconsin, the prevention of the destruction of evidence is not an exigent circumstance when you're talking about a minor offense. Presumably, then, it is when you're talking about a major crime."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But the police had no way of knowing the quantity at that point. I think you just told us, and correct me if I'm wrong, that if the crime would be a felony, then what was done here was okay. Secure the premises pending receipt of a warrant by the police officer. But if the crime is only a misdemeanor, then, too bad, you have to take the risk that the evidence will be destroyed. I think that's the line you're drawing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "Two responses to that, Your Honor. First of all, the line that I'm drawing is that the officers have to have probable cause and exigent circumstances. In this case, it's my position that they had neither, but the line I'm asking the Court to draw again is probable cause and exigent circumstances."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, is it exigent circumstances if it's a felony but not if it's a misdemeanor? That's what I don't fathom, because I thought from your brief and from what you said before that you were making a distinction between lesser offenses and felonies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "I am, Your Honor, that's true, and the reason I make the distinction is again, it's part of that analysis of whether or not the exigent circumstance of destruction of evidence is present. That's at least what the Welsh decision suggests, that if you're trying to preserve evidence of a minor crime, then the officers are not justified in entering the home to preserve evidence of that crime, so it's a factor of determining whether or not there's an exigent circumstance of destruction of evidence."

The officers I'm sure did not know that there were precisely 2.3 grams of marijuana present.

For example, in the application for a search warrant the State's Attorney thinks it's important enough to put in there that Mrs. McArthur is familiar with the appearance of marijuana. The State's Attorney also includes in there that Mrs. McArthur has seen marijuana on the presence -- or on the premises several times. He has her put in the affidavit that she has seen her husband use marijuana on several occasions. None of that information was given to Officer Love at the scene.

We don't -- we wouldn't have taken this case to decide whether in -- on these particular facts there was probable cause or not. That's not the kind of thing we normally do here. But you had said in your opposition, although probable cause existed, and the police entry was made peaceably. You're obviously talking about before the warrant was issued, and I took that to mean accepting the question presented, is it reasonable for police officers who have probable cause to believe.

I would think he might have gotten a Fourth Amendment medal, instead of Fourth Amendment criticism, because what he's doing is, he's trying to do the least restrictive thing possible consistent with the evidence being preserved.

Now, one thing you'd say was wrong with it was because he didn't have probable cause. We've discussed that enough. The second thing you think is wrong with it is because the circumstances don't justify it. You use this word exigent, but the reason why they don't justify it, what he's got before him is, the wife's told him there's pot under the sofa, the man lives in a trailer, he's told the man he's looking for the pot, and his knowledge of human nature.

Now, when that's specifically applied to our case, the reason there are no exigent circumstances here are twofold. One, Officer Love is the person that created the exigency of the destruction of evidence, and several lower courts have held that when police officers create the exigency of destruction of evidence, they cannot then use that exigency to turn around and enter a person's home without a warrant in order to preserve that evidence. Here, Officer Love admitted --"

      "speech": "May I stop you at that point, because I think you're telling the police, don't be candid with the people who you suspect about what's going on. It seems to me here the officers did everything by the book. They asked him whether he had contraband. When he said no they said, we're going off to get a warrant, and it seems what you're saying right now is that the police would have been in a better position vis-a-vis the Fourth Amendment if they had not told him what's up."

      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor, I am suggesting that. Several lower courts, including the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Roselli, have held that when it is reasonable or it is foreseeable that evidence will be destroyed if you ask for permission to search, if you go ahead and take that step and ask for consent and it's denied, you can't then turn around and use that exigency to enter the home without a warrant, because the police have created the exigency. Here, if you look on page 20 of the joint appendix, Officer Love testifies that at the time Mrs. McArthur told him that Mr. McArthur hid marijuana under the couch, Mr. -- or Mr. McArthur was still free to come and go from his home. However, once Officer Love asks Mr. McArthur for permission to search and is denied, from that point on, Mr. McArthur can't go in because now Officer Love is concerned that the evidence is about to be destroyed."

Whereupon, they burst in on the basis of exigent circumstances. I suppose we wouldn't allow that, would we, so you don't have to be frank with the criminal.

What makes this exigent is the confluence at a particular point in time in which the -- it isn't merely a case in which he has drugs, he knows somebody knows that he has drugs, he knows that maybe that somebody may go to the police. It's all happening in front of him at that time. He has the drugs, the person who's going to snitch on him has just seen the drugs, he can see the person outside his trailer talking to the police. It is sort of the temporal unity of all of this that gives it the exigency, and why doesn't -- that's my argument. Why doesn't it give a sufficient exigency?"

First of all, the police were out at the McArthurs for a while and again, Mrs. McArthur was coming and going out of the trailer this whole time the police were there. Evidently Mr. McArthur, from whatever he could gather from what was occurring there, wasn't concerned enough that his possession of marijuana was going to be reported that --"

I had frankly thought that this case involved neither the question about whether there was probable cause, nor the question about whether there were exigent circumstances. If there were exigent circumstances so the policeman could have gone in, this is an easy case. But you come up and argue exigent circumstances. It was not argued in your petition for certiorari. It was not contained in the question presented for review in your petition for certiorari, which is, by the way, different from the question that you show in your blue brief.
