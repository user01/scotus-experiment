I think I could design a label that's completely consistent and that meets the requirements that the Respondents wish to urge.

In other words, could they use, as they were required by Federal law to do, to use the precise label that in approving the application in 1998 the FDA required Wyeth to use, and also use the label that the Vermont jury determined should be used, and that was stated in the complaint and in the opening and the closing a statement that you may not, should not use IV administration or IV push, in other words that you should contra -- the label should contra-indicate something - -"

      "speech": "It didn't say -- it didn't say IV across the board. It said IV push is the claim, and that was -- as I understand this, the FDA was aware of the IV use and a certain risk. But did it ever, ever discreetly consider IV push versus IV administered the usual way by a drip bag?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAXMAN",
      "speech": "Yes it did, Justice Ginsburg, and I want to cite you to the portions of the record that demonstrate that it did. But before I do so, I just want to underscore a point that I think is clear from both our brief and the Solicitor General's brief, which is that isn't the test of preemption in any event. The question is what did the labeling say and upon what information was the labeling decision made. But as to your particular question, there are -- first of all, there was testimony in the record from multiple parties, including experts from both sides, that the FDA was aware of all of the forms of administration and the risk, including IV push. Their experts simply disagreed with the judgment that the labeling requires. But most saliently, the labeling in this case, which is reproduced, in sort of microscopic size unfortunately, on the last two pages of the petitioner appendix and the last two pages of the joint appendix, have four separate reference that, as we explained in footnote 11 of our reply brief, only apply to IV push. There is a reference to the use of the Tubex system. That is a direct IV push system. There is a reference to rigid plungers and small-bore needles. Again nothing to do with drip. There is a reference to a maximum rate of administration. Drip is gravity. The testimony in the case was that an instruction that a particular rate of administration not be exceeded only referred to IV push. And finally, there are cautions on the label about how the ordinary aspiration of blood to see if its bright or dark, which is only done in the context of a needle that is being used to push something into a vein, is not reliable in the context of this case because Phenergan discolors arterial blood immediately. So the labeling plainly comprehended and warned about the specific risks of IV push administration, and that's not all. There is an advisory -- an advisory committee in 1976 was asked to look at precisely the risk of arterial exposure to Phenergan injection or any other irritant drug that is administered intravenously and it made specific recommendations, including recommendations that go directly to IV push."

      "speaker": "WAXMAN",

And there is also test -- there is also evidence in the FDA record, including if you look at the 1987 correspondence that the FDA sent to Wyeth in the context of talking about what warnings had to be provided. The FDA provided Wyeth 20 citations to 20 medical journals that addressed this problem, and in footnote 13 of our reply brief we've cited the ones that specifically address the circumstances in which IV push administration is an important tool.

And the issue, Justice Kennedy, here is the FDA has to decide what information to provide to clinicians so that they can make judgments about what to use. And it -- what it did here is it provided ample, lavish warnings about the risk of intra-arterial injection and exposure of an irritant drug like Phenergan to arterial blood. It provided in the labeling to the physicians a cascading hierarchy of methods of administration. It said intramuscular injection is the preferred method. It then said with respect to intravenous injection that it is, as with any irritant drug, it is usually preferable to inject it into an IV infusion set that is known to be running properly, in other words where a line has already been established into the vein and the IV push occurs into the line that's already established. All that information was available to physicians and the FDA has to understand and does understand that in labeling to allow medical professionals to make their judgments, taking options away from physicians is not always better. It may not -- it may not even often be better. What the FDA has to decide in terms of telling physicians what's on the table and what's off the table and in terms of what's on the table what the relevant risks are is, is this ever -- would this ever be medically warranted?

      "speech": "Yes. I mean, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you've identified the respect in which this is difference than the medical device area. But for the salient purposes, I think the Riegel case directly points the Court to the nature of the determination that the FDA makes with respect to class 3 drugs. It goes through the same preclearance process. As we pointed out in our brief and as I think Justice Scalia's opinion in Riegel points out, the balancing time-intensive, data- intensive inquiry for medical devices was patterned after what is done for drugs, and it reflects a balancing of risks and benefits of the particular drug in light of the conditions and methods of administration prescribed in the labeling."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAXMAN",
      "speech": "Well, let me address both the established background of State actions and then the pre-emption clause difference, if I may. The Respondent and her amici have identified 97 cases going back 150 years in which tort actions have been brought with respect to pharmaceuticals. Very few of those cases - - and they are recent -- are implicated by the rule that the Vermont Supreme Court applied in this case, which is where a fully informed FDA, informed of all the information that Wyeth had, approved a labeling standard, but a court looking at the same evidence can reach a different conclusion about what is on the label. The most -- those cases I believe all post-date Cipollone. Many of them postdate Geier. And by my count, there are fewer than 20 such cases out of all of the cases that have been decided and those issues - - that issue had never come up and never could have come up when Congress enacted the 1938 Act, because it was only the 1938 Act that established a drug-specific, preclearance regime, and really in 1962, in which the FDA was required not just to evaluate safety in terms of licensing the distribution of the drug, but to balance safety against effectiveness. And so the -- the constellation of common law cases -- I mean, let me just say we are -- we are not seeking here a rule of field preemption. We are not seeking to preclude tort remedies for conduct that violates Federal law. What we are saying here is -- and this goes, I think, finally to your point about the express pre-emption clause -- the presence of expressed pre-emption clauses or the absence, the presence of a savings clause or the absence, does not and cannot affect the operation of conflict pre-emption under the Federal Constitution. Now, members of this Court are concerned about applying a broad, vague, or free-wheeling analysis of implied conflict pre-emption, but this case is heartland. A jury was asked to look at the same information and conclude that the precise language that the FDA just didn't allow, the FDA required Wyeth to use, rendered that drug unreasonably unsafe."

But as -- excuse me -- as I understand it, the -- the company, Wyeth, could have gone back to the FDA at any time and said, either based on experience or just our rethinking of the data that we have, we think the label ought to be changed to say \"Don't use IV push.\" Wyeth could have done that at any time, and it simply didn't do it. And the -- the reason I raise this is because it could have done it at any time, where, going back to Justice Kennedy's first question, where is the conflict?"

We -- we have both an impossibility form of conflict because, in the absence of any new information or new analyses of old information, we could not make the change in advance of getting approval. And we also have an -- an objects-and-purposes form of conflict pre-emption because the Vermont jury decided on the same information that the labeling that the FDA had approved and required was unreasonably unsafe. And we cannot have a world in which the very day after an intensive process -- the FDA says you may distribute this drug, but you must use this specific language -- either, A, manufacturers can just run in and change the label and ask for permission down the road; or, B, that a State jury -- let's take the easier case -- a State legislature or 50 State legislatures can decide: Because you could have gone back and asked, we can impose an obligation on you that you must have done so or must have changed the labeling.

I was -- I was going to identify the situation where -- and this has come up in the anti - depressant drug situation, for example, where there is evolving information. There has been a rule- making petition, in fact several over the years, to the FDA to change the labeling to warn against -- to warn about the possibility of suicidal ideation. And FDA has rejected that even though it's -- it's new information arising after the drug was approved. If the information is brought to the FDA's attention and FDA rejects the proposed change, then you would you have conflict pre-emption again. But if the information was never brought to the FDA's attention in the first place, then -- then there would -- it would be not inconsistent with Federal law to have a tort suit based on that.

But the second point is that in the 2007 amendments to the Act, Congress recognized the difficulties with this and gave FDA important new enforcement tools and resources to go after the problem of things that arise after a drug is improved - - approved, that has given FDA the authority to direct a change in the label, which it did not have before. It has given the FDA the authority to order new clinical studies, and it has ordered FDA to set up a data system where it will get electronic notification of -- of adverse events. I -- I should point out in the -- in the one year since these amendments were passed, FDA has, I -- I think, in 21 instances ordered clinical trials. In four instances it has ordered a revision of labeling. It has hired 430 new employees in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to address the post-marketing situation."

Riegle does contain an FDA -- an expressed preemption provision. But the reason why this Court found preemption in Riegle under that provision is very instructive here, because as Mr. Waxman pointed out, the premarket approval process in the two situations are essentially the same. And what you had on the one hand was Federal action having the force of law like under the file rate doctrine or some administrative determination having the force of law approving a license or -- or a drug, a legal prohibition against changing that without new information.

The second sentence of which reads: \"The labeling shall be revised -- this is after an applicant, a sponsor has obtained approval of the drug label -- \"it shall be revised to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious risk with a drug. A causal relationship need not have been proved.\" The testimony at trial established that Wyeth knew or should have known from at least the '70s that there was a significance issue concerning IV push risks. And, Justice Alito, in answer to your question - -"

People can say it's safe for you to walk down the sidewalk. That doesn't mean there is no risk that you get hit by lightning or something else. It just means in evaluating them together, they determine that it's worth the candle in particular cases where a physician determines that that's the indicated method."

But the idea that a label is set in stone for all time misunderstands the way the process works. When FDA approves a drug with a drug label, it does so on the basis of small clinical trials with very few, sometimes as few as a thousand or a couple of thousand people. And when the drug is marketed and goes to lots and lots of people that are not healthy, that are in different conditions, new problems arise. That's why the general -- the GAO found that over 51 percent of drugs have adverse drug events not known."

But as the amicus brief by Dr. Budhwani, et al. at pages 54 establishes had Wyeth been a reasonably prudent manufacturer over the years, it would have known that the risks of IV push so far outweigh any bearing negligible benefits, that it would have offered a stronger instruction, it would have moved to revise its label either with FDA approval or - -"

It simply says that the existing wording is inadequate. And if the case comes to this Court - -"

    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",

And here, the testimony at trial showed that an antinausea drug called Vistrol -- this is at page 79 of the joint appendix -- caused amputations in two cases. Pfizer voluntarily removed IV push injection for that drug. This was information in Wyeth's files; Wyeth knew this from the 1970s; and yet it did nothing to change the Phenergan label."

And I -- I - - if you responded to this particular point, I didn't get it. He said that he understood that Wyeth had in fact asked the FDA to modify the label, at least to strengthen the warning against IV push, and that request was -- was denied, so that in fact that -- that created the conflict. What is your response to -- to the factual basis for that -- for that comment?"

But essentially what the -- what the comparison was was talking about the preferability of injecting it through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning satisfactorily, which would suggest to most medical practitioners and was it the case in the trial testimony given by Dr. Green below, that that would suggest an IV drip, not IV push. When FDA then rejected it for -- for nonsubstantive reasons, it went back to the prior verbiage which is set out at 5a, which simply says if you put this drug in an artery the concentration can be such that it will -- it will cause harm. But our point is that these kinds of risks come to light frequently with drugs that are on the market and the need to revise these labels is the duty of the manufacturer. Section 314. - -"

Points out is that there was a lot of unpublished information about the harms of Phenergan that was known to Wyeth or should have been known to Wyeth in the '80s and '90s that would have justified a change under the CEE regulations."

Would you still -- would she still have a claim in your view, a non-pre-empted claim?"

    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",

One is can the manufacturer come forward with a label change on the basis of -- of information that is assessing the risk or reassessing the risk, and under the -- under the regulations it's absolutely clear it can do that before FDA has approved it. It is subject to FDA disapproval."

The only time -- you're saying pre-emption does not occur when there is -- forget the word \"new\" for a moment -- when there is further information, information in addition to what the FDA was told, whether it's 1,000 years old or discovered yesterday; and if there is liability predicated on further information beyond what the FDA was told, then there is not pre-emption.

There is no doubt that the FDA knew that IV push was a method of intravenous administration, but our point is a starker one, and that is that the FDA never was put to the test of deciding comparative risks and benefits of IV push versus IV drip. And it's that point that is crucial, because the catastrophic risks of IV push are so dramatic, no reasonable person could have made a safety determination to allow this drug with its risks when there are corresponding benefits that create exactly the same kind of treatment of care for the patient."

It should have had a basis for changing its label or proposing to FDA a different label, and that would be sufficient to satisfy the Federal standards as well as the State duty of due care.

We don't have evidence from the 1950s that would have suggested that the original label determination in 1955 would have caused a difference but certainly by the 1970s when -- when Wyeth was reformatting this as an old drug to comply with new standards, it should have known and it certainly should have known by the 1990s when several amputations had occurred from IV push Phenergan, which were in Wyeth's files. The people who analyzed these records, you know, were emphatic that Wyeth knew or should have known by the 1990s. And that was clear by the testimony of experts that -- that showed the comparison between Vistrol and Phenergan and on the basis of the IV push injuries that had occurred that were nonpublished. They appeared to have been reported to FDA, but Wyeth never took the trouble to do the synthesis, to connect the dots between these very terrible tragedies that had occurred from its drug, to bring about a labeling change or a modification that would have saved lives. And that is a failure on the part of the manufacturer not to comply with its standards of due care and with the regulations which require health risk information to be the basis of modifications to the labeling."

I think we would be able to establish that there was a justification on the basis of information before the reformatted labeling took place, and that was testimony by Dr. Green at trial on the basis of Vistrol, the other amputation that had occurred with Phenergan in 1965. And the -- the important point here is that on the basis of new information, if you are going to conclude that there is a standard that has to be met, I would urge you to consider two things: One is that the burden of showing absence of new information is going to fall on the manufacturer because it is asserting a pre-emption defense, but the way pre-emption gets argued in the courts, it is done oftentimes before discovery is permitted. So, if there is information in the drug manufacturer's files that would be relevant to a determination of the breach of duty by the drug manufacturer, if you decide pre-emption has to be done before discovery can be done, there would be no way to get that information."

    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "Well, let me -- let me address that question because your question goes to the regulatory compliance defense and that is not a pre-emption defense. It is a defense based on State law that the manufacturer in fact was not negligent because it complied with the applicable regulations. In that - - under that scenario, Justice Kennedy, the plaintiff is going to be able to obtain discovery and make arguments to the trial court about whether or not that compliance negated or did not negate negligence. But pre-emption is a Federal defense that would be asserted typically at the outset of the lawsuit before information is obtained. And notably, before 2000, FDA did not have subpoena power of drug manufacturers. It did not have the power to force labeling changes. It didn't even have the power to force drug manufacturers to make post-marketing studies."

Manufacturer: That's pre-empted. The claim is that you should have told the FDA and added something to your label. Manufacturer: That's preempted. Plaintiff: Well, you haven't read this reg here. The reg here which has been in existence since 1965 says that we can go and add something. I mean you can go and add something to show a contra indication, and that's the end of it. Now, in fact, 30 years later, I guess, without the horrible things happening that Justice Scalia mentioned, or maybe they did -- I don't know. But 30 years later the FDA makes another mention of new information. I take it that's in 1982. That's the first time that happened. Now, if I'm right about that, what happens when no one says a word about that? Of course, if the manufacturer had said something about that, then maybe the plaintiff would have said: And it was new. It was new, but the manufacturer doesn't say a word. Are you following what I'm saying?"

The regulations at 314.80(b) establish that the -- that the manufacturer has the responsibility to do post - marketing analysis and post-marketing surveys to determine the continuing safety of its drugs. If the manufacturer doesn't do that, it isn't complying with the Federal regulations which have an ongoing duty on them. And so in the case where there is silence, I would respectfully submit the manufacturer is not complying with its regulatory duty to ensure that there is current information about all of the side- effect risks of its drugs.

      "speaker": "WAXMAN",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to make -- I do want to go to -- make a preliminary point about all the talk about misbranding here. The statute has two criminal prohibitions. One is misbranding, which is the original 1906 reactive penalty. If the FDA subsequently finds that something is false or misleading, it CAN come after you for misbranding. But this case involves the criminal prohibition against distributing drugs for which there is not an approved, effective application. And that's what's at stake here. Now, the notion that there was any -- any misunderstanding in the trial court about whether there was new information or whether there was -- there were incidents that the FDA didn't know about, or it didn't evaluate the risk, is just flat wrong. The plaintiff tried this -- the plaintiff's experts said the FDA knew about this risk. Wyeth knew about this risk for decades. That is what is so wrong. That is why he stood up and said the FDA doesn't decide this question. You decide this question. And there was never, ever a suggestion in the record in this case, nor could there have been, that Wyeth ever failed to bring every single adverse-event report to the FDA's attention, every analysis that it did to the FDA's attention. And what the record does show is that after -- between the time of the 1955 approval of the new-drug application and the 1998 rejection of the SDNA, the Supplemental New -- SNDA, the Supplemental New Drug Application, that did have more extensive, stronger warnings in this case, Wyeth filed five -- and these are all in the joint appendix -- five supplemental, new-drug applications, each one asking for more language, more warnings, about direct IV injection. It's not called \"push.\" It's IV injection versus drip, which is a gravity method. And, in fact, Mr. Frederick says: Well, you know, in this case there could have been stronger warnings, and that -- and this case wasn't really about -- the jury wasn't really asked to -- it didn't really say that the label had to contra indicate something that the FDA-labeling required. That is exactly the opposite of what the trial lawyer told the jury at opening and at closing. What he said is this was unreasonably unsafe because it didn't say: Do not use by intravenous administration. With respect to whether or not the warning -- the last SNDA which we submitted, which was in 1987 and is reprinted in the joint appendix -- not only is it an original, but there is a typewritten version that actually has the text in the type size that one can actually read. At the summary-judgment stage that the pre-emption issue was decided -- may I finish my answer?"

    {
      "speaker": "WAXMAN",
      "speech": "Summary judgment was decided at the -- pre-emption was decided at summary judgment before trial. So there was no evidence about what was new or wasn't new. In Ms. Levine's motion for summary judgment, she uses the word \"new\" information about labeling change. And, with respect to the proposed 1987 language, the '88 change that we asked for, she said - - and I'm reading from page 24 of her motion for summary judgment -- \"In 1988, Wyeth drafted changes to the warning which advised that the use of a free-flowing IV would ensure adequate dilution and reduce the risk of arterial injectia. Although not strong enough, this improved the labeling instruction; if followed, would have prevented the inadvertent administration of Phenergan into an artery for the reasons described.\""
