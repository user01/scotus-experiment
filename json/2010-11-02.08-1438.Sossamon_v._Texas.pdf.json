Take statutes like Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, section 504 of the ADA, the list goes on and on, where Congress has created damages as the quintessential remedy to enforce civil rights, and when Congress has subjected States to suits under such statutes, it has always put them on equal footing with other defendants and subjected them to damages as well.

It's looking at that language and the way the court interprets statutes generally, among other things, looking at the tradition of what constitutes appropriate relief for a violation of this sort. We do think that Barnes v. Gorman is appropriate precedent in telling the court -- in telling Texas what kind of relief is generally thought appropriate to satisfy Congress's desire to remedy violations of a Spending Clause statute. We recognize, of course, that Barnes didn't involve sovereign defendants, but the local governments in that case had the same rights as a State would. It just comes out of the Spending Clause rather than the Eleventh Amendment. That is, both constitutional provisions prohibit Congress from subjecting defendants to damages suits under Spending Clause legislation without their consent. And this Court has enforced that identical constitutional right with the same clear statement test derived from Pennhurst v. Halderman. Even more, the contract analogy the Court relied on in Barnes is no less apt simply because one of the recipients is a State."

So Congress wouldn't have been thinking that appropriate relief is defined in some sense by the scope of the PLRA. In addition, we think that the fact that Congress expressly said that the PLRA applies to limit the relief that's otherwise available under RLUIPA shows that Congress didn't think that the PLRA itself made the relief inappropriate. It's simply that there is some relief that is otherwise appropriate that will be limited in some circumstances by the PLRA."

    "speech": "The statute, I think, does not in light of Barnes, because Barnes said that you get traditional contract remedies and punitive damages are not a traditional contract remedy. Beyond that tradition, though, there's also textual cues in the statue itself. There are three of them that I would like to focus on. I'll list them and then discuss them. One is the definitions section, which lumps States in together with local governments in the is the fact that the statute separately already authorizes suits for injunctive relief against State officials, making the addition of suits against States effectively surplusage unless some other kind of relief is available against the State. Beginning with the definitions section, this Court recognized in the United States v. Nordic Village that where Congress, in the Bankruptcy Act, defined \"governmental unit\" to include both the United States and a State, that Congress was making clear, quote, that \"States and Federal sovereigns are to be treated the same for immunity purposes.\" I think the same lesson comes out of the fact that RLUIPA defines \"governments\" to include not only States, but local governments, and subjects all governments to the same cause of action for the same appropriate relief. Congress was expressing there as clear as it could that there was a definitional equivalence between States and local government."

    "speech": "Well, maybe let's talk about them, then."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RUSSELL",
    "speech": "Okay. One is the fact that, as I mentioned before, the statute -- and I think the State agrees -- already allows suits for injunctive relief against State officials in their official capacity. The only thing that adding States as defendant would accomplish in light of that would simply be a change in the caption of the lawsuit, unless States are subject to some relief that State officials under Ex parte Young are not."

    "speech": "Well, I would set aside the question of whether Ex parte Young applies of its own And then the question is, well, what does it accomplish to also authorize suits against States? And I think the obvious answer is it authorizes a damages claim against the State. And even in light of Barnes, the State seems to acknowledge that damages are appropriate relief against local governments under this statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, I can conceive of a case where -- where the State's violation of RLUIPA consists of a State statute that simply deprives the individual of his rights under RLUIPA. What State official would you -- would you sue? It seems to me you couldn't sue the State legislature, so it would make sense to have an injunction against the State."

  {
    "speaker": "RUSSELL",
    "speech": "I think it's common in that circumstance to sue the State attorney general for Ex parte Young relief, for example, if you have a constitutional claim against the statute, as may very well have happened in the California case, or the relief against local governments, but Congress made clear that when it intended the identity of a party to result in a dramatically different scope of relief, it did so expressly, and you can see that in the U.S. enforcement provision. There, Congress specially authorized suits by the United States and had its own remedial provision which provides only for declaratory and injunctive relief. And that shows both that Congress didn't expect courts to simply figure out that different kinds of defendants would be subject to different appropriate relief, but also -­"

  {
    "speaker": "RUSSELL",
    "speech": "Well, the fact -- I would say two things about that. One is Congress didn't limit that provision to suits against States. It's anybody who gets sued by the United States is limited to provision and we think that suggests the same relief. That provision also kind of -- the language of that provision, \"injunctive or declaratory relief,\" stands in pretty stark contrast to the facially broader phrase \"appropriate relief\" in the general provision. In addition to RLUIPA itself, I think it's also worth pointing out that the State had independent notice under section 2000(d)(7) -- this is the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, where Congress made clear to Texas that it would be subject to suit for damages under any statute that -- under a section of any statute that prohibits discrimination by Federal funding recipients. And I think the question here boils down to whether RLUIPA is materially distinguishable from section 504, which is listed in section 2000(d)(7) as an example of a statute prohibiting discrimination. And if -- I think that means that the catch-all has to at least be broad enough to encompass section 504, and in our view, the two statutes are not distinguishable. effect of the issue here on persons who are in State institutions other than penal institutions. What would be -- what's the effect of the issue here on land use restrictions? Are there many cases in which issues involving land use restrictions are -- are raised in litigation against the State as opposed to a municipality?"

But if this Court were to, you know, section -- the provision that we are talking about here applies to land use as well as to institutionalized persons, and one would ordinarily think that the statute would have the same meaning depending on context. I recognize that the State's basic argument is that the meaning changes depending on who the defendant is, and I suppose if you accept that it could also depend on -- on what provision is being applied."

But as this Court said in Barnes, when a -­ when a recipient of Federal funds takes the funds, it is on notice that it is going to be subject not only to the remedies explicitly provided in the text of the relevant legislation, but also to remedies that are traditionally available in suits for breach of contract, and those include compensatory damages and injunctive relief. Now the State would have this Court turn that presumption, in terms of traditional contract rules, on its head by saying that this -- that this Court should hold that the State presumptively waived not to encompass the same word -- not to encompass the monetary relief, and also there was some legislative history where people testified and told Congress at the time that the word \"appropriate\" won't encompass monetary relief. Am I remembering that correctly?"

  {
    "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
    "speech": "Well, this Court has consistently applied a clear notice requirement to conditions that Congress places on Federal funds. That clear notice requirement arose out of cases like Pennhurst and South Dakota v. Dole, in which there were State recipients of Federal funds. And the Court said that the validity of Congress's constitutional action in exercising its Spending Clause authority depends on it giving the recipients of the funds clear notice of the conditions that they are agreeing to because of the contract-like nature of Spending Clause legislation. Now, that same rule was applied in Franklin and Gebser and Davis and Dole, even though the defendants in those cases were not sovereigns. It's still the same notice requirement and there is no reason to think that a county government would be able to understand, would be on notice that it would be subject to compensatory damages suits, and a State government would not. To be sure, the State government has more to give up. It might be a harder choice for the State about whether to take the money or not. But the choice is the State's, and when it says yes, I'm going to take this money, it agrees to the conditions that are attached to the money."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Some would say that injunctive relief attaches more to the public FISC then compensatory relief. Because future conduct or change immunity is injunctive relief. Any prospective relief is less intrusive on sovereign immunity than any form of retrospective relief, damages and that sort of thing. But especially true in this context, because when you talk about the Spending Clause, we can walk away from injunctive relief, from an injunction at any time. We can simply stop receiving the funds and stop accepting the funds and the injunction evaporates, but we can't walk away from a damage remedy. So we are construing the express cause of action in RLUIPA, like in RFRA, to do the judicial minimum. Which is that judicial relief which requires states to do what we are already required to do, which is to comply with the substantial burden mandatory under RLUIPA. So the fact that appropriate relief is essentially inherently ambiguous should end the analysis, because after all, the Court is required unmistakably clear text and rejected merely permissible inferences for two reasons, to ensure both careful, robust deliberation by Congress before disturbing the federal state balance of power, as well as to ensure clear notice."

I think they have, both the Petitioner and U.S. have indicated that the statute should treat state and locals the same way. The problem with that is the Constitution obviously treats states and locals very differently. The Constitution treats the state and federal government in the same way, in that both enjoy sovereign immunity and included in that are the principles of sovereign immunity, the need for specific waiver, not just a clear waiver, but specific as to the scope of the waiver, and specific as to the remedies."

    "speech": "I mean other States -­ they say, oh, the liabilities are just too great, we recalibrate that decision. Their core argument is that we should just extend Franklin and Barnes to States. The fatal flaw with that argument is that the very principle on which Franklin and Barnes apply -- are premised, that principle does not apply to sovereigns. When Congress passes a cause of action and is silent or ambiguous with respect to the remedies, there is a traditional presumption that we apply. Non-sovereigns now expect to be subject to any possible remedy under the sun. Precisely the opposite rule applies to sovereigns. We know that for sure as a matter of precedent in Lane, which rejected Franklin as applied to a sovereign. We also know this as a more fundamental basic principle of sovereign immunity, because when it comes to sovereigns, we have to have not only a clear waiver, but also a waiver that is specific to the remedy that is being sought. These two rules can't be reconciled. You either can apply the traditional presumption of all problem, but we submit that fundamentally misreads Franklin and Barnes, because what's doing the work in Franklin and Barnes isn't the Spending Clause. It's actually quite the opposite. The Spending Clause is cutting back against the traditional presumption. In Franklin -- I will take each case in turn. In Franklin, you see pages and pages of analysis in section 2 of the opinion, where there is exhaustive research about Bell v. Hood and the traditional presumptions that the Court has applied for decades under any thought of Federal power. The Spending Clause makes an appearance in Franklin only at the very end in section 4, invoked by the defense as a potential reason not to apply the traditional presumption. The court, you know, gets past that on the grounds that the traditional presumption is so strong that it does provide the clarity for non-sovereigns. It doesn't indisputably apply to non-sovereigns; why not apply it under the Spending Clause as well? been entitled to, except for the fact that this was a Spending Clause case, and that's precisely why he lost that punitive damage award. So put simply, yes, it could be that under Barnes and Franklin, remedies would be clear enough in that one context. The problem is it's not clear enough in this context, because sovereigns present a completely different constitutional context. I want to address very quickly Justice Sotomayor's question about Ex parte Young. I think you were exactly right that Ex parte -- that our reading isn't in any way redundant with Ex parte Young, but I want to note an additional reason why we are not redundant. We need to confirm, Congress needed to confirm, that there was in fact a privately enforceable right, and that's why our reading in no way renders the Ex parte Young concept redundant."

Gibson which talks about how the words appropriate relief, remedies in that context, by definition have no fixed meaning; they can't possibly have fixed meaning. So it has to enlarge or contract. And prior to 1991 -- prior to 1991 amendment at issue in that case -- the Court would unanimously agreed that appropriate relief would not have included money damages. Ruckelshaus provides similar guidance, in that I think the phrase was, there was no possible -- no comprehensible or principled meaning to the phrase a lot of reasons why that would be so, but I think the simplest is simply to acknowledge the difference between section 2 of RLUIPA and section 3. Section 2 of RLUIPA is much like the four provisions expressly enumerated in 2000d-7, in that all of them have the word discrimination and more importantly turn on the concept of discrimination. A discrimination is an element of a cause of action under section 2, or under any of the four provisions enumerated. By contrast section 3 is not. You can have discrimination as -- as part of your fact background if you want but it will have nothing whatsoever to do with whether have you a valid section 3 claim or not."

    "speech": "You -- you have already addressed this but I think it's their -- the position of your friend on the other side of the case is that with the Spending Clause you have a contract. The State has some extra protection, and therefore we need not be quite so strict in -- in construing waivers -- waivers about the clear statement rule. Or do you think the clear statement rule applies with equal force whether it's a Spending Clause or a direct regulation under say, the Fourteenth Amendment?"

    "speaker": "HO",

We don't see anything in the law that suggests that sometimes there is a clear statement rule and sometimes there is a super-duper clear statement rule. I think there has been some suggestion -- or maybe there has not been any more; I'm not sure; I read the briefs the same way, I think the same way that the Justices did. But they seem not to be arguing that any more. So it should be the same standard. I -- I certainly acknowledge that when it comes to the Spending Clause as you wrote in your dissent in Davis v. Monroe, that the Spending Clause if anything does raise special constitutional considerations as a general matter, Clause is not doing any work with regard to providing an assumption or presumption of remedies. Again, it's exactly precisely the opposite. Franklin and Barnes both articulate that it's the traditional presumption that applies to any exercise of Federal power. That traditional presumption is what's doing the work. The Spending Clause if anything is a cut back. So the notion that just invoking the Spending Clause suddenly puts States on this fabulously clear notice, I think just does not work. If there are no further questions, Your Honor?"

Unless this Court is, in fact, going to create a proliferation or hierarchy of clear statement rules, the Pennhurst rule that applies in the Spending Clause context of local governments applies in exactly the same way to a state government under the Eleventh Amendment and Barnes' Court construed the express private right of action under section 504, which incorporated by reference the remedies available under Title XI, which this Court construed to authorize appropriate relief. Exactly the same remedy that RLUIPA authorizes. And so the state for the first time today has suggested that the city of Austin is not bound by Barnes. I don't see how they can reach that conclusion. Barnes quite clearly says that the local government is subject to -­ and is on notice that it has clear, there is a clear statement in every Spending Clause statute that they are subject to a damages remedy so long as they accept the funds because of the contractual nature of the obligation.

Justice Breyer, with respect to RFRA, as far as I know, there is only one court of appeals case that says the United States is not subject to suits and that process hearing process there. In general, damages are the quintessential appropriate relief for violations of civil rights, and there is no reason to think that Congress was creating in RLUIPA a second class civil right that wasn't deserving of a remedy that Congress has provided even against states in every other context. With respect to the state's belief that the Eleventh Amendment somehow prefers injunctions over damages remedies, as counsel for the United States pointed out, the Eleventh Amendment is no basis for that. It treats injunctions and damages as equally offensive to state sovereignty, and in fact, particularly in RLUIPA, where damages are often capped significantly by the PLRA, the concern really ought to be on the states by injunctive relief, which will frequently have a much more significant effect on the public FISC than a small damages award. And finally with the state's argument that the words appropriate relief are too inherently ambiguous to meet any clear statement. Well, this Court example, like Richlin, relied on how statutes apply with respect to private parties to give meaning to the otherwise ambiguous word \"appropriate\" in the federal statute waiving the federal government's sovereign immunity.
