  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether the award of back pay to an undocumented alien who never was legally present or legally authorized to work in this country conflicts with this Court's holding in Sure-Tan or with this country's immigration laws and policies. In Sure-Tan, this Court held that the discriminatees in that case must be deemed unavailable for work and the accrual of back pay therefore tolled during any period when they were not lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the United States. The Sure-Tan Court's back pay limitation is consistent with INA's dual requirement that to be employed in this country an alien must be both legally present and legally authorized to work. Despite this dual requirement, the board contends that Castro is entitled to back pay even though he never was legally present or legally authorized to work during the back pay period. The fatal flaw in the board's position lies in its adherence to its physical availability doctrine. The board contends that this Court denied back pay to the discriminatees in Sure-Tan only because they had left the country and were physically unavailable for work. If the board is right, the Sure-Tan discriminatees could have illegally reentered the country to establish physical presence and to commence the accrual of back pay. However, such reentry would violate the immigration laws of this country and be contrary to this Court's holding in Sure-Tan."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Have the immigration laws changed at all in any relevant respects since our decision in Sure- Tan?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, the passage of IRCA in 1986."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And what relevant changes did IRCA make?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "IRCA was an amendment to the INA that made the employment, the knowing employment of undocumented aliens unauthorized from the employer's perspective."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And is it correct that when Sure-Tan was argued, IRCA, if that's the way you pronounce it, was being considered by Congress and the Government in its argument told us that if IRCA had been passed, back pay would not be available?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. Recognizing, as it must, that this Court in Sure-Tan conditioned the accrual of back pay on legal presence, the board contends that the Sure-Tan Court sought only to deter the discriminatees from illegally reentering this country to claim back pay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, when you say conditioned it on legal presence, I mean, in fact they were not present. I mean, the people in that case were still out of the country, weren't they?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So you have to acknowledge that it was dictum."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I would not call it dicta only because the Court set forth the conditions upon which the discriminatees might receive back pay if they were to legally reenter the country."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's right, but it only had to say one condition in order to decide the case. Namely, you had to be in the country, and it went on to say, and in addition you have to be available to work, but that is really unnecessary to the decision."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Well, the threshold condition was legal reentry, and that was the starting point of the analysis. If they were to reenter, then of course they would have to establish at the back pay hearing --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. McCortney --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "-- legal authorization to work."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If that is so, then why did the Court make the comment on page 901 of the opinion in footnote 11, talking about the board has said it will make it an arbitrary number of weeks, and the Court said the board has never attempted to impose a back pay award that the employer must pay regardless of the actual evidence as to such issues as the employee's availability to work? All of that would have been unnecessary if it were just this blanket rule, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I think in footnote 11 what the Court was addressing was the minimum back pay award of 6 months that the court of appeals had imposed and the board had adopted, and then the board tried to defend that award by arguing that it had in other cases had estimates of back pay, despite the fact that the discriminatee was unable to establish with any certainty the probable length of the back pay period. I think the Court there was simply saying that, look, you don't even go so far as to provide any showing of proof as to how long these discriminatees would have worked before their apprehension by the INS, but we don't read that to mean that had those discriminatees in Sure- Tan remained in the country, that they would have been entitled to back pay, because they wouldn't have been legally present and legally authorized to work."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, if the opinion in Sure-Tan we think equivocal, if it's a wash either way, what is your principal argument for reversal here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Assuming that Sure-Tan is equivocal?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "That the board's award of back pay conflicts with the immigration laws and policies of this country as embodied in the INA and IRCA."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, what do you say the argument that the board makes that even if the dictum in Sure-Tan were a holding as you say it should be treated, that the statute has changed the landscape, and that the board's rule in effect is in aid of the statute, because the board is saying the illegality on the part of the employer comes when the employer knowingly employs these people despite knowledge of their illegal character, so in effect we're going to say that the obligation to pay back pay stops when the employer knows that the alien in fact is illegally there. Up to that point, however, we're going to follow a different policy. We're going to make the employer pay back pay because otherwise we would make it very easy for employers. We would, in fact, create an inducement for employers to ignore the law by, in effect, winking at illegality on the part of the workers, so the board is saying, sure, the statute changed the legal landscape even on your reading of Sure-Tan, and we've come up with what seems to be a sensible way of implementing it. What is your response to that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, just the mere prospect of receiving back pay in this case encouraged Castro to extend his illegal stay by more than 4 years and to continue using --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I think you're right, but the board is saying, yes, there's that inducement on one side, but there's a very powerful employer inducement if we come out the other way, and although I don't think the board put it in these words, I take it the board is saying, we think the employers are going to make a rational decision about inducements more clearly or more obviously than employees, the illegal aliens might do, so we're going to prefer the inducement or the policy that is going to have the strongest effect on the employers. Isn't that a permissible choice for the board to make?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor. The board's authority here is to enforce the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act to the extent that they do not conflict with the immigration laws and policies of this country, and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But the board is saying we can't have it both ways. No matter which way we go, something we do would provide an inducement to violate the immigration laws. We think probably the best way to get where we want to go is to concentrate on inducements on the employer."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't believe that those, the deterrence of the employer to -- that knowingly hires illegal aliens or employs them, that awarding back pay is necessary in light of the sanctions under IRCA that now subject employers that do so to civil and criminal sanctions, and so --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Wouldn't it also be the case that if the employer, by reason of this inducement, hired -- supposed inducement -- hired somebody whom he knew at the time of the hiring to be an unlawful, an illegal alien, even applying the board's rule, he wouldn't have to pay any back pay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What is -- here -- I think Justice Souter is -- we said in our cases just what Justice Souter said, I take it, INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, quoting what Sure- Tan says. An employer can be guilty of an unfair labor practice in his dealings with an alien, notwithstanding the alien's illegal presence in this country. You agree with that. Retrospective sanctions against the employer may accordingly be imposed by the board to further the public policy against unfair labor practices. Now, those -- that's what the Court said. Now, this is a retrospective policy, a retrospective sanction of a compromise variety only for the period where the employer is not committing any labor law, any immigration law violation in order to further the labor policy. Why doesn't this fit within the two sentences that I just described?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Because --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And if this doesn't, what would?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, what it doesn't address is the violation of the INA."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm sorry. What the Court said in the sentences I read is, retrospective -- I take it, retrospective sanctions can be assessed by the board. Now, are we -- now, I want to know, if they can't do this, what can they do retrospectively, or is the sentence I just read you by this Court wrong?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I think what the sentence means, at least my reading of it, is that retrospective sanctions may be imposed, but not necessarily, and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Fine."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What other rules are there, is what -- what other retrospective sanctions are there?"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes. Yes, that's correct. Thank you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What else can the board do to punish the employer for the unfair labor practice?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So you really don't have any explanation for that language."
  },

    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "All I would say, Your Honor, is that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Which is, I suppose your explanation is that that's as much dictum as your opponent says Sure- Tan was."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So it's a wash, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, if that's the explanation, I take it that Sure-Tan was dealing with a case where the employer did know in respect to the sanction that the employee, the alien, was illegal, so Sure-Tan did not consider the kind of sanction here at issue, which is a sanction that applies only to the period where the employer did not know that the employee was an illegal, hence the employer was not violating the immigration law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "It still doesn't address, Your Honor, the fact that the illegal presence and the use of fraudulent documents and working without authorization is a violation of the INA."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is it unlawful? That's the question I was going to ask you. Is -- under the immigration laws, is it only the employer who is violating the law when he hires, with knowledge, an illegal alien, or is it also the case that an illegal alien who deceives an employer by providing a false green card and who then draws pay when he's illegally in the country, is that unlawful?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."

    "speech": "-- the use of the green card is, but is the working and getting pay unlawful under the immigration laws?"

    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Yes, it is."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I thought IRCA itself enacted a provision making it illegal for aliens to provide false documentation to get employment. That wasn't in the law when Sure-Tan was decided, was it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Yes, it was, Your Honor. In fact, let me just explain that 18 U.S.C. 1546 was already on the books, that prohibited the use of fraudulent documents for immigration purposes, and when IRCA came along it amended the INA but added 1324(c), which also prohibits the use of fraudulent documents to obtain employment, so at the time that Sure-Tan was decided, you had the following laws in this case that were violated by"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "May I ask if your position would apply if this were a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act instead of the labor act? If the employer had underpaid the employee, would he have a right to back pay?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I -- in the amicus brief of the States they seem to equate back pay under the NLRA with back pay under the FLSA when they're two different things. Back pay --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I understand they're two different -- I just want to know what your position is on that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "No, we would not advocate at all, and we have not, taking wages away from undocumented aliens that have been earned for work already performed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Even though they -- it was a crime to do any work? Why -- if you're sticking with your theory that everything that this person did on that job, from presenting the false documentation on, was unlawful, so why should he be paid anything for unlawful activity? You're making a distinction between the Fair Labor Standards Act and the NLRA, but your theory, I think, would cover both."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, we give certain rights and benefits to undocumented aliens that are already in this country, and we do that to level the playing field between undocumented aliens and American workers so that unscrupulous employers won't prefer undocumented aliens over American workers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, furthermore, just from the standpoint of equity, I suppose the employer has benefitted from the services in the case that Justice Ginsburg puts, and there's --"

    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Absolutely."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- no benefit here save, arguably, from the illegal labor practice, but there's no benefit for work received."

    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Sure."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Do I understand that if the employer and the employee both know of the illegality, that then there's no back pay?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The -- and of course, you don't -- this is the Government's position, you don't have to defend it, but in other words, as I understand the Government's -- once the employer knows that there's a violation and continues it, he's no longer liable for back pay. That's a strange calculus."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, that's the problem with the rule, is that it in some ways rewards the unscrupulous employer in Sure-Tan and penalizes the innocent employer, as in Hoffman. If the unscrupulous employer knowingly hires an illegal alien, then whenever some kind of union organizing drive comes along and say gee, we can get rid of them, and we know they're illegal, and we're going to terminate them, then they can report them to the INS right from the outset --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Suppose the allegation is, they kept me in this entry-level job, although I was qualified for the next step, because I was a woman and they never promote women.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "It would be -- if -- in your situation, you would get back pay, and let me explain the difference in this case. The problem with the board's remedy is that the very nature of the remedy creates a duty to mitigate, which in turn requires and encourages the illegal alien to seek interim employment, thereby committing further and new violations of the immigrations law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So in title VII, if she were laid off, say, because they laid off all the women before they laid off any men, so she would also have a duty to mitigate in those circumstances, would the result be different?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "No. When there's a duty to mitigate which requires them to seek interim employment, that is where the rub is, but under title VII, under, like, the National Labor Relations Act, there's a whole array of other remedies available to enforce compliance. Punitive damages, you can -- compensatory damages, emotional distress, that is not dependent on the victims authorization to work in this country."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Of course, her complaint, if it were complaint, should read something like, you know, I shouldn't have been working at all, and it was illegal for me to be working at all, and I'm complaining because I only got $12,000 in illegal wages. I should have gotten $14,000 in illegal wages. I don't find that a very appealing case anyway. Do you find that an appealing case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, I don't. I don't find that an appealing case."

    "speech": "But you just told me that you would bracket title VII with the FLSA."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Yes, because I -- notwithstanding Justice Scalia's very good example that I don't find that appealing, that there is a way that this Court can distinguish between the National Labor Relations Act, which is remedial in nature, and all these other State and Federal discrimination laws that have punitive features to it that are not dependent on the undocumented alien's ability to work in this country."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I don't have any doubt that there are other ways for us to distinguish this, and it may very well be that if this were an original matter with us we wouldn't have struck the balance where the board did, but you've got the element here, the added element here of the board's decision, and I suppose we owe some kind of respect to it. Given the confusion of statutes, the extent to which we owe deference is not, perhaps, clear, but we've got to give some consideration to it, haven't we?"

    "speaker": "CORTNEY",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't believe so. Under -- we're looking at a remedial statute under 10(c) of the NLRA, and the only deference that the board is entitled to is, if the remedy that they order does not conflict with the immigration laws and policies of this country."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speech": "The board did take that into account, though. I don't remember what they did in this case, but in the case where the board explained that it was, indeed, taking into account the policy of the immigration laws and the policy of the NRA -- what was the name of that case?

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But let's go back to one thing it also said in Sure-Tan, which is that the court of appeals here made an estimate without any evidence as to the period of time these employees might have continued working before apprehension by the INS, and that sounds -- working before apprehension by the INS, that sounds very close to what the board did in this case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, also in Sure- Tan, in the last sentence of the remedial section of the opinion it states, by directing the board to impose a minimum back pay award without regard to the employee's actual economic losses or legal availability to work, the court of appeals plainly exceeded its limited authority under the act. It made it clear that it wasn't just actual losses that was the problem, it was the fact that the discriminatees were not either legally present or legally authorized to work."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So then, what do you make of the condition about the period between the violation and when the employees might have continued working before apprehension by the INS?"

    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't know, because the discriminatees in that case were -- left the country the same day their employment terminated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm not talking about the outcome of that particular case, where they were in Mexico, but a case where they were here, and the question was, how much back pay, and there's a reference to not a flat 6 weeks or 6 months or whatever, but a time period from the unlawful employment practice until one would expect the INS would pick up these people."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CORTNEY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, again I think that is consistent with the other language in the Sure-Tan decision which is repeated over and over again about legal availability to work, and being legally authorized to work, and why would the Court use that language if it didn't have to? So I -- getting back to the policy of this that underlies the immigration laws of this country, it is to preserve jobs for American workers. It is not the act of illegal entry that takes jobs away from American workers.  It's the act of working in this country without authorization that takes jobs away from American workers, and I would submit that the continued presence of an illegal alien in this country poses a greater threat to American jobs than an alien who enters this country repeatedly, because the latter presupposes that the alien has been physically absent from the job market for a period of time. If the -- under the board's scenario, the Sure- Tan discriminatees could have reentered on a tourist visa and be legally present and not legally authorized to work, and under that scenario they're clearly not entitled to back pay because it violates 1182(a)(5), that sets forth the terms and conditions on which aliens can work in this country and those that can't. The same would be true of aliens who enter the country on a student visa, or who overstay their visa and work without authorization, so whether you have an alien that enters this country illegally and works without authorization, or who enters this country legally and works without authorization, both takes jobs away from American workers, and both violate the INA."

There also is the paperwork obligations, the verification systems, and I think there is a very real concern that an employer who knows that there's not really any monetary price to being lax in hiring, in checking whether illegal aliens are hired would say, well, on the one hand I just have the civil violations for violating the paperwork concerns. On the other hand, the labor of undocumented aliens is in a very real sense much --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, here's the thing. When an employer reviews documents and concludes that they're valid and the person is lawfully here, then the employer isn't going to get some advantage of hiring some illegal alien because the worker will have to be paid and given benefits as though the worker were legally here, so there's no incentive for the employer under those circumstances to give a bum deal to the employee."

That is a very large class of people to basically say, you are just without a remedy under the National Labor Relations Act, and there may be implications for other Federal labor laws as well, and --"

The Court pointed this out in Sure-Tan, where it said it is appropriate to include illegal aliens within the definition of employees, because all the workers are in it together."

    "speech": "I would have thought, Mr. Wolfson, that when you said, you know, there are 7 million illegal aliens in this country, that what you would follow that with is not, that's an awful lot of people not to give back pay to. I would have thought you would follow it with, we have to do something to reduce this massive number of 7 million illegal aliens."

On the other hand, Congress without question recognized when it enacted IRCA that this was a many- faceted problem, and one aspect of the problem was that there was a natural magnet in drawing illegal, undocumented workers here in the wage differential, and that employers were willing to give jobs, and that it should not be cheaper for an employer to hire an undocumented alien than it is to hire --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay, but the argument, Mr. Wolfson -- every time -- and I understand that argument. Every time you make that argument, it seems to me the answer comes back, there are other ways to go against the employer. You can fine the employer, you can bring criminal actions against the employer, and so on, so that the answer always is the effort to discourage employers from hiring illegal aliens doesn't depend upon the back pay. I thought the board's position was strongest to counter that when the board says, there's kind of the gray area in which it's not clear that we can prosecute. The evidence of what the employer knew at the relevant time is not leaping out at us, and so what we are trying to do is to fashion a remedy for those cases in which it's not practical to prosecute, but which we know perfectly well in the real world employers are winking at the likelihood that they're employing illegal aliens. That's the group that we want to provide the inducement for by forcing back pay. Is -- am I giving the board too much credit?"

In the question that the Government presented it says, whether an order to pay back pay to an employee who was discriminatorily laid off, but only up to the date on which petitioner discovered that the employee was an undocumented alien, whether that kind of order is lawful. That's how you saw the question presented. Now are you telling me that what I'm supposed to decide is a case I really didn't think I had to decide, which is, what happens if the board awards back pay to others, such as those whom the employer has always known were illegal?"

    "speech": "Well, if it's a narrow question, just what Justice Souter said I had taken to be the precise rationale for the narrow set of cases we're supposed to decide. Now, maybe that's all not so. That, I think, is what he was saying, and I'm seconding it."

  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "Justice Breyer, my point is that the board in a case -- the board did rely on its APRA Fuel decision in this case, but what it held in this case was that an employer, once an employer learns that an alien is undocumented and therefore he cannot be hired, and in addition that the board accepts that that employer would not have hired that alien and would have discharged the alien when it found out that he was undocumented, then the employer should surely get the benefit of the after- acquired evidence rule that is applied in many, many kinds of Federal labor laws, including the Age Discrimination Act, for example."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Once you adopt that rule, however, it seems to me that the asserted benefit to the immigration laws that you're claiming this rule has disappears. It is no disincentive to any employer, because the only employer who would get the benefit of the rule that you don't get any back pay would be the perfectly innocent employer who hires someone not knowing that the person is an unlawful alien. How are you possibly deterring anybody? You're trying to deter the employer who hires an immigrant, apparently with this in the back of his mind: I know this guy's an immigrant and I can commit an unfair labor practice upon him. I'm rather skeptical whether that's high in the mind of any employer, but assuming it is, you still have to assume, if he's going to be deterred, that he knows that the person is an illegal immigrant, but this rule only applies to people who don't know."

    "speaker": "WOLFSON",

Isn't that the answer?"

I think the question is, is this particular order inconsistent with the immigration laws, or is it consistent, and for some of the reasons that are being expressed here, all that we are saying is that it does not -- it is consistent with them. Surely there is no direct conflict with the immigration laws. The board --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What you just agreed to in your colloquy with Justice Souter does contradict the immigration -- I remember when this statute was passed about what the responsibility of the employer was. It was a clear provision of the statute that all the employer has to do is check the papers. It isn't the responsibility of the employer to look behind the papers and see whether it's forged. Now you're saying, ah, but there are some employers that maybe, yeah, you know, they complied with the provision of the law, they looked at the card, which is what the -- there was a big fight over that. How much is -- investigatory responsibility is going to be placed on the employer, and the answer was basically none, just look at the documentation, and now you're saying, but some employers, we think they should have known better, and we're going to impose on this class of employers and, as it turns out, on a lot of others, liability which they shouldn't have."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "They don't have any liability under IRCA. I mean, nobody is suggesting that the board can impose a liability under IRCA, but there is a concern, I think, that if en employer is totally exempted from back pay, a back pay remedy under another Federal labor law, that that does -- that does work an inducement on the part of the employer to hire illegal aliens."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "WOLFSON",
    "speech": "I do want to touch a bit on Sure- Tan, which I haven't had much of a chance to discuss. Our -- we have submitted in our brief that we think that the facts of the Sure -- of the situation in Sure-Tan really make it quite distinguishable from this particular case. In Sure-Tan, first of all I do want to point out that the condition that the Court explained and put on a reinstatement and back pay remedy, those did originate in the Seventh Circuit, and no party to this Court challenged that condition, that reinstatement and back pay had to be conditioned on the employee showing that he was legally authorized to be present and employed in the United States. Now, the Court perceived that what happened in Sure-Tan was essentially the employer was being forced to say to the employee, you have a guaranteed job and a paycheck waiting for you right now, so come back to the United States right now and pick it up. I mean, that obviously is a very powerful lure to an employee to migrate back to the United States if there is no condition that the employee show that he is authorized. We submit that the incentives work quite differently in a case like this where the employee does remain in the United States. Congress did enact IRCA on the assumption that illegal, undocumented alien employees in the United States were at the very bottom of the wage scale, they were likely to remain here as long as they could get any job that was available, and as against that, we submit that the inducement to violate the immigration laws that petitioner suggests by the prospect of waiting around after years of litigation for the prospect of some kind of back pay award at the end of the day is quite minimal, and all the courts that have looked at this under other Federal law such as title VII and the FLSA have agreed that it is not the prospect of a back pay award that induces illegal migration or illegal stay in the United States, it is the prospect of any job at any wage that is available, and so the incentives do operate quite differently here than they did in Sure-Tan."
