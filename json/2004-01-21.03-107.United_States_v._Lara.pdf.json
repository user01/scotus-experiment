The Court recognized, though, that its decision might create a jurisdictional gap on many reservations, but the Court concluded that if the present jurisdictional regime proves insufficient to meet the needs of reservation law enforcement, the proper body to address that concern is Congress, which has plenary power over Indian affairs. Congress responded immediately to this Court's decision. It -- it conducted an extensive inquiry and heard hearings about the consequences of the Court's decision and heard strong expressions of concern by many Indian tribes, by the Federal Government, and by numerous States about the law enforcement vacuum that would be created over many misdemeanor offenses on Indian reservations. And there was widespread support for Congress to restore the power to Indian tribes to exercise their sovereign power to prosecute non-member Indians."

Going back to 1817, the general Indian crimes statute has authorized prosecutions by the Federal Government over crimes committed by non-Indians, including misdemeanor crimes, and so there was not a jurisdictional void. The difficulty came -- the -- the most acute difficulty came from the fact that that statute, again since the earliest times, had -- has exempted crimes committed by one Indian against the person or property of another."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Kneedler, may I raise the -- the point that is -- is the greatest trouble for me so -- so you perhaps could address that? Because it follows from what Justice Kennedy has raised. As I understand what we held -- forget our language about delegation for a minute. As I understand what we held in Oliphant, which we followed in Duro, was that the very concept of -- of this dependent or subordinate sovereignty that tribes are -- are understood to have, the way we look at Indian issues, is inconsistent with the exercise of tribal jurisdiction over a -- a non- member. Whether that notion of subordinate or -- or dependent sovereignty is constitutional or common law doesn't really matter. As long as we're going to have that concept, that concept is inconsistent with the exercise of the tribe's own sovereign jurisdiction over a -- a non-tribal member. If we are going to stick with that concept then, it seems to me that we have got to understand the statute in question here as a statute that confers Federal power on the tribe as distinct from one that restores the tribe's sovereign power because the tribe can't have the sovereign power as long as we are going to understand that tribe to have this subordinate sovereignty. And therefore, for me the concepts that we're using pretty much force the conclusion that the -- that the power that's being exercised is Federal not Indian. Could you comment on -- on that analysis?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "Yes. I -- I think there -- there are several responses to that point. First of all, I think it matters a lot whether one views the limitations on tribal power as mandated by the Constitution or as a product of Federal common law. And in -- and --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, it may have a great deal to do with whether we can change our conceptualization about dependent sovereignty, but as long as we keep that conceptualization, it seems to me we've got to accept the conclusion that -- that I suggested."

    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "No. I -- I -- with respect, I don't think that's correct because I think if it -- if it is not -- if this conception is not constitutionally mandated, then Congress has the authority, the plenary authority, over Indian affairs to regulate, to modify tribal jurisdiction. And -- and in fact, I think that -- that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Okay, but if it does so, we have to accept the -- if we're going to follow that route, we will have to accept the conclusion that the whole concept of dependent sovereignty has -- has been modified in -- in some way because you can't have it both ways."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "No. I -- I believe that's -- that's an expression of the dependency or a manifestation of the dependency, not in derogation of it, because dependent means that your ability to exercise authority -- in this case, the Indian tribe is always subject to the overriding powers of the Federal Government. And what this Court said precisely in the --"
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",

Those treaties and statutes are not themselves embodying constitutionally mandated rules. They are the product of the political branches. They sometimes don't answer precise questions, and this Court is required to articulate judicial principles as best it can against the backdrop of those principles. But because those principles themselves are traced to treaties and statutes, it must be up to -- Congress must have the authority to modify those rules, and that's consistent with its plenary power over Indian affairs. What this Court said in the Montana decision, which -- which has been identified as the path-marking decision over -- concerning jurisdiction over non-tribal members, was what tribes lost by virtue of their dependent status was the power independently to determine their external relations. This is not what we have here --"

This Court held in -- in Oliphant and Duro, by looking at the -- at the backdrop of -- of statutory enactments, that its power had been limited, but -- and the tribe did not unilaterally overcome that. What Congress did was lift the limits so that the tribe -- the tribe would then be authorized to exercise sovereign power that it previously had -- had had. And it's in that -- it's directly analogous to two important examples that I think are very instructive here. One is that Constitution itself in the Commerce Clause has been held to, of its own force, preempt State laws in the interstate commerce and also in the Indian Commerce Clause area. But Congress can, in the exercise of its authority over commerce under either one, lift those restrictions and authorize States to regulate in areas they otherwise could not do."

The other -- the other instructive example is Public Law 280. Since the outset of the Constitution, really by the -- by carrying forward arrangements of -- in Indian law prior to the adoption of the Constitution, States have not been able to exercise jurisdiction over matters involving Indians in Indian country absent an affirmative authorization by Congress.

The whole idea was that you would have the Federal -- the possibility of the Federal prosecution and the tribal prosecution.

There's no delegation language in that. They clearly chose the means to the end of -- of covering the gap, the means of reconferring sovereignty. And if that is invalid, then the statute is invalid.

The reason they can't do that is there's a sovereignty relationship. There's no act of Congress that articulated that sovereignty relationship. It's just the way we understand things. The tribes are dependent sovereigns.

What you would win is a case where there was an appeal from the tribal prosecution, and under those circumstances, they had raised the question just as you phrased it, say it may not violate due process, for the reasons you gave, not to give the tribal member a lawyer, but it does violate due process for Congress to pass a law which subjects me to this criminal trial without a lawyer because I am not a tribal member.

The first point I'd like to make is that this case only involves the question of whether Congress can authorize tribes to exercise jurisdiction over Indians who are members of other tribes or affiliated with other tribes, not non-member Indians.

But -- so what Congress has done here is simply to identify another attribute of membership or affiliation with a tribe, which is that if you're on another tribe's reservation, you will be subject to that tribe's criminal jurisdiction. And that is important to law and order on many reservations, as Congress itself realized when it enacted this statute in 1991."

    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "No. I -- I think -- I think Congress at least under the Necessary and Proper Clause could allow a tribe to maintain jurisdiction over something that happened while the person was tribally affiliated. The -- another fundamental point is the one that Justice Breyer mentioned is that there is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits, the places a limit in this situation on Congress' exercise of its plenary power over Indian affairs. And in fact, there's much in the Constitution that points to the contrary. The Constitution refers to the Indian tribes, and as this Court has said, that reference to tribes and to the treaty-making power recognizes tribes as sovereigns, not simply voluntary organizations, but in the Constitution itself recognizes them as sovereigns. And the Court has said that because of those powers and implicit from that is the power of Congress to exercise protective authority over Indian tribes. And here that protection includes protection of tribal -- tribes from crimes committed by other tribal members. In solving this serious law enforcement problem, Congress was entitled to be guided by the Constitution itself which recognizes the tribes as sovereign and to vest authority in them as sovereign rather than act in derogation of the Constitution by deeming the tribes to be agents of the Federal Government when a tribal prosecutor is bringing a prosecution under tribal law in -- in tribal court. And Congress could rationally reach this conclusion for another important reason, and that is the lesson in history. History is very important in Indian affairs, and Congress throughout history, since 1817 under a jurisdictional regime that remains in effect, has left to tribes the power to exercise jurisdiction over members of other tribes, as this Court said in United States v. Rodgers where it construed the Indian against Indian exception as intended to allow tribe matters not -- and it expressly said, not only with -- with their own tribe but other tribes, to be left to the tribe."
