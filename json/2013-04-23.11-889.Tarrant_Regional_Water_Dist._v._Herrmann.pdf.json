      "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the Red River Compact, Oklahoma agreed that Texas would be allowed to use a specified quantity of water that is located in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is now trying to back out of that bargain. What its argument to this Court in support of its position is essentially that the Court should disregard language that appears in the Red River Compact because that language is superfluous, that the Court should read into the Compact language that does not appear there, and that the Court should not give the text of the Compact what Oklahoma in its brief describes as \"talismanic significance.\" Our very different view is that the plain text of the Compact must control. Now, in the Red River Compact, Texas and Oklahoma, along with Louisiana and Arkansas, agreed to allocate among themselves the waters of the Red River Basin. The Compact divides that basin into large areas called reaches and subdivides the reaches into subbasins. As to some of those areas, the Compact expressly allocates entitlement to water by State line. It says that the States may use the water within their boundaries exclusively. But in the section of the Compact which is at issue here, Reach 2, Subbasin 5, the Compact uses a very different and unique language. That section -- that subbasin includes the territory of all -- three of the four compacting States. The boundaries of that subbasin are drawn not by State lines, but by reference to the -- the last downside dam sites before tributaries to the Red River Basin -- Red River flow into the river itself."

This clause, the one that you rely on, is kind of sketchy, isn't it? Doesn't say how they're going to get it, if they're going to pay for it. There's a lot to be filled in."

It is quite clear that all four of the compacting States are in the language of the Compact, have equal rights to the use of water, defined water in a defined area of the subbasin, so long as no State uses more than 25 percent of the water. That -- that is quite express as to what is required. In -- it's difficult to read that language to mean anything other than that the States can take --"

I mean, I would have thought, if that was their intent, there would be a mechanism for doing it. That you'd have some authority set up by the Compact that would decide where, whether it's really true, and how are we supposed to do it, and there is no such mechanism, rather if there is such a right, which it doesn't say anything about, it's left to the State courts in different States to try to do what is an extremely complex and controversial administrative job."

And then they're going to say, don't you know that, in fact, when you put your pipeline into Oklahoma, you are going to be taking part of the 25 percent that belongs to us. And Texas will say, no, we aren't. And then we'll have to have a way of measuring how much goes into the river at different places and what are all these different pipelines are going to take out.

That's why I think we're here in the Court because all it says is you can't take more than 25 percent. It doesn't say what happens when Texas is unable to get its 25 percent from the south.

They said that States are entitled to use the water within their State boundaries, in the respective States may use the water within their boundaries. They did not -- the framers did not use that language in this provision."

Does that make sense in terms of the language?"

      "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
      "speech": "Well, let me make two points about that. First of all, I think that not only does it make sense in the language, it's compelled by the language because the language says within this subbasin all four States have equal rights. Separately, there is another separate reach. Reach V of the -- the Compact is Louisiana's, and so the water flows into Louisiana. When the water gets to Louisiana, it's no longer within the subbasin, it's somewhere else. So the plain language of the Compact compels the reading -- compels the -- the point that Louisiana could take its water from within the subbasin. Now, could it do that? The subbasin runs through to Arkansas to Louisiana, so it could go to Louisiana --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
      "speech": "Go back to the first one because what you have done is you've pushed me back to the equal rights. And now if I am going to fight you on it, I have to say the equal rights to water means equal rights to water arising within its boundaries. And all you have to say is equal rights to water arising anywhere in the subbasin. And if I just heard that, then I might say okay, I think yours is a little better. But -- but we have this enormous administrative mess that would seem to be created, and both those interpretations seem possible. So let's go back to that and let me hear quite clearly, now that I've focused it, what's the answer?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
      "speech": "If I may just finish with Justice Sotomayor and I will turn to that? I think the second answer to the question is, the States are going to take the water from the closest point where they can get it. And so Louisiana is not going to go to Oklahoma. If it's going to go into Subbasin 5, it's going to go to Arkansas directly across the State line."

So what is going on here, Tarrant, the Texas water district, is applying to the Oklahoma Water Resources Board. It will seek a permit. This will operate precisely in the same way as if an Oklahoma applicant is seeking a permit. You will go to -- you will go and say, I want to take water out of this point.

      "speaker": "ROTHFELD",

How does that fit in with the existing administrative structure?"

    {
      "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
      "speech": "Well, Oklahoma cannot use more than 25 percent of the water within the subbasin. I think that our friends concede that because the language of the Compact says no State is entitled to more than 25 percent. Within each State's 25 percent allocation, a resident water user of the State will apply to the Oklahoma -- if they are seeking to take their water from Oklahoma, it will apply to the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, which will assess that permit precisely as it assesses permits from Oklahoma residents."

One is, if there is enough water to go around for everyone, as in fact there is, then they simply assess it in terms of priority in time. Whoever makes the first application will get it. However, Oklahoma can only get 25 -- use 25 percent of the water. And therefore, Texas has the right, so long as there is water available and Texas has not used its 25 percent of the subbasin water. Texas has the right to seek that anywhere it can get it in the subbasin. If I may, Mr. Chief Justice."

First, the Court of Appeals erred in applying a presumption against preemption to determine whether the challenged Oklahoma laws conflict with the Compact. The rationale for that presumption where it has been applied is one of federalism, but the States themselves created the terms of the interstate Compact, and respect for the States as sovereigns in that context requires enforcement of the Compact according to its terms. Second, the court of appeals relied on general Compact provisions to conclude that the Compact gives States unrestricted authority to regulate the water within their boundaries. But the general provisions of the Compact make clear that a State's regulation of water has to be consistent with the allocations made under the Compact, and each State's obligations under the Compact."

And it seems to me that you may be right that the Compact either says you get the water or you don't, and the dormant Commerce Clause is just irrelevant. But I read the opinion of the court of appeals as being quite consistent with that proposition. You win or you lose, up or down, under the Compact. The dormant Commerce Clause doesn't -- just doesn't have much to do with it."

      "speaker": "CONNELL",

Where we disagree with the Court of Appeals is with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that, regardless of whether a State law would frustrate the purpose or pose an obstacle to a State obtaining its share of water under the Compact, that that State law should prevail under the Compact. So the Compact makes clear that those general provisions preserving State water law need to be consistent with each State's obligations under the Compact. And if I could --"

But I'll tell you where it comes from, which is Sections 2.01 and 2.10(a) of the Compact, which preserve the application of State water law. Section 2.01 says that, \"Each State may freely administer water rights and uses in accordance with the laws of that State, but that such -- such uses shall be subject to the availability of water in accordance with the Compact.\""

But, for example, if Texas could access 25 percent of the water from within its State, then the -- the application of a State law that would bar Texas water users from obtaining a portion of its water in Oklahoma wouldn't necessarily be preempted because it wouldn't pose an obstacle to the allocation."

That -- that -- you know, and it -- it suggests how difficult the process is. And then you look at this provision, and maybe this provision can be read as an entitlement, but it can just as easily, as -- as Justice Breyer suggested, be read as a cap, \"no more than 25 percent.\" So as between those two possible readings, the complexity of your way of reading this, which would have -- why?"

But the interpretive comments that follow Section 5.05(b) -- this is at page 30 of the is Joint Appendix -- refer to a \"right.\" The first full paragraph there says, \"When the flows\" -- I'm sorry, it's the -- the second line. \"If the States have competing uses and the amount of water available in excess of 3,000 cubic feet per second cannot satisfy all such uses, each State will honor the other State's right to 25 percent of the excess flow.\" The Red River Compact Commission also approved rules and regulations, and those say -- they're on page, I think, 19 of the Joint Appendix. I might have that page -- yeah, I have that page wrong. But the -- the Red River Compact Commission's rules and regulations say that when the flow is above 12,000 cubic feet per second, so that Louisiana could get its 3,000 cubic feet per second, \"each of the signatory States shall be entitled to 25 percent of the total runoff in undesignated flow.\" So I think it -- it's pretty clear that based on the -- both the text of the Compact and the interpretive comments in the rules that the Red River Compact Commission came up with, that there is not just that you can take whatever is in your borders even if that doesn't amount to 25 percent, but -- but that each State is entitled to 25 percent of the water, and that if that involves going into another State within this geographic area that's not defined with respect to State boundaries, then that is permissible under the Compact. And as the Petitioner pointed out, when the States wanted to impose a State boundary restriction in the Compact, they did so. There are several subbasins that span more than one geographic -- or more than one State, and the Compact in those provisions says that you can take whatever you want within your boundaries. And I also don't think that this is going to be particularly troublesome to administer. I mean, there may need to be some further proceedings on that, but Oklahoma law provides the backdrop for what would happen when a Texas water user goes in to -- to ask for a permit to appropriate and divert water from within Oklahoma."

    {
      "speaker": "CONNELL",
      "speech": "Well, the Oklahoma Water Resources Board would just apply its normal procedures and laws to determine whether this particular use of water could be put to beneficial use.

And I -- and I -- the Court shouldn't be concerned. I know all -- I know there are amicus briefs submitted by other Texas entities that would like to have water from this particular subbasin as well. They're all part of the same Region C, and they -- I think they have some way to work it out. It's not --"

In fact, the whole subbasin is defined by the last major dam site on the tributaries that are running in. So Oklahoma could do the same thing. And also, when the reservoirs are full, they're full. It's not like Texas could keep all of the water that's -- that's there from flowing into the bottom portion of that tributary."

And all my question, and I think that was being asked, is there anything else you want to say as to why that's an easy matter to decide?"

Those could be developed -- those additional problems could be dealt with by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board or as you said, perhaps in the original action."

So there's a piece of the Red River in this very subbasin that is -- it's in the express Boundary Compact.

The reply brief is not only -- is devoid of a citation, but Nebraska and Wyoming told both us, and Wyoming told Tarrant's counsel, that there have never been diversions. And Nebraska was quite -- like, wow, we hadn't known that. And it shows the danger of their position. They think if it's silent as to borders, the State of Wyoming can go hundreds of miles into Nebraska and take the water across the border. The other example they cite is fascinating because it's a lawsuit before you.

What they would have to do, which no one else -- no one has done -- and I think the drafters thought it was ultimately impossible because of Arkansas and Louisiana, is call for an accounting and actually figure out what the total was, figure out what the excess was, divvy up the 4 shares, do exactly what Tarrant wants I guess to happen, which has never happened, and it's not clear to the drafters of the compliance rules that it could in fact ever happen because of the riparian laws of Arkansas and Louisiana. But -- so in other words, if we lost this case, which is probably why Tarrant is disavowing the United States' view, is Texas would be in quite of a pickle trying to prove they couldn't get their 25 percent. And so I read Tarrant as saying, don't you dare send us back to try to prove that. We want to be able to go whole hog into Oklahoma. And if I could get to the point that Justice Kagan was talking about, what's on the ground happening, and why Oklahoma would have never agreed to this type of cross-border right because what Tarrant is doing is exploiting Oklahoma's law, which proceeds on the assumption that water in Oklahoma is a public trust that's held for the exclusive benefits of Oklahoma. And there are three ways where Oklahoma would not have agreed to this, and it would have been carefully articulated in a Compact. The first is prior appropriation. There are 4 Texas entities that have signed up for permits: The Upper Trinity, the North Texas Municipal Water District, Irving and Tarrant. And poor Oklahoma City got sandwiched in the middle. It beat -- it beat Trinity to the permit office by 24 hours. And so not surprisingly, it's open season for Oklahoma water, all of north Texas has come in and sought a permit and there's priority."

      "speech": "Well, I have two points. First, had -- had Oklahoma seen this coming, since they hadn't heard about this until Tarrant filed its application, Oklahoma City certainly would have gotten in line faster. And second of all, the whole point of this Compact -- and if you think about your equitable apportionment doctrines, which whoever gets to the water first gets a prior -- gets a priority permanently -- this was the point of the Compact. Louisiana and Arkansas wouldn't have to develop their water, Texas and Oklahoma were much more economically developed States, and the equal rights prevented a race to the permit office. Let me get to the second aspect what's a problem, and that is, compacts usually spell out the points of diversion. The last place Oklahoma would have picked as the point of diversion is the Kiamichi River, and Tarrant is saying, not surprisingly, it's the most desirable. And the third is the eminent domain. Eminent domain law in Oklahoma proceeds on the assumption that those are Oklahomans who got the permit, and thus can exercise a core sovereign power, and Tarrant, not surprisingly, would like to come in and do that. And none of this is happening with the normal political checks in Oklahoma. Oklahoma can't vote out of office the Tarrant officials. It cannot vote out of office the Upper Trinity or the North Texas Municipal Water District."

So out-of-State users would have to get the water going faster, it's subject to a review. And there's a statement in there that you need to look and see if there's a better use for Oklahoma. Now, I hope you ask them this because I gather their view is under the dormant Commerce Clause is all of those laws are constitutional with respect to 99 percent of the Compact, which is it's allocated to -- to Oklahoma for its free and unrestricted use. So they're basically saying there's 1 percent of this Compact that's unconstitutional. And not only is it 1 percent, the minute it drops below 3,000, all of a sudden, it became. And on this, we'd like to talk to the Russello principle. I also hope you ask them, this is on page 15A of -- 14A of the 15A brief. There are border references arbitrarily and they're missing, they're there. It's completely inconsistent. And this -- their view would make complete mincemeat out of 4 other provisions of the Compact. And ironically, it would march a lot of States into Texas. But back to (b) -- (b)(2) and 5.05(c) operate identical in that they're basically downstream delivery, where all States have to release 40 percent of the water downstream. So they -- they're the same. They're absolutely identical. You hold on to 60, you let 40 percent go. But only (c) contains that border reference. Only (c) says, \"within their respective States.\" And yet even in (c), it's completely redundant and unnecessary because you can't release water from without your State."

So only (c) says within their respective States, but (b)(2) is the exact same functioning provision, and it's missing the border reference. And I -- you don't have time now to ask the United States' view, but I think the United States would agree with us that if you give this border thing kind of the magical meaning, borders kind of appear and disappear with the water flow, which is very strange. Tarrant thinks that there's some heretofore unheard of crediting system, but they don't have an explanation on how (b)(2) and (c) -- but more importantly, if you could just turn to 9A for just a minute, which is 402, I want to walk you through this -- I'm sorry, 401(b). This is a provision that -- this is water wholly within Texas. And you don't have to understand much to know that Texas keeps 60, Oklahoma gets 40. So you have a big chunk of Texas, and Texas is allocated 60 and Oklahoma is allocated 40. Now, under Tarrant's view, because this is silent as to borders and because Oklahoma is not in this Reach, it's not actually located within the subbasin, Oklahoma either is entitled to or has to go get all of its water from Texas. And this pattern repeats itself -- this is on page 41 of our brief -- throughout the Compact, where the Compact is silent as to borders, and under their view -- and their Louisiana view is somewhat entertaining. I can't tell if they think Louisiana can go into Oklahoma or has to move one inch up to the border to take it out as opposed to just waiting, but under this view -- and again, it repeats itself throughout the contract -- the State that's not in the basin because there are no borders and because, I guess under their view, the only way that Oklahoma to get its water would be to go into Texas, and that's why they're sort of taking this bit about, oh, this Russello principle, if it's here, it must mean -- it must have had significance, would make a complete mess of the Compact. If I could also just turn to the remand of the United States. I just wanted to make -- to make three points. And that is, I do think it is significant that it's pointed -- it is addressed to a problem that Texas itself has never asserted. They're saying well, poor Texas can't get its water. And remember, Texas is upstream, so this sort of poor Texas is only to Texas. No other State is going to have this problem because the rest are downstream. So this you have to be able to get to your 25 percent is a uniquely pro-Texas provision that apparently at the same time for 20 years of drafting history when Texas was trying to buy this water, and the three States were saying, no way, no how, they either subconsciously or unconsciously or unintentionally enacted this provision for Texas's benefit."

      "speaker": "BLATT",

But if their view -- I mean, it is that they have to -- again, our view is that if they had wanted, like all the other cross-border rights, to allow for an extraordinary right, they would have made an explicit statement and then spelled out exactly what that meant, most importantly the point of diversion. Here, at most you have silence on the issue. Now, the government reads into borders sometimes because they say you do have borders unless there is a need. Under Tarrant's view, which I think is the most jarring and remarkable view, this is all a borderless common, and every State could have criss-crossing pipelines into every State because you don't have an exhaustion requirement. So Texas, even though it's got plenty of water in its fresh water streams and currently uses them, could take their whole 25 percent from Oklahoma. Oklahoma could take its whole 25 percent from Texas. Arkansas could come into Oklahoma -- and that's their view of the world. And I think the United States thought, no, that doesn't make too much sense. Let's at least make Texas exhaust. But the provision -- the Compact doesn't say this. Again, the United States and Tarrant proceed on the assumption that there is a numerical share, that it's equal rights to an exact 25 percent, exact 25 percent. Well, that's not what it says. It just says equal rights to the use subject to a cap, and we think a cap by limiting the use is not a guarantee that you can reach the cap, much less that you can cross borders to reach the cap. And if I could just make one more sense --"

      "speech": "So they -- you mean the two compliance rules they cited? They cited -- so they say -- that's what I was saying that was sort of sad is because what they cited disproved what they were trying to assert it for. So if you -- you don't even have to read the -- you don't even have to read the compliance rules. Just read page 19 of their brief. They say in the same sentence that we have an equal -- there's an equal right to one-fourth of an excess above 3,000. So that means you take whatever is above 3,000 and divide by four equally. And then they cite a provision that only divides by 3. And then the next provision they cite didn't divide the excess, it divided the total water. I don't know why they -- it's inexplicable. I can't tell you why they did that. And the only other thing I want to say on the extrinsic evidence, and I do think -- if you think there's any ambiguity in here, which I think there clearly is, you have 30 years of post ratification, which the States immediately did long-term water planning without so mentioning of this right. And Tarrant actually offered to buy the same water for $1.7 billion in 2002, which is a little bit inconsistent with the notion that they had this right all along. They just, in 18 months of negotiating history, never mentioned that they thought they owned the water, they were actually offering to pay 1.7 million. And the amicus brief filed by the Tribes, on page 4, says we were at the negotiating table and we never heard Tarrant mention this right. And the other thing, I do think the water planning documents are highly significant because not so much Louisiana and Arkansas, but Oklahoma and Texas take water planning very seriously because of their prior appropriation systems. There are hundreds of thousands of pages on the Internet and none of them mention this right. Again, they cited something in their reply brief, but if you go look at it, it doesn't come close to mentioning a right of Subbasin 5. Again, ironically it mentioned a portion of Oklahoma where Texas would have to actually buy the water. We'd ask you to affirm. Thank you."

First, my friend, Ms. Blatt, said that it would make mincemeat and a complete mess out of the Compact to apply its terms as they were written. We think that this Compact was negotiated over a period of 25 years. If you look at the Joint Appendix, you will very painfully see that there are reams and reams of commentary on the -- on the negotiations. I think the Court has to assume that when the drafters of the Compact used language and referred to State lines in one place and not in another place, they had some idea of what they were doing and they made these different choices intentionally. So I think the Court simply should read the terms of the Compact --"
    },

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
      "speech": "So how do you deal with all the provisions she was mentioning with respect to the 60/40 division? I can't make rhyme or reason of those provisions that don't use within State boundaries, but it has to mean that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROTHFELD",
      "speech": "Well, I don't think that it has to mean that. If Oklahoma wants to enter Texas to take -- if it makes more sense for them to do it, they can. If not, they can just wait for the water to flow down. I think one thing which -- which Ms. Blatt did not address is the practicalities of how Subbasin 5 operates. If you look at the map that was pointed out to you, Subbasin 5, which is what we're talking about here, is a very wide -- hundreds of miles wide, but extremely narrow. It's 10 to 20 miles wide -- north to south for most of its length. The reason the drafters drew this is because the States all take -- the assumption was all of the water in this Subbasin was going to be surplus water, literally excess water. The States all take the water that they want to use outside of Subbasin 5, and so the -- the allocations that Ms. Blatt was referring to by Oklahoma are all in Subbasin 1, they are not in Subbasin 5. The water that flows into Subbasin 5 is water that the States assumed was going to be surplus. And so it would make no sense, having divided this water evenly between the compacting States, to think that the drafters would have required a water user in Texas at the far west end, which would get its portion of the 25 percent share two miles across the border in Oklahoma, instead to have to go 200 miles to the east to get it out of Texas. That is not what the drafters intended to accomplish by this. They created, by the plain terms of the -- of the language, a common pool of water defined by dam site, not by State line, and gave each State equal rights to access that water so long as they did not use more than 25 percent. Your response to a question which was raised by Justice Kagan both to me and Ms. Blatt, I think the practical application of this is very simple. One simply has to apply to the permitting authorities, wherever you're submitting your application from, they will apply their ordinary standards. The Oklahoma Water Resources Board does that now for applications from within Oklahoma, it can do it just as well for applications from Texas or other from other States. And, again, the practicality of this is, water users are going to want to use water as close to where they are located as they can. They're going to go right across the State line within Subbasin 5 if that's the place to get the water. It makes no sense to require them to go hundreds of miles distant to get it. Ms. Blatt suggested that we are reading the 25 percent limitation out of the Compact. I think her reading reads the equal rights language out of the Compact. They read the Subbasin 5 language as being all capped and no entitlement. It does two things. It gives equal rights to the water, and then says that you can't take more than 25 percent within your State. So it's designed to do two things. It's designed to give you an entitlement and to say you can only use 25 percent of it. And finally, Ms. Blatt raised questions of -- of sovereignty and political concern. As the Chief Justice suggested, this is a Compact that's an agreement between coordinate sovereigns. They have decided what they want to do. And the thing that gives respect to sovereignty is to write -- is to read the plain language of the Compact as the framers wrote it. Again, they spent 25 years writing it. They took considerable care, as you can tell if you look at the negotiating history, in using the words for each provision. Those words should be given meaning. If there are no further questions."
