    "speaker": "PINCUS",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether the dramatically harsher mandatory minimum penalty for what the statute terms cocaine base applies to all offenses involving cocaine or only those involving substances with the characteristics of crack cocaine. In its brief in the Kimbrough case, the government described the provision at issue here as reflecting Congress's determination that, and I'm quoting, \"crimes involving crack should be subject to considerably more severe penalties.\" We agree. statutory provision. First, the only way to give different meaning to two distinct terms that Congress used in the statute -- \"cocaine\" on the one hand and \"cocaine base\" on the other -- is to make clear that cocaine base means something different than all substances with the chemical formula C17H21NO4."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
    "speech": "Mr. Pincus, if -- if I understand your interpretation correctly, it would exclude freebase. How is that a sensible interpretation of the statute, one that would exclude freebase, a commonly known substance? Congress was aware of it. The Richard Pryor incident had occurred. Everybody knew it was dangerous. Wasn't it at least true that Congress meant to incorporate that substance as well?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PINCUS",
    "speech": "Let me answer -- answer your question with a little bit of detail, Justice Kagan, because I think our reply brief wasn't as clear as it might have been, because the word \"freebase\" has, really, three different meanings. It means a hydrochloride, the powder form of cocaine, is mixed with ether and ammonia in a very volatile mixture and boiled. Most -- many users of freebase inhale the fumes that are released during that manufacturing process. That process is very dangerous, as the Richard Pryor incident showed, because the substance is quite volatile and will explode. If that process -- if the substance is not used then, but goes to the very end, when all of the liquids are boiled off, then it does produce a rock-like substance similar to crack cocaine. Our submission is that the -- if the substance is permitted to go to the end, and if, in effect, ether and ammonia are used as a substitute for sodium bicarbonate, then the substance does qualify under the statute, because it is a rock-like substance that has -- is chemically cocaine, and was produced in a method similar to the reacting of sodium bicarbonate with baking soda. But in -- when the process is in the middle of the production process, we don't think Congress meant That's what made the really big difference."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "PINCUS",
    "speech": "Well, I think there would be a factual question in this case. None of the courts below, Justice Ginsburg, determined whether, in fact, this -- the substance at issue in this case was crack cocaine, because the district court ruled that that wasn't necessary, that all chemical -- as long as the substance chemically qualified as cocaine, it satisfied the statutory requirement, and the First Circuit agreed.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "PINCUS",
    "speech": "Well, I think in -- in three ways, Your Honor. First of all, because Congress didn't use the term \"cocaine,\" which is used elsewhere in the provision, it clearly meant a subset. It didn't mean all of the -- all of the substances with the chemical formula that satisfies the chemical term \"cocaine.\" Court said in Kimbrough, that this was a statute that was enacted in response to a particular problem, and I think the question we're debating is: Would Congress have said, when it defined the term -- when it defined the term \"cocaine base\" -- and I should say, \"base\" was one of the street terms, colloquial terms, that was used at the time to -- to describe these categories of substances."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It's kind of an odd way for Congress -- it's an odd way for Congress to phrase the provision if what they want to get at is crack, to say what we want to get at is substance which contained crack. That suggests to me, when you talk about substances that contain something, what they contain is a base that then is used in the substance. I think that's a harder, harder logic to apply when you're talking about crack. They want to stop the use of crack, not so much -- it wouldn't occur naturally that they're talking about substances which contain crack. It would occur naturally, that language formulation, if you think of cocaine base as broader than just crack."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PINCUS",
    "speech": "Respectfully, I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice. The provision just above large Roman numeral IV talks about compounds and mixtures, and Congress is sensitive in crafting the drug laws that often, because these substances are not prepared in a chemistry lab, there are many, many impurities associated with them. For example, even cocaine hydrochloride, cocaine powder, is not pure cocaine hydrochloride. It's often diluted, it's often cut with other impurities. And so in all -- throughout the drug laws Congress has used that and we think that's exactly why it used a similar phrase here, because the crack rock does not contain 100 percent chemical cocaine in a rock-like form. There will be cocaine powder often, cocaine hydrochloride left. There will be baking soda left or the other reactant, and so it will be a mass of substances, and Congress needed that language to avoid defendants saying: This substance is not 100 percent cocaine in a crack form and therefore I don't qualify under (iii) ."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "You kind of elided the point there in your verbal formulation. It's easier to say this is something that's not just cocaine. It's harder to say this is something which is not just crack other things in it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "And you're saying Congress is afraid that the sodium bicarbonate, we might not be able to get at that if we just say crack?"

  {
    "speaker": "PINCUS",

And so I think Congress was getting at the idea that it didn't want people to either avoid the falling within clause (iii) entirely or trying to escape the 50-gram crack threshold by saying there are other things in here that you have to take out before you, before you can impose this penalty on me."

It didn't need to distinguish between the different forms. And that formulation had already existed like that in the Controlled Substances Act. But then in 1986 Congress was hearing testimony about a specific form, the base form of cocaine. Did you, at that point -- would one want Congress to have just said \"cocaine\" in Romanette (iii)? No, Congress said \"cocaine base\" because it wanted to be extra clear. There's another reason -- another -­"

It called it \"cocaine\" throughout its opinion.

So you need to have something that's described in clause (II) and that would contain cocaine base, and that would be the word \"cocaine\" in Roman (II).

  {

    "speech": "And one I -- the point I really wanted to make is that, you know, once the court says it has to be pasty, or it has to be yellow, you know, any of those things can be changed. The one thing that can't be changed is the chemical composition. It's still in the base form; it's still deadly; it still can be smoked. The paste doesn't have to be yellow, just like crack doesn't have to be white or off-white. There was evidence that a few years ago there were folks in Ohio that were coloring crack green for St. Patrick's Day. Any of these things can be changed. It doesn't have to be rock-like. It can be ground up to a powder and it can be smoked that way. This gets back to the point that the Chief Justice made, which is the reference in the provision at issue here to a \"mixture or substance\" containing cocaine base. The thing that Congress looked at was: Do you have a substance which may not be 100 percent pure; it's sold on the street; but does it contain the dangerous chemical? Congress defines throughout the Controlled Substances Act the things that it was concerned about in chemical terms. And that's just not because it was an easy way to define things. It does give greater accuracy and certainty. But it's because the harms that are visited on people, the reason that they are controlled substances, that they don't have approved medical uses, and that they are extremely addictive, is because the chemical is inside of them and the chemical is dangerous. So whether you get the chemical out of paste, whether you get it out of rocks, whether you grind the rocks and make it into a powder, whether you appear in the statute and does not have any clear meaning -- you know, Petitioner says it wasn't clear in 1986, the definition of crack -- I just want to give the Court an example of some of the problems that the -- the issues the courts of appeals have confronted. In several courts of appeals there have been substances which I think perhaps under Justice Breyer's definition would qualify as paste. The courts didn't call them paste, but in the Bryant case in the Fifth Circuit they said there was a brown, soft, mushy wet substance that contained cocaine base was being brought in the United States. The Easter case in the Tenth Circuit: a wet gooey, cream-colored substance. Those courts are ones that use the chemical definition of cocaine base, and they said, look, they contain cocaine base, they have the deadly chemicals, they count."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, my understanding of how coke -- how the paste is produced is the following: You start with the leaves; then people vigorously solid called coca paste; is that -- that's correct?"

  {
    "speaker": "SAHARSKY",
    "speech": "Yes, that's true. But it also can be dried. It can -- can be dried and smoked; it has been dried in South America, so it's not always wet, it's just a question of, you know, whether it has had time to dry or not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Yes. Now, if a chemist analyzed that or then analyzed crack or freebase, wouldn't there be present in the coca paste lots of other substances that would not be present, in quantities? Other substances would be present in quantities in the coca paste that would not be present in the crack or the freebase?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAHARSKY",
    "speech": "Well, they all -- any of those would have impurities that are not cocaine base. All three of them would be identically -- chemically identical if that they would all contain cocaine base; but you're right; the impurities would be different because the method of preparation would be different."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "So a DEA chemist could test"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SAHARSKY",
    "speech": "I think it really depends, Your Honor. I think if it's just a -- a regular DEA chemist, they would be able to tell you what chemicals they can find through standard techniques like infrared spectroscopy, like gas chromatography, and they can say we've identified these chemicals in this substance. Unless it is a chemist -- and we do have some that have additional knowledge of methods of preparation, DEA agents who have that kind of experience, have seen it prepared -- those chemists -- regular chemists would not be testifying about how it was prepared. For example in this case the chemist testified that the -- the sample had cocaine base, it did not have detectable amounts of sodium bicarbonate, and then defense counsel said well is -- is this -- do you think that it's -- or I'm sorry, the chemist, the defense counsel said -- wanted to -- tried to distinguish it from freebase, and said it's freebase crack; and the chemist said you know, I can't answer those questions. I can tell you scientifically what it includes. And that -- that's really the -- the issue of proof, is that you can tell chemically that it has the substance that Congress was trying to get at, the cocaine base. I suppose you can tell what other impurities are there, but you know, Congress doesn't care about the impurities, it cares about the cocaine base; and that's why you know, it says mixture of substance containing cocaine base. You know, one -- one other thing that I just want to make sure is clear to the Court, is that there was ample testimony before Congress at the time that it enacted this provision about the chemistry of this all, that when Congress spoke about cocaine base, it was understanding that base meant chemically the base form, and that again is near the pages I cited to Justice Breyer in our brief. But two different scientists, one was the head of the National Institute for Drug Abuse; the other was the -- was a professor at Yale. Both with experience, and they said things like the form of the drug is the freebase, the usual kind of cocaine is a salt. It is cocaine with hydrochloride, it is a salt like sodium chloride. But this has no chloride attached to it, it is freebase, which is just plain cocaine. So Congress knew the base form of cocaine is when Congress in 1986 was faced with a situation where courts, including this Court, had used the term cocaine to refer imprecisely to the cocaine hydrochloride form and Congress was going to put a mandatory minimum penalty in place, Congress had every incentive to be extra clear, and that's exactly what we think that Congress was doing here."

    "speaker": "SAHARSKY",
    "speech": "Yes, it could be pure. I don't know that we've seen any cases like that, but it is almost always cut with something else. So just to wrap up and be as clear as possible, what Congress had intended to do in the Controlled Substances Act really was to pull out chemicals that -- that have certain pharmacological figure out whether a substance that's wet, off-white, rock-like, paste-like counts as cocaine base. Certainly the Seventh Circuit has had several cases like that. It struggled. If this Court picks just one definition to limit the term \"cocaine base,\" it's really setting up a road to evasion for drug traffickers to change to a different form. We hope that this Court won't do that. We just don't think the text supports it. It says \"cocaine base\" without any limitation. And this -- we just don't think that this -- this Court should be adding a limitation based on what it thinks Congress must have intended but didn't say in the text.

Second point: We would be very happy to accept your definition. Third point, about the statutory language: I think the critical question here, as several members of the Court have noted, is that \"cocaine\" -- not just in Romanette (ii), but throughout the statute -- means all chemical forms of cocaine. If that's what Congress meant in (iii), there was no reason to just -- not to just say it. The words \"cocaine base\" could have a chemical meaning, but the word \"base\" was also in this debate as a word that was being used to describe the specific evil that Congress was aimed at. And so we think, at the worst, there's ambiguity here. And, Justice Scalia, going to your point in your analogy to State law, the problem here is that everything that is in clause 2 is in clause 3 under the government's interpretation, because clause 2, Roman (II), has the word \"cocaine,\" and clause 2, Roman (IV), says any compound mixture or whatever containing cocaine.
