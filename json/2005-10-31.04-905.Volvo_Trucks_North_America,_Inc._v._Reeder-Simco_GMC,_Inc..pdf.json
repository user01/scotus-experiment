In that time, there is no reported instance of a finding of a violation by a seller operating in an industry like this one in which a sale is made to the plaintiff distributor if, and only if, it has already secured a contract for resale to a particular end user. Courts have long understood that mere offers at different prices cannot violate the Act, because it requires two purchases, and that successful purchases in winner-take-all bidding cannot have the requisite effect on competition. To affirm the judgment below would open up new vistas for application of the Robinson-Patman Act where it has never been applied before. This case -­"

We don't have a substantial injury, even if you assume -- even if you read the evidence the way they do with respect to the one head-to-head competition. And it's important to understand that this -- the two-purchaser rule is not the only flaw in the judgment below. The Act requires causation. That is, the price differential must cause the injury to competition. Here, it's not the price differential that causes the injury, in the sense that the Robinson-Patman Act addresses. The Act is addressed to the situation where they're competing head to head, the favored purchaser has a competitive -- a relative competitive advantage which allows them to offer a lower price and, thereby, either get the sale or reduce the profits of the competing purchaser. But that's simply not the case here in these sales-to-sales or offers-to-sales competitions. The fact that some other dealer in some other transaction with some other customer got a better price has absolutely no relevance, no significance, and no effect on Reeder's ability to get a sale or make a profit in its transactions with an unrelated customer. So, there -- the causation element that's so crucial under the Act is absolutely missing here. And, in fact, Reeder's interpretation would simply read the injury requirement out of the statute. They would say, \"Whenever there is a price differential, we've been injured, because if we had gotten the lower price instead of the higher price, we would have made more money.\" So, there's per se injury.

That's what I thought it meant. And it seems to me that was the general understanding in the antitrust bar, that was the general understanding of the courts. And either it's not permissible to give such an interpretation -- I don't know why it wouldn't be; it's literal -- or there's a good policy reason for not doing it in respect to the policy.

It's problems with respect to customers of either of them. And it's quite clear, and it's been clear since 1948 in Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Morton Salt, that this is designed to recognize that when you harm an intrabrand competitor, that that's the kind of injury to competition that this statute was aimed at. And this Court reaffirmed that both in the 1980s, reaffirmed it again in 1990, in Texaco. And it's -- and notwithstanding some effort to ask the Court to revisit Morton Salt at this point, it seems to me that that principle ought to be completely settled at this stage. If there's to be any fix there, it ought to be a fix that's offered up by Congress. To go back to, then, your point, Justice Scalia, I told you, first, you have this discrimination in price, you have to show that it's substantial, lasts for a substantial period of time, you get the Morton Salt inference. You -- then we still have to show, under section 4 of the Clayton Act, that we have actual injury to our business and property. And in this context, it seems to me, the evidence is absolutely overwhelming, because you have a situation where, in 1995, we are next-to-none dealer for Volvo. In 1995, we're selling 66 cars, we're making $165,000. Volvo implements its \"Volvo Vision,\" the purpose of which is to drive my client out of this dealership. It engages in systematic discrimination, both with respect to unquestionable purchases on both sides and, candidly, more broadly than that. And the effect of that, at the end of the day, is that our sales go from 65 to 34 to 18 to 8. Our gross profits dropped to $26,327. You compare that to the kind of evidence this Court looked at in the -- in the J. Truett Payne case, where it wasn't clear that there was really any discrimination involved there, there was no drop in the market, there was no evidence of any diversion of any sales. And, even in that context, this Court was unwilling to say that the Fifth Circuit's decision holding that the evidence was flat-out inconsistent -- or inadequate to sustain the verdict, was overturned, had to be sent back.

    {
      "speaker": "ENGLERT",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The heart of the theory of this case came up in colloquy between the Chief Justice and Mr. Phillips. The Chief Justice pointed out that Reeder doesn't lose a sale because of the concession that Volvo gives to the other dealer, which makes this quite different from every other Robinson-Patman case. Mr. Phillips' response was, \"That's today, Your Honor. But our future ability to compete is impaired.\" Well, that's very similar to the evidence this Court referred to as \"weak\" in J. Truett Payne. The Court didn't go all the way and say that that wasn't enough to give rise to damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act, but the -- but all nine Justices agreed that such evidence was very weak. The Fifth Circuit, on remand, threw out the jury verdict, a case that arose in the same posture as this case. And there is not -- as we said in the reply brief, Reeder is complaining about price, not price discrimination. Now, let me say a word or two about the record. Mr. Phillips says the \"Volvo Vision\" was to get rid of dealers, and to do so through price discrimination. That is a leap of faith that Reeder asked the jury to make at trial, but there is not an iota of evidence connecting Volvo's interest in making its dealer network smaller and more efficient to price discrimination. That's entirely a leap of faith. Mr. Phillips says an inference should be made. That's not the kind of inference we usually allow juries to draw in antitrust cases without some evidence. The evidence was actually that Reeder's biggest customer, New Hi-Way, which was 82 percent of its business, was bought by a Memphis company. So, just to point to Reeder's before-and-after sales is really terribly misleading, in terms of causation here between so-called discrimination and the decline in Reeder's business. The so-called 102 sales are four transactions. There's one 77-truck transaction to New Hi-Way before it was bought by the Memphis company, and 25 other trucks in the other three transactions. They are all cases in which all Reeder did was take its own completed sales and compare them to sales by some other dealer in some other State. Reeder wasn't competing for the sale to that dealer's customer. That customer wasn't competing for the sale to Reeder's customer. So it is, as Justice Ginsburg's questions pointed out, completely a mix-and-match approach. And Bill Heck conceded that there were times when Reeder got better concessions than other dealers. If you have a company that doesn't engage in uniform pricing, as Volvo does not, it's not going to be hard for any plaintiff, whether it's Reeder or Reeder's competitor, to come up with instances in which it was the so-called disfavored dealer if it is admissible to compare transactions to completely unrelated transactions, which is what the proof at trial in this case was. Thank you."
