The Canal is an irrigation facility and it passes irrigation water to the farmers of Madera County. We were told by the Ninth Circuit panel below that all of the water in this canal constitutes flood water under the immunity provisions of the Flood Control Act of 1928 solely by virtue of the fact that this canal is part of the Central Valley project, a large Federal water project covering one-third of the State of California, with multiple component parts and with multiple originating purposes, only one of which was flood control. The Ninth Circuit made this ruling noting that this canal was not a flood control project by itself, and served no flood control purpose. The Ninth Circuit further indicated --"

Under those circumstances, I think the water, which is what the statute speaks to, is not flood water."

I mean, if water is -- someone is drowned in a boat accident as a result of flood waters being released out of a dam, you have a single incident that occurs right then. I take it your claim is based on leaching out, or some sort of damage to the soil over a period of years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It seems to me that makes your case a little harder, because it's project-related. This is not like the case where the Corps of Engineers boat was being driven by a drunk driver, which doesn't seem to have much to do with floods at all. But here, it has to do with the way the whole facility was constructed, and that seems to me to be a harder case for you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It's a long-term damage. The damage occurs over a period of time because of the way that the canal was constructed, or misconstructed, and that seems to me to be more closely related to the purpose of immunity, which is to protect the Government when it erects this facility, than in some of these cases where you have -- where people are sucked down into tunnels and so forth during irrigation season."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "I don't think that that's what we're saying. What we're saying is, is that the facility -- one of our claims is that they're just not maintaining it. The concrete cracks, they patch some of it, they don't patch the others, and some of it is deteriorating, and it needs to be repaired."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But you could say the same thing if it were the dam."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "We could, except the dam would be passing water right into the floodway itself. This, it passes on to other people's property. The dam got flowage rights. When Friant was built they obtained flowage rights to pass water in cetain ways and the fact that the dam is either leaking or has its gates open isn't going to give rise to a claim."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "This whole scenario, in effect, was quite beyond the contemplation of Congress in 1928. When it's talking about flooding on the Mississippi. There are no dams on the Mississippi River, needless to say."

    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "I understand, Your Honor, and that's very true. This -- the clear context, and I think this Court in James said that, that the context was a floodworks project like the Mississippi River, and we're not dealing with a floodworks project like the Mississippi River. We're dealing --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "You say, if I understand your case, you wouldn't take a position that flood waters are never -- you're not going to try to prove that flood waters were never released through this canal, but you would say categorically that the canal itself, when constructed, had no flood control purpose."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "I think that's absolutely true, because if this was -- if this canal was going to be constructed for flood control they would have never built it. They'd have never built that dam. They'd have built it much lower -- there's only a fraction of the space of this whole facility that serves any flood purposes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, would you concede that the Friant dam has a substantial flood control purpose?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "It definitely provides some flood relief. I don't know that I would say it provides a substantial flood purpose, because if they open the gates to channel capacity it would not impound a drop of water for 3 years at a time, maybe 1 year it would impound water for a limited period of time and they'd never reach 25 percent or 20 percent of this capacity --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But it's part of an entire project. The Sacramento River waters couldn't go to the San Joaquin if the Friant didn't back -- didn't stop the natural tributary."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "Yes they do route the Sacramento River water down into the San Joaquin Valley and they do route the water of the river --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And they can only do that because of the Friant Dam."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "But you don't impound water like this for flood control. If you're going to impound water in the way they impound it -- I mean, the United States said in their brief at page 3, you impound water as soon as posisble for irrigation, and you hold it as long as you can until you need it, and that's what they do with this facility, and they said you impound water only at the last moment for flood control when you have to and you evacuate it as quickly as possible. This facility just isn't operated that way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, suppose it is, in the sense that when the people were thinking of building this, they thought, we'll use it mostly for irrigation, but you know the San Joaquin floods sometimes too and then what we'll do is we'll have the water held behind the dam. It normally will go into the San Joaquin River, sometimes there's too much of it, sometimes we'll divert it up through the canal, it'll run into the Chowchilla River or the Fresno River. So they're thinking both. They agree most of the time, irrigation, some of the time, for just overflow of flood water. And who wins? And moreover, there's a crack in the canal, so that means most of the time the water that's running out is water that would be there for irrigation, and some of the time the water that runs out through the crack is water that would be -- would have been released because there was too much water behind the dam and the San Joaquin River was filled up. Right, now, who wins under those circumstances?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "The first presumption -- the reason the dam is because of the irrigation retention, but assuming I understand the hypothetical, and I think I do, the water that would go into the canal under those circumstances may very well be flood water, and it may very well carry the immunity, but it would be in a very limited circumstance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "All right, so you want to divide it say proportionate 90-10. But another to do it is to say that so long as the water that's sometimes in that canal and running out through the crack that was too big is flood water, so long as that's so, as long as that's a substantial amount of the water that's causing the damage, i.e. as long as a substantial amount is water that would have otherwise gone into the San Joaquin River but did not because there is too much water behind the dam and the river was filled up, as long as that's substantial, the Government's entirely immune."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "Is that -- I mean, it sounds like that's a causal --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "That's the opposite theory one way, it's very simple case that way. You know, there's no doubt that there's substantial -- that this is, I'd say, substantially related to flood control, though mostly related to irrigation, the canal, then there's no doubt that some of the time the river, the water that goes through that canal is water that would otherwise be dumped into the San Joaquin, that it was all filled up, but that's a fairly small but still substantial amount of time. And there's no doubt that that water causes some of the damage, but surely not even half. All right. So then I think it comles down to, do we do it on a proportional basis, or do you do it on a, well, if it's substantially mixed in, you lose?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "I think our position --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "How do you analyze it, really?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "Well, it seems to me there's a couple of different issues, and if I understood the question properly you're saying if you have a certain percentage of the water going down the canal is flood water, and a certain percentage of the water going down the canal, a larger percentage, is irrigation water, is not immune, then wouldn't you simply look at the damages and deal with that as a matter of causation, because some of that water was not subject to the immunity. It clearly wasn't, and if that wasn't enough to damage the trees, if the amount of water that went in the canal was not enough to damage the trees, that was not immune."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I gather it's already a stretch to say, as James said, that water which is held behind a dam that is not really flood water, it's water that's been accumulating over the summer, but if the dam is for flood- control purposes we're going to consider all that water flood water. That's a very unusual use of the term, flood waters. I mean, you think about the raging Mississippi. Those are flood waters. Then what the Government wants is yet another extension, and what Justice Breyer was proposing, and that is that any facility that is even used in part for flood control purposes, all the water passing through that facility, including the nonflood water part, becomes flood waters. That stretches it pretty thin, pretty thin."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "Then that's what we think happened here."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "Well, yeah. What the Ninth Circuit said is that this immunity, the way they're construing it is so broad that they could not think of a single instance where the immunity did not apply in the Central Valley --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It almost reads as though the Ninth Circuit said that but didn't want to say it, that it was very troubled by it's own holding."
    },

      "speaker": "JONES",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I think what Justice Breyer's question suggests is that if we were trying to determine causation in order to impose liability, to impose liability, if there are multiple causes, multiple actors, if there's a substantial cause then the actor is joint and severally liable for 100 percent of the damage. The mirror image of that might be that you have 100 percent immunity if a substantial purpose of the facility is irrigation, and I guess the problem with that from your standpoint is that we're just stacking the deck."

      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "We're saying, well, you also have a substantial cause, which is irrigation, and you're not immune for that, which leaves us, I guess, right back where we started. I guess standard tort principles don't seem to help us much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, are you -- I take it that all you really want us to do here is to say that the Ninth Circuit test, not-wholly-unrelated test, either is a matter of substance or is a matter of creating a presumption in applying the James test, went beyond James, and that we ought to reverse or vacate because that erroneous standard was applied, and I take it that you don't really need to have us or want us necessarily to do anything more at this stage except send it back and say, apply James the way we wrote James, and then if you don't like it later, maybe there'll be another appeal, but am I right that that's all you really want us to do, is to say that not-wholly- unrelated goes beyond James?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",

I thought you were asking us to substitute another test which you had identified as a primary purpose test. Justice Breyer introduced yet another test, which sounded to me like you figured out how much of the flow was for irrigation, how much for flood control, and then you do kind of an apportionment that wouldn't be an all-or-nothing immunity. I thought that's what he was saying. But you're saying, if the primary purpose is irrigation, then there's no immunity, even if a substantial purpose would be flood control."

      "speaker": "JONES",

It does seem to me that the -- that your primary purpose does not give the Government quite enough protection, because a major purpose, part of the major design of this entire system is for flood control purposes. On the other hand, I'm not quite sure how to answer your argument that that protects the Government in every single instance. Is a substantial -- if we said the -- if flood control is a substantial reason for the facility and for the operation that caused the damage, could you go back for trial on that?"

We think that's wholly different than what we're dealing with here, where it's just a continuous leak out of a nonmaintained facility, and if the water was not flood water going into the canal, it can't be flood water leaking out."

It seems to me that the whole design of the Central Valley project is that it's an integrated whole, and I don't know how we could take different pieces, the Madera Canal, the Friant Current Canal, which I take it takes a much larger volume of water, and even the Friant Dam itself and say, well, this is primarily irrigation. I just don't think you can do that with the Central Valley project."

The Madera Canal itself was funded as an irrigation project. It can relieve the lake of pressure, so to speak, into another natural waterway that itself is out of the same watershed, so when you look at the totality of it, it doesn't make sense for them to operate this for a flood facility. They wouldn't put water into the Madera Canal necessarily just to run it to another river that itself would be flooding."

I'm just not sure what test we'd use in order to separate out discrete parts of the Central Valley project and say some are irrigation, some are not. Much of the time, all the project is used for irrigation. There's no flood danger."

It has to empty itself, or it has to be emptied, and then it will refill three-and-a- half times during the course of the year. If that water is not released there will be a flood.

The specific discharge that was at issue in that case was deemed to be for flood control reasons. But here, the same principle applies because the water is released into the irrigation canals for a flood control purpose."

Then I think you have to get to water, and the water, as you pointed out, is it's contained or carried through a flood control project for purposes of or related to flood control. All right. Suppose I were to say, what that means is that the water is where it is for a purpose substantially related to flood control. Now, if that's so, except for a tiny little bit, this is not flood control water."

In August, that water would normally be released into the San Joaquin bed, and now it isn't released to the San Joaquin bed, why, for irrigation purposes, 100 percent. That's the answer to that question, nothing to do with flood control."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "Justice Breyer, if I could answer your question in two ways. The first is, if this complaint alleged a discrete release of water, there might be an argument that the Government was not entitled to immunity under your theory because the discrete purpose of the release could be identified. But this complaint asserts that this canal has leaked, and on page 54 of the joint appendix they say, we don't know when the leaking started, so you have to look at the overall purposes of the project, and you have to look at the reasons why water gets released from Friant Dam."
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Okay, let's accept that. That's why I think you have to get to the third part of this, which is the causation part, if we're going to say anything useful, and on that I thought you'd say, look across the year about 98 percent of the time it is diverted from the San Joaquin bed just for irrigation purposes. Some percent of the time -- I'll give you as much as you want, but it's not going to be more than 50 -- it's diverted for, let's say, flood control purposes, and now we have to say that the causation problem is solved by saying, you know, one, this water wouldn't have been substituted by some other water, and the second thing is, you have to apportion the damages, I think. Now, I'm putting that whole thing out to get your comment."

My comment is that if you're looking at why Congress would have put billions of dollars into these water projects, it did so with the assumption that the immunity would apply, and that is a very important principle here, because when establishing sovereign immunity principles you don't allow the Government to be engaged in fact-finding. They've asked for every single document relating to this project since the 1930's as part of their discovery effort."

Now, when we look at those days, we get maybe -- I don't know how many days per year, but not all that many, and maybe one every 3 years or something, but let's say it's 100 days a year. It's not more than that, which it isn't anywhere near that, but still, let's assume that. Very well. On those 100 days, those releases put water in the canal where it is at that time because it is flood water, but on all the other days the water in that canal is not where it is, because of any flood control purpose, so we're talking about the water on all those other days."

You would be asking us to sit essentially as the court of first view on this theory and to look at things that were never presented below, and that is an extraordinary thing to ask this Court to do."

      "speech": "No, Justice Stevens. What we want you to know is that the contract provides for flood water to be put into the Madera Canal, and therefore it serves a flood control purpose. That's all you really need to understand about the contract, because it is a matter that they've stipulated to, this is how the water gets into the canal, and the parties have agreed that flood water will be put into the canal as a matter of agreement. So when you look, Justice Ginsburg, at the sources that we have relied upon to defend the judgment and the rationale of the court of appeals, there is not anything that would be developed by going back. All that would be accomplished is that the Government would be forced to defend, you know, document requests that called for every scrap of paper in the Central Valley project and in the Madera Canal over the last 65 years, and the question of sovereign immunity would not be one that could be established at the pleadings stage. It would, in fact, be subject to proof at every step of the way, and this Court has made clear that not only is sovereign immunity a principle of jurisdiction, but it -- to prevent against the Government being liable, but it's also a principle to avoid the Government having to defend against vexatious litigation."

If I could take you to our reply brief, because we did address, although we objected to the judicial notice of all the facts we did address them there, and we noted that in a majority of the years in the 1979 to 1999 period selected by respondent, flows from the dam into the river bed never approached 8,000 cubic feet per second, which petitioner gauged by setting thresholds of 7600 cubic feet per second on a single day of the entire year and so, as far as petitioner could determine on those days that flows into the river bed did approach 8,000 cubic feet per second they showed no correlation with the higher flows in the Madera Canal. Point 2. This project was funded as a reclamation project. The canal was identified as an irrigation canal. This is not a project where Congress put money out and exposed its treasury to something it wasn't going to be reimbursed for. This is not the context of the Mississippi River flood project. And I would like to answer any questions, if there are any others."
