    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "That issue was not briefed at the Ninth Circuit level, Your Honor, but the canal itself was authorized under the reclamation laws and 100 percent of its costs were reimbursed to the United States under those rules.  The canal itself is not part of the flood routing system of Millerton Lake."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, can't it be, though -- I mean, the Government points out in the brief that there are limitations in a flood situation on the amount of water that can be discharged downstream, and in order to comply with those limitations they might have to use this canal to run off surplus water, so the United States is saying"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And you would say that if the escaping water resulted from that particular kind of flood control use there would be immunity.  If the escaping water was not so related there would be no immunity, and you'd in effect have to apportion the damage -- well, not apportion the damages.  You'd have to do a causation analysis."

  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "Flood waters consist of, and I think this Court's statement in United States v. James at page 605 is relatively clear.  It requires a Federal flood enough -- it's remotely related to flood control in that should there be a flood they can release some of the excess flood waters through this canal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "That might make the canal remotely related to flood control, but it doesn't make the waters that are passing through the canal -- under circumstances in the middle of summer, it's 100 degress out, the river is dry down below the dam 20 miles, and they're diverting the water into the canal under contractual obligations, where it's bought and paid for.  Under those circumstances, I think the water, which is what the statute speaks to, is not flood water."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It seems to me that makes your case a little harder, because it's project-related.  This is not like the case where the Corps of Engineers boat was being driven by a drunk driver, which doesn't seem to have much to do with floods at all. But here, it has to do with the way the whole facility was constructed, and that seems to me to be a harder case for you."

    "speech": "I'm not sure I understand the part about the way the facility was constructed.  Are you"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "I don't think that that's what we're saying.  What we're saying is, is that the facility -- one of our claims is that they're just not maintaining it. The concrete cracks, they patch some of it, they don't patch the others, and some of it is deteriorating, and it needs to be repaired."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you could say the same thing if it were the dam."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "We could, except the dam would be passing water right into the floodway itself.  This, it passes on to other people's property.  The dam got flowage rights.  When Friant was built they obtained flowage rights to pass water in cetain ways and  the fact that the dam is either leaking or has its gates open isn't going to give rise to a claim."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You say, if I understand your case, you wouldn't take a position that flood waters are never -- you're not going to try to prove that flood waters were never released through this canal, but you would say categorically that the canal itself, when constructed, had no flood control purpose."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "I think that's absolutely true, because if this was -- if this canal was going to be constructed for flood control they would have never built it.  They'd have never built that dam.  They'd have built it much lower -- there's only a fraction of the space of this whole facility that serves any flood purposes."
  },

    "speech": "Well, would you concede that the Friant dam has a substantial flood control purpose?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And they can only do that because of the Friant Dam."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "But you don't impound water like this for flood control.  If you're going to impound water in the way they impound it -- I mean, the United States said in their brief at page 3, you impound water as soon as posisble for irrigation, and you hold it as long as you can until you need it, and that's what they do with this facility, and they said you impound water only at the last moment for flood control when you have to and you evacuate it as quickly as possible.  This facility just isn't operated that way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, suppose it is, in the sense overflow of flood water.  And who wins?  And moreover, there's a crack in the canal, so that means most of the time the water that's running out is water that would be there for irrigation, and some of the time the water that runs out through the crack is water that would be -- would have been released because there was too much water behind the dam and the San Joaquin River was filled up.  Right, now, who wins under those circumstances?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "The first presumption -- the reason the dam is because of the irrigation retention, but assuming I understand the hypothetical, and I think I do, the water that would go into the canal under those circumstances may very well be flood water, and it may very well carry the immunity, but it would be in a very limited circumstance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right, so you want to divide it Government's entirely immune."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "Is that -- I mean, it sounds like that's a causal --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's the opposite theory one way, it's very simple case that way. You know, there's no doubt that there's substantial -- that this is, I'd say, substantially related to flood control, though mostly related to irrigation, the canal, then there's no doubt that some of the time the river, the water that goes through that canal is water that would otherwise be dumped into the San Joaquin, that it was all filled up, but that's a fairly small but still substantial amount of time. And there's no doubt that that water causes some of the damage, but surely not even half.  All right.  So then I think it comles down to, do we do it on a the canal, a larger percentage, is irrigation water, is not immune, then wouldn't you simply look at the damages and deal with that as a matter of causation, because some of that water was not subject to the immunity.  It clearly wasn't, and if that wasn't enough to damage the trees, if the amount of water that went in the canal was not enough to damage the trees, that was not immune."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I gather it's already a stretch to say, as James said, that water which is held behind a dam that is not really flood water, it's water that's been accumulating over the summer, but if the dam is for flood- control purposes we're going to consider all that water flood water. That's a very unusual use of the term, flood waters.  I mean, you think about the raging Mississippi. Those are flood waters. effect."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JONES",
    "speech": "Well, yeah.  What the Ninth Circuit said is that this immunity, the way they're construing it is so broad that they could not think of a single instance where the immunity did not apply in the Central Valley --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It almost reads as though the Ninth Circuit said that but didn't want to say it, that it was very troubled by it's own holding."

    "speech": "I think what Justice Breyer's question suggests is that if we were trying to determine causation in order to impose liability, to impose liability, if there are multiple causes, multiple actors, if there's a substantial cause then the actor is joint and where we started.  I guess standard tort principles don't seem to help us much."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, are you -- I take it that all you really want us to do here is to say that the Ninth Circuit test, not-wholly-unrelated test, either is a matter of substance or is a matter of creating a presumption in applying the James test, went beyond James, and that we ought to reverse or vacate because that erroneous standard was applied, and I take it that you don't really need to have us or want us necessarily to do anything more at this stage except send it back and say, apply James the way we wrote James, and then if you don't like it later, maybe there'll be another appeal, but am I right that that's all you really want us to do, is to say that not-wholly- unrelated goes beyond James?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

I thought you were asking us to substitute another test which you had identified as a primary purpose test. Justice Breyer introduced yet another test, which sounded to me like you figured out how much of the flow was for irrigation, how much for flood control, and not-wholly-unrelated means something more than remotely incidental, but we offered -- in the case the Court decided to try to use this case as a test, we offered a test.  We put together what we thought made sense in light of the Flood Control Act and the Federal Tort Claims Act and tried to determine how it would be applied in a multipurpose facility."

    "speech": "Well, James, as the Chief Justice indicated, didn't apply to a system where we had irrigation facilities. It does seem to me that the -- that your primary purpose does not give the Government quite enough protection, because a major purpose, part of the major design of this entire system is for flood control purposes. On the other hand, I'm not quite sure how to substantial-to-the-injury and say, if flood water was a substantial contributing cause to the injury you have no claim at all, as opposed to saying, if it's a substantial part of the facility, flood control is a substantial part of the facility and, in order for the flood water to be flood water, it has to have a substantial relationship to flood control, then that's fine.

It seems to me that the whole design of the Central Valley project is that it's an integrated whole, and I don't know how we could take different pieces, the Madera Canal, the Friant Current Canal, which I take it takes a much larger volume of water, and even the Friant Dam itself and say, well, this is primarily irrigation.

  {
    "speaker": "FREDERICK",
    "speech": "Okay.  Let me see if I can help, then. In James what the Court said was that flood waters within the meaning of the immunity statute is all waters carried in or contained through a flood control project for purposes of or related to flood control. half times during the course of the year.  If that water is not released there will be a flood.  If it's not controlled, there will be a flood along the San Joaquin River."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but blessedly there are farmers who want to use it, so of course it's released.  It could be used five times over if there were enough water.  The farmers are there, dying for water."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FREDERICK",
    "speech": "And the fact that there is a multiple benefit, and the hydropower is another benefit, does not mean that the water loses its character as flood water if it is stored to protect against a flood along the river, and what -- in James this Court considered the question of flood waters that were being used for recreational purposes.  The specific discharge that was at issue in that case was deemed to be for flood control through a flood control project for purposes of or related to flood control. All right.  Suppose I were to say, what that means is that the water is where it is for a purpose substantially related to flood control. Now, if that's so, except for a tiny little bit, this is not flood control water."

In August, that water would normally be the release could be identified. But this complaint asserts that this canal has leaked, and on page 54 of the joint appendix they say, we don't know when the leaking started, so you have to look at the overall purposes of the project, and you have to look at the reasons why water gets released from Friant Dam."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay, let's accept that.  That's why I think you have to get to the third part of this, which is the causation part, if we're going to say anything useful, and on that I thought you'd say, look across the year about 98 percent of the time it is diverted from the San Joaquin bed just for irrigation purposes. Some percent of the time -- I'll give you as much as you want, but it's not going to be more than 50 -- it's diverted for, let's say, flood control purposes, and"

    "speech": "Okay.  My comment is that if you're looking at why Congress would have put billions of dollars into these water projects, it did so with the assumption that the immunity would apply, and that is a very important principle here, because when establishing sovereign immunity principles you don't allow the Government to be engaged in fact-finding.  They've asked for every single document relating to this project since the 1930's as part of their discovery effort."

If the discrete situation applies in the accident, why shouldn't the discrete situation, in effect, rule apply here if they can show by the records kept by the dam that except in, let's say, five instances in which the canal was used for overflow for flood control purposes, all the other water that was diverted into that canal was for nonflood-control purposes and therefore you would get your immunity on some become a plenary theory in which there will never be liability, isn't that what we're going to have to do?"

That's just a stretch of the English language, and to carry it further, as you now want us to do, that even canals leading off of the main flood control project which are sometimes used for the release of flood waters, it's so breathlessly beyond what Congress has said in the statute."

    "speaker": "FREDERICK",
    "speech": "We can because in -- the way the project was designed, in 1944 the Corps of Engineers reported back to Congress and it said that if more than 7,000 cubic feet per second of water is released into the San Joaquin River there will be a flood at Skagg's Branch, and it also said the flood capacity of the dam is 12,000 cubic feet per second, and if you add 1,000 for the Madera many, and maybe one every 3 years or something, but let's say it's 100 days a year.  It's not more than that, which it isn't anywhere near that, but still, let's assume that. Very well.  On those 100 days, those releases put water in the canal where it is at that time because it is flood water, but on all the other days the water in that canal is not where it is, because of any flood control purpose, so we're talking about the water on all those other days."

The other 10 months, the water, on your theory, is not where it is in the canal because of flood control, and so I think what Justice Souter was driving at, and what I was, if all the water in the canal is causing that damage, what reason would there be for calling the water in those other 10 months flood water and subjecting it to immunity?"

It would, in fact, be subject to proof at every step of the way, and this Court has made clear that not only is sovereign immunity a principle of jurisdiction, but it  -- to prevent against the Government being liable, but it's also a principle to avoid the Government having to defend against vexatious litigation."

Point 2.  This project was funded as a reclamation project.  The canal was identified as an irrigation canal.
