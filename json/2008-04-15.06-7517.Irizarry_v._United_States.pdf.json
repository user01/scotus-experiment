The first step of the sentencing process described by the Court in Rita, as noticed, broke down in this case. The Petitioner first learned that the district court contemplated a non-Guideline sentence when it was pronounced. The grounds for that statutory maximum sentence were not noticed and the issues were, therefore, not litigated. The government here agrees that the lack of notice was error and advocates notices for all sentences outside the Guidelines. This is the correct result. Because it's only through notice can the sentencing court subject a defendant's sentence to the thorough adversarial testing contemplated by Federal sentencing procedure. That quote comes from Rita and relies upon rules 32(f), (h), (i), and a decision of this Court in United States versus Burns. That law controls the decision in this case.

And you had some -- the court could look at those and say, gee, am I going to pick one of these, if so I'll let him know. But you can depart now simply on the ground that you don't agree with the -- with what the Guidelines say as -- is that what you would call a ground of departure? It's simply a ground of disagreement, I would suppose. Why shouldn't we hold 32(h) simply. Simply has no -- no application under the new system? Or at least hold that all it applies to are departures within the meaning of the old mandatory guidelines system? Which is a much narrower category of departures."

But in the few cases where -- where an extraneous sentencing consideration that's important enough to drive the sentence up or down is raised, in order to have adversarial testing of that important issue, there has to be some kind of notice. And it's not -- variance is not what we're calling a variance, a non-Guidelines sentence is not a pure exercise in policy even in Kimbrough. That was a policy disagreement but it was driven by facts, and the defendant in that case, the appellant, gave notice that they were going to be challenging it, and -- and there was a factual presentation.

And now that we've returned to a system that is closer to that, why should we interpret 32(h) as imposing a very difficult to comply with requirement that didn't exist under the -- under the pre-pre-Booker system?"

That was the key. To say if there is nothing other than maximum incapacitation which will prevent him from being a danger in the future, if that was the issue, if the question is: Is there any lesser sentence than maximum extra incapacitation, then everyone could have litigated, that would have been the issue that was on the table."

I have seen this person, he appeared before me. It is my educated prediction that he will do it again. So I'm going to put him away for as long as I can.

If that was the -- now isn't the written, formal, this is during the context of the sentencing - - the way it comes out, then the response would be something like, \"Judge, there's -- there is psychiatric evidence or psychological evidence that's developed that I'd like to put on bearing on that issue in light of the report from Buttner, the new report that just came into the record right before the sentencing, that goes directly to the issue of amenability to treatment; and you're concerned that only maximum incapacitation will address the issue.

And the bar is actually getting better at that than when this occurred in picking up on 3553(a) factors, and I think the problem is actually going to become lesser over time. So only in the extraordinary cases -- and Burns was an extraordinary case -- where an issue that is important to the judge isn't flagged in the papers - - does the duty arise to let -- let the parties know what considerations they should focus their attention on, so that they can be litigated."

The -- the interests of the defendant in - - in a lower sentence, I think, is different than defending against a higher -- a higher sentence; but yes, I think it is appropriate. And the rule says -- rule 32(h) only speaks to the judge. But I think the parties in their positions are required by the local rule in the Southern District of Alabama and the Federal rule generally to put their -- their positions in writing in advance of the hearing. I think our rule, I believe, is seven days. So that when the judge, before getting ready to sentence, looks at the issues, the people with the heightened interest in them have already identified what they are. So the only -- it's only the residual issues that are picked up by rule 32. It occurs very infrequently in practice."

There's -- there are -- the reasons for notice I think are in -- notice is important not only for the individual defendant but there's institutional interests as well. It's a -- it's a fairly rarely occurring phenomenon where rule 32(h) comes into play. The rule as written doesn't demand any changes. It is a matter of interpretation. And the Sentencing Commission itself defines a departure as any non-Guidelines sentence. That fits within the literal language of rule 32(h). This Court doesn't have to decide this case."

The provision that came in in December of '07 that says that the court can request other factors, I think is just that an authorization to the probation officer to look at -- to look at other factors and to think more broadly. But I don't think that should be read as limiting the scope of 32(h) simply to what would be traditional guideline departures. If I could, I'd reserve the balance of my time."

Now, applying 3553(a) in this situation raises different problems, and there are issues regarding the specificity of the notice that's required and the timing of the notice.

If I can give an example of a case we recently confronted, for example? We had a case in which a judge imposed probation on a defendant who was convicted of soliciting child pornography because the judge was under the belief that prison couldn't provide the necessary treatment. We hadn't presented any evidence on available treatment programs, but we certainly would have done that if we had had notice that the court was contemplating varying on that ground.

That would start to make the notice requirement unworkable, but I don't think that's how it's been interpreted, to require the very specific facts in the departure context. The same situation, the parallel thing applies here. As I was going to say before on the burdensomeness, it hasn't been burdensome, unduly burdensome, to require notice for traditional, and there really isn't any reason to think that it would be different for here. And to get back to something earlier as well that we're were talking about, the key fact is rule 32(h) does indisputably require notice for traditional departures. And a notice requirement for variances is essential to prevent evisceration of that notice requirement because a court can always impose the same -- use a variance to impose the same sentence that it could have imposed as a Guidelines departure. So that notice requirement, which is still in the rule, is going to basically become meaningless unless the word \"departure\" is given it full scope and construed to include variances. And notices of variances is also necessary for the focused adversarial testing that rule 32 requires for the reason the Court said in Burns. If the parties don't know what the potential grounds for a non-Guidelines sentence are, then what they're likely to do is either address the possibility of an above-Guidelines sentence in a random and wasteful way by trying to conceive of every possible grounds or they're just not going to address it at all, like in the example that I gave before when we just didn't address the potential variance based on prison not providing - - being able to provide the appropriate treatment. And it's still important, even after Booker, to have adversarial testing of that issue."

The first is suggested by Justice Ginsburg and Chief Justice Roberts that paragraph 78 of the presentence report put the parties on adequate notice that they could engage in a full adversarial testing outweighing the defendant's future dangerousness against his amenability to alternative methods of treatment. The alternative ground for affirming the judgment below is that suggested by Justice Scalia and Justice Alito, namely: That Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) was drafted for a different era, an era of mandatory guidelines. And there is no reason, particularly in light of the right rulemaking process, to extend rule 32 to an advisory guideline era."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "But then it would be easy for a district judge to escape any obligation to give 32(h) notice because he could simply say: Oh, yeah, before I would have ranked this as a Sentencing Guidelines matter, but now I'm treating it as a 3553(a) factor, so I don't have to bother with 32(h) anymore."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUTLEDGE",
      "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, I understand your concern about the possibility that district judges might, I guess in theory, attempt to do an end run around rule 32(h) by recasting a departure decision as a variance decision. And, admittedly, there are certain circumstances in which the ground for a departure on rule 32(h) has some overlap with the ground for a variance under 3553(a), but I would offer several responses. My first response is that I feel the Court crossed that bridge a little bit in the Booker remedial opinion when it created an advisory guidelines system. The whole premise of the advisory guidelines system was to enhance the discretion of the district judge. My second answer would be that district judges still have a reason to engage in the departure calculation. As this Court made clear in Rita, district judges must begin by consulting the guidelines. And the Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Courts of Appeal all have interpreted that obligation to consult the Guidelines to include consideration of possible grounds for departure. Of course, this Court's decision in Kimbrough made clear that even if those two grounds don't provide the judge adequate incentive to engage in a departure calculation, that there is yet another reason; and that is because it may affect the scrutiny-of-reasonableness review. As the Court explained in Kimbrough, when a district judge departs from the Guidelines, the district judge's determination may be entitled to greater respect when the judge makes the determination that a case takes -- that a circumstance takes the case outside of the heartland."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

A case that would qualify for a Guidelines departure would, by definition, be a case in which the 3553(a) factors justified a sentence other than a Guidelines sentence? So I don't understand why there's any need to go through the departure analysis any longer at all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUTLEDGE",
      "speech": "Justice Alito, I don't believe that this Court's Booker and post-Booker jurisprudence has made the departure determination irrelevant. Indeed, just this last Friday, the Sentencing Commission posted on its website additional proposed amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that would inject new grounds for departures including fraud for emergency assistance and violations of Federal food and drug laws that entail a risk of serious bodily injury. Departures remain relevant to the guidelines because they are the basis upon which the Commission can continue to fulfill its mandate to provide for the type of uniform sentencing that still is possible."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

You're not -- a court -- a sentencing court, after concluding that there is no ground for a departure under Booker and the later cases, then has to consider the 3553(a) question. So the decision about the departures is irrelevant. It is not dispositive; and, if the court finds that the case qualified for a Guidelines departure, as I said before, by definition, that is going to be a case where the 3553(a) factors warranted a non-Guidelines sentence anyway. So it seems like a useless appendage at this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUTLEDGE",
      "speech": "Well, it may well be the case, Justice Alito, that as this Court's Booker jurisprudence unfolds, that the concept of a departure declines in importance, in addition with respect to the 32(h) obligation for notice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
      "speech": "Well, why is the 32(h) obligation relevant? That is, looking through the history of it, I see that in 32(i)(C) it says that the government has to allow the parties' attorneys to comment on the determination of the probation officer and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence. Then, in a case called Burns v. United States, this Court says that that right to comment includes a right to notice. And so all that 32(h) did was to take what was already the law and make specific that it includes a right to notice. I take it that was what they were up to. But even if you didn't have 32(h), you would have precisely the same right once you got 32(i)(C) together with the case of Burns. So I don't know where that leaves me, except thinking it doesn't matter, because the defendant has precisely the same right either way. And I guess it's easier just to say \"departure\" means generally all kinds of departures including not applying it. That's not a stretch of the language. It is quite right it is not consistent with what they thought they were up to, but not -- it is -- maybe before -- if they had passed this before Hawaii became a State, you could say: Well, they didn't think it would apply in Hawaii. So what? I mean would you decrease that, General?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUTLEDGE",
      "speech": "Certainly, Justice Breyer. If we were to put 32(h) to one side and consider the effect of rule 32(i)(1)(C), then the Court confronts the question whether the basic ideas that animated its decision in Burns should be extended in an advisory-guidelines era. And Burns, at bottom, rested on two distinct strands of reasoning. One was the question of unfair surprise. And we think, with that respect, that the post-Booker era is different from the pre-Booker era. And the reason why, Justice Breyer, is because pre-Booker the parties came to the sentencing hearing with an expectation of a within-Guidelines sentence. And post-Booker, particularly in light of this Court's decision in Rita, the parties cannot come to the sentencing hearing with that expectation because the district judge may not presume the reasonableness of the within-Guidelines sentence. And so to the extent that Burns rested on concerns of unfair surprise, the rationale has dropped out after Booker. Now, there is a second strand of reasoning to Burns which Justice Ginsburg alluded to, which is this question of full adversarial testing. And I agree with you, Chief Justice Roberts, that Chief Judge Boudin's decision in the Vega-Santiago case provides the pathway here. Judges engage in this kind of discretionary act all the time. Parties come to the hearing with a theory, a theory of how the judge should exercise her sentencing discretion within a known range, and knowing the applicable legal criteria, and have an opportunity to be heard. And we believe that, particularly in light of the recent amendment to section 32(d)(2)(F), that's going to include the possibility of the 3553 factors - - 3553, a factor in the presentence report, that the parties are going to have the opportunity to come to the hearing with the ability to engage in full adversarial testing."

      "speech": "I -- I don't think that it presents a concern of impracticability, Justice Kennedy, for one simple reason; and that is by relying on a mechanism such as the continuance, the parties are given the opportunity to identify for the court whether or not there's a concern of unfair surprise; and if there is, the district judge is in the position to decide whether or not she believes that the continuance is necessary. If the notice claim only arises at the time that the sentence is entered, there's relatively little opportunity at that point for the district judge to go back and reconsider the record on the basis of unfair surprise. And that sort of takes me to the basic point that Justices Souter, Alito and Justice Ginsburg all talk, about which is the fundamental unworkability of the notice rule and advisory guidelines system. As the judges -- the district judges explained to us in the recent rulemaking proceeding contemplating a amendment to rule 32(h), they're concerned that extending this rule to variances will make it quite difficult. We know that district judges often receive these packets of sentencing information only seven days before the sentencing hearing. Several courts of appeals have held that giving notice at the sentencing hearing is not timely. And even if the timeliness concern can be overcome, there are serious problems in workability as to the adequacy of the notice. The best that the Petitioner and the government the instruct this Court on, in terms of how the adequacy standard is going to work, is that it has to be context-specific; and if we put ourselves in the shoes of a district judge that now has to engage in a discretionary act to decide whether or not the notice that I've given is adequate turns on the context, doesn't provide a great deal of guidance to the district judge. We know, for example - -"

      "speech": "Why isn't it just whatever is the reason that the judge is considering is going outside the advisory Guidelines, whatever that reason is, just say it. So the judge says -- could say here, \"I'm contemplating going outside because I don't think that this man is going to stop these threats.\" Period. That's all."

      "speech": "I -- certainly, Justice Ginsburg. And I've wrestled with that own question in -- in my mind. If this judge were to have said I'm thinking of sentencing outside the Guidelines because I'm dealing with an individual who has a demonstrated ability to stalk and threaten his ex-wife, would that have been adequate? And interestingly, I think pages 23 and 126 of the Petitioner's reply brief illustrate that either the answer to that question is going to be \"not necessarily,\" or otherwise appellate judges are going to be strung up having to unpack whether or not notice is adequate, because it is Petitioner's petition in this case that even if the defendant had been put on notice as to the future dangerousness, that that did not, quote, \"put the defendant on notice\" that the district judge supposed the futility of treatment might justify an outside-the-Guidelines sentencing. Here's the essential workability problem. We know from this court's decision in Rita that the basic vision in the post-Booker world is to encourage judges to provide reasoned sentencing decisions, where a degree of reasoning may depend a little bit upon whether the judge is engaging an inside-the-advisory-Guidelines sentence, or an outside-the-advisory-Guidelines sentence. In the event that a district judge engaging in an outside-the-Guidelines sentence, she is now walking into a trap. Because if she imposes it based on a determination about the defendant's future dangerousness, and then in an attempt to provide a full explication of her reasoning makes a statement about the amenability or non-amenability of the defendant to alternative forms of treatment, the aggrieved party will seize on that extra statement and bring it back to the pre-sentencing report and the parties' pleadings and said we may have had notice as to ground one to the variance but we didn't have notice as to ground two. Or we may have had notice as to ground one and two, but we didn't have any as to ground three. This is the essentially workability concern that we believe that the district judges raised when they expressed their discomfort with the proposed amendments to rule 32(h); and precisely why we think the more prudent course is to affirm the judgment below, either on the narrow ground that I started start with, the Chief Justice's question suggested, or alternatively on the broader grounds suggested by Justice Scalia's questions, that the resume that emerged at the time of mandatory Guidelines should not be extended to the time of advisory Guidelines. And if I could make one last observation, and then I'll complete my argument unless the Court has further questions. In December of 2007, the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules formed a subcommittee to study this problem. If the Court consults the minutes of that meeting, they didn't form that subcommittee because they were awaiting this Court's decision in Irizarry. They formed that -- cert hadn't been granted in Irizarry. They formed that subcommittee for two reasons. The first reason was whether in light of this Court's decisions in Gall and Kimbrough a notice requirement was still necessary; and second was the consideration that in light of the breadth of the 3553(a) factors a notice requirement should be removed altogether. The more prudent course either for the narrow grounds suggested by Chief Justice Roberts or the broader grounds suggested by Justice Scalia is to affirm the judgment below. If the Court has no further questions I would be happy to yield back the balance of my time."

      "speaker": "MADDEN",
      "speech": "Thank you. I think Justice Breyer is correct that rule 32(e) is -- requires that the parties have an opportunity to comment on matters appropriate to the sentencing. That opportunity extends to not only Guidelines departures but also what has been called variances. There are two reasons why it's important that that -- that right comes with a notice requirement. The first is that fairness for the individual defendant, the ability to litigate the issues that are going to make a difference in his sentencing. The other is that it permits as an institutional issue effective appellate review, if there's a developed record and evolution of the Guidelines by looking at the aggregate of cases. If the Court's decision is that we're going to exempt from notice requirement the cases that are going -- the sentences that are going to be driven towards the margin, high or low, the goal of uniformity that Congress sought in the Sentencing Reform Act would be lost. And I submit that that's an independent reason why the Court ought to require notice is because otherwise, it's inviting the sentencing disparities which the architecture of the Sentencing Reform Act is designed to eliminate. As far as workability, it is extremely rare that the issues aren't flagged in the papers. It is not going to come up frequently. Rule 32(h) issues don't come up terribly frequently, at least in my practice in the appellate cases. Five circuits below have -- saw no workability problem with extending the notice requirement of rule 32(h) to variances as well."
