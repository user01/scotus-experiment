When this Court in Ginsberg crafted a rule of law that permits States to regulate a minor's access to such material outside the presence of a parent, it did so for two fundamental reasons that are equally applicable this morning in this case. First, this rule permits parents' claim to authority in their own household to direct the upbringing and the development of their children; and, secondly, this rule promotes the States' independent interest in helping parents protect the well-being of children in those instances when parents cannot be present. So this morning, California asks this Court to adopt a rule of law that permits States to restrict minors' ability to purchase deviant, violent video games that the legislature has determined can be harmful to the development and the upbringing -­"

The problem is, is that for generations there has been a societal consensus about sexual material. Sex and violence have both been around a long time, but there's a societal consensus about what's offensive for sexual material, and there are judicial discussions on it. Now, those judicial discussions are not precise. You could have had the same questions today with reference to an obscenity statute, and we have -- we have said that with reference to obscenity, there are certain -- that there are certain materials that are not protected. Those rules are not precise at the margins, and some would say not precise in a more significant degree as well.

Any harm that's supposed to be inflicted on them is supposed to take place over a period of years, not minutes, so the parent has ample opportunity to exercise parental supervision over what games are being played in the house.

But I'd like you to deal with their point for a moment. And I take it their point is: There is no new First Amendment thing here. There is a category -- call them X -- which really are involving things like torturing children, et cetera. Maybe you don't like to sell them to anybody. You have them X'd or some special thing. But they exist, and they fit within a Miller-type definition. They are much worse than the simple girlie magazine that was involved there. And they will use traditional First Amendment tests; that is to say, there is speech at issue, that speech is being limited, it is being done for a good reason, compelling interest -- namely, this problem with the X videos and the torture and living it through -- and there is no less restrictive alternative that isn't also significantly less effective. See, I want you to deal with that directly, because what you have been doing for the most part is saying we have to be in some new, total new area, et cetera.

This is a very difficult task, trying to use language to differentiate levels of violence or types of violence in a manner that would in some way tell people what the rules of the game are. I think, even if you think that there's some problem out there that needs to be solved, you ought to think very carefully about whether or not you're going to authorize the creation of some new rule authorizing regulation in this area, when no one will have any idea what the scope of it is."

And it's important, by the way, to -- to note that California hasn't told us whether we should judge it for 5-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 17-year-olds.
