The doctrine is contrary to fundamental Fourth Amendment principles that probable cause is an objective inquiry based on all of the facts and circumstances known to the officer at arrest. In contrast, the closely related offense doctrine is a subject of inquiry that limits probable cause only to those facts and circumstances closely related to the offense that the arresting officer announces at arrest. Under the doctrine, then if two officers observe precisely the same facts and circumstances and arrest the suspect, the arrest in one case can be valid and in the other invalid based only on the officer's subjective legal evaluation -­"

Under those circumstances, the results would be different. The -- the concern that Your Honor raised about police officers engaging in a post hoc rationalization I respectfully suggest is not a concern that is rooted in reality because the facts continue to drive the analysis.

I mean, these two police officers I think are what the public would hope these police officers were, looking at a code book at the roadside, calling a prosecutor late at night, trying to get it right. They are punished under this doctrine.

What matters is what came into an officer's brain, not what came out as a result of his working on it. Because, as I said, that would make law enforcement far from unevenhanded. It would make it depend upon who the officer was at the roadside on any given night. And those similarly situated would be treated very, very differently, depending upon what an officer chose to say.

He said, I'm arresting you for X reason, for tape recording. And then they had a whole colloquy. So what the -- what the arrest was for is as objective as it can be."

And that's illustrated by imagining three stops on that road that night, three Mr. Alfords, exact same facts. In one, the officer is engaged in the process that he engaged in here. In the other two, the officer chooses in the first to say nothing, and in the third, to say -­ hold up the code book and say what you did is in here. Everything in here applies to you, wise guy. Now get in the car. In those two other circumstances, complete silence and the table of contents approach, we wouldn't be here. These officers would not have been in litigation for 4 years. That to me demonstrates that it is essentially subjective because it is driven not by the facts, what the defendant did, but by the nature of the police officer. Is he clever? Has he gone to law school at night?"

      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. And -- and if -­ perhaps my distinction is -- is too homely, but I would say that's about what comes into his mind, into the brain, his senses. Did he see this taillight? Did he see the sticker? Not what comes out of his mouth as a result of the functioning of that brain, his legal brain. The legal work is for the courts looking at an arrest that's been challenged through the prism of an objectively reasonable officer. It does not depend, else Fourth Amendment seizures would be not reasonable, but would vary depending upon the skills of an individual officer from roadside to roadside. And that is utterly inconsistent with this Court's precedent and would, in fact, gut the objective reasonableness test. The Ninth Circuit's rule would lead to dramatically uneven law enforcement. It would, indeed, lead to either stacking or silence, and there's plenty of good reason why an officer or a Federal agent, who are not required to say anything at arrest, might want to inform a defendant of a basis for his arrest and might want to uphold other bases for an arrest, to protect a witness, for example. To drive police officers to the extremes is not in the public interest."

And the -- in reviewing the transcript and in reviewing the -­ the instructions and the ruling on the summary judgment motion, the reason that Senior Judge Bryan did not rule on the qualified immunity was twofold. One, at the time of the summary judgment motion, one of the officers was -- well, was lying about having contacted the prosecutor prior to making the arrest, and he noted in his order that there was a factual dispute. So summary judgment wasn't appropriate. And second, Judge Bryan indicated that essentially there was a problem created by the Saucier opinion because he felt that it was somehow possible that there could have been an arrest effectuated without probable cause, but that there was a reasonable mistake on the part of the officers. So this did not proceed to the jury on the -- on this closely related offense doctrine. It didn't proceed on there were these other crimes for which probable cause existed, but on this broad standard of good faith and reasonable mistake."

If you're engaging in conduct that would have and should have led to your arrest, if it's the same conduct for which you were arrested and it's simply misnamed, then there essentially is no harm of constitutional magnitude. But otherwise --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "Well, then you have a very narrow view of closely related. It comes down to misnomer cases. It's one thing to say -- what the officers told the DA, although after they arrested him -- didn't they describe the whole episode from when they saw Alford pull up behind the disabled vehicle? They described that and they mentioned the flashing lights. They described the whole episode up till the point where they -- the officers apprehended him and saw the equipment and then noticed -­ they told the DA everything, and he said, yes, you have probable cause."

      "speech": "So why couldn't it be related in time and space rather than legally related?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, I'm not urging something as narrow as -- as a semi-Blockburger test. But here you have essentially two discrete conducts that were being examined by the officers: number one, the actions surrounding the headlights; and number two, the actions surrounding the taping. And the trial -- I mean, it was very clear that the two were treated as discrete incidents by the police. At the moment Devenpeck saw the tape recorder -- and he testified at trial. When I saw the recorder in the record mode and saw that it was moving, that's what he stated to him constituted probable cause for the arrest. The moment he saw that tape recorder and saw the play and record buttons were pushed, he informed Mr. Alford, you're under arrest for making an illegal tape recording. So when looking at whether something is -- is sufficiently related or not, obviously there's going to have to be more than a modicum of logic that's used, but objectively this separates rather nicely into two discrete incidents for the analysis."

Now, the policeman might make a mistake about that. He -- he thought he threw a punch, but he made a mistake. Now -- now, why is a policeman less likely to make that kind of a mistake than make a mistake about what crime to label it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",

      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
      "speech": "No, no. You said -- you -- you say everybody agrees in this case that if the policeman had reasonable cause objectively to arrest the person for A, but he arrested him for B instead, there are some circumstances in which that's okay. And on their view, it's -- as long as -- it was always okay, really, as long as objectively there was reasonable cause. On your view, you're going to add a little thing. You're going to add, and by the way, it's not okay unless that conduct that he looked at was in fact illegal. So you say -- because policemen could make mistakes about labels, but they're not likely to make mistakes about throwing a punch. So I just wondered why not. I mean, they got the wrong guy for throwing the punch. You know, so -- so what? Why is that so -- that -- that supposedly in your view is some terrible constitutional harm, but if he just mislabels it, it's not a terrible constitutional harm. And I'm just puzzled as to where that distinction comes from and why."

      "speech": "Your Honor, if we start with first principles, and the first principle that underlies this case is there is, from the framing area -- era, a general mistrust of warrantless arrests. From that, we step to the reasonableness clause. From the reasonableness clause, we then step to this judicially created qualified immunity, which subsumed the good faith analysis. So what we find is we're stepping further and further away from the original principle. And the -- on the original principles, he was arrested without a warrant. Wrong. Under the Constitution we have reasonableness. Okay. He's arrested. Was it a reasonable arrest? The court has said we generally say that if an arrest has probable cause, then it's reasonable unless there are these exigent circumstances, excessive force, et cetera. Then under qualified immunity, it's even a step more attenuated, that even though there might not have been probable cause, if there was arguable probable cause, then there would be a violation, but no one is going to be liable for it."
