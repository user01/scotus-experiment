United States, to conclude that constitutional deprivations other than deprivation of the right to counsel can be addressed in habeas corpus proceedings as constituting a collateral effect enhancing the sentence of someone in custody under a conviction that they are seeking to attack in the Federal habeas corpus proceedings. In this case, Edward Coss had been convicted in the mid-eighties of simple assault and institutional vandalism and had been sentenced to incarceration, and he had completely served his sentence."

      "speech": "For obtaining the relief. I think it's in the Act, but I do know, Your Honor, that Pennsylvania cases have construed that if you're not in custody you don't get-post conviction relief, Act relief. Following the completion and full service of his sentence for that conviction in the eighties, Mr. Coss got in trouble with the law again and was found guilty of assault and was sentenced to a separate term. The record indicates that the sentence for his earlier 1980's conviction and sentence was considered by the court. It doesn't quantify the extent to which it was considered. It was just noted by the court. That was found both by the district court and by the Third Circuit Court. Coss filed his petition pro se. His Federal habeas corpus petition was filed pro se, and the district court, according due deference to his 19 -- or, to his Federal habeas corpus petition, construed it as an attack on his later conviction in the 1990's, as well as an attack on his 1980's conviction, and denied Mr. Coss relief based upon the fact that, although ineffective assistance of counsel was made to appear from the evidence that Mr. Coss suffered no prejudice. Mr. Coss then appealed to the Third Circuit and the Third Circuit reversed the district court, finding that prejudice was shown by Mr. Coss and finding also, or ruling also that because Coss' claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his 1980's conviction was -- had an effect upon the sentence he received for his 1990's conviction, that he was entitled to Federal habeas relief. And the means by which the Third Circuit reached that conclusion is the principal matter that I believe needs to be addressed here this morning, because what the Third Circuit did was relied principally upon jurisprudence developed in the Third Circuit which, for all intents and purposes, reverses district court judges that don't treat attacks on subsequent convictions that were enhanced, sentences of which were enhanced by prior convictions. The Third Circuit reverses those judges and says, you should have found that this collateral enhancement on grounds other than Gideon violations is something that we will not tolerate in this Circuit."

Cook has been misunderstood by the Third Circuit. The holding of Maleng v. Cook clearly seems to say that a person may not attack, or a person is not in custody under a prior conviction once he has fully served that conviction, but the Third Circuit reaches a different conclusion by looking at the result that was reached in Maleng, because in Maleng the Court will recall that the petitioner was granted relief, but in that case the basis, as I read Maleng, for the petitioner being granted relief was principally that there was a custodial nexus between the earlier conviction and sentence and that which he was attacking in his Federal habeas corpus petition, that custodial nexus being the hold that was placed upon him for the State conviction that he would be obliged to serve. In this case, however, there is no custodial nexus to connect the fully expired sentence to the sentence that the Court construed he was attacking in his Federal habeas corpus petition."

The United States adopted a line of reasoning which, while it may not directly apply to Federal habeas cases, Custis having been a case under the sentence -- the Federal Sentencing Act, the rationale of those cases clearly seems to announce a constitutional declaration that, in considering prior convictions and sentences, the only constitutional violation that the court will consider, the courts should consider, are Gideon violations, where counsel was totally absent, and that ineffective assistance of counsel cases do not fall under that umbrella and, therefore, are not to be considered as supplying a basis for Federal habeas attacks on subsequent convictions and sentence, enhanced by a sentence in which there may have been ineffective assistance of counsel."

Custis found that it is permissible to enhance a defendant's sentence with prior convictions that were themselves infected with constitutional error and, because that's so, a prisoner may not bring a habeas corpus attack under 2254 on his current sentence and hope to reopen the validity of his prior convictions except when the prior convictions are obtained in violation of Gideon."

      "speaker": "RUSSEL",
      "speech": "Absolutely, Your Honor. I believe that Custis does express the preference for the forum, which is to say that all these constitutional attacks need to be made in the rendering State or in the habeas corpus petition that follows, while the defendant is in custody, so while Custis, in that particular case the Court recognized that a habeas corpus avenue was available, that observation was premised on the underlying observation that he was still in custody and could go back to his home State and attack his convictions there. Otherwise, once the convictions are final and the defendant is not in custody, then the only violation that the defendant can raise in a complaint about his prior conviction is that the prior conviction was obtained in violation of Gideon."

There could have been another case, in all respects similar to this petitioner, with the one difference that a week before his custody in the State for the first sentence, a week before the custody expired, the State Supreme Court said, oh, you're right, there's a constitutional violation. It seems rather quixotic to deprive the petitioner of that opportunity here, simply because his sentence was served before the court got around to ruling on the issue."

He would like to say that that confession was beaten out of me. It's totally wrong. Can he do it, or does the judge, like the Federal system after Custis, just say we won't even listen?"

      "speaker": "RUSSEL",
      "speech": "I believe, Your Honor, that under Pennsylvania law the judge says, we won't even listen. I think that's the way it works in Pennsylvania, and so our rule definitely, while calling for application of the Custis principle, we certainly think that this may exclude some defendants from achieving relief in State court first, but we think that the line drawn in Custis is a fair and equitable balancing of the competing concerns between fairness and finality, and it's certainly a rule that can be applied uniformly throughout the States. I would like to point out that in substance our position tracks very closely to the argument advanced by the United States last month in the Daniels case and, while we think the Government's right there, we believe that this case presents even stronger reasons for application of the Custis principle. One chief difference is that, whereas in Daniels this case came to us through an application of a mandatory sentence enhancement scheme, this involved the discretionary use of a prior conviction by a sentencing court, and that's something that happens much more often. It happens in every sentencing court in the country every single day, and so to the extent the Custis majority was motivated by concerns about finality, and of the burden of conducting endless derivative collateral attacks, that concern, those concerns are implicated to a far greater degree here. It would simply be unworkable if we had to go investigate Strickland claims about trials that took place in a different State many years ago every time a prior conviction was used in a discretionary proceeding. We couldn't --"

Perhaps they were precluded because the law didn't allow the attack. Perhaps they only learned of the violation late, as in the case of a Brady or a newly discovered evidence rule, and in all of those cases we'll be opening up a collateral review, often in a different State, and trying to discuss the relevance, or the reliability of a prior conviction that was obtained many years earlier."

      "speaker": "RUSSEL",
      "speech": "And the burden of that litigation would just add to the same litigation problems we're going to have. A second difference between our case and the Daniels case is that there's a federalism component here that was not present in Daniels. We think it is one thing for the Federal system to say to the States, we will not use your convictions for our sentencing purposes, but it's quite a different thing for the Federal system to say, you may not use your convictions for your sentencing purposes. And finally, we note that from the transcript of the Daniels argument, some members of the Court at least entertained the possibility that the text of 2255 -- 2255 may allow for collateral attacks on grounds that are themselves not mandated by the Constitution, and to the extent that's a possibility, we think that's a difference in our case as well, because this Court repeatedly has stated that 2254 exists solely to remedy the errors of constitutional dimension. In short, we believe that this application of the Custis rule would be totally proper here because it is a workable rule, and that the respondent's position, in contrast, is totally unworkable. It would subject us to endless collateral reviews, and we would ask that the Third Circuit be reversed on that ground. While I have a few moments, I do want to approach my first issue and explain why this Court can and should address the main issue, even though we've raised what appears to be a jurisdictional defect. When we looked at this case, following this Court's decision in Maleng, we expected to see the habeas corpus litigation follow a particular pattern, which was that the defendant would exhaust his state remedies and then he would bring a habeas petition, styled as an attack on the new conviction, complaining about the use of the old conviction. Well, what we saw instead was something that was quite different. The defendant here never raised this issue in State court. He brought his petition while his -- excuse me."

You're going to have the problems of, that the State that's involved with the process is not there, but I think that's -- the problem with that is solved by limiting the remedy to the sentence, so that for the purposes -- if we -- the Pennsylvania Federal court declared a California conviction unconstitutional because of a sentencing in Pennsylvania, then it applies just to that sentencing.

That is, a State prisoner goes into Federal habeas court and he says, one of the reasons I got a longer sentence was because somebody thought that I hit one of the bystanders, but I want to tell you, there's no evidence of that at all in the record, none, zero.

In summary, we seek a limited and narrow rule. We seek a rule that will require the petitioner, or Mr. Coss, to exhaust his State claims, to meet his burden of proof, and when you have a case where he's met his burden of proof, has shown that his counsel was ineffective, and has shown that the subsequent sentence was enhanced or at least influenced by the prior improper conviction, that this Court should not base the sentence on that, they should not let a sentence be founded on an unreliable foundation, and that the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed."
