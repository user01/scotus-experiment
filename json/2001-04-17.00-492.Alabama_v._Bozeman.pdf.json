We are simply here today to resolve whether or not a guilty man should escape his just punishment as a result of a technical violation of a statute. Specifically, the question presented here is whether or not Michael Bozeman is entitled to have his, was entitled to have his indictment dismissed with prejudice as a result of a one-day transfer from Federal custody into State custody for purposes of arraignment and appointment of counsel."

Other States, specifically Alabama, do not have such a reservation clause in the Agreement, which would make it more difficult certainly to amend the Agreement. Now, there are some other States that have amended the Agreement unilaterally, but it's not been challenged whether or not that was permitted -- permissible under the Agreement itself."

Why did your State sign that, adopt that if it wasn't prepared to abide by it."

Do you have cases that simply don't talk about where the implied effect of a provision in most cases is to cause dismissal of the suit, we won't let it happen when there's been no substantial prejudice, that I can understand, but here you have language that is categorically mandatory."

And I have the same difficulty, I guess, with the Government's de minimis argument, and that is, it's true there is a -- there is a, as you put it, a sort of background principle of the harmless error doctrine, and there's a background de minimis, but I don't think that there is a background to the effect that these either/or of these doctrines may be used to excuse an intentional and systematic series of violations of the statute, and it seems to me that that is what you are arguing for. You're saying not only would we move the person for two days for an arraignment here, we will continue to do it or we should be entitled to continue to do it, and even though that's a technical violation of the statute, we would in each case be excused on harmless error. Do you know of any instance in which harmless error or de minimis, for that matter, has been used in effect to excuse a systematic violation of the statute?"

      "speaker": "STEWART",

However, I would say, number one, that an intentional violation act would certainly, whether or not it was intentional, would be a part of the harmless error analysis, and here I don't think there was an intentional act whatsoever. I think the prosecutor simply misread the Act and dropped the ball, and as a result Mr. -- if this Court holds that dismissal is required, then of course then the result, the purposes of this Act have not been maintained --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But I thought you were making a broader argument, and that is that this sort of transfer should be allowed. It is -- I mean, I can certainly see the value of making this transfer so that somebody who is not willing to waive arraignment can at least get counsel appointed and get the ball rolling toward prosecution, and I thought you were making the broader argument, not merely that this was a one-time mistake, but that for the good reasons that support this procedure, we ought as a general matter to apply harmless error whenever it occurs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "Mr. Justice Souter, I am making the broader argument that harmless error should apply to a statute unless there's an indication of an intent contrary to it that says that harmless error should not apply, and it's my position that this statute does not indicate such an intent that harmless error should not apply."

So what are they thinking in this, there might be lots of instances where there are days that pass between bringing him into the State and trying him, and what's supposed to happen in that time?

Now, if it's a prophylactic rule, you don't have a de minimis violation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "And certainly this Act was passed, this remedial legislation, it was passed specifically to address certain problems that occurred as a result of detainers, there being no formal procedures, and there being no way to bring an inmate into a State and have the detainers disposed of, and to do so in such a way that it didn't interfere with the rights to rehabilitation, that's the specific purposes behind this Act. Article IX of the Act specifically says that it should be construed in such a way as to effectuate those purposes, and to construe this Act as requiring dismissal of the indictment is not going to effectuate those purposes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but on that point, I thought that was a persuasive argument that both you and the Government make. They are interested in the rehabilitation, so they should send him back to the Federal prison. But why can't that be achieved by just asking for a waiver from the man because he would presumably agree with you in the normal case?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "Supposedly you could, you know, theoretically you certainly could ask for a waiver, but that is not what happened in this case, and it shouldn't be required that you ask for a waiver in order to --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Why not? I mean, if everybody is fully informed about the statute and the procedures, why couldn't that interest be adequately protected by saying, counsel, here's the problem, we can't try this fellow for another 30 days, so we'd rather -- we can either let him stay here in the county jail or go back to his regular rehabilitation program and then give the person the choice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "We could give the person the choice, but certainly again that could just simply lead to more litigation, and whether or not he understood what he was waiving and what right he had, and also we have to get him here practically in Alabama, the practical way, you have to get the person into Alabama before you can appoint counsel. There are ways to appoint counsel in advance of bringing the person to Alabama, but the practicalities --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but that just means that instead of a 24-hour turnaround, make it 48 hours, so you appoint counsel, give them time to consult with counsel, and then decide whether to go ahead with the trial before you send him back or send him back and let him continue the Government program. I would think very often the prisoner would say, yes, it makes more sense to go back, but assuming I guess he lived in Alabama, didn't he? That's part of the problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "Yes, he did, Justice Stevens. Certainly that's one way that this Act could be implemented, but the State's position is that that's not required under the Act because simply the transfer did not violate --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, it's clearly required if you read it literally, but you're sort of saying for this reason we should not read it literally and therefore it's not required."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "And of course this Court, at the time that this case was decided and at the time we were talking about whether or not Mr. Bozeman, whether his rights had been violated by the transfer, this Court had not decided New York v. Hill and decided whether or not waiver applied to the Act, and similarly the argument made there was that because the Act said that it shall be, that if there's a violation of the 120-day provision that the Act shall be -- or the indictment shall be dismissed with prejudice, that waiver shouldn't apply because and that the Act specifically should say whether it should or shouldn't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "There was an enormous difference, Ms. Stewart, between that case and this one, and that is the defendant did something that caused -- the defendant was sitting right there, and agreed to something, here the defendant hasn't agreed to anything at all. So it's one thing to say a defendant can't say, yeah, go ahead and try me and then the trial date comes and he says, uh-huh, it's too late. Here the defendant didn't do one thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "I think there is a significance in that that case involved waiver, but it's not for the purposes of the argument that I'm making which is that the IAD was silent on whether or not waiver principles applied to it, just as it's silent as to whether or not harmless error principles apply to it. This Court held that because it was silent and because the general principle, there's a presumption that waiver applies that waiver should apply there. Similarly, I'm arguing that because harmless error is, there's a presumption that it applies to statutes as well as to constitutional errors that it should apply in this case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It seems it would apply then in every case, and here was a prosecutor who made a perfectly reasonable choice were it not for this IAD to say, we're going to turn him around in 24 hours, just want to arraign him and send him back, but the literal reading of this cuts the other way, and if you don't hold prosecutors to that literal reading, then every case would be harmless, and must, shall would have no teeth at all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",

      "speech": "Certainly there are cases where there would be harm to the defendant by the transfer, for instance in Alabama there are like 2600 inmates involved in drug programs, and there's currently a waiting list of 800. Under the I -- if an inmate were transferred to another jurisdiction for a single day or maybe two days, he wouldn't lose his place in line to become involved in this program, so if he was transferred for the entire period, say, to a Federal jurisdiction to await trial, he would lose his place and lose his opportunity to participate in those programs, which could specifically prevent him from participating --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

We're talking about -- I'm saying that this practice of saying it's convenient for us to bring the person up without the clock ticking on when we have to start the trial, so bring him up, arrange arraignment, send him right back. And it seems to me that every case like that would be harmless error and not -- and then you have the words of the statute and then simply not enforced."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "I do think that there is a situation where you could bring somebody just for one day and there could be harm to them, if they weren't involved specifically, say, it was the time to take a GED, for instance, was that day, and they couldn't take it as a result, and it wouldn't be given for, you know, another year or something along that lines, it would be harm to the defendant, so there could be harm from a single day transfer."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, on that, even in this case illustrates the particular day, first it was one day, then another day, so it doesn't seem that the particular day is what's at issue.

      "speaker": "LAMKEN",
      "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. Our view is that the interruption is what is de minimis in this case, and when the interruption is merely for an overnight period, it does not cause a disruption in the inmate's participation in programs of rehabilitation in the original institution of confinement. If there was a long period of interruption, in contrast, the inmate would have to start over in the programs or could possibly lose his place as priority of the programs, depending on the institution, so we believe that, yes, in fact, there could be a longer interruption that would cause harm to the --"

Taylor, the United States Marshal Service placed a detainer on the prisoner, and the United States attorney's office was not aware of that detainer. Consequently, when they obtained custody of the prisoner, they said -- the magistrate specifically asked, is there a detainer on this prisoner? And the U.S. attorney said, no. They sent the prisoner back, not realizing that --"

      "speech": "Of course, Your Honor, but the rule of de minimis that when the event is so insubstantial in relationship to the purposes of the statute, the law does not take cognizance of it, and a single overnight transfer, like the one at issue here, is insubstantial in relationship to the purposes of the prohibition, and that purpose is to ensure rehabilitation of the prisoner and the prisoner's participation in the rehabilitation program."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yeah, but to the extent you rely on the interests of the prisoner, it seems to me that interest is totally protected by a simple requirement that he can waive because he would presumably have counsel to advise him, listen, you're better off if you go back and continue your program.

How is it really supposed to work because intuitively I'd think that a person who comes from a preliminary hearing, the longer he stays away, the worse things are, but this provision seems to force the State to keep him away."

It envisions, I believe, those time periods because they're sufficient to take care of all pretrial matters within that time. He's sitting there, he gets it taken care of, and of course Article I, in stating the purposes, says that the purpose is to resolve detainers. Bring someone in for arraignment, send him back, the detainer is still there, and the harm caused by the detainer is still there, and that is --"

      "speaker": "CHRISTENSEN",
      "speech": "Well, again, with the 120 days there is a provision that continuances can be granted for good cause shown. Now, in the antishuttling clause, there is no parallel construction there with the State. There's no provision that we're going to shuttle you over your objection. However, the Federal Government provision would allow that by reading the Federal amendment, the Article IX, which says if there's a hearing and the court orders that you're sent back, that's not a violation, but that's only applying to the Federal Government as a receiving State. It's not in the main body of the IAD, and I think that that is significant in terms of the statutory construction. In fact, I think it would be to run rough shod over the text to simply ignore it."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    {
      "speaker": "CHRISTENSEN",
      "speech": "The more time to confer with his counsel or? I certainly would think that. In this case there was very little opportunity to confer with counsel. If I could turn back to these Federal cases, the Chico case, Mr. Chico was transferred for arraignment, transferred back, and then transferred back to plead guilty. He did not appeal. He made no objection to the transfer. He was transferred pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum rather than as a detainer. This was before this Court had dealt with Mauro. Then when he had a probation violation, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus asking that the IAD be recognized. In Reed v. Farley, this Court has held that habeas corpus is not something that can be used to recognize violations of the IAD, so that would simply not apply. This case is then cited as justification in another Second Circuit case, the Roy case, Mr. Roy had so many detainers from so many different jurisdictions that I feel quite certain that the Second Circuit was looking for any reason whatsoever to keep from excusing him. Mr. Roy had another case in the Seventh Circuit which referred to the Second Circuit case and to the Chico case, and in fact the same transfer was complained about in the Second Circuit and in the Seventh and the Second Circuit cases. The Taylor case that Mr. Lamken mentioned does say that a brief transfer doesn't happen, but the prisoner there asked to be transferred back to State custody. There's quite clearly a waiver, although the Court for some inexplicable reason doesn't seem to reach that. That's a First Circuit case. The Fifth Circuit Sassoon case is also was raised on habeas corpus, and in fact it was raised on habeas corpus in the State courts. Mr. Sassoon had not appealed the issue following his conviction. Sixth Circuit Taylor case, many of these people for some unknown reason seem to be named Taylor, the court there held that since he was held in a jail and hadn't been transferred to a prison yet, that there was no violation, and then adds, and besides, all these other courts hold that quick, temporary transfers do not violate the IAD. It mentions Article IX of the Federal amendment in a footnote but doesn't rely on it. I find it somewhat inexplicable that these courts have this Federal amendment available to them, but it's evidently not being used because none of the opinions that I've found have done more than mention it in a footnote."

      "speech": "Yes, all these are cases where the United States was the receiving State. The Eighth Circuit Baxter case mentions this but it's again citing Chico, Taylor, and Roy, but it really resolves the issue on the fact that Mr. Baxter was transferred by writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum before a detainer had been lodged, so it really doesn't add to the argument other than to saying, yes, us, too, and the Ninth Circuit Johnson case simply comes down saying well, we've looked through and this is what the majority thinks, and we think that also. I would also point out that another reason I believe this cannot be de minimis or harmless error is that we tend to focus in on the phrase, the Court shall enter an order dismissing with prejudice, but there's also a self-executing clause in there, it seems that by the transfer itself, ex operi operato, the indictment becomes without further effect. Now, that is something that I believe that it requires an objection prior to trial to preserve that, just like any sort of defect in an indictment would require, yet it's not something that you can apply harmless error or de minimis analysis to. If the -- it seems somewhat redundant to have, then having the court enter a ruling dismissing the charge but I believe that that's to prevent the prosecutor from coming back and reindicting on these same charges, and it also recognizes that there really is no indictment, self-executing clauses being somewhat difficult to enforce otherwise. I would also point out, it's not very difficult for the States to follow these rules. It's laid out quite clearly. In this particular case, as I have set out in the red brief, the prosecutor had ample opportunity to know what the statute said and to follow the rules. She even had notice from Mr. Bozeman himself who had filed a pro se motion objecting to a prior transfer that said the IAD requires dismissal. It's -- to excuse that is simply, I believe, would be saying that a prosecutor can do whatever he or she pleases and that they hope to be able to get away with it by claiming that it's harmless. As a practical matter, a trial court judge is almost always going to rule that an error is harmless. He's going to rule against the prosecutor unless there is some real teeth given to the wording of the statute."

Well, it is a sanction, I suppose, against the prosecutor and they understandably don't like that because it's so rare that that happens, and as a defense lawyer, it gives me that small bit of cheer to occasionally have the upper hand. And also, this statute provides a bright line. I think that there are going to be endless hearings on whether or not harm has taken place if this Court rules that harmless error can apply. If you rule that the strict language applies, the Court needn't -- merely see, has there been a transfer, and if so, has there been a waiver."

      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points. I wanted to point out, the respondent has conceded that there are some exceptions to the actual wording of section, of Article IV(e), he has conceded that the language is not that clear and that there might have to be some construction of that statute in order to make it effectuate its purposes. Also, it's very important to point out that the agreement was not just for the benefit of the prisoner here, this agreement was entered into for the benefit of the party States as well as for the benefit of the prisoner, and that purpose is specifically stated in Article I, and it is one of the purposes that needs to be considered in determining whether or not a harmless error analysis should apply. In response to Justice Stevens' question about waiver and whether or not we could just have the prisoner waive, I think it's important to point out that the respondent has argued that one of the problems with implementing harmless error is it would lead to additional litigation in the trial courts, and I would point out that if we have a hearing every time we need to determine whether or not the prisoner wants to waive the right, then again we're going to have additional litigation, so either way we're going to come up with additional litigation. In answer to Justice Breyer's question about what's the purpose behind Article IV(e), I think it's simply meant to implement Article IV(c), and it's a way to bring the prisoner over, and we need to have him here, dispose of the charges, and bring him back, but I don't think the purpose is to give the prisoner some sort of benefit, some sort of way to have the charges disposed of short of a trial. Finally, Mr. Bozeman made no argument below about harm and that he suffered any harm, so it should not be considered here, and if this Court has no further questions, I thank you."
