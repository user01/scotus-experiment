And the way they -- these provisions interact in broad strokes that make perfect sense on our reading is that in the -- in the primary class of cases that motivated the passage of this statute, namely cases brought by the government where there were significant constitutional Confrontation Clause concerns about criminal defendants not understanding the spoken proceedings, in those core class of cases the Congress elected to pay for spoken interpreter services directly in the first instance. Now, in the non-core class of cases, private civil litigation, the Congress elected not to pay for these services but in 1920(6) to facilitate them in the lesser manner of providing that a party that incurred these expenses could recover them at the end of the case if it wins."

And this just, again, confirms that the -- that the usual congressional practice of differentiating between these terms in -- in statutes generally was fully applicable here, that the Congress knew the difference between these terms, used them appropriately. And the fact that having removed that -- that provision from the statute, the statute as passed contains only the words \"interpreter\" and \"interpretation,\" and no forms of \"translate,\" just again reaffirms that -- that the ordinary meaning of these terms should apply.

Our point is that that -- that double meaning doesn't apply to \"interpreter,\" which has a single narrow meaning limited to spoken communication.

But I don't think that that discretion is sufficient to eliminate the deterrent effect that this Court has recognized in cases like Farmer and Fleischmann, because it occurs at the end of the case, after a litigant has already decided whether to bring suit. The deterrent effect occurs ex ante when a risk-averse litigant has to decide whether to bring the case. But I would just note that these sorts of policy questions, Your Honor, arise in the context of language that by its terms extends to interpreting and not translating. And we would say that the relevant policy question is simply whether there are sensible reasons to -- that Congress may have drawn a line where it did. And, plainly, there are adequate reasons that these services, document translation services that were excluded, are potentially large and fall under the general principles that this Court has recognized are -- are presumptively not frequently avoided --"
  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "I guess I'm -- I'm having a problem with, you know, they're \"potentially large.\" Interpretive services are potentially large, although you claim that they -- that they don't -- they have sort of a terminus point. I've been in trials where we've had multiple languages simultaneously being translated to multiple defendants, with witnesses speaking even other languages. I was in the Southern District of New York. And fees there without translation, just for the oral courtroom work, sometimes went ahead for months. So, potentiality's not the question. If you're talking about disproportionality, then that goes to the word \"reasonable\" in the statute, doesn't it? I mean, the Ortho case you point to, the court did sizably cut the translation fees. And, more importantly, from the little I can tell, that was a huge patent case with a patent that was claimed to control 60 percent of a market. So, I don't know that that was a small case by anyone's definition."

I -- as to the difference, I mean, I'm not aware of, under this statute, an interpreter's spoken interpretation award approaching anywhere near some of the larger document translation awards that have been issued. But nonetheless, I am not denying that there could be large interpreter awards in some cases. But the fact is that adding on document translation awards is additive. The sort of necessity review that would be necessary to police these document translation awards would be quite burdensome on the district courts. And, in fact, the necessity standard is actually particularly problematic to apply to translations, Your Honor, because the fact is you don't know what a document says until it has been translated. And the exercise of trying to go back and reconstruct ex ante what a -- whether a person was reasonably necessary in causing to be translated something that they didn't know what it meant is likely to lead to very subjective --"

Kan Pacific relies on what it characterizes as different language in section 2, which put in 1827 and 1828, and section 7, which put in the cost provision. And it notes that section 2 sometimes uses the broader phrase \"interpreters in courts of the United States,\" whereas section 7 uses the word \"interpreters\" alone. But Kan Pacific doesn't examine the context in which section 2 does and does not use that broader phrase. And those specifics really undermine any argument I might make along these lines. As originally passed in section 2, 1827 contains 26 occurrences of the word \"interpreter,\" not counting the title. And of those 26 uses, 24 simply use the word \"interpreter\" by itself. So, there's certainly at the very threshold no overarching pattern of usage distinction between them. More fundamentally, though, the -- the substantive provisions addressing the use of interpreters by parties in these cases in 1827 do so without using that broader phrase. Subsection (d) --"

Without using the broader phrase \"in courts of the United States.\" Subsection (d) is the provision that -- that governs the use of interpreters in cases brought by the government. This appears at page 2a of the red brief appendix. And it simply provides that upon a determination of need, the services of an interpreter will be used in these cases. The only two provisions that use the phrase \"interpreters in courts of the United States\" are subsections (a) and (b), which are both at 1a of the red brief appendix, and both of these provisions simply are addressing the scope of the Administrative Office's duties under the statute. And as such, it simply makes clear that, in keeping with the office's ordinary function, it's -- it's facilitating the work of the Federal courts and making clear that the office isn't, for instance, certifying interpreters for the State courts. So, nothing in this language suggests in any way that the -- that the word \"interpreter\" means something different in different places or that the -- or that the services of an interpreter are viewed as embracing the same thing. So, we think that a variety of indicia of meaning converge in this case to support the conclusion that 1920(6) is limited to spoken communication. If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time."

Our submission is that, as the great majority of courts who've expressed a view on this question have recognized, the broader definition makes more -- more sense in the particular context at issue here. And we say that for a number of reasons. The first is that the basic purpose of translation in the litigation context is to make evidence intelligible to the parties and the court.

And the other side comes in and says, well, we think we need to submit this 10,000 pages of -- of documents, which will have to be translated, and by the way, if you lose, you're going to pay for that.

So, in connection with document translation costs, the Fifth Circuit has suggested that the way to tax them, the appropriate way to tax them, might be just to tax the cost of translating headings of foreign language documents, which should be sufficient to let the lawyer know whether this is a relevant document that might bear further translation, and then only the documents that really turned out, based on the translation of the heading, to have some significance to the case.

Necessity has long been recognized as one of the components of that discretionary determination. The reason we say it doesn't make sense to have the narrower definition of \"interpreter\" be the one that Congress enacted is that written document translation can be and often is every bit as important as oral translation.

Now, if you're going to make a copy for use of the case of something in Japanese, you're going to have to turn it into English. So, they included that as part of the cost of making copies of the material – of a document for use in the case. Now -- which is discretionary as to whether you do or whether you don't.

It is the oral translation of written documents. One of the reasons we think that the broader meaning of \"interpreter\" makes more sense in section 1920 is that it can't really account in any sensible way for sight translation. In this case, for example, our counsel, Kan Pacific's counsel, took Taniguchi's deposition, and to prepare for the deposition, he reviewed -- he had to review some contracts which were written in Japanese and some medical records which were written in Japanese. Now, under our view, having those documents translated in writing to prepare for the deposition would result in a potentially taxable cost. Under Taniguchi's view, they wouldn't. But it sounds like under either party's view, if instead of handing those documents off to a document translator to have them translated in writing, he had sat down in his law office with a member of the interpreter profession and said here's a box of documents; please, tell me what they say, that would potentially be a taxable cost.

And as far as the question where Taniguchi would have the Court draw it is concerned, I think that's a very hard question to answer, because he has moved back and forth so many times on that. His briefs offer several different -- several different narrow definitions of \"interpreter,\" sometimes saying it's the oral translation of oral speech, sometimes saying it's the oral translation of any language, whether it's oral or written, sometimes saying it's limited to in-court interpretation; sometimes it's saying it's not. That, it seems to us, is a very good reason for adopting the broader interpretation.

And as far as whether this is sort of a -- an outlying -- the examples I give are outlying oddball circumstances goes, I don't think they are. Sight translation, for example, is a core function of interpreters and translators alike. And I guess the only other point I would say -- make about sight translation, my friend Mr. Fried suggested that that -- that is something that could only be covered if it takes place during the course of live proceedings, which I think is -- is yet another narrowing of the word \"interpreter.\" But as far as I'm aware, most sight translation -- little, if any, sight translation actually occurs during the course --"

I think the history of this is strong evidence that it's not difficult. Courts have been doing this, certainly, since 1978 when this provision was added and even before then.

But I don't think it's entirely irrelevant that this has been done for a long time, and I think it's not unfair to presume that Congress would have been aware of that. The Court Interpreters Act has two main provisions as relevant here. There's section 2, which is really the more -- the main provision, and then section 7, which became 1920(6) in Title 28, which is the provision at issue here. An important part of Taniguchi's submission is that section 2 is limited to oral translators, and, therefore, it should follow that section 7, the provision at issue here, is likewise limited to oral translators. And our main submission on that -- on that question is that Congress actually used different language in section 2 and section 7. Section 2 added two provisions to Title 28: section 1827 and section 1828, which are titled, and which address, respectively, \"Interpreters in courts of the United States\" and \"Special interpretation services.\" In section 7, which added subsection (6) to 1920, Congress does not use those two phrases. Instead, it uses the phrase \"interpreters\" simply, not \"interpreters in courts of the United States,\" and then \"special interpretation services.\" So, to the extent that there is any appropriate canon about the use of similar or different language in different provisions of a statute, it seems to us that the appropriate canon is that one should presume that when Congress uses different language, it intends different meanings. I do want to respond to Mr. Fried's point about the number of times the word \"interpreter\" is used in section 2. And as I understand his point, is that -- it's that it's much more frequently used by itself than it is with the -- with the words \"in courts of the United States.\" What the statute actually does is add -- say that it's adding section 1827, which it calls \"Interpreters in courts of the United States.\" It then has a subsection that says that the Administrative Office of the United States Courts has to establish a program to facilitate the use of interpreters in courts of the United States."

So, it seems to us that as far as the Court Interpreters Act is concerned, even if it's true that section 2 uses the term in the narrower sense, it doesn't necessarily follow that it's used in the narrower sense in section 7. And the only point I would add about that, as we set -- point out in our brief, it's really not clear that section 2 is limited to oral translators. Soon after the Court Interpreters Act was enacted and for approximately 16 years thereafter, the Administrative Office would publish these notices in the Federal Register notifying the public that there were going to be certification exams for interpreters under section 2 of the Court Interpreters Act. These were pretty streamlined notices, not long at all. And one of the main aspects, the main sections, of the notice, was a list of what the director of the Administrative Office said were the -- were the duties of interpreters in courts of the United States. And to be sure, it listed simultaneous and consecutive interpreting, but it -- it listed sight translation, and it listed document translation. So, at a minimum, section 2 is not sufficiently clearly limited to oral translators, that the director of the Administrative Office couldn't issue these notices saying otherwise. I guess the -- the last point I would -- I want to make about other statutes, some of which use the term \"interpreter\" and \"translator\" together, I've already addressed that in part by saying that in many of those statutes, it really is pretty clearly used in the narrower sense because you're talking about members of a profession. The -- the only other thing I would say about that is that the premise of Taniguchi's reliance on those statutes seems to be that it would be strangely redundant for Congress to speak in other statutes about interpreters and translators together, if, in fact, the two terms could be used interchangeably, and that redundancy should be avoided. But subsection (6) of 1920 itself has a redundancy in it because it covers both interpreters and special interpretation services. And I don't think anybody could dispute that anyone who carries out a special interpretation service is an interpreter. So, it's not at all odd to have redundancy when Congress is addressing the subject of translation."

    "speech": "Very briefly, Your Honor, three points. In the first place, Justice Breyer, I just wanted to let you know that the first decision -- the first appellate decision construing 1920(6) to encompass document translation was the D.C. Circuit's decision in Quy in 1981. Second, Mr. Himmelfarb noted that Black's Law Dictionary takes a definition that arguably could encompass document translation, but he didn't mention that the -- that the operative version of Black's in 1978 when this statute was passed did not -- was a different definition that excluded document translation. And this change in the definition occurred in 1999, in the seventh edition, after a number of these judicial decisions construing 1920(6) had already come down, which supports Your Honor's observation that it could very well merely reflect a recognition of these decisions, rather than independent support for them. Finally, Your Honors, Mr. Himmelfarb cited certain notices issued by the Administrative Office from many years ago. These brief notices were ministerial documents that simply announced a forthcoming examination. The office has issued the Guide to Judiciary Policy, which is the -- which is the fully expressed views on this issue and is posted on the office's Web site. It's current as of June 9th, 2011, and expressly provides that document translation is not a part of the statutory services of an interpreter. If there are further questions, I'd be happy to address them."
