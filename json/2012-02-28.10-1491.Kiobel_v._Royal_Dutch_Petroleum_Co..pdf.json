Under Respondents' view, even if these corporations had jointly operated torture centers with the military dictatorship in Nigeria to detain, torture, and kill all opponents of Shell's operations in Ogoni, the victims would have no claim."

They're not defined by whether the perpetrator is a human being or a corporation or another kind of entity. And so, I think that the -- the Respondents are wrong when they say that international law does not extend to -- to those kinds of acts. They do -- it does. And the United States agrees with that position. What they have tried to -- to conflate is the question about whether international law -- the international law norms apply to a corporation or a person with whether there's a -- an international consensus with respect to how those norms should be enforced, particularly within domestic civil jurisdiction as opposed to criminal jurisdiction."

And Respondents take their position too far in this, because what they've said is that the fact that corporations can't be found liable criminally under the International Criminal Court, for example, means that the norms, the underlying norms -- genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes when it comes to the International Criminal Court -- don't apply to corporations. And that's clear -- that clearly is wrong because the United Kingdom and Netherlands, for example, the two home countries of -- of these corporations has passed domestic implementing legislation that imposes criminal there's no question that it can be done. What the most important -- I think one of the most important principles in this case is that international law, from the time of the Founders to today, uses domestic tribunals, domestic courts, and domestic legislation, as the primary engines to enforce international law."

One is that the Alien Tort Statute is a -- is a unique way of enforcing the law of nations, in terms of the way that the Founders married tort law and violations of the law of nations. In the international human rights amicus brief, the amicus brief of international human rights organizations, at pages 18 to 22, there's a whole series of cases where the domestic courts and domestic legislation of various states around the world have addressed those kinds of issues.

So, in terms of the underlying tort action, we have plaintiffs who are U.S. residents and were U.S. residents when they filed this case. They found a tortfeasor within the United States that they believe was responsible for these torts. And from Mostyn v. Fabrigas and before, Mostyn v. Fabrigas being the 1774 case by Lord Mansfield talking about transitory torts, the courts clearly have the jurisdiction to adjudicate those kinds of tort claims."

I would say two things: One is that that doesn't really go to the question about whether corporations can be categorically excluded from Alien Tort Statute coverage, which is really the issue that -- that was decided by the court below and which was the question presented here. Extraterritoriality has to do with a different kind of issue. I would argue that -- I mean, we've obviously argued that that's an issue that ought to be briefed on its own. But there is no international law principle that I am aware of, and I think it would need to be proved, that says that the United States Congress was disempowered at its founding from providing these kinds of tort remedies. And it was clear from the founding that the Founders at least believed that this statute would be extraterritorial."

But if -- if the Court looked to the Bradford incident -- the incident about which Attorney General Bradford expressed his opinion in 1795, which was an opinion that this Court found very important in terms of interpreting the Alien Tort Statute, the Bradford opinion had to do with an assault on the British colony in Sierra Leone. And so, it was not only extraterritorial in the sense of piracy, and I think everybody agrees that -- that this statute was intended to deal with piracy and maritime-related violations of the law of nations. It -- the Bradford opinion there said, even though U.S. criminal jurisdiction was limited, the civil jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute provided that the corporation that -- whose property was attacked within the territory of Sierra Leone --"

And so, one of the reasons that we've suggested that -- that -- that the extraterritoriality issue deserves full treatment if the Court is troubled by it, in a case where there is full briefing, because in this case it was raised by the -- by -- by the Respondents' amici largely, although the Respondents have raised it, and there -- the historians that have expressed opinions on corporate liability and others that would be interested in this question have not been able to put the other side before the Court.

I think the United States -- I think the same principle -- the United States would have wanted to do something for the French government in response to that because it would have been giving refuge to someone who had violated the law of nations.

In other words, is there a substantive norm that applied to corporations? Maybe there is; maybe there isn't. But that that's the question, as opposed to what you suggest in your brief, that really we should just think of this as a question of enforcement, which is entirely up to Federal common law.

In -- in fashioning Federal common law to decide whether there should be a common law cause of action, the ATS's reference to tort law, I think, directs the Court to domestic tort law, and the question of whether a corporation can be held liable under domestic tort law.

I want to be very clear: We're not arguing there needs to be an international adjudicated case finding a corporation liable in order for Petitioners to win, but they have failed to show anything in the conventions, the non-binding treaties engaged in by multiple nations.

But the human rights offenses here do not arise from conventions like those, which allow corporate liability. To the contrary. The human rights offenses here arise from conventions that speak to individual liability. The liability of individuals. And, Justice Breyer, in precise answer to your question about the convention on genocide, if you look to the Chevron brief on page 20 -- this is the amicus brief of Chevron filed by Professor Goldsmith. On page 20, it quotes in full the relevant passage from the genocide convention, article IV. I'm sorry. There are many briefs, but perhaps if I could read it to Your Honors, I'll read it in full. It says that \"persons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in article III shall be punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals.\" And, Justice Kagan, all the other relevant conventions also speak about natural persons. The convention against torture speaks about \"him,\" not \"it.\" And when Congress -- in the one time it implemented the conventions that are the source of the human rights offenses that are alleged here, Congress, in the Torture Victim Protection Act, said that the suit may be brought against individuals.

In answer to your question about -- earlier about respondeat superior, Justice Kagan, the only way a corporation can do anything is through the acts of human beings; thus, there's always the question, when it comes to corporate liability, to ask how to attribute the action of the human beings who work for the corporation to the corporation.

The international community at step one has rejected it. But, Justice Kennedy, it's very important that Sosa puts a second screen into your inquiry.

And as I was saying to Justice Ginsburg, in all the cases that hold, all the courts of appeals agree that who may be liable, just primary actors or also aiders and abetters, is determined by international law is a question of substance. So, we disagree with the premise. But to answer Your Honor's question, the Federal common law still should not fly in the face of Congress, and I think the important question in your hypothetical is who is the \"you\"? As Justice Scalia just pointed out, Congress could amend the ATS tomorrow to provide for a Federal common -- a Federal statutory cause of action against corporations. But the one time Congress spoke to the very question at issue here, it held the diametric opposite. Congress in the TVPA rejected corporate liability by choosing the term \"individuals\" rather than \"persons.\" And I realize, Mr. Chief Justice, that's the next case, but we think there's -- really the answer that the TVPA excludes corporations is compelled, and the U.S. agrees. So, Your Honor, the question is not what should Federal courts do in the abstract; it's what should Federal courts do when there is exact statutory decisionmaking by the political branches that has gone the other way. In maritime law, in Miles v. Apex, you didn't -- you didn't decide to go contrary to the Congress in the Jones Act; you said if there's a Jones Act statutory statement about wrongful death, we should follow it in Federal common law. Similarly here, even if the international community thought there was anything to corporate liability -- which it doesn't. It disagrees. Our two allies the U.K. and Netherlands disagree, and Germany has filed a brief saying it also disagrees with the ATS as it has been applied. Even if there was international consensus, you would still have to ask, should the Federal courts, through free-form Federal common law making, do the opposite of what Congress is saying?"

And the law of nations is uniform. It rejects corporate liability. It rejects corporate liability. So, to find a Federal common law cause of action here is to fly in the face of both the international community, with all the foreign policy consequences Justice Kennedy referred to earlier, if as Mr. -- as the Chief Justice said earlier, the point of the ATS was to stop war, by making sure there was a forum for the Marbois incident so that France wouldn't think it had to go to war on us to stop the offense to its sovereignty.

How do we deal with that incongruity?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOFFMAN",
      "speech": "Well, there are a number of -- of differences between the TVPA and -- and the Alien Tort Statute apart from that. I mean, for example, the Alien Tort Statute applies to a much broader range of international human rights violations. Congress decided to legislate in those areas for the reasons that it decided to do that. The one thing that's clear, as Justice Kagan said, is that the Torture Victim Protection Act was designed to establish or to make even stronger the Filartiga precedent and shield it from analyses that challenged its bases, and was -- was not intended to restrict the Alien Tort Statute in any way. And obviously, the next case will discuss in greater detail whether the TVPA applies to corporations or not. If -- I don't know. If I could just make a couple of additional points. If -- if it was true that international law barred corporate liability, then our friends the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have violated international law by passing legislation that imposes criminal liability on corporations for violating genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. And I think that brief makes it pretty clear that whatever they're saying, if -- if the Alien Tort Statute is a domestic enforcement of international law, then their views don't apply. And -- and this is a tort statute. That's what -- there was a meaning to torts. Skinner's case, for example, was a tort not only under English common law; it was -- it was a tort in violation of the law of nations. It was robbery on the sea. The law of nations was incorporated in English common law, just as it was in the founding in our country and, under the Paquete Habana, is still part of our land -- the law of our land. \"Tort\" meant to the founders \"tort remedies.\" It meant -- it meant that the means of enforcement would be done by the common law. That's all that was available then. It's all that's available now. And -- and international law places no restriction on the way domestic jurisdictions enforce international law. There is a general principle law of corporate civil liability for all of the things that we allege in this case. In every legal system in the world, one can get redress for this kind of thing. Countries don't necessarily call it a violation of the law of nations. They didn't fashion the statute the way our Founders did for the reasons that they did --"
