That agreement precludes Waffle House and Baker from having an action take place between them in court. But the EEOC was not a party to that agreement. Accordingly, the agreement does not preclude the EEOC's ability to bring a public enforcement action against Waffle House, nor does it limit the remedies available to the EEOC in such an action. Title VII gives the EEOC a public enforcement action that's independent of and, in many respects, superior to the individual employee's cause of action."

If you can imagine a case where an employer has retaliated against an employee and -- simply for filing a charge with the EEOC, and then that employee settles that retaliation claim for a nominal amount of money, without any judicial supervision, let's say, it may be that in that kind of case, the EEOC has a legitimate public interest in, nonetheless, bringing an action, getting some additional amount of damages to really take the employer --"

One, let me try one more time to defend the general principle, which is simply that Congress in Title VII gave the EEOC a distinct cause of action, and so the extinguishment of the individual employee's cause of action shouldn't automatically extinguish the EEOC's cause of action. But let me hone in on why I think that's so much more of a difficult case because in that case, the individuals settled their claim, so they have no claim to damages in an arbitration proceeding. And so, it might make some sense to say that the EEOC has no claim to damages in a litigation proceeding. What is so anomalous about the decision below and the rule that respondent seeks in this case is that it seeks to limit the EEOC's ability to get victim-specific remedies in court even though those victim-specific remedies are available to the employee in the arbitration. All of the cases that respondent cites --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "And I guess I do think there are two reasons why they would still have a cause of action in that situation. One is that Title VII does give the EEOC an independent cause of action. It's quite a remarkable statute in that respect. It's unlike statutes this Court has analyzed in, say, the Newport News Shipbuilder case where it specifically contrasted Title VII as being the rare statute that gives the EEOC a duplicative cause of action to the individual. The second reason, though, is that generally, as a matter of privity, res judicata principles, the reason that you hold one party in --in -- to a judgment that they didn't participate in to the consequences of that is because the party in the first action adequately represented the interests of the party that wasn't present. I --"

    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "My understanding is that the EEOC picked this case because this case -- the events here took place in 1994. So, the ADA was still quite new at the time that this -- that this case took place, and I think the EEOC was concerned that employers were not sure of what their obligations under the ADA were. So, they picked this case to litigate to help establish what employers' obligations were under the EEOC --"

I thought when the EEOC sues, then the individual has no right to come to court, that EEOC would be the exclusive litigator. And so, I think it's clear that the -- the individual employee couldn't bring a suit, a rival suit, in -- in court. Doesn't that extend to arbitration as well? I thought that the -- giving the primacy to the EEOC meant it would control this entire claim in all of its aspects, but you answered the question as though, even though the EEOC had filed, the employee could go on on a separate track."

      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "That's absolutely right. The statute gives the EEOC the exclusive right to initiate a cause of action for the first 180 days and then, for an extended period, until a right to sue letter issues. And that's why in light of the -- the congressional determination that -- that EEOC had not only a different action, but one that took primacy, that they had the right to initiate the action once they found that there was a determination that the suit would serve the public interest, it seems particularly --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Once they -- once they do initiate the action, though, the individual cannot also bring an action. Right? So, what you're saying is that the -- that the EEOC suit is independent of the individuals, but somehow the individual suit is not independent of the EEOC's."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Well, allow -- allow me to make two responses. One is it's clear that under the ADA and Title VII, it's not that the EEOC's filing of a suit simply extinguishes the individual's cause of action entirely. They -- the individual has a absolute right to intervene in the EEOC's action. So, if those actions were 100 percent duplicative, there would be no need to allow the individual to intervene in the suit."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Exactly. I -- I don't know why you think that cuts in your favor rather than against you. It seems to me the whole structure of the thing indicates that there's one cause of action. It can be brought by the EEC or by the individual, but not by both."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "No, we do not take that position. To the contrary, we think that the arbitration agreement does preclude in this case Mr. Baker from intervening in the EEOC's action.

It doesn't."

The agreement with Baker limited Baker to an arbitral forum.

    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "I think in all of those cases, the statutory scheme works effectively the same. There are independent causes of action given to the Government entity and to the individual.

Take, for example -- I mean, this Court has held that an individual can agree to arbitrate his or her civil RICO claim.

You said a second ago in -- in response or you -- you agreed with the suggestion of mine that in fact the Government can perfectly well sue independently. My question then is, why do you concede that the settlement case in which the individual settles for -- for money in lieu of damages is a harder case? Why don't you say no? It's just as easy as this is. And -- and in neither case is the agreement between the individual and the defendant binding or affecting in any way what the Government can do."

      "speech": "Okay. Let me give you three reasons why I think the settlement case is more difficult. First, there's already been some expenditure of resources in that case, either -- likely, either judicial or arbitral. Second, Title VII seems to place particular importance on the EEOC's ability to be able to initiate the action and consider the early stages of litigation. If, for whatever reason, we've gotten to the point where somebody has filed a claim and it's settled, that role has already been filled. The third reason is another particularly important function of the EEOC under Title VII is to act as a safety valve, so if for some reason the individual is not willing or able to sue, maybe out of a fear of retaliation or something, in a particular case that vindicates the public interest, the EEOC has the ability to step in and fill that gap. If there's already been a settlement --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but in each of the -- in each of the cases that you posit, even the third one, the -- the essence of the objection to your position is that an agreement has been made between the individual and the defendant. And in the case of the arbitration agreement, an agreement has been made between the individual and the defendant. And I don't see why the one class -- the one kind of agreement should be treated any differently from the other kind of agreement in determining whether the Government really is in an autonomous position."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Well, I actually think there is a reason to treat that one agreement different, which is the agreement to settle a case extinguishes any claim to relief. An arbitration agreement does not. It's simply a forum selection provision. And the anomaly of the Fourth Circuit's ruling is they take an agreement that limits Baker's access to a judicial forum, but does not limit his remedies and somehow transmogrify it into a rule that limits the EEOC's available remedies but not their access to a judicial forum."

    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Well, fair enough. But in this case, the Government did bring suit first. Baker has never arbitrated. So, that position would lead you to the conclusion that the Fourth Circuit was wrong, that the EEOC can pursue this case, seek victim-specific relief and general injunctive relief, and that it's up to you to determine whether or not Baker gets to intervene in that action. But that is -- that is certainly a result that the Government is quite happy with. It seems to me what's really sort of indefensible about the Fourth Circuit's reasoning is they take this forum selection provision and turn it into a restriction on remedies. The -- the ADA and Title VII have concurrent jurisdiction. Suppose that an employer and an employee agreed to litigate their case in State court, not Federal court. It wouldn't seem to me that that forum selection clause would bar the EEOC and bind the EEOC and limit them from bringing their public enforcement action in Federal court. It certainly wouldn't seem to me that that agreement to litigate in State court would somehow prevent the EEOC from getting victim-specific damages in Federal court if in fact there was no State court action. But -- but in principle, there's no difference between the arbitration agreement and that forum selection clause agreement that picks the State court."

And again, I suggest the example of a retaliation action. In a retaliation action, when an employer has retaliated against an employee for filing a charge with the EEOC, the EEOC clearly vindicates the public interest when it files suit to take the employer to task for the retaliation. And that's true even if the retaliation and the most effective remedies are victim- specific. In a case like that, you really need the victim-specific remedies because, after all, it is clear as day from Title VII itself that an employer can't retaliate against an employee for filing a charge. So, to simply get an injunction that says that is of somewhat limited utility. On the other hand, to get back pay, compensatory and capped punitive damages I think does vindicate the public interest."

The question, of course, is what effect does Mr. Baker's arbitration agreement have on the EEOC's litigation remedies. The Fourth Circuit correctly held that the EEOC could bring in court a claim for broad-based injunctive relief and declaratory relief. However, because Mr. Baker had agreed to arbitrate his claims, he could not seek relief in court specifically for Mr. Baker. Now, I -- I listened carefully to Mr. Clement's argument about the issue of settlement of a claim, and I must respectfully disagree with the authority and line of cases that he's citing. As a matter of fact, the position, as I understand it from Mr. Clement, is that an individual can settle a claim and then the EEOC can later sue on behalf of that individual and recover relief for that individual. And that particular principle, if that is what the EEOC is espousing today, contradicts their own policy guidance --"

So, the only point I'm making is when you've got one show that will be binding and the other that can't preclude the EEOC from litigating that basic question, whatever remedies would attach to it, doesn't it follow that the EEOC's suit must be allowed to go forward and have the question of discrimination determined in that forum?"

It doesn't involve where an EEOC charge has been filed or where there's a court case going on.

Next is the one with an arbitration agreement who doesn't enforce it. Next is the one who is in the middle of arbitration. Next is the one who has been through arbitration and gotten some money, and finally, at the far end we have a settlement. And whether each of those is appropriate, circumstances for the EEOC to proceed might differ one from the other. But certainly the arbitration case is in the middle. It's not way over at the extreme.

    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to first pick up on Justice Souter's hypothetical about the contempt proceeding. It seems to me that if that were enforced by civil compensatory contempt, rather than a criminal contempt action brought by the U.S. attorney, that he'd -- he'd have the same problem at the end of the day. Respondents invoke the proposition that the EEOC has to take the victim as we find him. The problem with that is that principle applies with respect to damages problems, like a failure to mitigate, that apply to the individual employee whether or not he arbitrates or litigates and applies equally to an EEOC enforcement action and to the individual claim. What's so unique about this is that respondent is attempting to take an agreement that does not restrict Baker's ability to get any remedy in the arbitration proceeding and turn it into a restriction on the remedies available to the EEOC in its action. The problem is, this is not, at bottom, a restriction on damages or a problem with remedies. It is a forum selection clause. And you have a statutory structure that allows two people to initiate an action. When one of those parties has signed a forum selection clause and hasn't even initiated the action, it seems that even in the general case there would be no reason to restrict the other party's access to forums or their remedies. That would seem to be a fortiori true for a statute like Title VII that gives the EEOC a right of first refusal over the initiation of the action. Another point I'd like to emphasize is that, as Justice Stevens made clear, there are currently no suits pending against employers in a situation where there has been a previous settlement. In fact, there are only 450 suits currently in the entirety of the EEOC's docket, and I think that puts this case in perspective. In the literally 99 cases out of 100, an employer's arbitration agreement will govern and the only Title VII claim that will be brought is the employee's claim in arbitration. In the 1 case out of 100, in the extreme case where there's some important public principle at stake or there's particularly egregious conduct, the EEOC's public enforcement action serves as a valuable safety valve that allows it to preserve the possibility of precedent-setting in public judicial proceedings. The third and final point I'd like to make is that whatever the answer is in the settlement context, there's absolutely no reason to take a restriction that only restricts the available forum and not the remedies and turn it into a restriction on remedies but not the forum. Here respondent seeks not only to bind the EEOC to the results of an arbitration, but to prevent the EEOC from seeking all remedies even when there hasn't been any arbitration proceeding initiated at all. For those reasons, we ask you to reverse."
