  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but that's -- that's a separate wrong. I don't know if that's a really fair answer to Justice Scalia's question. If there's retaliation, I -- I would think that's a separate component. But just suppose a case with no retaliation. The -- the employee recovers $10,000 and then the EEOC can recover $20,000 more?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, in a case like that, I'm sure as a matter of its prosecutorial discretion, the EEOC would not bring that case."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, let's say the prosecutor doesn't exercise his discretion that way that day."
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but -- but we're asking what the -- what the logical consequences of -- of your position are, and that's why we're putting the more difficult case so we can test the general proposition. And the general proposition, it seems to me, has to withstand some analysis under these more difficult instances."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, let me do -- let me make two responses. One, let me try one more time to defend the general principle, which is simply that Congress in Title VII gave the EEOC a distinct cause of action, and so the extinguishment of the individual employee's cause of action shouldn't automatically extinguish the EEOC's cause of action. But let me hone in on why I think that's so much remedies are available to the employee in the arbitration. All of the cases that respondent cites --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, here we have a case where the employee did not settle, but we were really discussing with you the possibility not presented in this case of a full settlement or a judgment in arbitration, disposing of the victim-specific relief, and asking you why then should EEOC continue to have a cause of action for the victim- specific relief, as opposed to broad injunctive relief, to address the overall problem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "And I guess I do think there are two reasons why they would still have a cause of action in that situation. One is that Title VII does give the EEOC an independent cause of action. It's quite a remarkable statute in that respect. It's unlike statutes this Court has analyzed in, say, the Newport News Shipbuilder case present. I --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, why did the EEOC decide to get into this case? Is there some sort of a pattern or practice involved that goes beyond this individual establishment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "My understanding is that the EEOC picked this case because this case -- the events here took place in 1994. So, the ADA was still quite new at the time that this -- that this case took place, and I think the EEOC was concerned that employers were not sure of what their obligations under the ADA were. So, they picked this case to litigate to help establish what employers' obligations were under the EEOC --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "This is -- this is not any broad pattern or practice. This is simply honing in on an individual case? on how we would get to the point of having a settlement after -- or an arbitral determination? I thought when the EEOC sues, then the individual has no right to come to court, that EEOC would be the exclusive litigator. And so, I think it's clear that the -- the individual employee couldn't bring a suit, a rival suit, in -- in court. Doesn't that extend to arbitration as well? I thought that the -- giving the primacy to the EEOC meant it would control this entire claim in all of its aspects, but you answered the question as though, even though the EEOC had filed, the employee could go on on a separate track."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, I had taken the import of the hypothetical as being that the individual had already sued and settled and then, only after that had taken place, that the EEOC decided to initiate a duplicative extended period, until a right to sue letter issues. And that's why in light of the -- the congressional determination that -- that EEOC had not only a different action, but one that took primacy, that they had the right to initiate the action once they found that there was a determination that the suit would serve the public interest, it seems particularly --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Once they -- once they do initiate the action, though, the individual cannot also bring an action. Right? So, what you're saying is that the -- that the EEOC suit is independent of the individuals, but somehow the individual suit is not independent of the EEOC's."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, allow -- allow me to make two responses. One is it's clear that under the ADA and Title VII, it's not that the EEOC's filing of a suit the EEC or by the individual, but not by both."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "I mean --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Not by both successfully, anyway."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "I respectfully disagree because, unlike the ADA, the ADA does not make the EEOC suit the exclusive vehicle and extinguish any cause of action or any basis to get into court for the individual. They can still intervene in the EEOC's action."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So, you're saying that if the EEOC brings an action in circumstances such as this, an individual who has agreed to arbitrate the claim can intervene and not be bound? The individual is not bound by the arbitration agreement?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "No, we do not take that position. To the contrary, we think that the arbitration agreement does preclude in this case Mr. Baker from intervening in"

    "speech": "Well, even if you disagree with me on -- on that particular point and you say that the FAA does not prevent Baker from intervening on this action, it's still true that the arbitration agreement is -- has a meaningful benefit to Waffle House because before Waffle House entered that arbitration agreement with Baker, it was subject to a suit in court by either the EEOC or brought to bear on it in -- in a suit in court? What Waffle House wants to do is to stay out of court, and that's what they're getting at when they talk about undercutting the -- the -- in effect, the arbitration agreement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",

    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "I think in all of those cases, the statutory scheme works effectively the same. There are remedy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "I -- I don't think that's necessarily true. It's certainly not going to be true in every case. And Congress specifically made all forms of relief available to the EEOC in its public enforcement action. The court below drew a distinction between equitable relief on the one hand and victim-specific relief on the other hand to avoid a perceived conflict with the FAA. But with respect, I don't think there is any conflict."
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Okay. Let me give you three reasons why I think the settlement case is more difficult. First, there's already been some expenditure of resources in that case, either -- likely, either judicial or arbitral. Second, Title VII seems to place particular importance on the EEOC's ability to be able to initiate vindicates the public interest, the EEOC has the ability to step in and fill that gap. If there's already been a settlement --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but in each of the -- in each of the cases that you posit, even the third one, the -- the essence of the objection to your position is that an agreement has been made between the individual and the defendant. And in the case of the arbitration agreement, an agreement has been made between the individual and the defendant. And I don't see why the one class -- the one kind of agreement should be treated any differently from the other kind of agreement in determining whether the Government really is in an autonomous position."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, I actually think there is a reason to treat that one agreement different, which is the agreement to settle a case extinguishes any claim to of the agreement as such."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Again, we have no -- absolutely no objection to having the agreement bind the parties to the agreement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you do say that the employee could not proceed even in the arbitral forum once the EEOC starts. It's clear in the statute that that's true as to a court action, but you I thought agreed with me that the employee, once the EEOC starts, can't go into the arbitral forum either."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Actually the EEOC is of the opinion that the -- that the individual could bring an arbitration action at that point. That is a consequence, though, of the view that they cannot intervene in the EEOC's enforcement action. I think -- I think they --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So, then the EEOC -- duplicative litigation can have of potentially conflicting results."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "That's equally, of course -- I mean, I -- I agree that there is that problem. That is equally a problem with the Fourth Circuit's rule, of course, because they said that the EEOC could be in court seeking general injunctive relief while the individual is arbitrating his claim for victim-specific relief."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "But -- but I think --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- that doesn't strike me as so terrible. I mean, that -- that's entirely understandable. You have two different types of relief being sought in two different forums."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "And -- and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What Justice Ginsburg points out is -- if the two are dependent, as the statute makes very clear they are when -- when the Government brings -- brings the suit first, barring -- barring the individual from bringing a separate suit, if the two are -- are dependent, then you don't face any of these problems."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, fair enough. But in this case, the Government did bring suit first. Baker has never arbitrated. So, that position would lead you to the conclusion that the Fourth Circuit was wrong, that the EEOC can pursue this case, seek victim-specific relief and general injunctive relief, and that it's up to you to determine whether or not Baker gets to intervene in that action. But that is -- that is certainly a result that the Government is quite happy with. It seems to me what's really sort of indefensible about the Fourth Circuit's reasoning is they litigate in State court would somehow prevent the EEOC from getting victim-specific damages in Federal court if in fact there was no State court action. But -- but in principle, there's no difference between the arbitration agreement and that forum selection clause agreement that picks the State court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Except there's a Federal Arbitration Act, and we've said it's designed to encourage arbitration of disputes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, in fairness, I don't think that the FAA embodies a self-executing preference for arbitration. The --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but -- a -- a favoring where the -- where an arbitration agreement has been entered into, as it was here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well, that's true. But I think available to the EEOC in that public enforcement action. It seems to me that at -- at bottom Title VII gives the EEOC a right to bring a public enforcement action."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The trouble is it's not a public enforcement action to the extent that it is seeking damages for this individual. To that extent, it -- it's an action that seeks to compensate this individual for the damage he has suffered. Now, that -- that has some public benefit I -- I assume, just as his own suit, should he recover, would have such -- some public benefit. But to call it a public enforcement action seems to me quite unrealistic."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "With fairness, I think that's a position that Congress rejected in Title VII itself. If Congress wanted to say that the only time that the EEOC well go for the whole ball."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But -- but to say that the portion of it that compensates the individual is essentially, you know, a vindication of the public doesn't seem to me -- doesn't seem to me reasonable. And -- and that is demonstrated by the fact that if the agency brings the suit, the individual can't because he's going to be getting his individual relief."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Again, with all respect, I disagree. I think restitution statutes reflect and vindicate the public interest, even though the restitution goes to the victim, and not the Government. It's the fact that the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If the model -- if the model is the Fair Labor Standards Act, which antedated these enforcement action. And again, I suggest the example of a retaliation action. In a retaliation action, when an employer has retaliated against an employee for filing a charge with the EEOC, the EEOC clearly vindicates the public interest when it files suit to take the employer to task for the retaliation. And that's true even if the retaliation and the most effective remedies are victim- specific. In a case like that, you really need the victim-specific remedies because, after all, it is clear as day from Title VII itself that an employer can't retaliate against an employee for filing a charge. So, to simply get an injunction that says that is of somewhat limited utility. On the other hand, to get back pay, compensatory and capped punitive damages I think does vindicate the public interest.  statement in that case that I think was just meant to reflect a general principle that parties to a litigation can't, through a settlement, bind a non-party to the litigation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but that was because the other parties had their own injury of a pecuniary nature, as I recall the case. I -- I don't see the case cited."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "As a practical matter, how often does the EEOC seek victim-specific relief in the form of monetary damages after there's been a settlement between the victim and the other side?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "I'm actually aware of no case where that's happened."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "This is all a hypothetical."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "This is all hypothetical. And what we're concerned about is a case like this one where "
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORDON",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The answer to the question presented today is found in the broad terms and policies of the Federal Arbitration Act. The question, of course, is what effect does Mr. Baker's arbitration agreement have on the EEOC's litigation remedies. The Fourth Circuit correctly held that the EEOC could bring in court a claim for broad-based injunctive relief and declaratory relief. However, because Mr. Baker had agreed to arbitrate his claims, he could not seek relief in court specifically for Mr. Baker. Now, I -- I listened carefully to Mr. Clement's argument about the issue of settlement of a claim, and I must respectfully disagree with the authority and line of cases that he's citing. As a matter of fact, the Is that right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORDON",
    "speech": "Well, perhaps I perceived it differently, Your Honor. But I -- I do think that from our position it's very important for the Court to understand that the cases are almost uniform for the proposition that if an individual settles a case --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Gordon, but that's so highly hypothetical because the likelihood that the employee would have proceeded -- if the EEOC in the beginning is the only one who can bring an action in court, EEOC brings an action. Now, even if it's limited only to injunctive relief, isn't it clear that the basic finding of fact, was there discrimination, has to be made for any kind of relief. And are you going to permit a viable set of proceedings to determine that question? to wait for the EEOC to --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, because one of them has power to bind the other. Does it not? I mean, suppose the EEOC proceeds and there is a finding that discrimination, unlawful under the statute, occurred. That would be binding on the employer in any other forum, wouldn't it be?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORDON",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, it should be, but the EEOC doesn't take that position, as I understand it. As I understand their position, whatever happens in their court proceeding is an independent action and that Mr. Baker really doesn't have any control over. And they're doing their own thing in court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But we're not talking about Mr. Baker. We're talking about the employer who has been found to have been a discriminator. That would have issue wasn't party to that litigation. Am I right about that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORDON",
    "speech": "Well, I would have to disagree with you on that because I believe that in the arbitration, if there were -- an adjudication was made as to Mr. Baker and in -- as in this particular case -- if I may use this case as the example, in this particular case, Mr. Baker is the only game in town here. The EEOC is seeking relief solely on behalf of Mr. Baker. All damages will go to Mr. Baker."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let's -- let's cut out the relief aspect of it and again concentrate on the issue, was there discrimination or not, as to which there might be injunctive remedies. If Mr. -- Mr. Baker loses on that, that can't preclude the EEOC from getting the determination, was there discrimination. So, the only point I'm making is when you've got one show that will be binding and the other that can't rule, can go forward and have the claims for broad-based injunctive relief heard there. And I -- I must say that there may be separate issues being litigated in that EEOC court proceeding because --"

And the EEOC says, I don't care Didn't Congress set this statute up so that it is more is involved than a simple tort action or a simple contract action? There's a public policy in the United States against this kind of discrimination embodied in many laws, and this is one of those laws."

The EEOC in these cases takes its employee as it finds it, and in this particular case, the employee has an arbitration agreement. And individual conduct can limit the ability of the EEOC to seek remedies in a case. It happens in a from choosing its forum? The same question with respect to suppose it had been a State human rights commission that is going into the State court, and the employer says, no, State human rights commission, you can't do that because this employee has signed an agreement to arbitrate."

And to allow parties to come up with ways to get around these agreements completely undercuts the Federal Arbitration Act. And I -- I would disagree with your premise, if I -- if I may, respectfully, that arbitration is a forum selection clause. It's a lot more than that. It is a -- than the Federal court would apply, are you?"

    "speech": "That's true, Your Honor, but -- but still if we -- if we go forward with the rule that's proposed by the EEOC, in -- in my view we will be flying in the face of the Court's decisions in Gilmer, the Court's decision in Circuit City, the plain text of the Federal Arbitration Act. We will be discouraging rather than encouraging arbitration, and --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. -- Mr. Gordon, I assume that giving up the whole cause of action is the greater and giving up the forum is the lesser. Isn't your response -- and let's -- let's take the more general -- general example where there -- there hasn't been a claim filed and where an individual is having a dispute with his employer. And the employer says, I will give you $300 in exchange for a -- a settlement agreement, a release of all claims. It doesn't involve where an EEOC charge has been filed or where there's a court case going on. The EEOC and the courts take the position that that particular scenario would preclude it from later seeking relief on behalf of that individual in court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why is this greater? You agreed that this is a -- this is the greater, the arbitration. The way I'm seeing it, which you can correct, is that the word in the statute is appropriate relief, and that there's a spectrum. On the one hand, we have the indifferent employee. Next is the one with an arbitration analysis, if -- if I may. I have to revert to the fact that -- that the individual signed the agreement to arbitrate. Once signing that agreement to arbitrate, then he must pursue his individual claims in that forum and he cannot hand off the ball to the EEOC and have the EEOC do for him what he cannot do for himself, which is get individual relief in court. That was the bargain that Waffle House made with this employee."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

Somebody quite apart from this proceeding will come forward and say, I'm one of them. You've got to rehire me. Can the injunction injunction to rehire those who were improperly fired could be enforced in -- in court. In other words, there's an injunction and a court that issued the injunction can enforce it.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORDON",
    "speech": "Well, it could, Your Honor. In court a determination such as that could be made that these individuals have been discriminated against and therefore remedies are available to them. But the actual determination of the remedies must be made in arbitration arbitration."

And let's assume that the employee who claims that -- that he is the subject of that violation has also signed an arbitration agreement. Does it have to go to arbitration? to a particular individual is awarded in arbitration. Assuming that relief was awarded, then that would probably end the participation of the arbitrator at that point."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The contempt action wouldn't be brought by either the EEOC or -- or the individual, I assume. It would be brought by the United States attorney or, as we have said, some attorney appointed by the court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORDON",
    "speech": "Your Honor, the Court -- the Court should not allow -- and I think this is the central -- central theme of -- of our argument here. The Court should not allow the EEOC and its charging party who comes to it with an arbitration agreement to frustrate the purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act by making this end run around the agreement. Mr. Baker entered into a private agreement with Waffle House to resolve any disputes he has arising out of his employment. The Act would always take primacy, I think you -- you put it. But the notion that the EEOC ought to be running these discrimination actions -- they are the main show, and then the individual actions can supplement that. But -- but you couldn't have that model effected under your view of it because the arbitration agreement could always come in and interfere with it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORDON",
    "speech": "Well, I think we should -- should take account of what the EEO still is able to do under the Fourth Circuit's rule. The EEOC is still able to effectuate the public interest by seeking broad-based injunctive relief. The EEOC is still able to get an injunction telling an employer that you are to certain things with the way you run your business. The EEOC still has the opportunity to tell an employer that you must report back to us on a regular basis to tell us how you're arbitration agreement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORDON",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor. It could -- it could file its own action for broad-based injunctive relief if it wished."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that's fine. It says that policy is reflected in this one instance, and -- and it's the same instance that's -- that's before arbitration. What happens?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Gordon. Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to first pick up on Justice Souter's hypothetical about the contempt proceeding. It seems to me that if that were enforced by civil compensatory contempt, rather than a criminal contempt action brought by the U.S. attorney, that he'd -- he'd have the same problem at the end of the day. Respondents invoke the proposition that the EEOC has to take the victim as we find him. The problem with that is that principle applies with respect to damages problems, like a failure to mitigate, that apply to the individual employee whether or not he arbitrates or a forum selection clause. And you have a statutory structure that allows two people to initiate an action. When one of those parties has signed a forum selection clause and hasn't even initiated the action, it seems that even in the general case there would be no reason to restrict the other party's access to forums or their remedies. That would seem to be a fortiori true for a statute like Title VII that gives the EEOC a right of first refusal over the initiation of the action. Another point I'd like to emphasize is that, as Justice Stevens made clear, there are currently no suits pending against employers in a situation where there has been a previous settlement. In fact, there are only 450 suits currently in the entirety of the EEOC's docket, and I think that puts this case in perspective. In the literally 99 cases out of 100, an employer's arbitration that whatever the answer is in the settlement context, there's absolutely no reason to take a restriction that only restricts the available forum and not the remedies and turn it into a restriction on remedies but not the forum. Here respondent seeks not only to bind the EEOC to the results of an arbitration, but to prevent the EEOC from seeking all remedies even when there hasn't been any arbitration proceeding initiated at all. For those reasons, we ask you to reverse."
