    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1997, this Court recognized that there is an asbestos litigation crisis confronting the Nation, and nothing in the last five years has -- done anything other than to show that that crisis is more acute now than at any other time in our history. The Rand Corporation in a report just two months ago concluded that there are now 6,000 defendants confronted with asbestos litigation claims, that the estimated value of those claims in litigation costs exceeds $200 billion. The six plaintiffs who are involved in this case, the respondents here today, are emblematic of at least a fundamental element of the problem that confronts asbestos litigation. Each of them received close to, and in some instances more than a million dollars in compensatory damages for claims of asbestosis. The basis for their claim, the primary basis for their claim was that they confronted a fear of cancer. Asbestosis does not convert into cancer --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How do we know that? I mean, I notice that the awards there seem to grow with age, and they don't seem to vary depending upon smoking. I mean, they're inversely related to age, they don't seem to be affected by smoking, and that suggested to me that maybe it didn't play a major part, this fear of cancer. How do we know that it played a major part?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, there is a legal answer and there is a factual answer. The legal answer is that you have to assume it because the jury was instructed to include it as an element, and under West Virginia law, it is absolutely settled and respondents don't contest it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but that, the fact that it's one element doesn't mean it's the primary element, does it? They did all suffer physical impairment as a result of the asbestosis itself, did they not?"

    "speech": "They all suffered asbestosis, and they all suffered some physical elements of it."

    "speech": "I don't know that it's not the primary ingredient, Justice Stevens. What I do know is that as a matter of law, you can't ignore the fact that the -- that fear of cancer was put before the jury as a significant component of the plaintiff's case in chief, that the jury was instructed to include that, and that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, I think the record supports it in the sense that we know that these are asbestosis claims that even the respondents' expert testified were mild, for the most part. One or two differences about that, but these are still relatively mild asbestosis claims, and mild asbestosis claims do not typically generate million-dollar damages awards --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Did the defendant --"

  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "-- particularly where there's no cost of medical care as part of the component."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Phillips, did the defendant attempt to test this by seeking a special verdict so that the damages could be broken down by the jury? This was a general verdict, so we don't know how much they gave for anything."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But they could have -- if they tested this, isolated this, and then we'd know how much was actually allocated, whether it was as he initially said the primary, or whether it was a lesser thing. We just don't know."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Oh, and that's because it's the plaintiff's burden. If they didn't want to have -- if they didn't want to take the risk of a general verdict being set aside because there's an element of damages that's included that the court ultimately decides should be excluded as a matter of law, they then bear the risk and the burden of having the case sent back for a new trial."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Oh, but the relevance of this, I think your overall point, in my mind, is that the other side would say, I think they do say that this is a case in which there was an impact, and as a result of the impact -- the thickening of the lungs -- the person does have a fear of getting cancer greater than most people, that that's -- entitles them under traditional law to some damages, and where you can get a special verdict, it's easy to see, if the jury has awarded too much damage for that, in which case you get a reversal under -- you get a reversal if they give too much for it, and -- so what's the problem here that has anything to do with there being 6,000 plaintiffs and enormous damage and problems overall?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, the problem's easy to identify, that is that if the instruction is that everyone who suffers a diagnosed case of asbestosis is entitled to go to the jury on fear of cancer claims, then the amount of damages that will be generated as a consequence of that will run completely out of sync --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why would it? Why -- maybe they're entitled to some fear. A person who has no problem in the world has a 1 in 4 chance of dying in cancer. A person who's subjected to asbestos may have a 1 in 3 chance."

    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Phillips, under West Virginia practice, is it -- if a plaintiff or a defendant requests a special verdict, is it automatically allowed, or is it in the discretion of the trial court?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "It's in the discretion of the trial court, and it is also clear under West Virginia law that if two theories are put before the jury with respect to damages and one of them is impermissible, the answer is you strike down and you get a new trial on damages, so that's -- that's clear. And I don't -- I don't hear the respondents as arguing anything to the contrary."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Phillips, do we look at this case as one of a claim for traditional pain and suffering damages? Is that how we should view it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "No. This Court said in Gottshall that pain and suffering damages are describable as sensations stemming directly from a physical injury or condition. The physical injury that -- that's identified here is asbestosis, and to be sure, the pain and suffering that an asbestotic would be allowed to recover for might be a fear of shortness of breath or other symptoms that arise out of asbestosis, but the notion that cancer that doesn't exist currently, may never take place, stems from the existence of asbestosis is not a fair application of that rule of law, particularly when there is no evidence, and again, I don't think respondents challenge this, that asbestosis does not cause cancer, it does not lead to cancer."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But, it sounds like you want us to say there is some limitation on the availability of pain and suffering damages in the context of an asbestosis case."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, I think it's the respondents who are asking you to do something different with a pain and suffering case, and actually I'm not even sure that's a fair way to characterize the respondents' argument. I don't understand them to be arguing that this is a classic pain and suffering --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I'm trying to find out what you're arguing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Right, and my argument is, this is not under any circumstances the kind of pain and suffering that we traditionally think of. It's not something that emanates directly out of the existing 0 injury. Second, it's not negligent infliction of emotional distress, and it's not emotional injury as a component of a negligence claim."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, what was it -- was the case presented as a separate claim for negligently-caused emotional distress?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "No. It was --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No. It was a pain and suffering argument. That's what it was, wasn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, it wasn't clear exactly what it was until the jury -- until we got to the jury instructions. At that point, the trial judge did say, I view these as pain and suffering."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "As pain and suffering."

    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Yes."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I mean, I thought that's what we were confronting here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, except that the traditional standard for pain and suffering doesn't permit the kind of disconnect between the fear of cancer that you're talking about here and asbestosis. You normally associate pain and suffering as sensations that emanate directly from the injury itself, and fear of cancer doesn't emanate at all from asbestosis."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it can include fright. 1"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is it conceded -- I think you said it was conceded, but is it conceded that fear of cancer does not emanate from asbestosis? If it's clear that you have a greater risk of cancer if you have contracted asbestosis, why isn't the fear connected to the asbestosis?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, it's interesting, you know, the testimony itself was simply, do you have a fear because of exposure to asbestos now that you have asbestosis. They didn't even ask the question whether the fear arises out of the asbestosis."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Did you ask questions about the causation theory that you're now espousing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "No. Our argument, Justice Souter, was that fear of cancer is too unrelated, as a matter of law, to be an element of pain and suffering."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay, but I take it your argument is that the mere fact that there is an association between asbestosis and a higher risk of developing cancer, depending on whether you smoke and so on, is not enough of an association to support a -- in effect, a separate element of damages for fear of cancer? 2"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What is your authority for that? In other words, you're saying there's got to be some kind of a different, or more intense causal relationship than simply this association that can statistically be shown."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",

    "speech": "What's the basis for that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Buckley, frankly, is as close to anything on that score, because Buckley says even if you accept as an article of faith, as I think the Court did, that each of those individuals who'd been exposed to asbestos felt that he or she would be more seriously at risk --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "No."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- they didn't, and the point here is that there is proof of asbestosis, and there is a statistical showing that you don't deny, I think, of a higher degree of risk, what -- however the causal chain works -- which associates asbestosis with fear of cancer, so this is not a Buckley situation, and my question is, why isn't that statistical association sufficient to ground an instruction allowing for compensation for fear 3 that results from this association?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "There are two answers to that, Justice Souter. In the first place, the -- there is no strong common law doctrine that says that those -- that that kind of a disconnect between the damages is a core element of what the common law routinely grants for --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you call it disconnect, he calls it a connect. What it is, there is, I take it, an undenied statistical association between asbestosis and a probability of developing cancer --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- and that's the basis for the claim of the fear. Why is that inconsistent with a common law theory of pain and suffering damages?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, the core of the pain and suffering -- the pain and suffering theory is that it is a fright that emanates directly out of the particular condition you have, which is asbestosis."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right, if you want to use that kind of terminology, I don't see why you haven't got it here. The reason these people are worried is that they've got asbestosis, and people with asbestosis have a higher chance of developing cancer. Isn't that enough out of, in your terms?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "No. Even if you accept that 4 premise, Justice Souter, you still have to confront the overall policies of the Federal Employers Liability Act, and the question of whether not allowing a recovery that might otherwise be legitimate -- and that is precisely what the Court said --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So, are you saying that even if the common law allowed it, we should not allow it under the act, or the act doesn't allow it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, I don't think the common law clearly allows it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay. Have you got any authority for that proposition --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "No, because --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- that an association between these two conditions is insufficient to support a damage award?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "There are lower court -- we cite the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions, the Eleventh Circuit decisions -- there are decisions out there that have said we're not going to allow fear of cancer in cases involving asbestosis, but I --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, there does appear to be a minority of jurisdictions that have said -- and have held -- that you have to show as a plaintiff in a case like this a verifiable causal nexus between cancer and the injury suffered in cases where you're dealing with 5 exposure to a hazardous material. That -- maybe that's a reasonable requirement, but it appears to be a minority view. Are you suggesting that we should adopt that here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, I'm not asking you to -- I don't think the answer to this case resides in the common law, because I think the common law is essentially a muddle. There are cases on both sides."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, are you -- do you think we should adopt an interpretation of FELA that says there has to be some verifiable causal nexus?"

    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Absolutely, Justice O'Connor, and the reason to do that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Do you acknowledge that that is a view that is generally a minority view in the country?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "I -- I -- I'll concede that it is a minority view in the sense that there are maybe five cases on one side --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "This is not an area that's been litigated sufficiently to be able to say where the trends are."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It may make sense, but I just want to 6 know where we are here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Right. Well, I've only got two or three cases that identify it in the context -- the way you just did, Justice O'Connor, and my colleague on the other side will identify four or five cases that don't impose that requirement, but what remains absolutely critical in the analysis of this case, I think, is the core policy that this Court identified in Gottshall and in Buckley that says if you don't have a clear answer from the common law, you have to look to see whether or not this particular damages remedy creates the possibility of unpredictable and unlimited damages, and that's the reason why the Court needs to adopt a more restrictive view of the standard to be applied under the Federal Employers Liability Act. That may not be the rule that would be required as a matter of common law in any particular State, but under FELA, the notion that you're going to create unlimited liability in circumstances in which the plaintiffs are allowed significantly reduced requirements in order to prove the basis for their claim suggests that this Court has consistently taken the position that it must cut back and not allow on a category basis -- on a categorical basis -- not allow damages to extend to --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But what -- I mean, what -- unlimited 7 damages, I don't know what you want us to do. What if the statistical chance of your getting cancer if you have asbestosis is -- is your chances are doubled. Would that be enough to create the kind of a fear that we could allow damages for it?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "I think when you get past more likely than not that you will incur cancer, there is a risk, then at that point -- but remember, the flip side of this is the two-disease rule, and that's an important element in how the Court ought to analyze this problem, because not only -- by allowing fear of cancer damages now, you essentially say to the world, the sky is the limit, inconsistent with what the Court said in Gottshall and Buckley. The flip side is, if you don't allow the fear of cancer damages now, but allow fear of -- but allow the 8 plaintiff to come back after he or she contracts cancer and allows as a part of that recovery for fear of cancer, then the people who are most seriously injured are made whole at the appropriate time in the appropriate circumstances."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, the quick answer on apportionment is that in 1908, it was absolutely clear there was several liability. You're only liable for the injuries you cause. That's embodied, I think, in the statutory language that says that the railroad is responsible for the injuries while employed. That language has been interpreted as recognizing we only pay for the things that we cause. The Third Restatement --"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Cause in whole or in part?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It could be read to say that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "It could, but I don't think that's the most natural reading of that particular language, and I don't think it's an appropriate one where the policies in 1908, and the policies of the law under the Third Restatement quite clearly say that you should apportion, because that is the fair way in order to ensure that a defendant is not -- does not -- is not forced to overcompensate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's really a question of who should bear the burden of bringing in those other people. If it's joint and several, you could join other people. On your view, you say to the plaintiff, \"Unless, plaintiff, you bring in all these other people, you can only get a small piece from any particular one.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Right, and I think the statute and the existing common law clearly suggest that the right answer is that because you've reduced the burden of the plaintiff in order to get into court and to be able to make a case, the quid pro quo for that ought to be that you only hold the railroad liable for the amount of the injury it caused, and here it is not contested that -- and Mr. Butler's case is the prototype example of it -- he had three months of exposure when he was with Norfolk & Western, he had 30 years of exposure with others. That is a reasonable basis on which to apportion for cause, and that -- and no one has contested that. I'd reserve the balance of my time."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SALMONS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I do think that the respondents have taken that position in this case. On page 20 of their brief, they say that the relationship between asbestosis and cancer is two-fold. First, the asbestosis confirms the extent and severity of the initial exposure to asbestos which, of course, under Buckley is not a separate injury or impact that can give rise to liability under FELA, and second, that they both -- both the cancer and the asbestosis would result from the same negligent conduct of the defendant, but I do not read respondents to be alleging in this Court that there is any causal relationship between cancer and asbestosis in terms of asbestosis actually turning into cancer. There may be a correlation, but you know, that -- the reasonableness of the fears is really not the question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The question I had is, if there is a causal correlation, if 50 percent of the people who have contracted asbestosis as a result of exposure to asbestos will also contract cancer, why does that matter? That's what I didn't quite see."

    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. I think that in terms of -- of the existing tort law principles that, as this Court noted in Gottshall, and even prior to that around the time of the enactment of FELA, that pain and suffering damages are limited to those damages that flow directly from the injury that allows you to sue, and that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But both of those cases were a self- standing claim of emotional distress. It wasn't pinned to any existing injuries. Here, the difference, and at least as portrayed by the judge who made it part of pain and suffering, is you do have an injury, you have the asbestosis, and one of the elements of damages is pain and suffering, and this is included in pain and suffering. At least that's the way the judge saw it, as distinguished from Buckley and Gottshall, which were self-standing claims of emotional distress not tied to any preexisting injury."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SALMONS",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, that is the way the court below approached the question. We think the problem with that is that, as the overwhelming majority of courts that have considered the issue of the relationship between the diseases have concluded, they are separate diseases that result in separate injuries and separate causes of action, and the test of FELA --"

    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- when does the statute of limitations start to run when you get the virulent form of cancer? Does it begin to run when you got the asbestosis, because that should have tipped you off and you should have sued then? The answer in that context, and there are many courts that say that cancer is a separate claim, is not necessarily what it should be in this context."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SALMONS",
    "speech": "We do think it is instructive, however, Your Honor, and that's particularly true because FELA provides for liability -- to any person suffering injury while employed -- for such injury, and we think, consistent with the text of that statute, which limits the employer's liability to the injury that's actually suffered, and not the fear of suffering a future -- injury in the future -- that the rule we are propounding today is the most consistent with that text and the most consistent with the purposes and -- and policy considerations this Court articulated in both Gottshall and Buckley, and in particular --"

    "speech": "You did say -- you said in your brief that it's a question of not whether, but when, because when you get cancer, if you get cancer, you get the damages for past, present, and future pain and suffering, but that's not quite right, is it, because you are leaving out the category of person who has asbestosis and never gets cancer, which will be most of these people? Those people -- for them, it is a question of whether, not when, right?"
  },

The Court -- this Court did not say, though, their fears were not reasonable. In fact, the court of appeals in that case had found that they were. What this Court said was, they didn't fit within the common law categories that allowed recovery because the exposure itself was not an impact or injury, and our position is that while the asbestosis gives them an ability to sue for their injuries related to that asbestosis, they cannot reach back to that initial exposure and recover the damages that were precluded in Buckley, namely --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But here -- here we've got something more. We've got the proof that this is a serious risk, and that proof consists of the fact that asbestosis has, in fact, developed."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I know that that's your position, but once we cross that threshold, as we have in this case -- the threshold that shows that the fear is, in fact, a serious one, because at least asbestosis has now developed, why isn't their fear of cancer just as reasonable whether that fear rests upon the fact that in 10 percent of asbestosis cases, the asbestosis progresses to cancer -- which isn't true -- or, on the other hand, in the same percentage of asbestosis cases, cancer will also develop as a result of the common cause for which the employer is liable? Why is the fear any less reasonable in either of those cases?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SALMONS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, with respect, we don't think the question is whether their fears are reasonable, but their question is whether their fears are recoverable at this time."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I know that, and one of the questions we want to know in determining whether recovery is possible is whether the fear is reasonable."

    "speech": "And we do not --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "One threshold test that we all agree on is, the fear has at least got to be confirmed by some physical manifestation. Okay, we've got this here. Once the physical manifestation is shown, why is reasonable fear -- why should reasonable fear -- not be enough for recovery, whether the causal connection goes from asbestosis to cancer, or common cause to cancer?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SALMONS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, we think that one of the primary reasons why it should not be enough -- that reasonableness of the fear should not be enough in and of itself -- even assuming for a moment that the statistics that are at -- that were in evidence here are, in fact, sufficiently conclusive to draw those assumptions -- I mean, I do think it's important to remember that this Court in Buckley referred to these same types of figures as being uncertain and controversial, and I think that that description is probably still true here. But the purposes and policies of FELA, which this Court recognized in Buckley, and in particular the fear that plaintiffs with relatively minor injuries now will come into court being drawn by the opportunity to get front-loaded, significant damages for future harms, will end up frustrating the system, and will end up hurting the plaintiffs that in fact develop cancer later, and I think that this case implicates those policies and concerns of FELA and tort law generally just as much as was the case in Buckley, that the vast majority, the number of people that will actually get cancer in the future is relatively low, and there is a significant risk --"

Tort law, as this Court explained in the Metro- North case, approaches the recovery for emotional distress injury from a categorical perspective, and tort law categorically distinguishes between two different situations. First, the situation where one has a stand- alone claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress where the emotional injury itself the element of the offense, the injury element, and second, the so-called parasitic damage context, where there is a threshold physical injury which supplies the essential element, and what many courts do is they impose very significant limitations on the recovery of emotional distress in the stand-alone context such as physical manifestations, immediacy, and severity, but --"

If you look at the jury instruction very closely on page 573, the trial judge in this case was very careful, knew exactly what he was doing. In the paragraph right before the \"fear of cancer\" paragraph, he refers to the entitlement of a physically injured plaintiff to recover for physical and mental pain and suffering. In the next paragraph, where he refers to reasonable fear of cancer, he refers only to mental pain and suffering, and this is a longstanding distinction in tort law. Physical pain and suffering is the kind of pain which is immediate and intimately associated with the bodily injury."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Well, actually, it may well be more, but let's put that aside. What is quite clear, Your Honor, as this Court explained in the Metro-North case, is that just because there are background risks, that doesn't mean that one can't have a reasonable apprehension based on an increased risk. For instance, it is 100 percent sure, Your Honor, that every one of us in this room will die. We have a background risk. But the fact that someone through negligent conduct causes us a physical injury which increases our risk of dying sooner does not mean we can recover for that. And the place to look in the Restatement of Torts, Your Honor, to see that this is a classic thing that one can recover for, if you look to section 456, you look to comment c, and then it referenced comment -- it referenced Restatement section 905, and Restatement -- and it says that when you have a physical injury, then it triggers the whole panoply of emotional distress injuries, and section 905 of the Restatement of Torts describes what is encompassed by \"emotional distress,\" and comment e describes how it goes, as always, to fear, anxiety, apprehension of future consequences."

I don't think, though, in this case, first of all, that there's any question that statistics support a reasonable apprehension, but even more importantly, the question whether they do or don't in this case is not one of the issues here.

Here are two people, the person in Buckley, the snowman, and the person who has asbestosis, both of those people may have a real fear of cancer, and we may find them credible witnesses. I thought in the Buckley situation that one concern is, it's too easy to make this up, and for some people facing that risk, they'll say, \"Well, yeah, I might be run over tomorrow, it doesn't bother me.\" Isn't the real problem that the fear of something, when that fear doesn't have the physical manifestation, that these things are too easy to make up, too uncontrollable, and I frankly can't see the difference from the point of view of a sufferer between the person in Buckley and the person here.

You're not adding new cases to the docket, and even more importantly, as the court has --"

We actually think both of those are met, and that is, we think that the fear is caused by the physical injury. It's also caused by the same negligent conduct, but that is also a sufficiency of the evidence question, and what they are positing here is what the legal standard should be for physically injured plaintiffs and the recovery for related emotional stress harm. An example, the Anderson case they cite on page 2 of their reply brief -- a radiation burn case -- which they say is distinct from this case. It's exactly the same as this case."

But if, when I look at all this stuff again, and I come to the conclusion -- if I were to come to the conclusion that it wasn't cut-and-dried, then I'm much more at sea, and I want you to see why. One was the reason I gave, which is the risk problems, and the other, which is driving that, and I'd just like you to comment on this, is -- is my concern that if we begin to compensate people for fear of small changes in risks when the law doesn't -- is open on the point -- what will happen in the asbestos cases, and that was their initial point, is that we will -- there's $200 billion at stake, and the fund will run dry. When the people who really get the cancer come into court, the cupboard will be bare, and I think that's a serious policy problem, and it's worrying me quite a lot, and that's why I keep coming back to the open nature of this."

All one has to assume here is that there was sufficient evidence that a reasonable jury could give some money based on fear of cancer, not that they had to, and not, certainly, that they gave $4.4 million, just sufficient evidence that a reasonable jury could have given a dollar, or some money. That's all that would be necessary. The second -- sorry."

    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. There is -- there's lots of record evidence in this case to establish the asbestosis and how there may have been different degrees of asbestosis."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right, and since that's dependent on dosage, why isn't this a case in which we can apportion causation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, for very simple a reason. The first reason is that we think that FELA itself on its face actually directs there to be joint and several liability when you have single injuries. That's our first argument, that FELA on its face answers the question, or that FELA provides that the railroad should be liable, quote, \"for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of the railroad.\""
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Your Honor --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- or am I wrong about that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "No. The background principle of the common law of torts here is that there are -- if there is a single injury, then there is joint and several liability unless there's a reasonable basis for apportionment. Our threshold argument --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And since asbestosis is peculiarly related to dosage and exposure, why isn't that a proper ground for apportionment here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Assuming that FELA doesn't answer the question, let me answer it based upon the common law. Because the plaintiff has the burden -- sorry, the defendant -- petitioner has the burden in that case to establish 1) what the doses were, and 2) what the dose relationship was, and the one thing we know here, the prototype example that Mr. Phillips referred to is Mr. Butler, and the fact is that Mr. Butler apparently worked for three months exposed to asbestos for petitioner, and for many, many years exposed to asbestos at other workplaces. While we don't know what the dose relationship is, Your Honor, we do know for the record the one thing the dose relationship isn't is time. One can't compare one time to another. Let me tell you why we know that. On page 420 of the joint appendix, their expert testified that one is far more likely to contract asbestosis from high concentrations over a short period of time than low concentrations over a long period of time, and there's a reason for that. As Dr. Brody explains on page 87 of the joint appendix, the lungs can naturally rid themselves of the fibers at the low concentrations. It's only at the high concentrations -- the macrophages. It's only at the high concentrations that the lungs can't rid themselves of the fibers. While we have no idea how low the concentration levels were at these other workplaces, we do know how high the concentrations levels were at petitioner's workplace, because Mr. Butler testified on page 249 of the joint appendix that during those three months, he worked in the location of petitioner's workplace where the asbestos concentrations were at the highest. Mr. Butler testified that he worked in the room where the engines were stripped of their fibers, and more fibers were placed on. He testifies on page 249 he looks at these same pictures, which were trial exhibits -- they're reproduced in our brief. He looks at these pictures and he says, yes, that's the kind of room I worked in. This is 249 and 250. Yes, that's the kind of exposure I faced."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "So we know he had the very high concentrations --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well now, how do we know that? You're saying he worked in the place with the highest concentrations so far as the railroad is concerned, but how do we know how that compares with where he worked elsewhere?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, we have no idea, and they -- because they never introduced or sought to introduce any evidence, but what we do know is that very low concentrations -- here we can turn to the Rand report, which they filed with this Court -- lodged with the Court --just two weeks ago. The Rand report and the testimony of this case makes absolutely clear that in low concentration employment centers, at low concentration exposures, one is very unlikely to have any kind of physical injury, asbestosis or cancer ever develop, which is why there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of plaintiffs, many of which come from low exposure, which, as the Rand report makes clear, is not likely to lead to any kind of disease. We have no idea how low it was here. We know how high it was here. I have no doubt, Your Honor, that petitioner would have been very hard-pressed at trial to actually show what the doses were, and to show what the dose relationship is, but what I do know is, whatever their reason was at trial for never trying to introduce this evidence, and they never -- if you looked at their motion, where they made the motion for this jury instruction, they never even remotely suggest what the basis for apportionment would be, but whatever their strategic reason for doing that at trial, what is absolutely clear is they are not allowed in the first instance to come to the United States Supreme Court and proffer newspaper articles, magazine articles, selected journal articles and try to argue that there is a reasonable basis for apportionment, or they're entitled to a remand to litigate a issue which they failed to litigate in the first instance. The simple truth, Your Honor, is that at trial in this case the respondents established all of their essential elements of their negligent cause of action. They established their physical injury, and they received a jury award which certainly, compared to the jury awards that I see mentioned in the amicus briefs, is a jury award which seems relatively modest, and certainly a jury award which on its face doesn't suggest that there was some outrageous amount given for reasonable fear of cancer."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I'm not -- they never offer a basis of apportionment. We'd have to know, and the evidence at trial made clear, to know the dose and dose relationship you'd have to know the air flow rates, the pathways of exposure --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, they were not denied this opportunity at trial to introduce the evidence with respect to the non-railroad employment, and you can see that because they actually did do some cross-examination, they did try to introduce the evidence of three months, they did try to refer to the other workplaces, they could have tried to introduce more evidence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, why was that relevant if there's joint liability?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Well, we thought it was irrelevant, Your Honor, but they were clearly thinking about the possibility of requesting an apportionment instruction, but the fact is, they never laid out a reasonable basis. If you look at the memorandum --"

  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So the point was preserved."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Right, but the trial court was correct in denying the instruction because they had not met their burden of proffering a reasonable basis for apportionment, and in the absence of that evidentiary basis, the trial court was absolutely correct in denying it. This was a jury verdict, Your Honor, this was reached."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Oh, but that theory, then, is that several liability would have been appropriate if the evidence were sufficient?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Well, no, Your Honor. Our threshold argument is that it would not -- asbestosis, this is a classic individual injury. There are many courts who have talked about this, and they said, well, in theory, asbestosis is dose-related."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "With respect, Mr. Lazarus, isn't your -- the bottom line in this argument that this is simply not an issue in the case, because they didn't provide a basis?"

    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "Well, but it's quite --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAZARUS",
    "speech": "There's some evidence as to that, but in fact if you can look to their instruction they don't even say what -- that time is the relevant factor, and I think the evidence at trial shows that time is not even close to establishing what the dose relationship would be. This is very complicated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But aren't you really saying that unless there's an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in refusing to send this to the jury, based on what you've just described, insufficiency of evidence on their part, that it's not in the case for us?"

We put in an instruction on apportionment based on a reasonable basis following Justice Kennedy's analysis of the law, which says if there's a reasonable basis to apportion, you do that. The trial judge did not reject that on the basis of insufficient evidence. What he said at page 179, volume 9 of the transcript is, if you've got a joint tort­ feasor, that tort-feasor is liable for all of the injuries. He said it as a matter of law. It's joint and several liability. There is no apportionment. That's the ruling we challenged. That's the legal issue before this Court. The second question, then, with your leave, is to --"

    "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
    "speech": "Well, Dean Prosser said from day one it's always going to be difficult to apportion, but that's no reason not to have the jury undertake to apportion. There are lots of decisions that juries make that are very hard to make, but the better rule is to apportion, because that's the fair outcome that will arise in these cases. With respect to the fear of cancer damages, the key to this case, it seems to me, is just how big a gatekeeper function the fact of asbestosis can be, and my -- the argument is, asbestosis is extraordinarily easy to diagnose. There are currently 5,500 cases under FELA in West Virginia. Every single one of them involves a claim of asbestosis. Every single one of them will be supported by an expert. What you get is, that's not a gatekeeper. Those cases are going to come in, and then you're going to have exactly the kinds of evidence you had in this case, I'm afraid of cancer, give me whatever you think is the right number. That is the essence of unpredictable and unlimited damages. This Court declined to allow that under FELA in Buckley. It should decline to allow that under FELA in this case as well.
