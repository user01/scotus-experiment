  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case comes to the Court in a remarkable posture. If you agree with the Hobbs Act arguments in the blue briefs, you should reverse the jury verdicts and direct entry of judgment for the defendants. But even if you believe the arguments in the red and gray briefs, you should still reverse, but for a new trial. And whatever you do on the Hobbs Act, you should reverse the RICO injunction because RICO simply does not authorize private injunctive relief. Now, why do I say so starkly that even respondents and the Government's theories require reversal of the jury verdict? Because the attempts in those briefs, to salvage the theory of plaintiffs' case, concede that someone must obtain the victim's property for the offense of extortion to be shown. And the whole reason the Court granted cert on the Hobbs Act issue was to review the Seventh Circuit's holding directly contrary to those concessions that, quote, a loss to, or interference with the rights of the victim is all that is required, closed quote. Likewise, the jury was instructed that all it had to find was that the defendants caused someone, quote, to give up a property right, closed quote. You will find in the red and gray briefs very elaborate efforts to suggest meanings of obtain and property under which the record in this case supposedly could support a finding that petitioners obtained some abstract form of property from the clinics or women. But no defense of the Seventh Circuit's holding and the jury instructions that substituted the phrases, interference with and give up for obtaining. So there ought to be no question that some form of reversal is required. Now, the reason why there should be reversal for the entry of judgment for the defendants, and not just for a new trial, is that respondents and the Government's brief-formulated conceptions of obtaining and property are wrong. The essence of the theories is that petitioners obtained control over the use and disposition of clinic assets. To refer to that as obtaining property of another -- the language of the Hobbs Act -- is an awfully broad use of language. It's a far cry from the New York law on which the Hobbs Act was based."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I suppose in some instances one competitor can buy another competitor's firm and just close it up in a regular business transaction, and that -- that would be obtaining it in that sense. Now, of course, I recognize that title transfers, et cetera, et cetera. Here the result is about the same."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor. Respectfully, it's not. My clients don't have the clinic's property today as they would if they had, in fact, obtained it. They may have temporarily interfered with some use of it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let's assume that the -- that the boycott or -- or the protests are sufficient to close it down. They have obtained it in a certain sense in that they have obtained -- they have secured for themselves the use that they want of it, i.e., no use."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "That is a sense of the word obtain, but it's not the sense relevant for interpreting the Hobbs Act for several reasons. One is the Hobbs Act has historical predecessors that this Court has said should be looked to in interpreting its terms."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You -- you concede it's a sense of the term obtained? I mean, would you really speak of obtaining somebody's property when you -- when you interfere with that person's use of it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "Well, I certainly don't -- I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. I certainly don't concede it's a relevant sense of obtain. Because of -- because of the Hobbs Act historical antecedents, because of the rule of lenity, because of the very odd use of language, for all those reasons, that's not how the Court should interpret obtain. But more important than any of those things is the implications of such a theory. When Carry Nation went into saloons with her axe and destroyed property, she certainly interfered with the property owner's unfettered use and control over disposition of his assets, and that's exactly what she intended to do. Was that extortion? The civil rights boycott of white merchants that the Court considered in Claiborne Hardware certainly affected the ability of the boycotted merchants to use their property and involved isolated acts of violence as well. Was that extortion? These aren't hypothetical concerns."

  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, but were the Court to uphold the theory in the red and gray briefs, which wouldn't support the judgment, but if the Court were to uphold that theory, it certainly could be charged the next time the facts of Claiborne Hardware come along."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Because it was a State case it wasn't -- the reason -- reason it wasn't charged. It grew up through the Mississippi court system, if I remember correctly, didn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "Well, my -- that's correct, of course, Justice Stevens. But my fundamental point is not that one case was or wasn't charged as -- as extortion. It's if you uphold the theory of the red and gray briefs, it can be charged as extortion in the future. And that's actually happened to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. It's happened to other animal rights groups. Because of these implications, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference joined the amicus brief of the Seamless Garment Network at the cert stage. Disability rights groups that conduct protests have joined the Seamless Garment Network brief at the merits stage. Activists of all stripes and their admirers -- Daniel and Philip Berrigan, Nat Hentoff, Martin Sheen --"

  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "And that's a very important point supporting our position because Congress at one point had coercion as a predicate act in the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934 and, at the request of organized labor, took it out. In the Hobbs Act, in the passage of the Hobbs Act in 1946, again, organized labor lobbied to make sure that coercion was not part of the Hobbs Act. Coercion is a different crime from extortion, and interfering with someone's rights is the crime of coercion under the Model Penal Code, under New York law, under various other bodies of law, but it's not the crime of extortion."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",
    "speech": "I think it's a stretch, Justice Kennedy, but even if it weren't a stretch, it still wouldn't be a Hobbs Act violation for a different reason. There must be consent to the obtaining of property or -- of another, and simply going in and engaging in adverse possession doesn't necessarily entail consent."

I suppose if A robs B, and B turns over the wallet, in a sense there's consent, not -- not the kind of consent that the law would ever recognize. It's a consent in a -- just from the standpoint that there's a voluntary act in handing over the -- the wallet."

  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",

And in fact, the common law distinction between robbery and extortion, which are both Hobbs Act predicates, is one is with consent and the other is without. So robbery is a classic example of something that you could stretch the word of consent to cover, but it isn't extortion."

In other words, if -- if, say, you have a group of terrible criminals, and they say here is what -- we're going to kill you unless you do the following, and then they say, today you serve X and tomorrow you serve Y, and you send the money over to Z, and you do all these different things; in other words, they run the business."

  {
    "speaker": "ENGLERT",

    "speech": "Except that services is not property, and the one thing that is common in both the negative and the positive examples is the obtaining of control.

I -- I believe the New York courts did construe obtaining of property rather strictly in that case and in every other pre-1946 case, but I can't -- I apologize. I can't give you an intelligent discussion of that right at this moment. I'd like to turn to the RICO injunction issue, if I may. It's very straightforward. I plan to address it only briefly. First, this Court has held in several cases that section 7 of the Sherman Act and section 4 of the Clayton Act, both worded almost identically to section 1964(c) of RICO, did not authorize private injunctive relief. The dissent in Paine Lumber contended that courts had inherent power to grant injunctions --"

  {

And in section 16 of the Clayton Act, Congress authorized private injunctive relief. No language remotely resembling section 16 appears in section 1964 of RICO, but all of the language from the statutes this Court held didn't authorize injunctive relief with very tiny variations appears in RICO. Besides the obvious statutory language borrowed from the Clayton and Sherman Acts, as this Court has recognized throughout its cases, the statutory evolution of RICO presented Congress with repeated opportunities expressly to provide private parties with injunctive relief under RICO. Every such proposal failed before and after the final enactment of RICO. The court below dismissed the reliance on legislative history on the theory that this Court would not ascribe any significance to legislative inaction. But ironically the very day the Seventh Circuit decided this case, this Court was hearing argument in Chickasaw Nation v. United States, and the opinion of the Court in that case reiterated the longstanding principle -- with which some members of the Court disagreed, but the longstanding principle in majority opinions -- that courts ordinarily will not assume that Congress intended to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other language."

The reason it seems less strong here is that the choices that -- or the -- the remedies that Congress has specified are extraordinary remedies, e.g., right in this section. What is specified is treble damages, not damages. If they had simply said can get damages, I think it would be a slam-dunk, but -- but what they did was -- was to specify something out of the ordinary, and I'm not sure that that carries the implication that ordinary remedies, consistent with what it specifies, are -- are meant to be excluded."

  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, I -- the question presented, in connection with the Hobbs Act, I think is answered this way. Where unlawful -- which this Court should articulate, we hope, in its opinion. Where unlawful force is used to arrest sufficient control of a business to stop the performance of its services, the Hobbs Act has been violated because control of the business, a property right has been acquired. I -- I may have 1 minute left to just mention one thing with respect to the -- the RICO provision. Congress created a private right to damages for RICO violations by intentionally copying language from the antitrust laws that this Court had repeatedly held did not confer a right to seek injunctive relief. This Court has said that Congress was aware of the antitrust history, was copying it, intended to copy it, and was presumed to know the consequences of what Congress was doing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Of course, at the time the statute was enacted, a private litigant could get relief, injunctive relief, under the antitrust laws, not under the -- not under the section 7 of the Sherman Act, or section 4 of the Clayton Act, but under whatever the other number is."

The Court will accept what Congress has done. And Congress did not adopt and in fact rejected the opportunities or -- or failed to accept the opportunities to adopt precisely the remedy that would have had that result."

  {
    "speaker": "CLAYTON",
    "speech": "Justice Stevens, and -- and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with the RICO issue, if I may, and then turn to the Hobbs Act questions. The stark contrasts between the antitrust law and RICO prove the -- prove why private injunctions are available. When it comes to damages, we agree that the language is virtually the same, treble damages and so forth. But when you look at the injunction provisions, they are radically different. In the antitrust law, Sherman IV, all the injunction provisions were put in a single paragraph giving the Government the exclusive duty to enforce. That is not -- that was not copied in RICO. In RICO, Congress took out permanent injunctions, put them in section 1964(a), a separate, unrestricted section. Not only did it give the duty to the Government, it didn't even mention the Government."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But in the next section, it did mention the Government and said that the Government shall have the authority to -- to use the injunctive provisions mentioned in the first section. Right?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLAYTON",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, of course, you are correct about section (c). Section (c) does give standing to private parties, and gives them these extraordinary new remedies, treble damages and legal fees, which they could never get without a statutory grant. But section (b) does not give the Government the right to use permanent injunctions. It only talks about preliminary relief. It takes that one section of Sherman IV out, and the other part, the permanent injunctions in Sherman IV, are now, under RICO, put in a wholly different provision, the unrestricted section (a). The natural reading of section (a), which says all these permanent remedies, including the injunction that our trial court granted here, went against future criminal activity. Section (a) in an -- unrestricted language makes that available to the court to restrain violations of section 1962, the very violations that section (c) --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Section (a) says what the court may grant. It doesn't say who has authority to ask the court to do that. And in the -- the provision (b), it empowers the Government and the Government only to ask for preliminary injunctive relief. It's a strange thing. Why would Congress withhold the power to seek a preliminary injunction and yet give that party the right to seek a permanent injunction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLAYTON",
    "speech": "That's a question that we have pondered for a long time, and -- and I think the Motorola brief, which explains -- a very important brief -- why preliminary injunctions should be available to everybody, makes a good argument for that. But we don't have to address that question here. My own thinking is that section (b) gives the Government something that it wouldn't have had without the statutory grant because preliminary injunctions require one -- one element that permanent ones don't, the irreparable harm to the victim. And the Government, suing as sovereign, doesn't have property that's harmed. And if you look at the Wollersheim case, they recognize that was a plausible reason for why section (b) is there."

  {
    "speaker": "CLAYTON",
    "speech": "I was going to say in the American Stores case, this Court construed the very same language in the Clayton Act, sections 15 and 16. Institute proceedings, sue for in the other. And the Court said both of them mean both the Government and private parties may go and get injunctive relief including divestiture. It's just two ways of saying the same thing. The Government is thought to institute proceedings. It's bringing them as a sovereign. Private parties are suing for. It's just the traditional language. Certainly those phrases don't bear the weight of the argument that institute proceedings means this party and only this party has access to those unrestricted remedies of section 1964(a)."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And I looked -- I mean, I couldn't make too much out of the fact that you take the language from the Clayton Act which says the Attorney General may institute proceedings in equity, and you move it to section (b) and just change it to say, he may institute proceedings under this section. That's the only difference with the Clayton Act that I could find. So I looked up the history. In the history, it looks as if there were five different bills floating around, and things didn't -- weren't all that straightforward. It got a little mixed up. And you have in the House several Congressmen getting up and saying they made a mistake in the Senate. They didn't include this. They should have. And then there were four more bills floating around, and the ones who wanted to include it said, send it all to the Judiciary Committee, let them work it out, and they never worked it out. I mean, that's -- that's the thrust of it that I -- that I got out of that. Maybe it was just a mistake. Well, if it was a mistake, you're the -- you have another law. You can bring it under the -- you could get an injunction I guess under the Abortion Act, the Abortion Clinics Act, or -- it seemed to me this one -- they made a mistake. Well, they made it."

But the fact is the bill makes a very -- it's a very radically different structure from the antitrust law. Private -- I mean, permanent injunctions are unrestricted, and under the traditional jurisprudence, Califano -- when we -- we assume all traditional remedies are available unless -- unless there's the clearest command. There's not even a hint here. Maybe it was a mistake. It was certainly not a clear command to do the opposite. And as my -- petitioners have pointed out, the only time private injunctions were voted on, they passed unanimously. Why didn't they put it in there? I think it would have been redundant, and the Court doesn't like surplusage. If they had said in section (c), and private parties can get permanent injunctions, then the courts would have been trying to figure out, well, what did they mean in section (a). That has to mean something different. They didn't say again the Government could get permanent injunctions in section (b). That would have been redundant too. But everybody agrees the Government can get permanent injunctions. In any event, this Court's jurisprudence teaches us --"

    "speaker": "CLAYTON",
    "speech": "I -- I agree, Your Honor, and even though that's not an issue that the Court has to resolve in this case, I think the Motorola brief makes an excellent case for why -- since this is a very special remedy, it's not an exclusive list. Congress didn't mean to deprive private parties or anyone else of any of the traditional remedies. The Califano rule is clear. Unless there's a clear command to deny it, it's available. I don't think section (b) -- remember, it doesn't even have that duty language. One other point I'd like to make is when the antitrust laws were written, there was no merger of law in equity. To go in -- when someone had a right to get damages, they had to go into the law court which could only give money damages. It couldn't give injunctions. That had changed by the time RICO passed. And Congress knew that. Congress knew the Federal courts had the ability to design any appropriate remedy to fix the wrong, barring the clearest command. There's no clearest command."

  {
    "speaker": "CLAYTON",
    "speech": "Your Honor, the verdict here is based only on property. If you look at the Hobbs Act instruction, it required that the respondents be made to part with property, not part with liberty interests. If a newspaper publishes an editorial, it has a liberty interest, a First Amendment right, to do it, but it also has a property right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but it defined property. It says you can find a violation, other things -- all the other -- all the other requirements being met. You have to say that the doctors, nurses, or other staff or clinics themselves give up a property right. The term property right means anything of value --"

  {
    "speaker": "CLAYTON",
    "speech": "No, no. No, Your Honor. What we believe is that to find property in any one of those aspects of property -- there are three aspects of property: the clinic's right to control its equipment and buildings and so forth, the women's right to spend their money, and the contract among -- between the two parties. Extortion of any one of them proximately injures all of them because it's two sides of the same coin. If the clinic is forcibly -- through threats of violence, the clinic is forcibly closed, now the women who have appointments, which are contracts, bilateral contracts, they can't get in. It's a -- it's two sides of the same coin. So to extort the property of the clinic is to proximately injure the women in her business or property, which is -- the standing comes under RICO. This is something that petitioners have never even challenged at the trial court --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So a -- a woman's right to seek services is property which, if they say, I don't want you, the clinic, to serve the woman so the woman can't get the services, that is obtaining property?"

    "speaker": "CLAYTON",
    "speech": "It is under these circumstances where she has an actual agreement with the -- the clinic. She's not just going shopping. Each woman who went to these clinics had an actual appointment for a particular service at a particular time.

But a lot of -- a lot of people who don't like these various demonstrations don't, and they'll all be in under the Hobbs Act and -- and RICO and so forth. I'm rather concerned about this problem. I'd like you to address it."

We -- and -- and question 12 ensured that a mere blockade or sit-in -- question 6 on the jury form asked the jury if any of the predicate acts they found was based on a mere blockade and sit-in. The jury said no. I told the jury don't include in your predicate acts -- I told them -- anything that was based on mere speech, or mere presence, or the message. It had to be something that involved force or violence, the wrongful use of fear --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I -- I am reading the closing argument on behalf of the clinic plaintiffs at the trial, and it says, in every issue we've shown you the property rights of the clinics and the women were extorted under RICO. Even a few hours of deprivation of legal rights will satisfy the RICO act of extortion. There is one way, I guess, in which you don't have the element of force in a blockade, and that would be if the blockaders did something that they were specifically instructed that they should never do, that is, politely move aside, part like the Red Sea, and let a woman through. But you know that never happened. No witness ever testified to that. No witness -- not defense, not plaintiff -- ever said that any of the blockaders were instructed to let women through. In other words, you told the jury that you could find an offense here under the Hobbs Act by the mere blockade. It wasn't smacking people around. It was just not letting people in."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

So at the trial -- at the pretrial stage, that was all they offered. They didn't object then. During the course of trial, they made numerous objections. I can't say they never objected. They didn't timely object. And their original view of what extortion meant was part with property, which is the same I think as give up property."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLAYTON",

    "speech": "What would you coerce them to do that is not the giving up of property? Give me an example."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Shouldn't we draw the line this way? Instead of speaking as, for example, the Solicitor General did and some of the cases do about obtaining control, isn't the way to -- to adhere to the line between the liberty and property distinction to say that you extort if you gain control in a way which prevents them from doing business, i.e., engaging in a property exercise, but you do not extort if you gain control simply in the way they do business, i.e., their choice of whom to serve? If we draw that distinction, then the old sit-ins in the lunch counter weren't there to stop them from doing business. They wanted them to do business. They wanted them to do business with them. Whereas, the case which I think you have is a case that could be argued that the point of it was to stop the business, period, and that gets into property and crosses the line from liberty to property. Would you accept that distinction?"

  {
    "speaker": "CLAYTON",

But when we look at the old organized crime, the classic organized crime extortion cases that the Hobbs Act was based on, we see organized crime going in saying, let these people run your pension fund. Don't do business with these people. Fire these people. Hire those. Any attempt to control a lawful business decision I believe is extortion, whether it's positive or negative."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLAYTON",
    "speech": "But the proper -- excuse me, Justice Souter. The best way to address the First Amendment issue is to apply the standards of Claiborne Hardware to any extortion at conduct, as was done here. Make sure that the petitioners had to have specific intent that the crime be done. Make sure it was done knowingly, willingly, wrongfully, not just accidentally. Make sure the enterprise authorized or ratified it. Those were the instructions given here. There was -- nothing could be a predicate act unless all those tests were met. And then on top of that, they had to use demands, wrongful demands, to control lawful business decisions. And I do believe that decisions either to do something or not to do something, as long as the business owner -- say the company makes round widgets and square widgets. And the -- the extortionist says, we don't like round widgets. We want you to only make the other kind. Or maybe they don't make round and they want them to start doing it. That's as much a control of their business decisions as all those classic organized crimes that were the basis of the Hobbs Act. And it's just as offensive here. Your Honor, we ask the clock not to turn back the -- ask the Court not to turn back the clock on 50 years of Hobbs Act jurisprudence which protected businesses and their customers in making their lawful business decisions.

That's -- it's cited in footnote 16 of our opening -- of the Scheidler opening brief. United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Company. This Court reminded us members of the bar that the tendency to assume that a word used in two different legal rules always has the same meaning, has all the tenacity of original sin, and must constantly be guarded against. To think that property's definition in tax cases and in Fifth Amendment takings cases is necessarily the definition of the Hobbs Act is simply wrong. The Hobbs Act draws its definition of property from the common law and the New York law, not from takings cases and tax cases. The First Amendment is in this case. Yes, the Court did not take the First Amendment question, but the principle of constitutional avoidance always governs the construction of statutes. And Ms. Clayton concedes that classic protest activities that are venerated in American history in retrospect would be covered as extortion by her definition. That should give the Court pause.

For those who don't like legislative history, the fact that there's a list of predicate acts and coercion isn't one of them should give you pause. I think almost everyone agrees that there has to be at the very least a remand in this case, and Ms. Clayton hasn't quite conceded it. But if this Court's decision in Griffin v. United States, a criminal case, is applicable in civil cases or if this Court's decisions in Yates v. United States, Maryland v.

So actually the jury rejected -- we know to a certainty the jury rejected most of NOW's evidence, and there weren't even any allegations that Mr. Scheidler, Mr. Scholberg, or Mr. Murphy actually engaged in violence. There were allegations they were connected to violence, not that they engaged in violence. And I should say my clients are proponents of nonviolence. Mr. Terry was not alleged to engage in acts of violence either, I should add. RICO. Section 4 of the Sherman Act is repeated almost verbatim in 1964(a) and 1964(b).
