      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The Massachusetts Attorney General's advertising ban constitutes a prohibition, based on smoking and health, imposed under State law with respect to cigarettes and other tobacco products. For those straightforward reasons, it is preempted by Federal law and, for these and other reasons, it abridges free speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. As to the preemption argument, the Court of Appeals analysis is no longer being defended. It cannot be. This ban is emphatically a prohibition with respect to advertising. Nor can the ban, alternatively, be defended on the ground that it is not based on smoking and health. Of course it is based on smoking and health, as one look at Massachusetts' First Amendment argument proves, and as they ultimately concede. Massachusetts' alternative argument is that the ban can be sustained so long as there are other permissible nonpreemptive grounds for the ban, but if --"

In 1969, when they were looking at whether to amend section 5(d) and how to amend it, one of the great concerns was that States or localities ultimately would respond to the FTC's warning requirement on advertising by ultimately expressing disagreement with that warning requirement. The concern was after '69 they'd say, that's not enough, we don't like it, and so what they'd do in response is, they'd say, we're just going to ban advertising altogether, and that's exactly what California was considering in '69, New York City was considering in '69. It was before the Congress in 1969, and that's why they banned this very type of thing."

But even if you look at intent, at what they did in effect, it's not just that you can't get the warnings. Obviously, it just relates to schools. I mean, that is a health-related reason. They were concerned about underage sales to children. That's a health --"

We recognize that. They said, however, if you read the ban that broadly, if you read the preemption that broadly, rather, then the words of limitation, which are -- which refer to smoking and health are going to have no limitation at all, becasue it's going to include everything, and therefore you've got to pull back or the words become meaningless. What is your response to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, that's an important point. In 1969, the reason you had to have based-on-smoking-and-health language there is, otherwise this ban would apply to all general zoning laws. In other words, you'd have ERISA II without the based-on-smoking- and-health language."

      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "No, but that's my point. My point is that, without the based-on-smoking-and-health language you'd have ERISA in the sense that every State law that had any application to cigarette advertising would be covered. That would mean the States or localities couldn't have general zoning laws regarding advertising, billboards, or store front signs. The based-on-smoking- and-health language critically --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

Prior to 1969 they had the language that said, statements in advertising. In '69 they go to requirements or prohibitions with respect to advertising. That would cover an awful lot of general laws but for the based-on- smoking-and-health language, and that's exactly --"
    },

      "speech": "No, Your Honor, and that's a critical, and again if you go back to section 5(b), you'll see why. Conspicuously missing from 5(b) is the word sale. It just preempts bans on advertising or promotion, but not sale, so for example -- and this is in Cippolone at footnote 26 --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, it's not that the State has to address all aspects of the problem, but is the State not entitled to do something about promotion and advertising to the extent that it encourages underage people to smoke?"

    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, and these laws have some of that in there. For instance, the requirement that to sell cigarettes it has to be a person-to-person transaction. You can't get it from a vending machine, in order to protect children."

      "speaker": "SUTTON",

We know the States after '69 could still have bans on sales to minors. That also must mean you couldn't have offers to sell, conspiracies to sell, or a direct solicitation for --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "But Your Honor, once you're beyond a direct solicitation for a legal sale, you're into the main core language of section 5(b), and keep in mind, Congress was not unaware of the problems you're raising, and that's why they made sure that the FTC had authority in this industry to investigate unfair and deceptive trade practices."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But when you read the Federal statute, it does seem to be directed more toward what has to be on cigarette labels than anything else. I mean, they didn't want a whole conflicting array of State requirements of how the package had to be labeled."

    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "I respectfully disagree, Your Honor, and this was the quid pro quo in 1969. On the one hand, in the same act they said there shall be no cigarette advertisiing on radio and TV. On the other hand, the other side of the bargain is, we're not going to let localities and States after the fact start to ban it as well, just as they were considering doing. But I think -- there are two things that get to the children's solicitation. If it is not a direct solicitation for an illegal sale, then it is preempted, but there are two reasons the Court may not be concerned about that. First, the FTC does have authority to investigate this very thing. In fact, the State of Massachusetts in 1993 asked the FTC to investigate a tobacco company on just these accounts. The FTC did, and so it shows they understood it, and the FTC knew how to operate. Secondly --"

The only court that has embraced the based-on- smoking-and-health theory was the fourth, and the Second Circuit dismissed that as mere sophistry, as I think they should have."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "And I'm just making the point that three of those circuits embraced a reasoning that is no longer being defended, which leaves the based-on-smoking- and-health theory advocated here, and I don't know how you can look honestly at their brief, the press release of the Attorney General when he announced these regulations, and say they weren't based on smoking and health. That animated everything they did."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So would you like this Court, then, to send it back and say, First Circuit, consider the theories that other courts of appeals have accepted?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "Well, that is fully up to the Court. I mean, we've been willing to argue the alternative ground that Massachusetts presented, but if the Court wishes to send it back, that's fine. We're agnostic about that point. But we do think either theory does not work. And the other point I wanted to make that I think gets to your point, Justice Ginsburg, and yours, Justice O'Connor, is, keep in mind these children's solicitation hypotheticals are really hypotheticals. I mean, all of the major tobacco manufacturers entered into an MSA, multisettlement agreement, multi-State settlement agreement, in November of 1998, that prohibits this very thing. I mean, this is something that cannot happen after 1998 by 98 percent of the cigarette manufacturers in this country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Can I go back to your first point? You started off saying this is a ban, and suppose hypothetically I were to think that it's okay for the State to regulate location, but not okay for them to ban all advertising. Then, at that point, you get to your maps. You have a number, and you have the maps. When I saw the number, I thought, well, this is a ban, because 90 percent of the area can't advertise. Then I looked at the maps. It didn't seem to me -- I can't make heads or tails out of them. I would have thought the right question is, of the area previously available for advertising, in how much of that area can you no longer advertise as a result of this, and I can't get an answer to that question from the map, and the map only covers Boston and not the suburbs. It doesn't cover the suburbs of Worcester. I mean, most of the population of Massachusetts, I don't know what the situation is -- we now have those maps -- and yet I think it's very important to your argument, on my assumption."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "Your Honor, this provides a transition to the First Amendment argument. I mean, ultimately, you are allowed to aggregate all State conduct, so the 90-percent figure is a legitimate figure, because it is aggregating all State conduct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I'm not saying legitimate or not, but in my own mind, I thought the relevant distinction turned on taking the area previously available for advertising. What percentage of that area was cut off? I take it I cannot get an answer to that question in the State of Massachusetts."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "Well, either way, Your Honor, I would submit it is an advertising ban. It is a regulation with respect to advertising cigarettes and, as Justice Blackmun said in Cippolone, you cannot, after 1969, do by negative mandate what you can't do by positive mandate."

The Court has followed Red Lion since and, in fact, in Virginia Board of Pharmacy, the key case in 1976 that started to recognize the constitutional protection for commercial speech, that's exactly what the Court did. We said, we're going to -- we've got here a price advertising ban. We're not going to deal with the question of how that ban would be treated if it were on a different medium of communication. I think the Court should do the same thing here. The key problem with this particular law and why it gets strict scrutiny is the fact that it does suppress a substantial amount of speech directed to adults about a lawful product, and does so solely based on the message in the speech."

We think the Court should embrace ultimately the plurality reasoning in 44 Liquor Mart, and we think this is a good case and a good vehicle to do it, but you're right, we do not need to do that.

That is exactly what the MSA did. What the MSA did is, it dealt with all of the major cigarette manufacturers. It made sure that there would not be any youth targeting when it comes to advertisement. It banned all billboards. This is not a billboard case. In fact, it's barely a storefront sign case, because it only applies to storefront signs that are less than 14 square foot in size.

It does say the broader thing on its face, but I'm especially struck by the fact that this language amended an earlier text which did say exactly what you say this new text says. The old text said, no statement relating to smoking and health shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes. They could have simply tracked that language and said, no State shall require any additional, or prohibit in the advertising of any cigarettes. They went out of their way to change that text into this broad text."

      "speaker": "PORTER",

Your Honor is correct that the 1965 preemption language preempted statements relating to smoking and health. The phrase, relating to smoking and health, has an objective meaning in that provision. It clearly refers to the health-related content of the statement. The phrase, relating to smoking and health, was retained essentially unchanged in 1969."

      "speaker": "PORTER",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I -- the 1969 amendments clearly did expand the possible forms of regulation that could be preempted, but it still retained the focus on health-related content by virtue of the retention of the phrase, based on smoking and health. In addition, Your Honor, the fact that Congress at the same time prohibited advertising on television and radio, I don't think provides any basis for an inference -- I think it would be a great stretch to infer from that that Congress was invading the traditional authority of the States to regulate the location of advertising."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, but it may well have been part of the legislative deal. Look, this happened in 1969, over 30 years ago. Public attitudes regarding cigarettes were not nearly what they are today. It was much more controversial as to how much you're going to move against them. I don't know what the legislative deal was, but there's always a deal going on there, give me this, I'll give you that and so forth. The best way to tell what the fair deal was, it seems to me, is to read the text of the statute, and this is phrased as a very broad ban against the States going beyond the electronic media ban that was contained in the statute. That's what it reads like, it seems to me, and if that was the deal, it seems to me we should enforce it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PORTER",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I don't think we should infer a deal of that type. At the same time, considering the environment in 1969, and this is apparent in the legislative history, Congress was concerned in general with the prevalence of tobacco advertising and what to do about a warning. It provided, ultimately, for a warning in advertising. It did prohibit advertising on television and radio. But what you see in the legislative history is a great concern that the advertising dollars that were saved when TV advertising stopped would simply migrate to other places. Well, Congress -- that concern is expressed throughout. It would be unlikely that in the face of that kind of concern, at the same time Congress would pass a preemption provision that would essentially guarantee tobacco, cigarette advertisers the right to advertise anywhere."

I'd like to point out that based on can have different meanings in different contexts, but when one statute describes another statute as a rule based on something, as a regulation based on something, that language ordinarily refers to the operating criteria of the regulation, and not the reason why it was adopted. For example, when Congress in one statute refers to another statute -- to taxes based on revenues, or it refers to requirements imposed on vehicles based on size or weight, it is using a shorthand description of a category of statute, and it is describing the text of the -- of that other statute, the criteria that that statute uses, and not the reasons it came into existence.

And then by adding prohibitions Congress reached State laws that would have the effect of requiring new warnings, but would do so in the form of a prohibition, say, for example, no advertising without this warning, which in effect requires a warning, but does it in the form of a prohibition, and it would also reach State laws prohibiting affirmative health claims about filters, say, or the safety of a particular cigarette.

They now no longer have a content-location dichotomy. They've just rewritten 5(b) to say, with respect to statements in advertising. That's the only way to give content to 1969 under their theory, and their theory ultimately does not give content to those significant amendments. The Little League hypotehtical is just not true. That would be a direct solicitation, an illegal sale. It would not be preempted, would not be barred by the First Amendment. They've ackowledged that a total ban would not be preempted. I mean, they've just said that you could have a total ban here. That's exactly what they were getting at in 1969. Now, clearly they were banning not just brand- favorable messages, but all messages that are favorable to tobacco. That's exactly what 44 Liquormart is about. This is not seven dirty words.
