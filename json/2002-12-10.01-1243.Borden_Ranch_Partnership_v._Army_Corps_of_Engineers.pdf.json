    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Army Corps of Engineers has a considerable number of hurdles to clear before it may regulate activity as a discharge under section 404. Congress specified in section 404 that a permit is required for an activity that is an addition of a pollutant to a navigable water. That addition -- that added pollutant must be in the form of fill material or dredged material. And the addition must come from a point source. Those statutory terms, we believe, have a core of plain meaning that excludes a farmer and rancher, deep plowing in a seasonal wetland, to prepare the soil for deep-rooted crops. A deep plowing of that sort does not add fill material or dredged material, and it doesn't involve a point source. And so it --"

    "speech": "And that -- that is not -- and that was not the basis of the judgment below or of the penalty. In the summary judgment ruling, the court found, as a matter of law, that plowing that moved material that was already in the wetland -- and this is page 36 of the petition appendix -- was a violation. When it came to hearing evidence, for that reason the court did not focus on the question of whether material was added to the wetland, as the Government says, from -- from outside. The penalty in this case was based on 358 rips, passes, of the plow across the wetlands. The court did not distinguish, in any of those cases, as between passes that brought outside material into the wetland and those that didn't. It simply was not a focus. This was not the basis of the Government's argument below. This is entirely novel. It wasn't the basis of the district court's decision in this case. It wasn't the basis of the court of appeals decision, if you look at page 6 of the court of appeals decision. Furthermore, we believe that --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",

It would also show that the -- that the deep plow was raised on many occasions before the -- it moved from upland into wetland, and there's an example of that described at page 71 of the petition appendix. And finally, on page 3 of our reply brief, we cite a California Ag Extension pamphlet which describes in great detail the nature of the soils and the plowing in this area, and what it -- what it describes is that when a deep plow passes through this sort of clay soil and it then rains, that the -- that the -- the clay pan seals up again and that because of the -- the nature of the clay pan, there really is no homogenization during the plowing process between the soils above and below the pan."

  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "No, no. Well, the purpose of the -- no. The purpose of the act, Justice Breyer -- there are multiple purposes of this act, but the purpose to preserve the Nation's waterways is achieved through a -- a dual or perhaps a tripartite process. There is a section 402 NPDES permit that is regulated by the Federal Government. There is a section 404 fill and dredge authority that is -- is -- that is handled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. But that is only part of the picture. The Government through -- the -- the Congress through section 208 set up a process which is mainly administered through the States, although with considerable Federal assistance, for -- for regulating nonpoint source pollution. If this activity, this plowing activity, is not regulated under section 404, it is, nevertheless, regulated by the States as nonpoint source pollution. And so the goal of the act to -- to protect the Nation's waters is not one that depends on the Federal Government, and in fact, we think here that to give a broad reading to the powers of the Army Corps of Engineer under section 404 by straining these very -- these -- these terms, these series of terms that Congress predicated section 404 jurisdiction on, that that would contravene Congress' other goal in section 101(b) which is to preserve and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of the States."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Bishop, will you explain something to me? And -- and -- on a most basic level, if what the concern was it was to preserve wetlands and not have them converted into dry lands, what difference should it make if the conversion comes about through redeposit, shaking all the stuff up, turning it upside down, but what you're ending up with is dry land rather than wetland, or if you take a little sludge from someplace else and put it there?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "We don't think it's permissible, Justice Ginsburg, to protect wetlands by ignoring the plain language of the statute because Congress, through using the terms that it did, imposed limits on Federal power that preserve and protect, as 101(b) says, the power of the States to regulate nonpoint source pollution.

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is there any redeposit that could be?"

  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "Well, the -- the -- Judge Silberman in the National Mining case said that the terms addition in section 404 and also the concept that a 404 permit is for the -- is for the deposit of material to a specified disposal site, that read together, those show that Congress intended that there be a geographic or temporal separation between the dredging activity or where the material comes from and where it is deposited. So, you know, if a bulldozer digs up large quantities of material from one side of a wetland and moves them to another, you know, perhaps it is reasonable for the agency in a circumstance like that to say that there has been an addition. Even in a case like Deaton, where you have dredging, the dredging takes soil out of the wetland. At that point it becomes a defined pollutant under section 404 which is dredged spoil, something that Congress said was a pollutant. And if is that is sidecast, then, you know, certainly there is far more movement of the soil and far more disturbance of the soil in a situation like that. It's lifted out of the wetland and it is moved elsewhere. But what we're dealing with here is a plow, a deep plow, that goes through the soil and that pushes it to the side and -- and moves it, but it stays in contact with the soil all around it and it's simply moved in small degrees."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "Well, Justice O'Connor, our -- our take on this case is that we never get to 404(f), that this activity is not a discharge to begin with because it doesn't satisfy the requirements set out in 404(a). It is not -- it does not involve a point source. A plow is not a point source. This is not fill material. It's not dredged material. It is not an addition. Therefore, it is not discharge."

    "speech": "If -- well, that would be -- that would be an issue, but as I say, there's no finding as to that sort of a -- that sort of an addition. And I don't believe -- Justice O'Connor, let me be clear that that -- the -- the movement of material into the margins of the waters here would not be a discharge. Even if it is an addition, it still has to qualify as fill material and as dredged material and as a point source. And a plow simply is none of those things, and I hope I get a chance to explain why I don't think it's a point source."

    "speech": "Why not a ripper?"

  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "Well, let me explain. The language of the statute is that a point source is a confined conveyance, a confined, discrete conveyance. And we do not believe -- and if you look at -- and then are examples set -- set out in the statute. And this is at 5a of the addendum to the Government's brief, which is a little easier to handle than our petition appendix. A point source is a discernible, confined, discrete conveyance. And then there are a series of examples. Now, the Government's regulations don't define point source. In fact, they don't even use point source. The -- the 404 regulations don't include the term, point source, and they're not in the 1996 memorandum to the field in which the -- the Government purported to explain why deep plowing is covered by 404. But we think that these terms and these examples show one important characteristic of a -- of a point source, that it confines the material that it conveys."

I believe that the terms confined and conveyance in the statute in their plain meaning and as they are elucidated through all of these examples that are given, that they all have characteristics in common. One is that they confine the material. The other is that they convey it.

So we don't think that it's a point source, but even if it is a point source, we certainly don't think that it's an addition because there is no addition to the wetland unless something is added. And all we are doing is moving soil, be it up or down or sideways, small -- to small degrees. And that doesn't -- nothing is coming into the wetland from the outside."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- the argument that -- that it's a -- it's not adding material. No new material is added, but as I take the Government's argument, it's converting something that wasn't a pollutant into a pollutant when this deep ripper churns up the earth and deposits the rocks and the soil and the biological material on the top."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, the -- the statute, section 404, applies to two types of pollutant only, and that's fill material and dredged material. Dredged material is material that is dredged out of the soil, the sort of thing that a backhoe does, dredging a hole and lifting it up out of the soil. The agency's regulations define dredged material as material that is excavated or dredged from the wetland. The district court didn't find that there was any dredged material involved here, and we don't believe that any reasonable reading of the term, dredged material, or of the regulation that talks about excavating and dredging from the wetland could describe the activity of deep plowing. That leaves fill material. Fill material in its plain meaning is material that is -- is used, is moved in to fill a gap or a cavity. It was defined in the regulations at the time as material that was used for the primary purpose of replacing an aquatic area with dry land or changing the bottom elevation. As Justice Breyer has pointed out, if anything took water out of this wetland, it is the activity of punching the hole in the clay pan so that it drains out. We are not interested in filling this wetland and there was no purpose here to -- to use the material to replace wet areas. And in fact, it's quite irrelevant to a farmer and rancher if the topsoil remains wet, and in this area it does, as a matter of fact, remain wet because the clay pan seals up and during the rainy season, there's -- there's water on the surface. It's just not our purpose to do that."

    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "It does, but the -- but the pollutants -- the pollutants have to be in a particular form in order to be covered by 404, and that form is fill material or dredged material. So it's not enough to say that there is rock or sand involved here. It has to be in the form of fill material or dredged material which is why you have these regulatory definitions of those two concepts."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Where do I get that from?"

    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "In -- in section 404(a) on page 2a of the Government's addendum. The permits are issued for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites. The -- the regulations then define on page 6a and 7a fill material, discharge of fill material, and dredged material and discharge of dredged material."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So the definition -- for present purposes the definition of pollutant is irrelevant."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",

And that talks about the discharge of any pollutant. But the basis on which this case has been litigated is that we needed a 404(a) permit not a 402 permit, and that is a permit for the addition of fill material or dredged material."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is -- is -- what is your definition? Because I think that's actually not a bad point. You said it's a conveyance. This is not a conveyance. The dictionary, I guess, defines conveyance as a -- as a means of conveying, and it says conveying is cause to pass from one place to another. So the Government says, well, we'll accept that. And of course, if you take that literally from the dictionary, then this is a conveyance because it is a means of conveying. You say it couldn't be that broad. I have a better definition, more consistent with what the paragraph means, and that better definition is what?"

  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",

It is not -- there's not a lot of homogenization, as the -- as the Ag Extension pamphlet that I cite in the reply brief says. There's not a lot of homogenization at the lower levels from below the clay to above or from the clay above because of the nature of the soil and because of the nature of the piece of equipment. This is not like a moldboard plow that has a curved shank that pushes the soil up. It's a cutting device that is intended to allow water to hydrate the roots and to allow the roots room to grow.

On the question of whether there was a discharge of pollutant -- pollutants, the Clean Water Act makes clear that a discharge is defined as any unauthorized addition of any pollutant from any point source. If you make such a discharge, under 301 you have violated the law. You have two -- 301 provides -- there are two exceptions to 301.

The understanding from my experts is that it's actually more like a foot wide. But the shank is about 5 to 7 feet long.

    "speech": "Well, your opponent doesn't want us to reach that exception because he says he wants to rest on the fact that, A, it wasn't a point source, that the plow is not a point source, and B, there was no addition. There was simply a redeposit of material in the same place. Have you dealt with that yet?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Yes. I would like to go back to that point. We're now back to question 1 and talking about the question of addition which is fundamental to the idea of a discharge. Our view is that there were additions from three sources here. First, there was addition by material being moved from the upland into the wetland. Counsel states that that occurred in only three cases. The record actually shows that it occurred in at least 33 of the 40 wetlands that are involved here. The district court made reference to it only in those three cases where it was the only movement of that material. But it's easy to see that the three cases that are cited in the district court's opinion refer to those cases where the ripper passed next to a wetland but didn't go in and pushed -- nevertheless, pushed soil into the wetland. The same thing would happen in those areas where the ripper actually intruded through the wetland as well. So in the case of all of the -- the areas, the 29 areas that were filled, all of them had movement of material from upland into the wetlands."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, excuse me. I thought your opponent said it isn't an addition because it's a redeposit of material. Have you dealt with that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "Yes. The -- in talking about -- before when I spoke about the dredged material, about how material is moved from one place to the wetland to another place, that is a regulable redeposit that is covered by the act. And we believe the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in Deaton is quite persuasive on this."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I think that's already a stretch. I mean, you know, with that you'll say, well, literally you're not adding anything to the wetlands just to move the -- the mud from one portion to another. But you have this big dredging operation and it does disturb everything and you move it. So, yes, I'll go along with you on that. But -- but then, you know, that's not enough for you. Now we have to generalize from that and say that any movement of anything within the wetlands is also an addition to the wetlands. And -- and that brings you to this case. And I think it is fanciful to think that anything has been added to the wetlands here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

Would you be explicit about what is implicit in that is, and that is, the definition of wetland, I take it, is the -- the land area between the surface and the hard pan, and the area beneath that is not part of wetland so that if you take material from beneath and bring it up, you are moving into the wetland.

And there's a fair amount of flexibility in determining how that might be done. In this case, the parties had agreed below that each pass of the ripper was, in fact, a violation. The -- the district court then determined the maximum penalty by taking the number of passes of the ripper and multiplying it times the maximum penalty. But it did not impose that penalty. Instead, it looked to the specific statutory criteria that govern the application of the penalty provision."

The statute has been revised three times, and they've been quite specific in what they've done. The normal farming exemption is a good example. Congress could have simply exempted all farming activities from coverage under section 404 or the Clean Water Act itself. Instead, it drew a very specific line in this case and it said that we are only restricting normal farming activities and we're subjecting them to a recapture provision. That recapture provision applies whenever the activity, even if it's simply plowing, results in the change in use of the property and also results in a diminishment of the waters of the United States, if it actually fills --"

But it drew limits on those exemptions to avoid covering situations like we have here where we're not talking about a yeoman's plow, but rather we're talking about a 100,000 pound bulldozer pulling a 7-inch -- 7-foot long shank through a wetland area. I think it's important to remember too that this lawsuit could have easily been avoided. The -- the parties were -- were -- discussed this issue on a number of occasions, and the Corps made quite clear that they were not subject to a permit provided they simply avoided these small wetland areas, what's -- in the case of the parcels at issue here are about 1 percent of the property. It was easy enough to simply mark these areas and have the contract rippers who came through avoid those areas. The petitioners in this case decided not to do that. They decided to disregard the law and the fact is that this suit and 10 years of litigation -- excuse me -- 8 years of litigation is the result. The fact is that this is a quite sensible program. The Corps and EPA have applied it quite sensibly, and I think that their actions in this case, if you look at the record, were really quite reasonable. Now, I would like to touch back, since we've covered a lot of material here, just to go over --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay. But, you see, that's -- that's not an exception for -- for normal -- it's an exception from the discharge of dredged or fill material. Right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MINEAR",
    "speech": "That's correct. And so what this does is it exempts the party from having to get a section 404 permit for activities that would otherwise constitute dredge or fill activities. And the fact that Congress has chosen to exempt activities, including specifically plowing, indicates that Congress understood that plowing could result in a point source addition of pollutants. Now, what Congress additionally did is it -- it states on the carryover -- there's a number of other matters that are exempted as well. It indicates that these activities are not regulated under section 301 or section 404 or section 402, for that matter. But then on the paragraph on page 4a, it recaptures those provisions when they result in a change of use, when someone, such as in this case, decides to take a ranch and subdivide it and sell it as farmettes. And it -- and even that recapture provision only applies when it reduces the reach of waters, which is what happened in this case. As the district court found, these waters were filled. They are no longer wetlands, and the idea that these areas are going to be resealed finds no support in the record. The district court found here that what were once wetlands are now orchards. These are not areas that include wetland -- or have wetland characteristics any longer. I would simply like to touch on -- since we -- we have bounced around among the three issues here quite a bit, I'd like to simply say a few more words about the civil penalty provision because I think it's important. The legal issue that's before the Court on the civil penalty is -- is whether a penalty ought to be assessed in terms of determining the maximum penalty on a per-day basis or on the basis of the number of violations per day. And the Congress made -- made quite clear that it wanted the latter to be the basis for determining the maximum civil penalty. It amended the statute in 1987 to eliminate any ambiguity that might exist with regard to the -- to that provision, and it's quite clear that it does apply to every violation each day. Now, it takes into account that some violations can be continuing and go on for a long period of time. And those are treated as receiving a $25,000 a day penalty. But in the case of the violations we have here, they all occurred in one day on the basis the district court analyzed the -- the problem. Finally, I'd like to make the point that the district court needs to have a great deal of discretion in determining how to apply the penalty provisions that are involved here. There are different ways to calculate violations, determine what is the appropriate measure of violations, but ultimately the fairness turns on the district court's judgment of the individual penalty factors that are considered here. In this case, the court took into account all those factors, including the economic benefits that the party received by avoiding its legal obligations in this case. It's important to remember there are land developers, ranchers, and farmers out there that do comply with the statute, that do comply with the regulations, and they are, in effect, penalized if in fact people who ignore the law are allowed to go forward and not be subject to a substantial penalty in cases in which they have violated the law. In this case the penalties are less than what actually would be necessary to recoup the economic benefit that they received according to the -- the facts that the district court put forward. The court of the -- or excuse me -- the -- the Government put forward. The district court recognized there was some uncertainty with regard to determining economic benefit, but nevertheless I think chose a very reasonable approach here in terms of requiring both a mitigation remedy and also a substantial civil penalty. If there are no further questions."

    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "I think it's a shame that the Government has chosen to insert at this level for the very first time this idea that soil came in from outside the wetland. On page 36 of the petition appendix, the -- the district court, in describing what the plowing here did, said that it broke up, mixed, turned over material already in the pools, swales, and intermittent streams. If you turn to page 86 through 91, where the court describes in detail factual findings after hearing the evidence on the impacts on waters, on only three -- as to three of the jurisdictional features does the court say that there is any fill coming in from outside, and that is where there is upland plowing parallel to a drainage that pushes a small amount of material into the very margins of the wetland. And the reason that the court didn't need to get into this is, A, that it had made a legal finding to begin with that soil disturbed within a wetland was a discharge, and B, that there was a factual dispute here about the extent to which we have pulled up the plows before we entered across from the upland to the -- to the wetland. And the court didn't want to deal with -- with that. And it didn't have to under this notion that if you disturb soil within a wetland, that's an addition. Second, I'd like to point out on page 8a of the -- of the Government's addendum the regulation about plowing. Plowing means all forms of primary tillage including moldboard, chisel, and wide-blade plowing, discing, harrowing, and similar means utilized on the farm to break up, cut, turn over, or stir the soil to prepare it for the planting of crops."

Primary is the initial preparation of the soil. You might contrast that, for example, with -- even though harrowing is mentioned here, farmers understand that harrowing is actually a secondary form of land preparation. It's like a large rake that -- that clears the seed bed for -- for seeding. Primary is the first movement that prepares the soil for accepting the crops."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "But it's clear that they did not intend to reach agricultural activity. The Corps in a dispute with the EPA made noises between '72 and '77 about, well, we're -- we're going to start regulating stock ponds and -- and ordinary farming activities. And Congress reacted to that by, as one commentator has said, a provision that reflects the fact that it didn't think that one stake through the heart of the vampire was enough. This is a belt and suspenders provision. But what it does, as you remarked Justice Scalia, is to provide an exemption for agricultural activities that are discharges. It doesn't change the definition of point source, fill material, dredged material, addition in any way. It doesn't change any of the operative terms in the statute that we think mean this activity is not a -- a discharge to begin with. And the exemption also mentions other activities, seeding and cultivation and harvesting, that just are not -- I mean, these are not discharges. These do not result in the addition of fill and dredged material from -- to the -- to the wetland. And -- and that is why this structure is what's reflected in the regulations. The regulation on page 8a. It says plowing, as described above -- I mean, they purport to exclude what we did from the definition of plowing, but plowing, as described above, will never involve a discharge. It's not a discharge to begin with. You don't get into the 404(f) exemption."
