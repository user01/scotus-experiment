      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On April 3rd of 1992, Judge Foster dismissed criminal charges against Timothy Hall. She noted on the docket, case removed from docket, defendant deceased, and then signed her name. 3 inches above that reference on that docket sheet was the name, Bryan Saunders, in big letters, court appointed counsel for Timothy Hall. On April 6th of 1992, warrants charging Walter Mickens with the capital murder of Timothy Hall came before Judge Foster. Judge Foster telephoned Bryan Saunders and asked if he would receive the appointment on that case. He accepted that appointment. This case presents this Court with the extraordinary circumstances of a judge appointing a lawyer to a death penalty case when that judge knew or reasonably should have known that the lawyer represented the victim at the time of the victim's death. As a consequence, Walter Mickens has been deprived his constitutional rights under the Sixth Amendment to conflict-free representation."

I mean, they -- they can't -- you know, they -- they can't have a thousand people in their office, and sure enough, some members of the people -- sometimes this will happen. So, what kind of rule would you suggest?"

So --"

You make a sharp distinction between this case where the judge knew. But suppose Mickens didn't know and the judge didn't know. Why should Mickens be worse off? In both cases he doesn't know."

Why isn't that just -- that would take care of all these cases just as you say."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but here it seems to me that two inquiries tend to become conflated in a case like this. If there's no adverse effect, that shows that there was no conflict."

      "speech": "Well, I would suggest --"

      "speech": "And -- and that's quite different from a case where there's multiple representation over the defendant's -- over the counsel's objection. I mean, we could say that in that line of cases, prejudice is apparent from the record. It -- it -- a burden on counsel inheres intrinsically in the representation to which he objects. But that's not -- there -- there are hundreds of different kinds of conflicts. The -- the defense attorney is a candidate for the prosecuting attorney in an upcoming election. One attorney has been interviewed -- the defense attorney has been interviewed for a position in the DA's office 4 weeks before. All of these things you say there's an absolute requirement of a new trial without any inquiry into whether there's an adverse effect? This is an astounding proposition."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but Holloway and Cuyler were both multiple representation cases where the trial court could see the whole thing right before him at that time. This was not a multiple representation case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I agree. But I would suggest that in this type of case, it's even more dangerous for the defendant that the court doesn't initiate the inquiry. In that case, at least the court knows and the defendant knows that the co-defendant is being represented by the same attorney. In this case, Mr. Mickens never knew that his -- that his attorney had a conflict."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "May I ask if -- if in your view would everything have been satisfactory, as a constitutional law matter, if the judge had said, go ask your client if the client has any objection, and the client had said, no, I have no objection? Would that have taken care of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "speech": "Well, I believe that the court should have indulged in some inquiry of the client himself. The court should have asked the client if he understood everything that was involved in waiving that conflict. And in this situation --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Excuse me. You're -- you're presuming a conflict. I -- I really don't follow your argument for that -- whether the judge had an obligation to inquire into a conflict about which he knew or should have known. What he should have known was -- was not the existence of a conflict, but simply that this defendant -- that the deceased had previously been represented by counsel who's representing this defendant. That does not constitute a conflict. The -- what follows from that -- from that relationship? Does anything follow other than the fact that the lawyer cannot, in -- in a subsequent representation, disclose any confidential information which he learned in the prior representation. Right? Isn't that the only thing that follows?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "speech": "Well, it is that, but there's also ethical consideration 4-5 of the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility which states that anything obtained by Mr. Saunders through his representation of Hall could not be used to Hall's disadvantage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "That's fine, but that doesn't show a conflict. That shows at most the potential of a conflict, and -- and you're representing it here as though there is a conflict and -- and the judge had an obligation to inquire into it. But the whole issue is -- is whether there was a conflict. That hasn't been established at all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "speech": "Well, I believe it has, Your Honor, and it's been established because Mr. Saunders in this case obtained confidential information from Mr. Hall. That's clear from the record. The district court found that. And in preserving those confidences of Mr. Hall, he was precluded from doing certain things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Would you -- would you say what they were? Because it seemed to me that some of the things you listed were just matters of record and not at all -- there was one conversation between this lawyer and the client. We know it took place for 15 to 30 minutes, and that was it. And a number of your recitations do involve matters of public record that would not involve betraying any client confidence if Saunders brought them out. So, what was it that Saunders knew that was not available to the public?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "speech": "First of all, all of this happened in -- in juvenile domestic relations court, and under Virginia law, all of those files, all of that information from that case was confidential and couldn't be revealed to the public. But nonetheless, even if it was public, under ethical consideration 4-4 of the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility, which governed Mr. Saunders at that time, he was absolutely required to preserve the confidences and secrets of Mr. Hall regardless of the source or nature of those confidences --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So what? So what? Why does that constitute a conflict? Unless you connect up that confidential information which he knew with something that was relevant to the defense of his new client, there's no conflict."

      "speech": "Well, isn't -- wouldn't that be true in most criminal cases?"
    },

      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "speech": "It would be true that the -- the attorney should look into the -- the background of the victim. Absolutely, Judge. But I think it's particularly true because of the sentencing phase in a death penalty case. In the sentencing phase of the death penalty case, the attorney needs to -- or the team of attorneys need to look into the background of the victim, need to engage in a -- in brainstorming about the background and an investigation about the background. And Mr. Saunders couldn't engage in that brainstorming, couldn't engage in that investigation because he had to preserve those confidences, and he had a duty of loyalty to Mr. Hall."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, this may not get us very far so far as a general rule is concerned, but isn't your argument, insofar as this case is concerned, pretty much undercut by the fact, number one -- let's take an example. Let's take the issue that you -- you rightly stress about the response to the victim impact evidence, the -- the mother's testimony. Isn't your case pretty much undercut here by the fact that the information, on the basis of which defense counsel could have responded to the mother's testimony, had already been published in a newspaper? And isn't it also undercut by the fact that there was co-counsel here and there is no claim that co­ counsel had any conflict, actual or potential. So, if we -- even if we accept your -- your premise that proof of conflict would be enough in this situation, don't you lose anyway?"

    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",

    },

Therefore, I could not take from the Wood case what you are urging this Court to take. And if that's so, then the Wood case is in no different category.

Sullivan very specifically draws out a test in which you must show both actual conflict and adverse effect. If you then look to the dispositional paragraph of Wood v. Georgia, that speaks only of actual conflict, and it speaks of it three times. In Wood v. Georgia, the only requirement upon a showing that the defense attorney had not inquired into the conflict but that the judge knew or reasonably should have known of the conflict is that there be an actual conflict showing. And again, it's three times in the dispositional paragraph."

Georgia that said, we -- you know, if -- if the defendant fails to inquire and if the judge knew or reasonably should have known or if the defendant fails to advise the court of a conflict and if the -- the court knew or reasonably should have known of a conflict and failed to inquire, all that needs to be shown is an actual conflict, and didn't mention adverse effect. That -- that's as specific as I can get in -- in that specific case. And you're right, Your Honor. I misspoke. They did not find an actual conflict but sent it back to the court to determine if there was an actual conflict, back to the -- to the court that -- that did the probation revocation hearing in that case to see if there was, in fact, an actual conflict. And -- and that's what the Court found, just that the court had to find an actual conflict, and if it did find an actual conflict, then that case appropriate for reversal. And that's what we're asking."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No. But you started -- at least, as I recall back in your brief, you started out by arguing that what puts the court on notice doesn't matter so long as the court is on notice. You said in Holloway counsel raised it before the court, and you're saying in this case, under the -- at least the rule that the court should have known of the -- of the potential conflict, that was the functional equivalent to counsel's raising it in Holloway, and therefore the result should be the same. As I understand Holloway, if the result were to be the same, we would not even look any further into the question of actual conflict. We would say if there was enough to put the court on notice, reverse. And I take it you're not arguing for that now, or are you?"

      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "speech": "They're equivalent to a certain extent, but the fact that the defense attorney raised it to the court has a certain significance. As the Solicitor General indicates in their -- in their brief, there is some significance to the defense attorney raising that issue to the court and the court's compulsion to inquire into it at that point. It's not as significant as the trial court's role in inquiring into that conflict, but it is significant. And Wood v. Georgia takes that significance, that component into effect when it requires an actual conflict, a showing of an actual conflict --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

It's consistent with the repeated admonition of this Court, that in order to claim an interference with the right to counsel, you have to show that it had some effect on the representation.

The fact that counsel has taken these steps of advising the court that he sees a conflict of interest, the fact that counsel tells the court, when they get to trial, that he is not able to examine his several clients because of the confidences he knows, that is, as -- as Holloway said, relying on counsel being in the best position to know.

Isn't the difference -- reading Holloway the way I am reading it, isn't the difference between Holloway and -- and Sullivan something like this? We realize that if, through no fault of anybody, through the -- the client was not asleep, the judge was not asleep -- it nonetheless turns out later that there was a conflict, we want to make sure that that conflict actually had an effect on representation before we -- we start reversing convictions. But if there was reason to believe in advance, if somebody told the judge like the lawyer in Holloway, that there is a problem here, we want to have an inducement on the trial court to pursue that problem right then and there. And in order to get that inducement, we're going to have a rule that says, you don't have to prove effect. All you have to prove is conflict. In other words, in order to induce the trial courts to be on their toes, the defendants later on have a lesser burden. Do you think that's the way to read Holloway and Sullivan together? And do you think that is a sensible rule?"

The fact that counsel has not raised any matter to the trial court when he is in the best position to know and when he does not see that there is a conflict sufficient enough to call to the court's attention over -- for an objection to be resolved, we have a different record.

The difference is not so much that the -- I mean, I guess the -- the answer is the defendant is not entitled to a different or more lenient standard of review of his conflict claim, you know, because of the judge's failure to act on notice of additional facts.

First, it is a central tenet of this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence that a Sixth Amendment violation does not occur unless there has been prejudice to the defense.

He's not going to be able to represent the defendant adequately. And the second is that prejudice inheres in the situation in which a judge orders a defense counsel, over his objection, to continue representation even though the attorney believes he is not going to be able to perform adequately. And those two circumstances together create a per se rule of prejudice, and it's a carve-out from the Sullivan rule."

The thrust of the respondent's argument here is that Holloway stands for the proposition that if a defense attorney raises an objection to the court and the court compels that representation over that objection, then that is where the prejudice is presumed. If you take this argument to its logical conclusion, then anytime a defense attorney raises an objection on the basis of a conflict to a court and the court compels that representation over that objection, then prejudice should be presumed. In other words, when you have a situation where a defense attorney raises an objection to the court, the court properly inquires of that defense attorney about that conflict and properly finds that there is no debilitating conflict here and then requires that -- that defense attorney to proceed with the representation, then under what the respondents say here, prejudice should be presumed. That's not what Holloway stands for. Holloway stands for the proposition that the trial court has the duty of protecting the essential rights of the defendant. The trial court has the duty of seeing that the Sixth Amendment rights of a defendant are protected. And in this case, the trial court failed in that responsibility. It knew or should have known of that conflict, failed to inquire into that conflict and that's where the prejudice lies here. I thank the Court."
