      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd first like to start by emphasizing three points to the Court, first that the Government's interpretation -- the Government s - construction of the statute in this case is extreme. It allows the INS to lock somebody up, potentially for life, just simply because their country of origin will not take them back. Secondly, our clients are in no way challenging their orders of deportation, or the Government's plenary power to create categories to deport them, and to deport them. They are simply asserting their Fifth Amendment right to liberty, which they retain until they are deported from this country. And third, the Government has other alternatives in this case, in these cases. They are not left unprotected. The INS retains a substantial statutory and regulatory authority to supervise Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas and those similarly situated. In stark contrast to the Government's statutory construction, the circuit court suggested a reasonable construction of this statute that allows for the detention beyond the removal period for a reasonable time period. This interpretation, this construction is consistent with the silence of the statute, which, as explained by the circuit court, invites the question of what time period are we talking about. The Government would seek a time period of \"indefinitely\", that word to be read into the statute."

The burden is not on us, and if you can't find a country, you're not going to be allowed into the public in this country, where you have not been given any permission to be?

What this Court has never done is taken this a step further and essentially condoned what could be lifetime detention for individuals who have in hand their full Fifth Amendment protections, and I would want to emphasize that Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas today are substantially constrained.

Why is that lesser punishment, if you consider it that, although it really isn't punishment, it's -- you know, that was the deal.

That general rule remains, and all they are asking for in this case, and the substantive due process claim here, is simply to ask INS to take into consideration the fundamental aspect that is really driving these cases, the fact that people are locked up for life.

At issue in this case, the constitutional issue in this case, is that people who enter this country are regarded as persons under the Constitution once they enter. That is the rule that pertains. The exception to that rule is a very narrow exception which is called the entry fiction, which is applied to people who are detained or interdicted at the border, and what the Government is proposing here is to have the exception swallow the rule.

The Government acknowledges all of that, and under Mezei you wouldn't have to let these people out at all, even if you knew that they wouldn't flee, and even if you knew that they might possibly pose a threat to the public, isn't that right?

We're not asking for Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas to have the same freedom that a citizen would have. They would be under supervision. If they violated the terms of that supervision they could be punished for up to 1 year for failing to abide by the terms of the supervision, and they could be punished up to 10 years if that misbehavior was seen as obstructing the actual deportation process."

      "speaker": "BARNARD",
      "speech": "What we're saying is, Your Honor, that if you found someone to be dangerous -- and the Ninth Circuit says in its opinion that it would depend on the circumstances of each case. If someone had a shoplifting conviction and they were detained for 90 days, or 120 days, and it wasn't reasonably foreseeable they'd be deported, perhaps that would be a reasonable period to release them, but if someone had a more serious conviction, I believe a district court could hold them somewhat longer. But if you're asking for a time period, I would suggest that the traditional time periods when the statute was silent -- the 1970 statute, it was 2 to 4 months, the statute in the fifties was 6 months -- and that would be a guidepost, but at some point you could not detain them beyond that, because the person is being held merely based on the fact that he's dangerous, and he's being treated in a manner that is different than any other person in this country. We don't have one set of constitutional rules for citizens and another set for --"

You shouldn't be able to hold him for any period just because you're worried that he'll commit another crime. I mean, surely that's the way we treat citizens. You can't hold a citizen in jail because you're worried he's going to commit a crime."

I think the Ninth Circuit said there are two factors here, and one of them is, can this person be deported within a reasonably foreseeable time? Once you're sure that the answer to that question is no, that's the end of the inquiry. I don't think that they were making any determination based on -- what they said is, people serve their time, we let them out. We don't take into account how dangerous they are in any other setting. Therefore, the only legitimate consideration is, does the Government have a reasonable expectation that they would be able to find a place to accept this person. Once it's clear that that's not in the cards, then it isn't -- at least the Ninth Circuit view is, it doesn't depend upon how dangerous this person is. Am I right in understanding that?"

      "speaker": "BARNARD",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Barnard, wouldn't the foreseeability be considerably affected by the rule that you're urging upon us? If I were the minister of interior, whoever is responsible for making these determinations in the Federal Republic of Germany, let us say, and the United States wants to send back the person that they say is a German citizen, who is obviously a bad actor and he's committed a lot of crimes, and that fits the description of at least one of the two here, I would not be very much inclined to say, oh yes, he is a German citizen, send him back. Now, I might be inclined to do that if I knew that the poor devil is not going to be allowed into the general population, that his choice is to be kept in detention in the United States. You're loading the dice against anybody being willing to take back bad actors. Why should they do it? The consequence of not taking them back is, they'll just be released in the general public in the United States instead of in the Federal Republic of Germany."

There were other countries involved in those cases, and not only did this Court reach the constitutional issue, but resolved it in the alien's favor. So if there were some attenuated foreign policy interest there, I would say that this Court in previous cases has not allowed that --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

If they don't take him back, he will have achieved exactly what he wants, which is to stay in the United States."

I would point out that the Government's theory in this case is that once the deportation order becomes final, the individuals are stripped of their constitutional rights. Both in Wong Wing and Witkovich deportation orders were final and the individuals were not stripped of their constitutional rights. In fact, this Court reached those issues and decided in favor of the alien. I would also point out that Mezei really should be limited to its unique set of facts.

That enactment was the culmination of measures beginning in 1988 by which Congress sought to address what had become the serious problem of criminal aliens within the United States.

As we point out in that brief, the INS twice last summer called Mr. Zadvydas in for an appointment, after he asked that that appointment be postponed, so it could be explained to him what information the INS had obtained from the Lithuanian consulate as to what information would be necessary to apply to Lithuania for citizenship based on the Lithuanian citizenship of his parents.

I think it's inherent in Justice Stevens' question, and I think it was raised by your response to Justice Ginsburg's Hendricks question, and I think it's focused by one of the green briefs, amicus briefs filed by, I think it was a group of law professors, and they said, what's wrong with the Government's argument that the order of deportation converts the individual back to the status of someone who has not yet been admitted is this: The status, the constitutional status of the individual who has never been admitted rests upon a patent fiction, and the patent fiction is that the individual is not in the United States, when we all know that the individual is in the United States. Illegally, yes, but in the United States, and the Fourteenth Amendment does not distinguish between citizens and others in this respect. It may very well be that that legal fiction is a very justifiable fiction, because otherwise the United States is defenseless against Mariel boat lifts and things like that, but it's another thing, as Justice Stevens' question suggests, to extend that legal fiction and say that the legal fiction takes you one step more, and that is, we're going to now assume that an entire further class of individuals, in fact, is not in the United States and is not subject to whatever the territorial claim that the Fourteenth Amendment seems to respect. What is your answer to the problem of extending legal fictions, because, what's in back of my mind is, in the back of my mind is, if legal fictions can support this restriction back on whatever the rights of persons are, then I suppose other legal fictions could accomplish the same purpose for other classes, so what is your response to the problem of legal fictions?"

We might have found a more candid way of doing it, but I can see the justification. You now want to extend that fiction to somebody who has been in the United States for quite sometime and is still here, and the fact that the statute may by definition say, they're the same, obviously doesn't control the constitutional inquiry."

It is no part of our submission that an alien who is illegally present, or who has been paroled into the United States in a case like Mezei, is not a person for purposes of protection independent of the immigration laws, but it's quite a different matter to say that the Due Process Clause was somehow intended to limit Congress' plenary power to protect the United States, and the safety of the United States. One other point that I'd like to make, because it's important to bear in mind, protecting the safety of the citizens of the United States and the community is not ancillary to, or simply incidental to an immigration consequence. It is part of the whole point of removal of the aliens in this situation, that they were, as Justice Scalia pointed out, essentially in this country conditioned upon their compliance with our laws. They broke our laws, they committed crimes, and they -- and committed crimes that demonstrate that they present a danger to the community."

You said, it affects our negotiations with Cambodia, and I was trying to think, how would it affect the negotiations knowing -- how would the difference between putting someone into prison and putting someone under close supervision, how that would affect the relation, the negotiating relationship of -- if the object is to keep this person from doing harm, I understand that's one thing. The other thing is our negotiating some kind of expatriation arrangement with Cambodia. What is the relevant difference between holding that person in prison and holding them under close supervision?"

We think there probably might be a constitutional component to that to the extent the Court concludes that there is any residual liberty interest at all. That would be the proper way to address this, not to attack as a substantive due process matter, which is all that's here."

      "speech": "Your questions presented don't raise the issue of judicial review one way or the other."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
      "speech": "No, that is absolutely correct, but the -- again, coming back to the central issue in this case, all that is at issue here is whether the Attorney General's detention pursuant to expressed statutory authority is reasonably related to the goals that have been advanced, and as long as the person was found by the Attorney General to be dangerous or a flight risk, the detention is reasonably related, and that detention is subject to periodic, automatic review by the Attorney General every year, and in intervening periods the alien can request a review of his status by presenting changed material circumstances. In that situation, we think that is a very reasonable response on behalf of the two political branches about how to deal with the severe problem of dangerous criminal aliens in our midst. It is an inherent part of the sovereignty of every nation to protect itself against aliens who that nation does not believe should be in its presence for purposes of national sovereignty, national security, but also the safety of the populace of that country, and that is what Congress and the Attorney General are responding to. Safety is not simply a question to be addressed by the States. When it comes to aliens in this country, it is Congress' responsibility, not that of the States, or in addition to that of the States, to protect the populace of the United States against the presence of dangerous criminal aliens in the United States, and that is what has been done here on the basis of a criminal prosecution and administrative procedures that unquestionably satisfied due process, and the only remaining -- in terms of giving Congress an interest with respect to aliens, it is the equivalent of a State's interest with respect to the mentally ill. In that situation, it is directly parallel to the interests of a State. When does a State come in and intervene with respect to the liberty interest of an individual? With respect to civil commitment, it is in the context of mental illness which gives the State a right to come in and look after the individual and protect the individual and the State. With respect to aliens, it is Congress' plenary power. That has been satisfied. That has been permanently extinguished, that liberty interest. All that remains, then, is the question of dangerousness, and, as this Court has held in the civil commitment cases, a State may place on the alien the burden of showing that he is no longer dangerous at the end of a particular period. There have been no questions here about the statutory authority of the Attorney General to detain the aliens, but we think it is clear that the Attorney General has that authority conferred by Congress."

    {
      "speaker": "STANSELL",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I have just four points I would like to make. The first is that the administrative process in this case. What 's fundamentally wrong about it, it takes absolutely no consideration that deportation is not foreseeable. If it did, and if the agency weighed foreseeability with actual and real evidence of dangerousness and flight risk, we would have no quarrel with the agency applying that constitutional test in reviewing these individuals. Secondly, as I just said, the test in any case has to be, is detention excessive in relationship to the legitimate Government's interest, and we feel like the district court in Mr. Ma's case had the proper test, balancing foreseeability of deportation with dangerousness, real evidence of dangerousness and flight risk. We would draw the line at, is deportation foreseeable, and say on balance everyone would get out on this case. This Court may disagree, and want to allow a broader balancing test where actual foreseeability might be a gradiated scale and allow for different balances to be drawn, but in any case, that's the test that should be applied. Third, that there's no authority for this Court to expand Mezei. The decision in Wong Wing is over 100 years, and that stands as a general rule that informs the Mezei narrow exception. Witkovich is similarly situated. Individuals who've been ordered deported did not lose their constitutional rights."
