They probably figure ­­ sign papers every five months or every day, and they choose insurers. They do all kinds of things. And it's the topping, the icing on the cake, that pushes it over the edge, which is that you have to fill out the form saying, I object, this is my insurer, you then can contact my employees, da, da, da, da, da. It's a whole bunch of things. All right. So the question is, putting that all together now, are they protected by RFRA? I think the reason that the Court went from Sherbert and Verner over to Smith was they couldn't figure out how to apply Sherbert and Verner. And it's Sherbert and Verner that RFRA picks up. And this is at least one difficulty with it, which is where I'm going. And I've even read St. Benedict. You know, not ­­ not for religious purposes, I'm trying to find out something about being a member of society. Sometimes when a religious person who's not a hermit or a monk is a member of society, he does have to accept all kinds of things that are just terrible for him. Think of the Quakers, the Quakers who object to Vietnam. Think of the people who object to laws protecting blasphemy. Think of the people who object to shoveling the snow in front of the walk that will lead to the abortion clinic. Think of the Christian Scientists who know when they report the accident, the child will go to the hospital or the adult and receive medical care that is against their religion. So there are loads of things. I've just given you four. Think of the taxes. Well, there's no question that doesn't violate the religious clause. But plenty of other things do. So what's the line? Why do the Quakers have to pay the taxes for Vietnam, but you don't find the religious Jew or Muslim getting an extra day off during the week when the law says nobody can work on Sunday because their sabbath is on Saturday? What is the line? And I've been reading and reading to try to find a fairly clear simple statement of what that line is and how it works.

It's too important. It's too universal. And then you come at a case like this, or like Sherbert itself. The thing that made Sherbert an easy case was the government of South Carolina had already taken care of the Sunday objectors. So at that point, their argument that the whole system would collapse if we take care of the Sabattarians, it was not a particularly persuasive argument. Here, they've taken care of the churches.

But on the flip side, if, as they suggest in their briefs, they are not actually willing to tolerate the problem with respect to all of those other people, but instead, think they can further their interest in other ways, the question becomes: Why are all of those other ways that are sufficient for all of those other people suddenly insufficient when it comes to Petitioner's employees? And that's the fundamental breakdown in the government's side of the case. More generally, I think we see an absence of evidence on many of the critical issues here. Let's assume for the sake of argument we knew what the size of the problem was, how many women out there actually lack access to contraceptive coverage. And we don't know the answer to that. And let's further assume that we knew how much of that problem would be reduced by forcing organizations like Petitioner's to comply. Would we reduce it by 1 percent? 15 percent? 50 percent? And we don't know that. We still don't know whether the government could achieve a comparable reduction through less burdensome means, and the very less burdensome means that it says are sufficient to further its interests with respect to all of the other employees who, like Petitioner's employees, don't get contraceptive coverage from an employer­based plan."

We've had a lengthy discussion about that. I think I've tried to show you that that ­­ I don't think you can argue that that exemption undermines the government's compelling interest. They claim that there is an exemption for employers who have fewer than 50 employees, but that's just wrong. In fact, there's no reason to think that virtually anybody in the ­­ in that category of employees of those small employers isn't getting contraceptive coverage as part of their regular health care from the regular doctors. And let me explain why that is. There is no exemption from the contraceptive requirement for that group. Proof of it is that several Petitioners are in that group of fewer than 50 employees, and they're asking for the ­­ and they're asking for the ­­ and they're ­­ and they've raised the RFRA claim here. So ­­ and that's because when employers in that group provide coverage, they have to meet the contraceptive coverage requirements so the employees get the coverage from their regular doctor as part of their regular health plan. Then also, if your employer is not providing you coverage in that group, then you go on an Exchange, and then you purchase a policy on the Exchange. And that policy provides you with contraceptive coverage as part of your regular health plan from your regular doctor, or you ­­ you ­­ if you are eligible, you apply for Medicaid. And Medicaid gives you contraceptive coverage as part of your regular health plan from your regular doctor."

The difference is with ­­ when somebody works for a grandfathered plan, for example, in that category, or for a church, the ­­ those people are already getting insurance.

I'd like to start with the universities, Justice Kennedy, because I don't think it's the case that just because Congress exempts churches, that it has to exempt the universities. What it needs, though, is a rationale for drawing the line. Now, my friend on the other side says the line doesn't have to be perfect. Well, under compelling interest and least restrictive alternatives, it at least has to be pretty good. And the line that they have drawn here is absurd, and I would urge you to look at the amicus brief filed by the Dominican Sisters and authored by a former head of the tax division, because it explains the line they have picked, using 6033 of the tax code, makes no sense. That's an informative filing requirement, but there is no substantive difference. If my clients filed the form, they get the same tax exempt status as the churches. The only difference in that provision is whether you filed the form. The substantive treatment is exactly the same. To use that line to draw a distinction between churches and universities or the Little Sisters of the Poor is a terrible line to draw. And if you go back to thinking ­­"

Their original justification for the line they drew, Justice Kennedy, was that the exempted organizations would be more likely to hire co­religionists and, therefore, less likely to have employees who would use the products. My clients equally enjoy the Title VII exemption which gives them the right to hire co­religionists so their original rationale applies equally to my clients. You have to draw a sensible line. Now as to the exemptions, I mean, I will respectfully disagree with Professor Laycock."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
      "speech": "Would it have been better to say, churches, you've got to tell us you're going to claim an exemption, because not every church is religious, has the same religious tenets. So is that what you would have preferred? Is that the ­­ the sort of incentive you want to put out there? Is that the message you're giving, which is, there is lots of rules that apply differently to churches because we recognize they are special? Others may be special like them, but it's clear to tell what a church is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Let me answer both questions together. First of all, the exemption is not just limited to churches. It applies to religious orders. And if my clients would have just stuck to their knitting and not helped the elderly poor, they could qualify. But to answer both of these questions together, not all exemptions are created equal. And Professor Laycock is a great scholar, but even he admitted he didn't understand the details of this particular plan. He didn't get into that. He left it to the parties. And I think he subsequently said that if there really was a requirement for these entities to contract, and there is, then even he would recognize there is a substantial burden. But the important point is not all exemptions are created equal. If you create an exemption for small employers, that's a rationale exercise with enforcement discretion. If you create an exemption for ­­ take the O Centro case. If the exemption for peyote had been for a Schedule 5 substance that was less dangerous, maybe the government would have won. Their problem there was that the government had already exempted the sacramental use of peyote, a Schedule 1 substance. So of course, they had a hard time arguing why they couldn't provide an exemption for a different Schedule 1 substance. All of these exemptions have to be treated the same, Justice Breyer. There is no excuse. There is no other way than to do the hard work of looking at the exemptions and seeing whether they make sense. One of the cases that Congress clearly wanted to embrace in RFRA was Yoder. Now, Yoder was a relatively hard case because there basically were no exemptions. If the State of Wisconsin had already provided an exemption for the Mennonites and it already provided an exemption for the students upstate where the schools are farther apart, Yoder would have been an easy, easy case. You can't make an exemption for all these grandfathered plans. And please, it's not that this is a sunset provision. If you look at Joint Appendix page 956, they link the grandfather provision to the idea that if you like your plan, you can keep it. So that's not going away. Just in closing, my clients would love to be a conscientious objector, but the government insists that they be a conscientious collaborator. There is no such thing."
