Why would Congress want to exclude review for discretionary judgments by the Attorney General that are recited explicitly to be discretionary in the statute, but provide judicial review for judgments that are just as lawfully discretionary because the Attorney General is given the authority to make them discretionary and has done so? I mean, a discretionary judgment is a discretionary judgment. Why -- at least if it's a legitimate one. I can understand why you would say discretion which is given to the Attorney General under the statute, as opposed to discretion which he has wrongfully assumed, but -- but both -- both exercises of discretion are just as lawful, right, under the statute? One is explicit in the statute, and the other is pursuant to the authority of the Attorney General to make it discretionary. Why would Congress want the one to be subject to judicial review and not the other?"

      "speaker": "SCHOENFIELD",

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

That makes some sense. And I -- but where discretion is lawfully exercised, why would -- why would Congress say, oh, when the discretion is lawfully exercised because the statute says so, we have one approach, but where discretion is lawfully exercised only because the statute allows the Attorney General to prescribe discretion, we will not allow it? I don't understand why -- why it would want to do that."

It deals with -- like, rule 60(b) of the Federal rules, it deals with potentially new evidence, matters that weren't available to bring initially, and it's important that potential mistakes be reviewed."

The battered spouse provision specifically says that in the Attorney General's discretion, he may waive the time limit for the 1 year for the battered spouse. Now, that surely is discretion specified -- and I think the word \"specified\" is important here -- specified in subchapter 2. So there should be no judicial review as to that. You would have to agree with that, wouldn't you?"

And I would like to go right to one of the questions that was asked by Justice Scalia, which is: How do you make sense out of this statute, in terms of what Congress is doing in not allowing judicial review of specifications of discretion in regulations, but -- I'm sorry, and allowing judicial review of things that are specified in regulations, but not things that are specified in the subchapter? And I think that the answer to this question comes from the text of the statute, particularly if you compare the two things that are in 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and (ii), that all of the things that are listed in (i) and that are covered by (ii) are substantive decisions that are made by the Executive in the immigration context as a matter of grace, things that involve whether aliens can stay in the country or not. And those are matters, at the end of the day, that the Executive, in the exercise of its immigration and foreign affairs power, has the authority to decide and that Congress did not want the Federal courts in the business of reviewing. But what the Federal courts have often reviewed are things where discretion is committed by regulation, and these are procedural matters that relates to whether an alien had a fair shot of getting his claim heard by the agency and by the Federal courts. Things like --"

And here, Congress didn't say any time there is a discretionary decision, which is what implicit discretion would go to. It says: When discretionary authority is specified. Under this subchapter, that means that there needs to be something specific, specified, explicit, specifically noted in the text of the statute."

All those matters would be reviewable, I guess, in your view."

I don't think your -- I can't find a reading of this statute that makes sense, except for one which I am trying on, and I'm sure there’s a lot wrong with it, that what Congress meant to do here is to take all the procedural decisions, including reopening ones, and treat them the same way that they are treating the substantive decisions. So that in his case, he wins. Because he gets review of the substance, he should get review of a reopening. It's the same thing. And in some other case, they'd lose, because if you don't get review of the substance, you shouldn't get review of the reopening. Both are the same thing. They are just filed at different times. So that, to me, is the only reading of this statute that I have yet found that made sense. But since no one argues for it, I'm sure I must be making some huge mistake.

And it directed all of the attorneys in the Office of Immigration Litigation not to be making this jurisdiction-stripping argument anymore. And it has been the United States' consistent position since then, and we urged it to the Seventh Circuit below, that when you look at the text of the statute, you look at authority specified under this subchapter. It’s Congress that specifies authority. \"Specified under this subchapter\" means \"in this subchapter.\" It means \"in the text of the subchapter.\" And we have to answer this question in this case by looking at the text that Congress enacted. I acknowledge that there is not legislative history, for example, to tell us what Congress intended to do here, but we think that the answer comes from the text of the statute.

In fact, it noted that judicial review of motions to reopen, albeit under the abuse-of-discretion standards, goes back to 1916, and we just didn't see anything in 1996 to suggest that Congress wanted to change that.

And those regulations existed in substantially the same form until 1996, when they were amended to make discretion explicit in the regulation, and the 1996 is essentially the same form that it’s in today. So there has -- there has always been an assumption that there can be such a thing as reopening. And I -- I just want to focus on what Congress was doing in 1996, because I think it's very telling. We know that Congress was focused on enacting bars to judicial review, and we also know that Congress was codifying for the first time an alien's right to file one motion to reopen. But Congress just didn't make any effort to make denials of motions to reopen judicially unreviewable, and that's very telling, because there’s any number of ways that Congress could have done that."

Congress -- excuse me -- this Court in 1988 recognized that provision as requiring a constitutional exception. And I think Congress, acting in 1996, would have recognized that the same -- very similar language in section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would also have a constitutional exception.

None had extended it to motions to reopen, but in CDI Services v. Reno in 2002, the Sixth Circuit recognized section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as extending to regulations. That was in the context of a -- a petition for a visa extension. And Onyinkwa v. Ashcroft in 2004, the -- excuse me -- Eighth Circuit similarly recognized that. And then in Yerkovich v. Ashcroft in the same year, the Eighth -- excuse me -- the Tenth Circuit also recognized 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as extended to regulations.

Now, what we're talking about is a big set of cases, including frauds and various things where there is some discretion substantively to let the person stay. Now, on that big set of cases, the statute says if it's fraud, et cetera, we don't want review. But if it's asylum, we want review. Isn't that how it works, basically -- basically?"

The Attorney General was making a -- a decision as to what rule of decision to apply in motions to reopen, and Congress later attached the jurisdictional significance."

With respect to your question about other examples of situations in which an agency is left to make a determination that has jurisdictional consequences, I have a few examples. The first is the Communications Act of 1934. This Court recognized in Global Crossing that the agency there could determine that a -- that conduct under the Act was unreasonable. That is an administrative determination under one section of the Act. It has the consequence under another section of the Act of creating a cause of action for individuals to recover in damages. A second example is actually section 701(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act which refers to categories of decisions that are committed to agency discretion by law. Courts have understood that that is not the broad subset of discretionary decisions but instead that subcategory of discretionary decisions for which there is no law to apply, and many courts recognize that the agencies may create the law to apply in those circumstances. So an agency may enact a regulation that binds the agency's own discretion and renders the issue reviewable where it would not otherwise have been. So there --"

This is -- this is provision 1252(a)(2)(A) -- and borrowing the term “Romanette” -- Romanette (i), (ii), and (iv) -- refers clearly to things provided in subsection (e) of the statute; whereas, Romanette (iii) refers to the application of such section to individual aliens including the determination made under section 1225(b)(1)(B) of this title. That is a determination by immigration officials at the border as to whether an individual who is otherwise inadmissible may have grounds to be detained and allowed to go through asylum proceedings. Clearly there, where Congress recognized that there was an administrative determination to be made, it used the preposition \"under\" to reach through the statute to the administrative determination. I also have three examples, Your Honor, of situations in chapter 8 in which Congress actually uses the phrase \"specified under,\" the same phrase at issue here, to refer again through the statute to administrative determinations. These are not unfortunately in the briefs. 8 U.S.C. 1227 -- excuse me. Let me start with 8 U.S.C. 1375a(a)(4) and (a)(6). This is a provision that calls for the preparation of a pamphlet on the legal rights of immigrant victims of domestic violence. Paragraph 1375a(a)(6) calls for the pamphlet to be distributed and made available, quote, \"in the language as specified under paragraph (4).\" Turning to paragraph (4) then, it clearly anticipates an administrative determination, because it says the Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with the Attorney General and the State Department shall determine at least 14 languages into which the pamphlet is translated. So that's an example of Congress using \"specified under\" to refer, yes, in the first instance to statutory language, as it does in our provision, specified under subchapter 2, but it is a situation in which the statutory language to which \"specified under\" refers clearly anticipates some exercise of administrative authority. Here, the exercise of administrative authority is the specification of languages. In our example, it is the specification of procedures for motions to reopen."

The motion to reopen regulations very clearly implements Section 1229(a), which is in subchapter 2. And a question asked earlier was where one would look to determine whether Regulation 1003.2 is a valid regulation, a reasonable interpretation of the statute, and for that, I believe one would have to look at the content of section 1229(a), which is in subchapter 2, so although --"

I believe that “authority” there references the authority that is clearly granted in section 1103 to implement the entire chapter. But what the section does is to indicate where the specification of discretion must be located, and in this case, it must be located in either the statute or regulations issued under it, and to see that, I think the easiest illustration is to suppose that the statute read: No court shall have jurisdiction to review any decision specified as discretionary -- excuse me -- decision, the authority for which is specified as discretionary in the subchapter or in regulations issued thereunder. If Congress had used belts and suspenders in that way and made itself doubly clear, there would be no question here that the word \"authority\" was somehow superfluous or misplaced."

      "speech": "Section 1252(b)(6) mandates that review of the underlying decision should be consolidated with review of a motion to reopen. I think that tells us several things. The first and foremost of which is Congress intended there to be review of motions to reopen -- at least some motions to reopen. To try to go back to Justice Breyer's questions, I think one can extrapolate from the consolidation provision that, if it is impossible to consolidate because there is no review of the underlying decision, you do not get to have a review of those motions to reopen. And that is referenced, I believe, in the government's brief, at footnote 15 -- excuse me -- with some cases cited, where courts have so held. We did not focus on that because that is not Mr. Kucana's issue. As the Court has alluded to, Mr. Kucana's issue is the nature of asylum based upon changed country conditions, and those situations are where it may be a matter of life and death, certainly, also a matter of -- of liberty, to be able to bring forward new evidence, which did not exist before, about changed country conditions, and it is not two bites at the apple. It's the first bite at current conditions, which is essential. With regard to the case of Webster v. Doe, that my colleague cited orally, that was an extremely unusual case in which the Court essentially said that it could not -- it did not have any criteria to evaluate the discretion used by the director of the CIA. That is certainly not the situation we have here, where we are dealing with motions to reopen, which are analogous to rule 60(b) and which are routinely reviewed on abuse-of-discretion standard. Additionally, let me note that, if you were to determine that the statutory language “specified under” is ambiguous that the applicable canons both point us to favoring judicial review -- favoring judicial review and not essentially allowing the Executive to pass a regulation which insulates itself from judicial review. That would be both the clear statement requirement as well as the principle laid down by this Court that, in an ambiguous situation dealing with deportation, ambiguities are to be construed in favor of the alien.
