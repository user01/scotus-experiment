Instead, what he got was a moving target. The trial judge's later reconsideration of Smith's acquittal placed him in jeopardy for that same offense twice. Smith's position on the matter is completely faithful to this Court's precedent, and it makes sense in the real-world practice of criminal law. The State, on the other hand, asks this Court to make exceptions to the rule, long-held, that acquittals terminate jeopardy."

The judge can say, yes, I've made this ruling and it sticks. You see, I'm going to give you a separate piece of paper that says judgment, but if I don't give you that separate piece of paper, even though I said judgment granted, it doesn't count until the very end of the case.

Then there's no repose element because the -- the defendant is on notice that this may not be final. What would be the -- your position in that case if a statute like that were on the books? And if you say that that's different, then I'll say, well, suppose the supreme court of Massachusetts just makes up this rule as a judicial matter."

I mean, what -- what defense counsel would do that after having spent his whole effort to say it was the other guy, it wasn't this defendant?

To -- to do that, to say I wasn't there, that's my main defense, but then, jury, I'd like you also to consider that if you think that I was there, then -- it -- it really doesn't fly as a criminal defense."

Maybe she was too hasty, and then a trial judge will say, my law clerk went to the library at lunch, there was a Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts case going just the other way, so of course, I confess error, but the defendant isn't prejudice. The defendant hadn't put on a -- well, the -- it came up at closing. Right?

It -- it is -- granted, for purposes of this argument, that it's permissible for States to order judges to withhold rulings, that there shall be no ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence prior to the return of a jury verdict. Louisiana, for example, does that, and I think Oklahoma. But for the Supreme Judicial -- Judicial Court of Massachusetts to say that an acquittal has no force is simply straight contravening what this Court has said.

Every judge is going to say, yes, looks as though you -- you got them there, but I'll -- I'll just hold onto this until things are over, and then I'll rule.

You know, it had to be a barrel less than 16 inches. So is there any evidence here of the shotgun? And she, I guess, forgot that there was a lot of evidence that it was a pistol. Now, there aren't many pistols that are 16 inches long. So she's thinking, something may be missing here. She's a little uncertain, but she writes acquittal, and then a few minutes later, she thinks, let's say, oh, my God, there was all that evidence about the pistol. So I shouldn't have done that. I mean, how -- how is a judge like that, a hypothetical -- what's she supposed to do? Is she supposed to say, I better not enter anything, because after all, I don't care if the defendant has to produce a case?

Certainly that common law right of reconsideration could not run afoul of this Court's double jeopardy jurisprudence, but the appeals court specifically stated that the Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated because there was no second proceeding and that the judge in this case, therefore, was permitted to reconsider her ruling."

And at the end of the case, the prosecution asked for reconsideration of the exclusion of the evidence, and the judge ultimately determined not to go ahead and let that evidence back in, but specifically said if I had let it back in, I would have vacated my motion for required finding and allowed the case to go to the jury.

      "speech": "Right, because we read that to be the holding of Smalis.

First of all, this Court has drawn that distinction in Swisher v. Brady where it initially said that the two-stage system of adjudication is -- in Maryland that was at issue in that case was permissible because it entailed continued proceedings before the initial tribunal rather than an appeal to a second tribunal. And the Court specifically distinguished its prior decisions in Jenkins v. the United States and Kepner, both of which involved appellate review. And the other basis for drawing a distinction between appeals on one hand and reconsiderations by the trial court on the other is historical tradition. I think the Court could look to history and history would show that on one hand trial courts have always had inherent authority to reconsider their mid-trial rulings because the practical exigencies of trial are such that trial courts inevitably will err on occasion, and the ends of justice require trial courts to have the authority to revisit their mid-trial rulings."

      "speech": "We would, Justice Kennedy, but it raises a distinct problem because one value that's served by the Double Jeopardy Clause is the defendant's interest in preventing the prosecution from honing its evidentiary case by repeated efforts. And if the trial judge were permitted to reopen the case to give the prosecution that opportunity, it at least would implicate that interest. Now, we still think that the proper line is jury discharge, but we understand that that hypothetical would present a distinct interest. Now, with respect to historical tradition on appeals, the historical tradition is clear that the government has lacked authority at common law to take an appeal in a criminal proceeding. This Court relied on that common law tradition as early as Sanges v. the United States and it's repeated that understanding in Carroll v. the United States and Arizona v. Manypenny, and that's why the Court construes statutory grants of authority to the government to take an appeal in criminal cases quite narrowly. And so I think the Court could draw a distinction between reconsiderations by the trial court and appeals by looking to historical tradition, and the Court often looks at history to shape the contours of double jeopardy protections. And that would afford the case -- the Court a basis for saying that in Smalis, while appeals were forbidden, in this case trial court reconsideration should be permitted. And I think the lens through which the Court would do that under the Double Jeopardy Clause is the valued interest in giving the prosecution one full and fair opportunity to prove its case in the sense that while that full and fair opportunity may exclude an appeal, because the Court held as much in Smalis, it doesn't exclude reconsiderations."

But even if we're dealing with a situation in which the ruling clearly falls on the definitive side of the line, you'd still have the problem that a trial court might be convinced that it's correct and rule definitively but still be incorrect.

Now, that might be seen to fall on the tentative side of the line, but that's exactly the effect of this -- of the trial judge's ruling as a matter of Massachusetts law.

It would be equally the case, for example, as the State mentioned with respect to an evidentiary ruling that barred the prosecution from introducing a category of evidence, but then the trial judge, later in the proceedings, wanted to revisit that ruling. The question would be whether revisiting the ruling resulted in prejudice to the defendant because the defendant had detrimentally relied on the trial judge's initial determination.

The Government is also trying to move this case into the particular tribunal analysis. That comes from cases that are mistrials. This is an acquittal. This is not a particular tribunal case. As to the judge resolving all the issues in a bench trial and -- and that's why that -- that acquittal would be more final than a motion for a directed verdict, it was a motion for a directed verdict. It was a demurrer in Smalis. It was the exact same standard that the judge applied in that case. As to prejudice, prejudice has never been a factor in this Court's double jeopardy analysis. As a matter of fact, in -- in one of the really classical statements, Ex parte Lange, if you look at the facts of that case, that looks like complete gamesmanship. The defendant was sentenced to a jail term and a fine when the -- the statute only authorized a jail term or a fine. He said, oh, I'll pay -- I'll pay the fine. It's a get-out - of-jail-free card. There's complete gamesmanship, but prejudice was not a factor. And in fact, this Court has said prejudice is not open to judicial examination in double jeopardy cases. As to honing, in -- in fact, in Rumsey - -"

But it's not evidentiary honing. In Rumsey, it was only argument that was presented at -- at the remand after acquittal. Justice Souter, I want to heartily endorse the -- the way you phrased what the rule should be, which is, trial judges, you ought to take this seriously. Pretermitting the prosecution's case is a very serious matter. You cannot take it back. So think about it. Do it right the first time. As to -- to rule 25 itself, it's true that the -- the judges can't reserve. So what they do as -- as a matter of practice in Massachusetts is they simply deny, and -- and they deny the first one and they have two more opportunities, one at the close of the defendant's case and they have an opportunity at the close of -- after the jury has returned a verdict. At each of those steps, they can make a motion for acquittal. As to the full and fair opportunity, this Court said in Martin Linen that the Government has a right to try the case. They do not have a right to have it proceed to verdict. I'm just taking that straight from Martin Linen. As to, finally, whether or not State law sort of insulates this from Federal -- I see my time is up. Thank you."
