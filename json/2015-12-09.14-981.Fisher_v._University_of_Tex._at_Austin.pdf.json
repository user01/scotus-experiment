In reviewing the Fifth Circuit's initial decision in what we call Fisher I, seven members of this Court reaffirmed that a clear precondition to the use of race as an admissions factor was the ability to satisfy what was called the \"demanding burden of strict scrutiny\" articulated in Grutter and Bakke. By establishing that she was considered for admission to UT under a system that discriminated against her on the basis of her race, Ms. Fisher placed upon UT the burden of ­­ of proving, by evidence of record, that its use of race was, first, in pursuit of a compelling, constitutionally legitimate interest expressed with sufficient clarity and concreteness to allow a reviewing court to determine, first, that the use of race was a necessary last resort in pursuing the interest defined, taking into account reasonably available nonracial alternatives."

One, why the record supports the Texas legislature's conclusion in 2009 that the holistic plan at issue was a necessary complement to the State's Top 10 Percent Law; two, why the record shows that Texas's holistic policy has had a meaningful impact on diversity at the University of Texas; and, three, why the record absolutely forecloses any claim that University of Texas has adopted a quota. With respect to the first question of necessity, there are three principle ways in which the record shows that the plan at issue was a necessary complement. First, as Justice Breyer mentioned, there is a significant portion of the admissions pool, all out­of­State students, all students from Texas high schools that don't rank, some of the best high schools in the State, and all students just below the top 10 percent who are nevertheless great students who aren't eligible for admission under the top 10 percent at all. And the Fifth Circuit found that without the consideration of race in the mix for those students, admissions would approach an all white enterprise. Secondly, the record in this case shows ­­"

But the fact is, is that ­­ that the way that the Top 10 Percent Law admits minority students is by admitting those students from the lower­performing, racially identifiable schools. And the way ­­ the reason we know that is because if you look at the bill analysis decided by Justice Ginsburg in her dissent the last time we were here, that analysis specifically says on page 4, \"Because of the persistence of segregation in this State, minority students will be admitted under the top 10 percent plan.\""

And for the holistic admittees, African­Americans and Hispanics, it's 26 percent. This is from a Class of 2008. So there isn't ­­ it seems to me it refutes the idea that all of these minority students who were admitted under ­­ or most of them admitted under the 10 percent plan come just from these predominantly overwhelmingly black and Hispanic schools with poor students.

Number three, the University made clear that because of the decrease in student body diversity under the very race­neutral policies that our opponents are asking this Court to impose, that additional measures were necessary to make sure that it was achieving its educational objectives.

Because the University of Texas has heeded this Court's message. It's taken three­quarters of the class that it selects through a facially race­neutral system, the Top 10 Percent Law. And what we're here debating is whether or not it can complement that policy by taking race into account for a quarter. Now, it may actually be that the university could achieve more diversity through the pure Grutter­Bakke­style plan, but we think, working with the Texas legislature, we've come up with a hydrid ­­ hybrid plan that works together to both ­­ to both address this Court's concerns about using race too much in the process, and addressing University of Texas's legitimate, core academic concerns about compiling a class that's diverse in all the ways that are appreciated by Bakke. If I could read one aspect of the deposition testimony here. This is from Ms. Ishop on page 253a of the Joint Appendix, and she explains why top 10 percent alone is not sufficient. What she says is, quote, \"Considering an applicant on the basis of just their test score and class rank leaves out all of that life experience and circumstantial experience that an applicant faces. It's also important not ­­ not only to how they developed and the type of student they are, but also to what they contribute to our campus.\" That's what the holistic policy adds. If you exclude race from that mix, you not only aren't looking at the individual in all its respects ­­ and race still does matter in Austin and across this country ­­ but you're ­­ you're preventing the university from rounding out its class from complementing the single­minded way that the Top 10 Percent Law to achieve its diversity objectives in a way that is narrowly tailored to its interests, which this Court has found compelling."

One of the things the University says it's looking for is students with high SAT scores who are not in the top 10 percent of their class.

And the ­­ the principal argument that my friend Mr. Rein makes in challenging that is, well, actually a lot of that is post hoc rationalization, in particular, the effort to find whether you call it qualitative diversity, diversity within diversity is all post hoc rationalization, that is simply not so. If you look at page 1 of the Supplemental Joint Appendix, the first page of the 2004 Proposal, the University specifically says that what it's trying to accomplish is to create a diversity of perspectives among minority students.

Again, the University of Texas' plan has every one of what the Court in Grutter at page 334 said were the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan. No quota. Everybody competes against everybody else. No automatic award of points. Modest factor. And in addition ­­ and this goes to your question, Justice Kennedy, about whether there is an argument here that race is determinative ­­ Texas is different from the University of Michigan's law school plan in every one of the four ways that Your Honor identified as ­­ as being potentially troublesome and making race determinative.

He said that, in the plans of Grutter and the plans of Bakke, those were okay in respect to narrow tailoring because they did compare the students one after another and use race as a plus factor.
