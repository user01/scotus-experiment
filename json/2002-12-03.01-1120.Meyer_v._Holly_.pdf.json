      "speech": "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The question -- excuse me. The question presented should be answered with the following bright line rule: Imposition of vicarious liability under the FHA should be determined by application of established rules of corporate and agency law not criteria unique to the FHA. Under these principles, corporate shareholders and officers are not vicariously liable for the torts of the other agents of the corporation. The Ninth Circuit held that a different rule should apply under the FHA, that vicarious liability could be based on control alone. That is not, nor should it be, the law. While the starting -- the starting point for the analysis is necessarily the statute itself, while Congress has authority to expand the class of persons liable for violation of a Federal law, when it has done so, it has done so expressly. The FHA was never -- which neither defines nor expands the class of persons liable under the act, and as this Court stated in Bestfoods, this silence is dispositive. Specifically, Congress has spoken directly when it has wished to impose a control test. For example --"

Based on this record, could we go on to say that under California law and real estate law generally, the real estate salesman is the agent of the broker, and therefore the broker is liable under agency law?"

    {
      "speaker": "BENEDON",
      "speech": "My -- Your Honor, my answer to that is -- is several-fold. First, the distinction needs to be made between a corporate broker and an individual broker. Mr. Meyer in this case is a corporate officer who holds a broker's license solely as the officer of the corporation. The corporation is the employer of the agent. The agent operates under the license held by the corporation."

Are those different certificates?"

    {
      "speaker": "BENEDON",

There are separate licenses issued by the Department of Real Estate in California: one to individuals who act as brokers, and one to individuals who are brokers only in their capacity as officers of a corporation. Those are separate licenses. The only license in this cases was held by Mr. Meyer as an officer of the corporation. He could not step outside the corporation and act as a broker. His existence as a broker depended on the corporation. He could not transact --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "May I ask you this question? You explained to Justice Scalia that there is no California case holding a corporate broker liable in this situation, as I understand. Are there any California cases going the other way? Has it ever -- has the issue ever been presented to the California courts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENEDON",
      "speech": "Yes, it has, Your Honor. In two cases, there have been, one -- one State case and one district court case cited in our -- in our briefs, in the -- re Grabau case. They've held that the California statutory scheme imposes only a disciplinary remedy for any violations of the scheme such that a broker -- a designated officer/broker who violates any of the provisions of the statute may be subject to discipline, but is not the basis of a civil action."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speech": "-- prongs or the other facets of your answer?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENEDON",
      "speech": "The other facets is that liability under the FHA cannot be premised on California agency law. There, the -- the agency under the FHA is determined on Federal rules of agency. To determine Federal agency, this Court held in General Contractors, you look to the Restatement which has a two-prong test. One is the right of control, but the other is that the person controlled has to be acting on behalf of the principal. Here, the agent works -- is working on behalf of the corporation. In this case when Mr. Crank went out and did real estate transactions, he was acting on behalf of Triad. He was not acting on behalf of Meyer. The problem with looking at each State's structure is we're going to end up with a patchwork construction of a Federal statute. The law may be different in Nevada than from Oregon than from Washington than from West Virginia."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENEDON",
      "speech": "To answer that question, I think you still need to make a distinction between individual brokers and corporate licensed brokers. We do not dispute that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I -- I was simply addressing the point of whether or not State law as opposed to Federal law controls. And if it's the general law in most States that the broker is the principal, then that would certainly be sufficient for the imposition of liability under this Federal scheme. Would it not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENEDON",
      "speech": "Again, I -- I disagree, Your Honor. I would say that the rules still -- you need to still look at the Federal law of agency rather than how the State defines the relationship between the broker and the agent. You -- again, you look to the Federal rules of agency to determine agency under the FHA."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I thought you said those were general common law principles that are -- presumably the States would share."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENEDON",
      "speech": "The general law principles applied in the broker/agent context would establish that the agent -- the sales agent -- is the agent of the principal broker when the broker is acting in his individual capacity when the agent is acting on behalf of the principal, of the individual broker, and subject to that broker's control. The situation is different when it's a officer/broker who is not -- the agent in that situation is not acting on behalf of the officer. He's acting on behalf of the corporation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Then if I understand your argument correctly, you're saying that the discussion, whether it's California law or Federal common law, is in this case at least academic because under California law, if you were to apply it, there is no relief for these plaintiffs, that the only remedy where it's -- the license is held in the corporate name is a disciplinary sanction?"
    },

      "speaker": "BENEDON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENEDON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But I thought you said that if -- if this were a license to an individual broker, if this were held -- the license were held by Meyer as an individual -- that he would then have a principal agent relationship with Crank. Is that not so?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENEDON",
      "speech": "That is correct, Your Honor, if it's an individual broker's license. I think I may have caused some confusion. Under general principles of agency law, common law principles of agency law, the sales agent is in an agent principal relationship with an individual broker. If there is a violation of the act by the broker under California law, then he would be subject to disciplinary action. That is separate and apart from vicarious liability under the FHA, which would adhere based on the principal agent relationship."

      "speaker": "BENEDON",

We hold that the theory and doctrine of corporate veil- piercing is -- is available in the appropriate case as it would be under any case under the general common law, although here it's been -- it wasn't raised and it's been waived, and it's never been proven."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Right. Now, so if it came up on a motion for summary judgment, then whatever -- whatever evidence the plaintiffs were going to rely on for the veil-piercing would have had to have been brought forward. Isn't that right?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I thought that if -- that a judgment winner, as the Holleys are at this stage, can defend the judgment on another ground. In other words, the Ninth Circuit ruled in their favor and now they're saying, well, here's another theory on which we could prevail. I didn't know -- certainly they can't get an immediate victory, but if they attempt to defend the judgment on that basis, aren't they then entitled to go back and make the case rather than taking from them their victory and saying you lose? They say, but we have another theory that would be viable. Up till now, we won with this one. Why isn't that altogether appropriate they should now be given a chance to air that other theory in support of the judgment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENEDON",
      "speech": "They -- the theory was never raised below. An alter ego is in and of itself a fact- driven inquiry. Where it's -- and so the fact that it wasn't raised below, it's -- it's now been waived. It can't be raised for the first time in this Court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Even if -- even if it had been raised, my understanding is in -- in order to have it sent back on the -- on the basis that although the court below relied on one theory, it could have relied on the other, the motion for summary judgment put the plaintiff to his proof to -- to at least come up with facts, the assertion of facts, not the demonstration of them, but the assertion of facts that would support the other theory. And the only fact contained here is control. So if control is -- does not suffice to pierce veils, that's the end of the case, it seems to me."

He paid the taxes in his own Social Security number. He made various transactions that violated the terms under which it was supposed to be the corporate form, and he didn't train the person properly. I mean, they have a list of things which I take it they didn't just make up, that they're there in the record. Then -- and then they say that, well, in the Ninth Circuit brief, what it says in the footnote is that evidence -- evidence will show that Meyer is the sole shareholder of Triad, and thus an argument to pierce the corporate veil would be meritorious. Well, they don't list all those things in that footnote. That's true. But we should send it back and let the Ninth Circuit decide. I guess that's basically their argument, and I think I want to hear as complete a response to that as -- as you have. Maybe I've heard it already."

      "speaker": "BENEDON",
      "speech": "No. You -- I would like to amplify on that, Your Honor. The issue of -- of alter ego that's been now raised for the first time in this -- in this Court by the Solicitor General is based on speculation beyond the showing that there was sole ownership and that there is no insurance coverage. Everything else is unsupported by the record in terms of establishing that there was a failure to adhere to corporate formalities, that there was under- capitalization. All that is speculation.

There was a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. In the complaint at that time, there were essentially two theories. The complaint said that Mr. Meyer should be liable as an individual because he owned the corporation, and the complaint also said that Mr. Meyer should be liable because he was the officer/broker. The district court granted in part, even with respect to the Fair Housing Act claim, the 12(b)(6) motion and, in particular, held that the allegations of the complaint with respect to ownership under no circumstances could lead to liability. And the only thing that the district court did not grant 12(b)(6) on was the issue with respect to liability based on officer/broker. That led to discovery. The district court then granted summary judgment because it was the district court's theory on that issue that there could not be liability unless Mr. Meyer held an individual broker's license as opposed to what he holds in this case, which is a license through Triad, or more properly, according to the California law, Triad holds the license through him. So with all respect, what the district court held in the 12(b)(6) motion was that no set of facts that the plaintiffs could prove could justify veil-piercing. We never got --"

In fact, in a colloquy with the district court, the defendant's counsel, after the 12(b)(6) motion, Your Honor, when the only thing left was the summary judgment with respect to the broker situation, the district court said, is there any money in the company?

He allows going forward the claim based on corporate broker, and he specifically refers to a case -- this is the 12(b)(6) decision -- that talks about veil-piercing. Page 32 of the joint appendix in the footnote. Now, our point is that that's enough for notice pleading. The defendants understood what was going on. The judge understood what was going on. We were prepared -- certainly at the summary judgment stage, Justice Scalia, we would -- we would have been happy to go forward with proof of underfunding, and there is substantial proof of underfunding.

We think the standard should be, just as it is under Title VII, the employment discrimination law, in Kolstad, Burlington Industries, and Faragher, that the standard for vicarious liability under the Federal statute should be a Federal standard. And that standard should be traditional agency principles as informed by the policies of the Fair Housing Act. Now, the Ninth Circuit apparently felt that they had to go beyond traditional agency principles. What we've tried to do in the brief in Roman numerals I, II, and III is point out three separate and independent alternative theories under traditional agency principles.

I believe the Government takes the position -- and we certainly don't disagree with the Government -- that it is a Federal question. And if I may, I want to get into those parts I, II, and III of our brief, and particularly the first part and vicarious liability. The problem we have with petitioner's argument is that I believe it's based on two faulty assumptions. One is that petitioner wants to take certain parts of the California corporation and real estate law that are advantageous to him, but he doesn't want to take the other part, which is the responsibility part. It is literally true that in California, a corporation can be a broker, but it cannot be a broker unless there is an individual appointed who is an officer of the corporation and has qualified under the broker requirements, and that individual is required by California law to take responsibility for the supervision and control of the agency."

You said that California law says that the corporate broker, the -- the one who's designated for the corporation, has to exercise control over the -- over the brokers in the corporation. That may well be true. The -- the issue is not whether he -- he has to exercise control. It's whether he exercises control in his personal status or rather exercises control as an officer of the corporation. If it's in the latter capacity that he exercises control, he -- he should not have personal liability. It's the corporation that has liability."

Currently he would have to file a paper, but he would clearly get the status. But Triad, Inc. would cease at that moment being able to be a broker. And none of the acts in this case, none of the salesman's acts, could have been performed under the rubric of Triad. And the other point that I was going to make about the petitioner's argument that I think is faulty is it's the assumption that if Triad, Inc. is the principal of these agents, nobody else can be the principal of these agents. And that's clearly inconsistent with longstanding agency principles as reflected in the Restatement, section 20, comment f, which says there can be joint principals."

That is, by the way, what 86 percent of the brokers in California do. They operate as sole proprietors, and they are clearly vicariously liable. There is a -- an additional question. What happens when you incorporate? And -- and so it's not exactly on all fours. And I think the -- the jury is out or the judges are out with -- with respect to what California would do. Some States say in addition to the corporation, the individual is vicariously liable; some don't."

      "speaker": "SCHWEMM",
      "speech": "There are many uses, Your Honor, and I would like to address that. The only thing that we are arguing that Mr. Meyer was responsible for is what I would call the licensed activities. For example, if a broker went out on the way to a meeting and negligently drove his car and caused an accident, that is not the kind of behavior that's subject to broker supervision. And that would be no liability."

And when he reads the complaint, he looks to claims, and he sees first claim, Fair Housing Act, which doesn't have a word about this theory. And apparently in the brief, a different theory was produced, the one that's been produced today, that the reason they're liable is not because we want to pierce the veil, but because it's Mr. Meyer who's really the holder of the license in some sense, and that is sufficient. So not surprisingly, the district court says that. He says any liability against Meyer as an officer of Triad would attach only to Triad in that plaintiffs have not urged theories that could justify reaching Meyer individually, with one exception. And he then goes and discusses the exception. Well, if I were a district judge, I would have thought I had done my job at that point unless somebody came in and petitioned for rehearing and said, judge, you missed something, which no one did."

      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "speech": "That -- that's correct. Now, in the course of doing discovery on the designated officer/broker question, they -- the plaintiffs unearthed some facts that are potentially relevant to the veil-piercing theory, but they've had no discovery on veil-piercing as such. And another important criterion in determining whether veil-piercing is appropriate is whether the individual bears some degree of personal fault for the wrong alleged. And here, the plaintiffs' allegation is that Mr. Meyer negligently supervised Mr. Crank, that that was a contributing factor in Crank's ultimate misconduct, and that would suffice to show that aspect of the veil-piercing analysis. I think it's also important to note that courts are typically more willing to pierce the veil in tort cases than in contract cases; that this Court has described the Fair Housing Act as -- as essentially defining a new type of tort. The theory is that in contract cases, an individual who contracts with a corporation has his own opportunity to assess the -- the corporation's finances and decline to do business if the corporation seems likely not to be able to satisfy its obligations whereas in a tort case the -- the potential plaintiff has no opportunity to do that. Inadequate capitalization has always been an important factor in veil-piercing analysis, and really it goes to the question whether the incorporators have adequately respected the independent status of the corporate entity."

And so what they say is, you know, the complaint doesn't have to spell out every theory, but it does state some facts there from which this basis could be fairly inferred, and therefore it shouldn't have been dismissed.

The issue was not under-capitalization. The issue was not mismanagement of corporate formalities. The issue is -- was could Mr. Meyer as an individual be held liable because he was the sole owner, president, and designated broker of Triad -- Triad Realty. Excuse me.
