We did not have the benefit -- we were under the impression, I should say, that we -- that the family policy compliance officer's letter would be accorded Chevron deference, as the district court did.

We have endorsed the position argued by the amici in the three briefs that have raised the issue. I believe it's perfectly appropriate for the Court to decide that, and I believe that the Court -- that the Court's decisions do indicate that FERPA is not actionable under 1983. If you focus on the -- go back and look at the language of the statute, of course, which is the ultimate issue, there is no rights creating language in FERPA the way there is, for instance, in title 9, that the Court focused on in Canon.

We didn't raise it in the petition for certiorari because we had not raised it in the court below and, frankly, we believed that the odds of persuading the Court to grant certiorari on an issue that we had not raised and briefed below were not very good and, again, our focus had always been on the merits of the case, and I believe we should win on the merits, but I also believe that section 1983 is not -- does not provide a cause of action under FERPA. FERPA says -- it uses the language, no funds shall be available to an educational agency or institution that has a policy or practice of allowing the disclosure of education records. That is clearly talking about a systematic practice on the part of an educational agency or institution. If a section 1983 remedy were allowed, then what about an individual teacher who, in violation of the district's own policy or practice -- the district, say, has a policy that we will not release it, yet an individual teacher makes a deliberate choice to release the information. Under 1983 that teacher would have to be held liable, it would seem to me, even though the district had done exactly what Congress commanded. The district had enacted a policy saying, don't do that, so that clearly militates against a 1983 cause of action. In addition, FERPA --"

I do not recall from the record. There might be something in the lodging of those extensive letters from the FPCO, but I do not recall, and do not -- cannot represent to the Court that there's anything in the record regarding there ever having been a funding cut-off."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I guess we are taking you away from the question on which we granted certiorari. As I understand the position of the respondent here, and tell me if I'm incorrect, if the respondent is correct, the teacher would have to keep a record of all of these quizzes as part of the permanent record, is that the necessary result of the respondent's argument?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RICHARDSON",
    "speech": "The respondent seems to take the position, which is contrary to what the Tenth Circuit said -- the respondent seems to take the position that only records, only grades or scores that are recorded in the teacher's grade book are education records. The Tenth Circuit clearly said that's not the case. The Tenth Circuit clearly said, even if the grade is never recorded in a teacher's grade book, the mere fact that the teacher receives it and uses it for some purpose, maybe even just to evaluate her own teaching performance, and determine whether the class is ready to move on to the next lesson, that makes it an education record. Respondents have backed away from that. They argue in their brief at least, or she argues in her brief at least that it has to be recorded in the teacher's grade book, but we believe that even that is a far more broad definition of education records than what Congress plainly says in the statute. The statute defines education records with a two-part definition. It's those records, files, documents, or other materials that contain personally identifiable information and are maintained by an educational agency or institution, or by a person acting for an educational agency or institution. Now, maintained has to have some substantive meaning, because it's half of the definition. Clearly, homework papers are personally identifiable. There's no doubt about that. But if maintained doesn't mean anything more than what the Tenth Circuit said it meant, simply possessed by a teacher for some brief period of time, then that's really writing that word out of the definition. Any document that comes across a teacher's desk would be an education record. In fact, chalkboard work would have to be an education record. If a teacher asks a student to come to the chalkboard, do a math problem, that's personally identifiable information. The entire class can see this student working a math problem. That math problem is maintained on the chalkboard until the teacher directs a student either to erase it, or erases it herself, or himself."

  },
  {

    "speech": "I believe because a grade book is, in my opinion, Your Honor, more of an evaluation instrument rather than a record. A transcript shows what the student earned in a grade, or in a group of grades during the course of his academic career. A grade book is more than simply a dry record of the percentages that a student achieved during his time in his class. For instance, during a relevant grading period a student might start out doing very average C work. The student then might near the end of the grading period suddenly get it, and start doing B and A work. The teacher would, I think any teacher in America would look at a grade book containing those records and would not simply go, okay, the total average for this grading period is a 78.5, he or she gets a C. the teacher would look at the improvement shown in the student's performance and would in all likelihood round it up and give the student a B. The grade book is an evaluation instrument. It is not simply a collection of records."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I mean, that's the problem. Your notion of what are records maintained just does not square with the existence of that exception.

Maybe Congress didn't want this stuff to be covered, but --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RICHARDSON",
    "speech": "Well, I think that's an alternative possibility, Your Honor, is that it's a belt and suspenders approach that Congress never intended grade books to be covered, but just in case somebody happened to be inclined to read them that way, we're going to put this exception in as well."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And it would be consistent with that argument that you say, well, a teacher's grade book is kept for the year, but it doesn't become normally part of the institutional records of the school, so it's not maintained for a substantial enough period of time to qualify, whereas -- and I just don't know factually about this -- maybe the guidance counselor's records are simply kept forever. I don't know. I mean, is that kind of a durational criterion something you want to stand on here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RICHARDSON",
    "speech": "Not in a -- no, not a pure durational criteria. I don't think that is the key. Again, many grade books are not -- I don't think Congress meant to draw a line and say, okay, you keep it 6 months, it's maintained, if you keep it 5 months and 3 weeks and 6 days it's not maintained. I don't think Congress intended to do that, and I'm not asking the Court to do that. records that are, as a practical matter, maintained over a long period of time that are institutional records."

The record of the quiz which student A corrects the student B and calls out to the teacher, the number that student B puts on top of the quiz is a record for a short period of time."

I mean, in that context, the Tenth Circuit's analysis would be right. If it is an education record, then the fact that one student sees it is just as damming as the fact that the entire class sees it, it seems to me, but it's not an education record, therefore there's no question of release.

FERPA regulates the records maintained by an institution, not the homework and classwork of students. Congress did not intend for FERPA to intrude into the day-to-day activities of hundreds of thousands of classrooms across the Nation, or the way in which teachers conduct the educational process in those classrooms, or the way in which students interact with each other."

  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "It addresses the grade book, in our view, by including it -- we think ordinarily it would come within the sole possession exception in the act. Now, I think it's important to recognize that even a grade book -- there may be no one uniform practice about the way a grade book is handled. It could be that a particular school would regard the grade book as an official school record from the outset, where the principal always has access to it, and the teacher is really maintaining a record on behalf of the institution in keeping the grade book. You could have other school systems in which the grade book is essentially used by and for the future as a memory jog, and all that she ever discloses to the front office is the semester grade. In that event, we think that the grade book would fall within the sole possession exception, so that this is one of the things about FERPA, is that it addresses the situation in which actual record- keeping practices may vary, or let me change that, actual pedagogical practices may vary widely from school district to school district, and that's why we think importantly this act did not enter the classroom by addressing the way teachers handle papers, give feedback to students, have students grade each other's --"

I think it would depend, though, or may depend on the way in which the grades were assembled. I think if the teacher or professor, let's say, in college, the only grades probably ever, ever assembled or marked down for a college course may be the final exam grade. The professor may have a grade sheet, a roster in which the professor marks down the grade for everyone in that class and sends it to the registrar, and from that list puts a list of final grades for the course. I think at that point, the fact that the grades would be derived from something that would be regarded as an institutional record, in that instance I think the posting of the grades may well be a violation."

    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Which means it would have been embraced by the statute, but for that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "That's probably true, but it's -- one thing to bear in mind here is, this act was passed in one form early in 1974. Some difficulties were identified, and it was amended and revised and elaborated upon later in 1974, and there is a description by Senators Pell and Buckley describing the original version of the act, in which they indicated that personal records were not the sort of thing that was intended to be included, because the act then used the definition of official records that were intended to be for school use, and they said that these informal notes, and I think teacher notes would be include din that, were not intended to be included in the act to begin with. So I think that there is a way in which that gives emphasis to something that may well have been excluded anyway, but they do fall within the coverage of the act, because the act was revised to meet some concerns that had been raised by local school districts. I did want to point out two things in response to Justice Kennedy's question. This act does not require a school district to retain any records. It may destroy records at any time. It only addresses rights of parents while the records are actually retained. The other point is, we don't think that there is anything talismanic about the duration --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But they don't have to be retained for 45 days or anything?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "If a request is made for them they have to be retained until the request is resolved, a request to inspect them, but if the parent or student, adult student has not requested it, nothing in this act requires the school district to keep them. We don't think that duration is dispositive. We think because the act was designed -- we point this out at pages 20 and 21 of our brief, and page 23 of our brief -- was intended to reach records that the school was going to be -- use to make decisions about the student in an institutional way, institutional decisions about the student, which we think are different from what goes on in the classroom in the day-to-day learning experience, and so we think that that could include records, or some materials that are kept by a principal that wouldn't necessarily go into the permanent record, but would be part of the school's overall supervision of the student for that school year, so we do not think that the duration of the period is dispositive. Having said that, what gave rise to this act was concerns about the sorts of things that were in the permanent institutional records of the student, the sorts of things that would follow the student, or that law enforcement officers or probation officers or others would have free access to when parents did not, and there was concern that there might be irrelevant information, or inaccurate or anecdotal information in records that would make a real difference in the child's life, and that's what this act is directed towards."

In other words, Senator Buckley did intend the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to reach out into the record keeping process that included the teacher's work or the -- or the records that were being maintained by the teacher. What the petitioners are requesting of this Court is to have unfettered and unshackled right to disclose exam grades to whomever they choose.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "I am just trying to be sensitive not only to just that one child, but even to her other children who are also part of this case with respect to their A's. They were straight A students. So rather -- whether one child receives low grades or whether one child receives stellar performance in the classroom, it does not matter. It is still a release of a grade. Those children know the grade. The parents of those children know the grade. When a parent goes to the parent-teacher conference and she shows up and the teacher says, all right, these are the -- we're going to keep this private, it's not private information. It's already been disclosed. That information is not private. How can the teacher keep concealed that which she already revealed? And even the district court found that hard to believe. And -- and that's -- that's the logic of the Tenth Circuit. The Tenth Circuit didn't prohibit the practice. The Tenth Circuit merely suggested that the statute on its face, the plain language of the statute, says, give the parent the right to consent. That was the intent of Senator Buckley: give the parent the right to consent to the release."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If it's an educational record as defined under the act and maintained as such -- and that's really the issue, whether it -- it's covered at this stage of a fellow student calling out a grade."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "It's covered because in the facts of this case, the teacher is using that protocol to collect the information."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but that is not the text of the statute. You have to overcome the fact that the literal language wouldn't cover it. the context of the parent's right to consent, in other words, keeping that information confidential. If there is a legal obligation on the part of the teacher to keep that grade confidential once it's in her hands --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "She had -- they have no right to keep information confidential. They have a right to keep the record confidential. If the information is obtained from some source other than the record, the statute does not -- does not address its release."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "I respectfully disagree. The statute specifically says, which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records or personally identifiable information contained therein --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Contained in the records."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "She's making the record. She's maintaining the record. That has to be interpreted in the context of what we're doing here. And if we look at Whalen v. Roe --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm way out-of-date probably, but again, when I used to be in school, grades were thought of, to some degree, as an incentive, that they weren't totally private. One of their functions is they should be at least told to other people in the class in order to get them to work harder or to strive harder. about records, which I don't think defines itself, is there any indication in this history that that idea that if a teacher wants to use grades as a kind of incentive device, that that should not be up to the teacher? She isn't able to do it? I mean, is there -- see, records doesn't define itself, and I'm looking for a line."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Congress intended that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In -- in the absence of some other line, I might tend to think a line should be drawn to give the teacher maximum freedom to run his or her class the way the teacher feels is best educationally. That's different from having a record in an office somewhere in the clerk's office in the school. See, that's where -- that's where I'm sort of looking for, and I'm trying to get some help from you with that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "The line is the grade that is going in the grade book with respect to this particular case. If the grade is going in the grade book, what she is creating, she is maintaining. If -- if that -- if maintain does not mean that she is making the record or creating the record, if we subscribe to their view that maintain means the central custodian, then the central custodian doesn't have any record either until it's actually in their hands. And then we can disclose, we can access, we -- everything."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So what -- so what if you could? Suppose you were to say that. Suppose you were to say before it becomes part of the permanent records of the school, you can disclose it to other people. You can. That's right. The teacher can tell other students. The teacher can tell the parents. The teacher can have a discussion about it. They can do a lot of those things if the teacher feels that's good educationally and the school approves. What would be so terrible about that in terms of this statute?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "It would be terrible. It would be disastrous. Students, parents would not have the right, that privacy. That interest in keeping that information private would not be there. Everybody would have access to that information. In fact, that reads out of the statute (B)(i). You wouldn't have confidentiality. Education records, by its plain language in the statute, means information directly related to the student and maintained by the institution or somebody acting on behalf of the institution. And clearly, by the plain language of the statute, that includes the teacher. So, yes, the teacher grade books -- the teacher grade books are education records, subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the privileges and the obligations that come with this particular statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Wright, this goes all the way through, I take it, in your view that -- take a college student. The college student can say, oh, I don't want to participate. I don't want anybody else to know what my grade is, and I'm not going to exchange papers with another person."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Precisely. We don't engage in this practice at college because we would have mutiny at all colleges. They have the capacity as adults, I'm not doing this. I'm out of this class. I don't want people knowing what my --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's a technique that teachers do use, to have students prepare and present each other's papers, that that's a technique that's quite common in colleges and professional schools."

    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "You're referring to the -- the teacher assistant helping them grade?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, no. The students critique each other's papers. That is not prohibited by FERPA. The teacher is not collecting that information. The students are making the evaluation or assessment of each other for their sole purpose, not for the purpose of the teacher recording and making --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The teacher writes down -- the teacher writes down in the book the comments that the students made and she takes that into account in the final grade in the course."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Outside of the facts of this case, that may be a violation if, in fact, she's making a record and that was the intent of the teacher to make a record."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "A -- a good alternate name for this statute would have been the Anti -- the Prevention of Mutiny Among Students Act? (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Suppose -- suppose that a school district received $100 a year in Federal funds, and this act were applied in the way you said, would that to you raise any serious concerns of federalism?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "I think the funds need to be available under an applicable program, and I think the lower cases have -- have deemed that certain programs are applicable and certain others are not. Federal funding through a State agency would be an applicable program. Those facts were never raised in this particular case, never defended by petitioners as to whether or not there was any applicable Federal funding involved in this particular case. The solution to the problem with respect to this issue that is before the Court, provide the parent the right to consent -- in fact, that's what they're doing in many schools or they're just, like the Tenth Circuit said, do it anonymously or don't do it at all. Have the student grade their own paper. Encourage the parent to come and -- and be informed as to what is happening --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "To have the student grade their own paper might have some problems with it too. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "I cross examined the principal with respect to that particular issue, and he said, well, we exchange papers because the students cheat. I said, well, the neighbor grading the other neighbor's paper -- they don't have an opportunity to cheat? Oh, yes, you're right, Mr. Wright. They do cheat. So that doesn't preclude the students from cheating, does it? No. Well, no, they could cheat even during the exam because they could write the answers on their hand."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you need two cheaters for that takes one. Right? (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "We believe that the plain language governs what is an educational record and it does not mean the permanent transcript. If Congress had intended for education records to mean a permanent transcript, they could have easily placed language in there that said only the permanent or cumulative record of a child is an education record. They didn't say that. They even excepted out sole possession notes, which are notes of the teachers. They excepted out directory information. The Family Policy Compliance Office has consistently over the last 25 years held that the grade book is an education record. A parent would like to access it. Here's the -- here's another consequence, that a parent doesn't have a right to access if it's merely the permanent education record of the grades. The teacher could -- could say, no, you can't see your child's grades. A parent has to have that information available to her for the purpose of making some important decisions with respect to her child, and that's exactly what Ms. Falvo went to the school district and argued. She argued that those are my children's grades. Those are between me and the teacher. I have a right to consent to their release, and I have a right to access."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but a moment ago, from what you said, I thought the school district was telling her that she couldn't see her children's grades. That never happened, did it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "No, that never happened. But that happened in a particular case that has been cited by the petitioners in the State of California where a mom with a special ed child was having a hearing and needed the information in the grade book, and they said, no, FERPA doesn't apply. The grades in the grade book -- she had no evidence available to her to make an informed decision with respect to whether or not her child belonged --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But that -- that wasn't what happened here, was it?"
