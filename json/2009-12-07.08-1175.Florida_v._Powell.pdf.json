Yet the Florida Supreme Court erred in two ways to suppress a voluntary confession relied upon for Kevin Powell's conviction. First, the Florida court misapplied the analysis. Rather than evaluating the warning under a reasonably conveyed standard for the right to an attorney, the court strictly parsed the warning, seeking certain words in a certain order. Second, the court incorrectly found the warning to be misleading. The court ignored the totality of the warning. The court overemphasized the order in which the rights were given, and furthermore, the court applied a hypertechnical analysis of the warning's language."

Just you're entitled, I think it was, to the help of a lawyer. So there’s -- there’s a confusion, I think, between what Miranda spells out and many other cases spell out as the State’s obligation, what the State must do, and the statement that must be made to the defendant to communicate that."

Miranda requires that law enforcement effectively communicate the fact that you can access your right to an attorney present and during an interrogation. However, in the Miranda opinion they approvingly cited the FBI warning that only had the terms -- the generalized warning: Consult with counsel. Furthermore, the ability to talk to your lawyer, which is at issue in this warning, is the first natural step to getting your attorney. And, third, as this Court has held in Minnick, that it’s the representation that matters in custodial interrogations --"

Because the FBI advice of rights says: \"You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning.\" Were they -- and -- and I was taken by the fact, \"We hold that an individual must be clearly informed.\" And so, is there some other case that says -- or some other FBI statement that they give people that doesn't use the words \"with you,\" that says you don't have to say \"with you during,\" or doesn't have to say \"present during\"? Was there some other case that said that?"

That is not the standard of analysis that the Florida court applied. And secondly, when evaluating that warning, the -- the Florida court incorrectly finds that this warning was misleading. Now --"

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACQUOT",
      "speech": "Your Honor, there are three reasons why the Florida Supreme Court's explicit standard is problematic. First, the same standard applies to written warnings as to verbal warnings. So you’ve had situations where you have a law enforcement officer who doesn't have his card in the field; there’s a verbal error; there’s an inconsistency in translations. If a suspect is asking questions trying to get clarity, the law enforcement officer is going outside of the card to provide that clarity. Those are situations that may not meet the explicit express advice standard of the Court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
      "speech": "Well, there is a question about how much the subjective intent of the questioner should be involved in this process or not. There are cases where it appears the plurality of our Court has said it should always be an objective standard, and others where certain members have expressed a question about subjective. But if we are dealing with a printed form, why wouldn't the intent of the entity at issue be placed in question? Meaning, you could have -- the police here could have chosen to be explicit, but instead they chose to be -- to obfuscate a little bit and be less explicit. Shouldn't we assume that that’s an intent to deceive or perhaps to confuse?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACQUOT",
      "speech": "Absolutely not, Your Honor. The Tampa Police, in having this warning drafted, is attempting to reasonably convey the warning, and there is good public policy reasons why."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
      "speech": "But why? The -- the easy solution is to do what 90 percent of the jurisdictions are doing: Copy Miranda."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACQUOT",
      "speech": "Well, Your Honor, we would claim that this warning falls within the 97 percent cited by amici because it has the word \"during\" in the warning. The Florida court ignored the totality of the warning. It chose to place the order of the warning's rights in a way that this Court in Prysock and Duckworth has found is not the proper analysis. Furthermore, this court used a hypertechnical approach. It took the words \"before answering any of our questions,\" turned that into an exclusive statement to say, \"only before questioning\" and then, as a result of that, attempted to discount the last sentence of the warning. That's the kind of parsing, that's the kind of precise formulation, that's the kind of construing warnings like a will or defining terms like an easement that this Court has rejected."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACQUOT",
      "speech": "Your Honor, you are correct, in that Tampa has a new form now that does have the words \"present\" and \"during\" in a different formulation. However, there’s no indication that they would go back to the other form, for several reasons. One, law enforcement has an incentive to have Miranda rights properly given because they desire there to be confessions and for those confessions to be admissible."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Well, once we say this is properly given, my goodness, here's -- here's an instruction approved specifically by this Court. I mean, I think they should use that, don't you? I mean, the other one they are going to have to guess about, but this one is approved in a case involving Florida by this Court. So you -- it's pretty attractive to use that one."

You should say, yes, of course, they -- they might; we don't think it's likely, but they might, and if they did, it's perfectly okay. Isn't that your position?"

      "speech": "Justice Scalia, they theoretically could, because the warning was reasonably conveyed. It was sufficient. However, it’s unlikely they would. Law enforcement agencies modify their warnings when they become issue. So when a litigation begins on a warning, they often modify it at that point."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
      "speech": "Let me -- let me ask you one question. Isn't it the case that this particular warning is used in one judicial district, and the warning that was approved in Traylor was used in the rest of the State? And so there is an interest -- the Florida Supreme Court has, in effect, required the same warning throughout the State. And if you prevail, there may be one standard warning in one judicial district, and the other districts may continue to use the one they have used in the past. Isn't that right?"

For instance, the term \"before\" is lacking in 30 of 90 jurisdictions in Florida. There is nothing to stop the Florida Supreme Court, if this Court was to allow an express advice Standard, from then requiring the term \"before questioning\" in addition. That's the kind of danger in having an analysis that is much stricter, that essentially looks at words that should be in a warning, rather than looking at whether the right to attorney is reasonably conveyed to the suspect.

And I think that history and experience are the best answer to that question. Respondent's amici, who have carefully studied this issue, have found that some police officers have attempted to evade Miranda by interrogation techniques, but there is no indication that police have tried to accomplish that purpose by changing the language of the warnings, and that is not because they couldn't do so. For the last 20 years, Duckworth and Prysock have been on the books, and have made clear that no standard formulation of the warnings is necessary and that variant warnings will be upheld.

The Federal Government does not use those warnings because they create a list -- a risk of litigation. We think that's the correct reading of Miranda, but that, of course, is not guarantee that other courts would read it that way. And, indeed, 2 years after Miranda, the Fifth Circuit had gone the other way and decided that, in fact, a right to counsel warning is not sufficient. But, Justice Breyer, I think that the answer to how these warnings convey presence is that a suspect is not going to draw the highly counterintuitive assumption that if he is told that he can have an attorney not only before answering any questions but during this interview, that he is going to need to walk in and out of the room each time he wants to talk to an attorney.
