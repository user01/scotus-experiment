The holding of the Sullivan decision, which reaffirmed and explained this Court's decision in Cage, is what makes Melvin Tyler's conviction unconstitutional, but it is the Court's rationale underlying the Sullivan decision that makes Sullivan retroactively available to Melvin Tyler, and that is because the rationale underlying Sullivan also satisfies the second exception to Teague's policy of nonretroactivity to cases on collateral review."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARSON",
      "speech": "-- that Cage was meant to be applied retroactively, and that unmistakable import was received by seven circuit courts of appeal that have applied Cage retroactively since Sullivan. Every lower court that has considered the new rule in Cage since this Court's holding in Sullivan has said that Sullivan compels the application of Cage on a retroactive basis. The respondent in this case and amici have advanced two principal arguments for denying Melvin Tyler relief in this case. The first would be the language of EDPA which requires that a matter relies on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court that was previously unavailable, and then finally this Court's holding in Teague v. Lane that new rules of constitutional law cannot be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review unless they fall within one of two, as the Court has described, narrow exceptions. As I said in response to Chief Justice's question, from our perspective now that we are before the Court, the first obstacle is purely theoretical. If this Court should decide that Teague requires that the new rule announced in Cage as explained by Sullivan should be applied retroactively, and it simply says in this case, which it has the power to do, and as all -- as amici has conceded, that it's made retroactive and applies it to Mr. Tyler's case, and that resolves the issue. Obviously, not every case that turns on the meaning of 2244(b)(2)(A) is going to be heard by this Court, so if the Court decides that it should address the statutory question now, we would submit that the better interpretation is the one that has been offered by the Third and the Ninth Circuits in the two cases of West v. Vaughn and Flowers v. Walter -- that the phrase made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court does not require the express ruling of this Court. We are not saying, as the Ninth Circuit has said in Flowers v. Walter, that all cases that should be retroactive under Teague are, in fact, retroactive. We are simply saying that the word made in this case should be given its simple plain meaning of caused to be the case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But I think an equally simple plain meeting is to say, made retroactive would be that this Court has said they were retroactive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARSON",
      "speech": "That would be, Your Honor, but if that were to be the case, it creates an entire host of problems. First, I think that the Court -- that Congress had before it the possibility of a wide variety of language such as held by, determined to be retroactive by the Supreme Court. The first is that this -- the use of the word made as not requiring an express decision by this Court avoids the unequal treatment of similarly situated petitioners. You would have a first petitioner who received the -- who a lower court could say, well, yes, the Court had made that new rule retroactive, whereas a second petitioner identically situated for Teague purposes would not receive the benefit of the rule. The second is that this interpretation of made retroactive is the only one that works with the statute of limitations that EDPA has created. If -- if we are to interpret the rule as requiring an express ruling from this Court that something has been made retroactive, when the statute of limitations begins to run when the new rule has been recognized, as we pointed out in our briefs, you could have a statute of limitations expiring before this Court ever ruled on whether something had been made retroactive. On the other hand, if you were to take the position of the Solicitor General that maybe the statute of limitations doesn't begin running until this Court recognizes the retroactivity for successive petitions, the statute of limitations would never begin to run. So you would have successive --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "On the other hand there is a thirty- day requirement in the court of appeals to determine whether or not to decide the issue, and that indicates, it seems to me, that the only thing they can do is look to see whether this Court has decided it. Because otherwise they have to decide a difficult substantive issue within thirty days. It does not seem to me that that is consistent with the statutory scheme."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARSON",
      "speech": "Well, but that's precisely the type of decision that lower courts make every day in terms of first petitions, as was done in this case. The Fifth Circuit had determined that Sullivan had been made retroactive -- Cage had been made retroactive by Sullivan, and it applied it to all first petitioners. So I don't think, Your Honor, that we're placing an additional burden on the lower court because, quite candidly, we are only talking about a very, very, very small category of new rules that would have been made retroactive. In fact, in the eleven decisions that this -- in which this Court has considered new rules of law since Teague was handed down, none have been found to qualify for the second Teague exception. In fact, this would be the first new rule under the second Teague exception. So to respond more fully to your question, Your Honor, I do not think we are placing an undue burden on the lower courts, because Your Honors' interpretation of requiring an express ruling from this Court would mean that a successive habeas petitioner under a new rule was either too early or too late, but never on time."

Nebraska, and that seemed to suggest that all but in one or two, maybe the Louisiana and New York, that the instructions were okay. We found twenty-one reversals in New York on this ground, and some in Louisiana, and no others. I mean, that's just a quick check, so it would be in New York and possibly Louisiana, if that's right.

We are dealing with the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. And then there is the second problem of the Teague analysis, which is the reliability factor. And because of Cage and Sullivan, we know that when you have an erroneous reasonable doubt instruction such as the one in Cage, Sullivan and Tyler, that you have -- that the likelihood of an accurate conviction has been serious diminished."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, except that that's not the way we explained it in Sullivan -- what was at stake. We didn't say anything about accuracy or reliability, as I understand it, and as you quoted from it a moment ago. What we said was that as a matter of definition, what we mean by a jury verdict has not been observed when the jury is operating under this kind of reasonable doubt instruction. It had nothing to do, as I understand it, with what we normally mean by the reliability of a verdict, i.e., was the person really guilty or not guilty? Did he do it, did he not do it? So it seems to me that the two don't synchronize the way you're arguing."

    {
      "speaker": "LARSON",
      "speech": "They do, Your Honor, if you go more into the structure. The reason you have been deprived of a jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. For that you have to go all the way back to In re: Winship. And what we understand from In re: Winship is that there is only one measure of reliability within a criminal trial, and that is the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard. Presumably as you push the burden of proof to higher levels, the likelihood of an improper or erroneous conviction is lessened, and that if you require proof beyond all doubt, you would have -- certainly you would not have any innocent people hopefully convicted. And so what Winship tells you is that it is that proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard that, quote, from Winship, plays a vital role in the American scheme of criminal procedure, because it is the prime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual error."

Teague gives us an example of a watershed rule in Gideon and provides a definition that a watershed rule is a rule which alters our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements necessary for a fair trial. Our principal point is that -- the question is, does this definition encompass the notion that a watershed rule can redefine an existing procedural element, or does the watershed rule need to announce a new previously unarticulated procedural element? I would submit that to adopt the first definition would require the rule so redefine an existing procedural element that we have, in a sense, created a new bedrock procedural element, and it is insufficient to simply alter our understanding and illuminate an existing procedural element in some way. That the new rule must tell us a fundamentally new principle that is applicable in each and every trial that should be conducted in the future."

      "speaker": "HEUER",

One is that it be the fundamental foundation that -- and that it -- to become a watershed rule it has to announce a new principle, yet encompassed in that definition is the fact that it forms an essential bedrock procedural element. So the examples I gave you, correct, would not be watershed rules. They would --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, why wouldn't this one be, then? Why wouldn't this one be? That is, what their argument is -- I mean you might find it easier to address the specific. The specific, I take it, is that before Cage and Sullivan, people always understood that judges can make mistakes on jury instructions. They do every day of the week, and some are very important. But after Cage and Sullivan, we suddenly see that a misdescription of the reasonable doubt standard is like no other. It is so important that automatically you get a new trial no matter what. The only other thing that compares is not having a lawyer at all. So before the two cases we thought, yes, you could make a mistake in the instructions, maybe even a bad one. After the instructions, we recognized that that kind of mistake is unique among all others and like not having a lawyer. Now, that's their argument, I think, as to the significance in you're reshaping our legal thinking about a jury standard misdescription. All right? So now, on your principle, why isn't that watershed, or why isn't it watershed irrespective of your principle?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEUER",
      "speech": "I think the question of structural error is distinct from retroactivity. I believe Teague requires an additional component. Moreover, the structural error of a misdescription of reasonable doubt has more to do with whether or not we can get our hands on what's going on there, whether or not the effect of the error is quantitative. We simply cannot look at the verdict and conduct an analysis because we don't --"

This Court has now made certain conduct unpunishable under the criminal law, and that's the kind of thing that Teague says is retroactive, and even where it's absolutely plain that it is the reason, it still, in your opinion, is not retroactive unless the Court adds the words and it is retroactive."

And that someone who is on second and successive habeas, who has had direct review and first habeas already, that person is in jail validly and pursuant to his conviction, and if this Court gets around to saying that, then the person may be --"

As I said in response to Justice Kennedy, if the Court wanted to distinguish unmistakable import cases, I would think those would only arise under the first Teague exception, and I also think that not all cases under the first Teague exception would qualify or be even close. I mean, petitioner in this case -- I think in their brief they have about five examples. I would agree with one or maybe two of them, but not with the other three, and I think there would be a lot to argue about."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Then you'll run into a statute of limitations problem, because the statute of limitations seems to say that it has to -- you have a year after the right of cert was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, and so you're going to have to do within the year -- it's going to have to come up on habeas to the Supreme Court in an instance, let's say, where it's absolutely clear from the reasoning that it is meant to apply retroactively, so you'll never -- I mean, it'll put this Court in an impossible situation, wouldn't it?"

      "speaker": "FELDMAN",

First of all, I think the statute of limitations provision hasn't been construed, as far as I know, that particular provision of it, by any lower court, and the meaning of whether it would run from the date of the original decision or the date that this Court had made the decision retroactive I think is not entirely clear, so I don't think it would necessarily be a problem. But I also do think that Congress intended that the gateway for second and successive habeas petitioners should be extremely narrow, and they assigned, Congress assigned, the courts of appeals the responsibility within a thirty-day period of deciding -- usually they're based just on the petition, not on any response from the other party, from the warden -- based just on the petition a determination of whether it satisfies the Teague exception or not. If they can look at the decisions of this Court, that part of it won't be hard to do. They might have difficulty figuring out just what the claim is, but they won't have difficulty figuring out whether it's retroactive."

      "speaker": "FELDMAN",
      "speech": "In our -- that's correct, and this statute, of course, didn't apply then, but a second or successive habeas petitioner would have had to wait until there was a decision of this Court that finally and -- what Congress had in mind was that it be finally and conclusively decided, both the validity of the rule the petitioner is relying on and its retroactivity, before they're going to get into Court. Congress did not intend that people should be able to bring second or successive habeases so that they can establish whether it's retroactive or not. And as shown in this case -- the petitioner in this case claims that it was totally clear after Sullivan that the rule in Cage should be made retroactive, but I think we've at least made substantial arguments it's not, and it's going to be -- there are going to be issues raised in these cases, and I think the Congress wanted this Court --"

      "speaker": "FELDMAN",

And it's our view that it doesn't necessarily have that temporal component. If you thought that it did have that temporal component, then you would stop after the first question."

This instruction was not given in all criminal cases in Orleans Parish. It would also be subject to the statute of limitations under EDPA. Following Sullivan, people had to file Cage claims saying I had a Cage instruction. And so the number of people -- and this is based purely on an estimate from inmate counsel at the Louisiana State Prison -- there might be fifty or sixty people still in prison who had gotten a Cage instruction and, even then, since we are only dealing with the retroactivity issue, they would still have to surmount all of the very formidable procedural obstacles that otherwise apply in habeas cases. The reason that Mr. Tyler did not raise this in his first petition to Federal court is because it wasn't available to him. His first petition was in 1988, Cage was handed down in 1990. Sullivan didn't come along until 1993, and as soon as Sullivan came along, Mr. Tyler timely filed his habeas petition."

Not one judge in any of those courts has ever suggested that Sullivan did not compel a finding that Cage was to be applied retroactively. In terms of whether there is some ground between Gideon and Cage in terms of watershed rules, I would suggest that in Justice Harlen's concurring opinion in Mackey, he made it clear that that category, that second category, does have cases, and that cases will arise in that second category. It's not an empty box as one of the amici suggested in their brief, it is a box into which we put rules, new rules of law, that are fundamental. And what is fundamental about Sullivan is that it tells us that if a jury is given a yardstick that is two feet long, that's not sufficient. It has to be accurate because that is the central point of any jury trial, criminal jury trial. There are some decisions that are -- some errors that are so fundamental that a conviction obtained with that type of process should never be final. That's what Justice Harlen recognized in his entire retroactivity doctrine. If we obtained a jury verdict by flipping a coin --"
