Rather, it carries the force of law that is binding on other courts, binding on the executive branch which must enforce the judgment, and even binding on the legislature which cannot reopen the judgment.

The ­­ Section 1334, on the other hand, which is on page 14a of the government's statutory appendix, 1334(b) says that \"The district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under Title 11.\" So the district court does have original jurisdiction at the outset, but when it has referred the matter to the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court has entered final judgment, then pursuant to 157(b) and pursuant to 158(a), the district court is now exercising appellate jurisdiction."

And so Congress has defined the scope of the abstention according to the same language that it uses in 157(b) whether a proceeding arises under Title 11 or does not do so, but is merely in relation to a case under Title 11. So if the Court goes and revises what Congress has provided as the definition of core in 157(b), there will be collateral consequences for other statutes that Congress had enacted. But the second point is that there are, as I think Justice Scalia was suggesting, policy decisions that really only Congress can make in deciding how to respond to Stern, because one can compare, for example, the provisions of 157(c)(1), which is the bankruptcy judge issuing a proposed findings and conclusions, and the Magistrates Act, 636. The two are actually quite different. The magistrates, for example, are assigned a specific motion to consider and issue a report and recommendation on. By contrast, the bankruptcy court in (c)(1) exercises jurisdiction over the entire proceeding, including up to conducting a trial in something that isn't subject to jury trial, and then issuing a report and recommendation to the district court."

It assigned, irregardless of consent, this action to determination and final judgment by a bankruptcy judge. The Court considered this statute and held it unconstitutional in Stern. So if consent were to cure the problem here, then the jurisdiction of the Court would depend solely on the consent of the parties. If, on the other hand, the Court was considering in the first instance whether consent as a limiting feature on the jurisdiction of the non­Article III body meant that there was not the types of structural problems that the Court identified in Stern, then it would be as part of the determination whether there was or was not an Article III violation in the first instance."

But here, where there was no consent in this statute, the Court has already held in Stern that there was an Article III violation.

But if I may begin, please, I'd like to address Justice Scalia's point about where's the ambiguity in the statute. And unfortunately, my friend and I disagree, because I think the statute under 157(b)(1) is unambiguous in my favor. So if I could take you back to the statute, and I'll use the Solicitor General's brief for convenience. 157(b)(1) is the provision by which district courts, if they want to ­­ there's no compulsion on these Article III officers ­­ if they want to, they can refer matters to bankruptcy judges. And it says, when there is a matter referred, that they may hear and determine the matter and may enter an order or judgment. My interpretation, I believe, is the more natural one of \"may enter an order and judgment,\" it's a permissive grant of authority. There's no compulsion to enter an order and judgment. They can simply hear and determine the matter and not enter an order and judgment. And I can contrast this textual language ­­ you don't have to go very far ­­ down in (c)(1) and (c)(2), where (c)(2), there was only one \"may,\" they don't have the double \"may permissive grant of authority.\" And there's ­­ and in the noncore matters, there's a ­­ a \"it shall,\" when \"it shall determine.\" They use the verb \"shall\" in (c)(2).

      "speech": "No, you held it unconstitutional regarding an objecting defendant. There's been hundreds of years of consensual adjudication with these inferior judicial officers, as that they were called in the earlier cases, such as Go­Bart. They are officers. They're inferior judicial officers, and they are controlled by the Article III judiciary. The Article III judiciary retains the control to use them or not use them as they want, and parties can't be forced to do them over their ­­ without their consent. So when this Court has had opportunity to address Article III concerns of this, they have always relied upon the lack of consent as a problem. And that's why this Court's formulation in Stern, I think, is critical, just following Union Carbide, and indeed every opinion in Northern Pipeline, going back to the MacDonald case under the old act. What matters is the lack of consent. Plenary matters can't be tried without consent under the old Bankruptcy Act. When there is consent, this Court held in MacDonald, that's fine. Indeed, when there's implied consent, this court held in Klein against Baker in the American College's amicus brief, that's fine. And as the American College also lays out well, these old statutory cases under the old Bankruptcy Act were interpreted with constitutional values in mind. The old act was very cryptically drafted and tersely drafted, so this Court used constitutional principles in interpreting the scope of the old Bankruptcy Act and upholding the consensual adjudication of plenary matters when there is consent. So our submission, Mr. Chief Justice, is yes, we do think that the consent matters. And the final thing I'd like to say is, my friend cast this narrative. He said, well, how do you know I consented through my implied conduct to the noncore claim? Remember, he did plead it was noncore in his answer, and ­­ my red light."

There's also one other aspect of our argument that has not yet been mentioned this morning, which is that we think that even if consent is not adequate to cure the constitutional violation or if you find that there is not adequate consent on this record, we think that it would still be open to you to find that petitioner has forfeited this constitutional argument. Constitutional arguments can be forfeited. He has not ­­ he did not advance this argument at any point ­­ any reasonable point before the bankruptcy judge, before the district judge, until he was before the Court of Appeals.

But if I can turn to the severability question, which was also the focus of a lot of the argument before, Justice Scalia, you pointed out that Congress can rewrite the statute the way it wants to. And that's, of course, true. But it is always the case when this Court gets to a severability analysis that Congress didn't get its first option. Here, Congress did include a severability clause in the 1984 Act. It's in Section 119, and it says, if any provision of this statute or any application thereof is held to be unconstitutional we want the rest to stand."

      "speaker": "GANNON",

In Stern, on page 2620, this Court characterized the effect of its decision as being, \"The removal of Vicky's counterclaim there from core bankruptcy jurisdiction.\" And the consequence of that is that, because the Congress had divided the world into core and noncore proceedings in the wake of Northern Pipeline, thinking that the distinction between them was core proceedings were ones in which bankruptcy judges would have authority, constitutional authority to enter final judgments; noncore proceedings were ones in which they could not do that without consent, or they would only be able to provide proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. And in the same paragraph where this Court noted that the effect of its decision was effectively to remove this, that type of counterclaim from core jurisdiction, it said that it did not expect that this decision would meaningfully change the division of labor between the bankruptcy and district court judges, precisely because Pearce Marshall was not contesting the proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law."

In that particular paragraph, the Court mentioned the fact that Pearce Marshall was not contesting the district court's ability to take proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. And as Mr. Pottow already observed, many district courts have already taken this action in response to Stern. In the appendix to our brief at pages 15A to 17A, we list 25 of those districts. Since our brief was filed, two more districts have adopted similar provisions in Rhode Island and in New Hampshire. And we think that that is telling. I also think, with respect to the underlying constitutional claim, if I could elaborate a little bit on what my colleague was saying in response to the questions from the Chief Justice about instances in which Article III judges may indeed delegate the ability to enter certain decisions with which the district court's subsequent ability to over ­­ to look over that decision will be cabined by the action that has happened with the consent of the parties. My friend was talking about the Heckers case.
