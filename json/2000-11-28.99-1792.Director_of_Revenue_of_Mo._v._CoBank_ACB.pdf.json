      "speaker": "LAYTON",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: In 1933, when Congress authorized the organization of banks for cooperatives, it implicitly authorized the States to tax them. That authority became effective for each bank when it retired the Government shares. The National Bank for Cooperatives paid taxes to Missouri until 1995, but according to the Missouri supreme court the bank's tax liability ended in 1985. That court failed to recognize the bank's exemption from taxes is and always has been provided by statute, and that staute, now 12 U.S.C. 2134, exempts from taxation only the bank's notes, debentures, and other obligations, not its income. In deciding what section 2134 means, the Missouri supreme court erred in three respects. It transformed a technical and conforming amendment into a significant change in the Farm Credit Act, it made that transformation by adding to the plain language of the statute, and it turned the statute into something that is incongruous to the rest of the Farm Credit Act. Before 1985, the statute provided that CoBank and its predecessors would always pay taxes on real and tangible personal property and, at any time when the Government did not own shares, they would pay other taxes to State and local governments and perhaps even to the Federal Government. The question arises here as to what happened in 1985, and the position being taken by CoBank is that in 1985 suddenly they were freed from all taxes, and yet that is not what the statute said in 1985. There was a technical and conforming amendment that appeared in title 2 of the 1984 -- 5 act. Title 2 was the part of the act that was dedicated to making the Farm Credit Administration an arm's length regulator for the farm credit system, something more akin to what we see at the FDIC and other bank regulators in the Federal system. Title 1 of that act also included conforming amendments. Title 1 dealt with the credit corporation which CoBank cites here as a new vehicle for investment into the farm credit system. The second point that the Missouri court erred on is transforming the plain language by adding to it. The plain language of the statute is simply that this entity is exempt from taxation as to its notes, debentures and other obligations. Ever since 1933, the entire scope of the exemption given to the banks for cooperatives has been contained in statutes. The only thing that anyone can point to in the statute today that goes beyond notes, debentures, and obligations is the reference to this entity as a Federal instrumentality, but this Court has at various times suggested or, in fact, held that Federal instrumentality does not have the kind of meaning that CoBank ascribes to it."

      "speech": "That McCulloch is restricted to an instrumentality of the type that this Court addressed in the New Mexico case, and we can see the comparison fairly bluntly here. The Second Bank of the United States was run by presidential appointees. The Federal Government owned 20 percent of the shares in that bank, and that bank performed governmental functions, not just functions in which the Government had an interest, but it actually issued currency. It did things that the Government itself must do. In that sense, the Second Bank of the United States was a little like the Red Cross that this Court addressed in the Department of Employment case. Again, presidential appointees run the Red Cross, and that entity fulfills treaty obligations that the United States assumed under the Geneva Convention. The -- CoBank mentions the Rural Telephone Bank in their brief. Well, the Rural Telephone Bank has a 13- member board of directors. Seven of them are appointed by the President of the United States. The Governor of the Rural Telephone Bank is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, and there is a direct appropriation from Congress in a -- over a 10-year period of -- or 20-year period of $600 billion for the Rural Telephone Bank. By contrast, here we have an entity that from the beginning has been controlled by a board of directors that is appointed by its voting shareholders, which did not include the United States. That is, by the borrowers. It has always been a private entity, quite distinct from the things that we see in McCulloch. So what's the distinction from McCulloch? McCulloch holds that if you have something that is an instrumentality of the type that is the Second Bank of the United States, then in fact there is, absent any congressional language, immunity."

That is, Congress, when it created the Second Bank of the United States, didn't say, okay, you have the following exemptions from State and local taxes, but that's what Congress at least since 1916, when it started the farm credit system, has done consistently for the financial entities within the farm credit system."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Layton, there's a reason that the other side gives for the exemption of the debt obligations, because, they say, those obligations are held not in the hands of CoBank but in the hands of the lenders, so you need an exemption so that those lenders, who are private and not government instrumentalities, won't be taxed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAYTON",
      "speech": "Well, it's curious that they make that claim in a brief where they also cite the Memphis case in section 742 of, I beileve it's title 31, which, if this entity is part of the United States, that is, if this bank of cooperatives has the inherent authority that they ascribe to it, then 742 would cover them, and this provision would be superfluous in 2134. But it doesn't cover them, because they are not an instrumentality of this sort, and Congress has defined the scope of their authority. In 1928, this Court in the Shaw v. Gibson- Zahniser Oil case, just a few years before the 1933 act that created the Bank for Cooperatives, pointed out that there are instrumentalities of the United States that do not have exemptions unless Congress gives them an exemption, and then 5 years later Congress in this instance defines what the exemption is, and what CoBank and what the Missouri supreme court have done is to say, well, that definition by Congress doesn't really matter. The third point that I mentioned was that it turns the statute into something in Congress with the rest of the Farm Credit Act. That is, in each instance in the Farm Credit Act, where Congress has created an entity that is even -- that is analogous to this particular one, Congress has said, okay, here is the kind of exmeption that you have from State and local taxes. It always is a comprehensive statement, and does not leave room for some kind of an argument that there is an additional exemption based on some kind of inherent immunity, and in each instance it permits taxation of real property and in many instances taxation of tangible personal property. And one of the differences that occurred in 1985, according to CoBank, is all of a sudden the statute changed from allowing State and local governments to tax tangible personal property to including only a real property exemption which they ascribe back to the dicta in McCulloch. In fact, there may be a problem with tangible personal property. I'm not sure how much of that CoBank would be likely to foreclose upon, but the same statutory language is used for the production credit associations, and it is easily understood that there would be tractors and other equipment that they would foreclose upon that would justify the need for a provision for taxation on tangible local -- tangible personal property."

    {
      "speaker": "LAYTON",
      "speech": "No. There are a couple of cases cited in our brief that stand for the proposition that we don't expect Congress to use technical amendments to make this kind of a change, but neither of them actually says, yes, we can then go back behind the language to determine what Congress did. But here you don't have to go behind the language to committee reports or something like that. Just look at what the language was. If Congress wanted to do what CoBank now says they did, all they had to do was eliminate the last sentence in the prior statute. That is, the sentence that said, okay, here's the point at which the State's authority to tax begins. If that had been the scope of the -- of Congress' action, just eliminating that last sentence, then except for the tangible personal property question CoBank would have today exactly what they wanted, but that sentence says, okay, the exemption that we are giving you in the prior sentence -- that is, you don't have one until we give it to you. The exemption we are giving you in the prior sentence is going to apply only to a certain point. And when Congress acted here, they took out not just the, okay, it applies at a certain point, but exemption that they had given, and so today there is no exemption in the statute, and the banks for cooperatives are responsible for paying taxes to State and local governments. If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal."

      "speech": "We'll hear from you now, Mr. Frederick."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position is that banks for cooperatives under the Farm Credit Act are not exempt from State income taxes for two reasons. We think the Court should confine its decision to an analsyis of the text of the Farm Credit Act, and not go beyond it to discuss or address the constitutional issues relating to Federal instrumentalities. Under the text of the act itself there are two reasons why banks for cooperatives are not exempt from State income taxes. First, as the State counsel noted, at section 2134, the first sentence itself just addresses an exemption for notes, debentures, and obligations. That provision contrasts with two other provisions of the Farm Credit Act that specifically give State income tax exemptions for other entities of the farm credit system. 12 U.S.C. 2023 provides an exemption from State income taxes for farm credit banks and provides expressly that Congress intended for those entities to be exempt from State income taxes. Moreover, 12 U.S.C. 2098 provides an express exemption from State income taxes for Federal land bank associations. It's clear, therefore, that when Congress enacted this statute, and it amended it over a 50-year period, it knew precisely how to give the kind of exemption from State income taxes being asserted by respondents in this case and chose not to do so. Secondly, the history behind this provision, as the Stte counsel made perfectly clear, does not support respondent's position. Between 1933 and 1985, the text itself provided for the exemption from State income taxes only in any part of a year in which the Government owned stock. That ended in 1968. From a period between 1965 and 1968, the Government retired all of its shares of stock in banks for cooperatives. So as of 1968, and this is reflected in the Farm Credit Administration's annual report, banks for cooperatives were not exempt from Federal and State income taxes. When Congress made its amendment nearly two decades later, in the 1985 Farm Credit Amendments Act, there was no Government ownership in any banks for cooperatives. These were completely privately owned for- profit entities and, as such, would have been subject to State income taxes throughout the entire period. Now, the last point that I'd like to make is that the Court should not reach out to opine about instrumentality status generally. This -- the Court consistently under the Farm Credit Act has looked at the text of the act to determine the scope of exemptions from taxation, and that's true in all of the cases that have been cited by the parties under the Farm Credit Act. It should not use this case to opine broadly about what instrumentalitiy status means for several reasons. First, Congress uses the term, instrumentality, in a broader range of contexts, and even in this case and in this statute itself, has used it to describe not only the organizations that are being used to facilitate Congress' purpose, but also the financial instruments themselves. Section 2023, which is the Farm Credit Bank tax exemption provision, describes the notes themselves as the instrumentalities of the United States, and so by making a decision about what instrumentality status means, the Court could end up having -- could create unintended consequences that would affect the taxable status of instrumentalities throughout the Government."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but Mr. Frederick, isn't it true that for purposes of deciding this case, if we have to -- if we rule in your favor and the favor of the petitioner, we must decide that the mere fact that it's labeled an instrumentality is not sufficient to give a tax exemption?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "No, Justice Stevens. What the Court would say is that use of the instrumentality language by itself would not render the rest of the tax exemption language in the Farm Credit Act surplusage, and the Court would say that Congress defined the scope of the tax exempt status of these particular instrumentalities by expressly dealing with tax exempt status, and that's how the court did it in the First Agricultural Bank case in 1968, when it addressed a very similar question for the national banks, and there the Court said, we're going to look at the text of the statute to determine the scope of the exemption and not reach --"
    },

One point that all parties seem to agree upon, and certainly the Court's opinions make this clear, is that the question of whether or not an entity is entitled to immunity as a Federal instrumentality is up to Congress. The Court said that in the New Mexico, the -- Missouri said that in their briefs, the Solicitor General, of course, said the same thing. What we now have here, we would submit, is a case where congressional designation as a Federal instrumentality somehow carries less weight than a judicial determination of Federal instrumentality."

The banks were, and the Farm Credit Act was then in 1971 completely recodified and Congress again affirmatively, not merely carry-over, but affirmatively said, the bakns for cooperatives are -- continue to be federally-chartered instrumentalities of the United States.

The second use -- and this is all set out in section 2132 with respect to BC's. The second use is to rebuild loss reserves, or to make sure that loss reserves are adequate. These are both things that are necessary for the bank to function. The third use, of course, in these years is to pay back the Government loan and, as we indicated in our brief, the Bank for Cooperatives National Bank and its successor, CoBank, paid back something like $300 million.

It's to reduce the cost of his loan, because one of the fundamental missions of the farm credit system, again as this Court has recognized, is to provide loans for farmers at the lowest possible cost."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "speech": "Well, I don't think Congress was any less sensitive. If you go back to 1933, when the banks were formed, it was obviously the Depression, and Congress did what the Court acknowledges that it does. It balanced the interests of a Federal program to provide secure and adequate and inexpensive financing to farmers with the fact that the States were also suffering from the Depression, and so the compromise that was struck in Depression conditions was, you can't tax these entities as long as there's a Federal investment, but we will let you tax them when that investment is retired. As Missouri itself put it in its brief, they said, you know, if the Federal Government has an investment in the bank -- an investment here cannot realistically turn on whether it is equity or debt. I mean, in either case, as I suggested earlier, the terms are such that it's a Federal claim. They said the States ought to be understood to have to stand aside until that's paid back. What changed in 1985 is, Congress recapitalized the system."

Therefore, there's no need to favor the United States, and therefore there's no need to provide a nontaxable policy. At each time, before '85 and after '85, the United States' policy with respect to the effect of the cost of borrowing on borrowers, on this analysis, would be exactly the same."

All it says is that the preceding sentence exemption doesn't apply when the Government interest disappears. That's what my version says.

Now, once you say there was a negative implication before, why doesn't that same negative implication exist after '85, from the first sentence, unless there's something in that '85 history that shows that what they wanted to do was restore McCulloch, and my reading is there isn't a word on that, but you're prepared to say it wasn't the statute before that wiped out McCulloch. You're saying what wiped out McCulloch before was a negative implication from the statute, and so my question is simply, why isn't that negative implication still there, just as strong as it ever was, unless, of course, you can point to a reason? Now do you see my -- you see where I'm going?"

      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "speech": "Well, and let me qualify part of my answer, is that the statute has been understood by -- it's never been construed by this Court, but it's been understood by a number of State courts and -- consistent with what Congress said. They said, what we are writing with that third sentence is, not that we -- we won't tell you what happens when there's no ownership, but we are telling you affirmatively that you become taxable. Now, was it artful language? Perhaps not. So I don't think it's fair to say that the exemption -- that the taxability previously existed by negative implication. I think it was statutory and, of course, the answer, what happened in 1985 was, the statute was repealed. Now, both the exemption, I agree, and the negative implication. One thing here that I think the Court needs to focus on, and it's a major point made by the State and by the Solicitor General, is they -- citing Rosello and cases like that, they say, well, the farm credit banks have an exemption, and the farm -- the Federal land bank associations have an exemption, and you don't have an exemption therefore, and I grant that that's a perfectly valid rule of statutory construction. But I think it's fair to say that someone ought to at least offer a reason why it makes sense that Congress would discriminate against -- differentiate. They're not discriminating -- differentiate between a bank for cooperatives which makes loans to an agricultural cooperative or production credit association which makes a loan to a farmer. It's also a property, but it's otherwise identical, and a Federal land bank association makes the same loan, and they've clearly granted a statutory exemption in the one case but not the other. Now, you know --"

If you take the position that there's no inherent exemption for this kind of organization, that you have three organizations, and for two of them Congress has provided expressly your income is exempt, and for one of them it hasn't, so why isn't the assumption just from the text that two of them have it and one of them doesn't?"

They issued their own bonds. They made their own loans. They were liable only for their own bonds and for their own operations.

And Congress, the bill was introduced on, I think, the 20th of November, and it was signed by the President on the 18th of December. I mean, this went, bang, bang, bang. It was described in the Wall Sreet Journal as legislating on the fly. They were, you know, as the Wall Street Journal would be very offended by that. But -- so you have -- you have a lot of very high priority concerns that Congress was trying to deal with and articulate and explain, and then you've got this State tax exemption which I'm -- and liability, which is clearly important to Missouri, I've no doubt about that, but on a list of priorities, I doubt that it was very high when Congress was concerned -- as the comments on the floor indicate, they're worried about losing the entire system, and -- but I think the second point, and again, in 19 -- I know I'm repeating about this point, but in 19 -- prior to the change, the statute said that the bank was exempt as long as the Federal Government owned stock in the bank. After 1985, if you accept our interpretation, we are saying that the bank is exempt because the Federal Government has reinfused capital, admittedly in a different form, but certainly not financially, economically different, and in a form for which the banks were liable, so that I would submit that the only difference between the circumstances in 1984 and 1986, if you will, is that in the first place Congress was being explicit, and in the second place Congress was relying upon --"

Now, you can say, well, doesn't that undercut the notion of lending at the lowest possible cost? The answer is, I think the Government is sort of indifferent whether it gets its money -- in paying back the loan whether it gets its money from taxes or gets a loan repayment, and in fact the banks were never truly exempt from Federal tax because they were -- even when they were exempt from Federal income tax the statute imposed a franchise tax based on net earnings, which is functionally equivalent, so in that sense the status quo was maintained, and I think that's our argument. The status quo was maintained. The design was maintained. The facts changed, and under the circumstances, and given the pressure Congress was under, I think it's entirely rational that they would look at this -- I mean, the bill came out of the House on the 6th of December.

So -- you know, so the presumption, the pattern is opposite for a Federal tax. You're taxable unless there's a statutory exemption. Here, and I'd like to simply conclude by where I started. If you look at the New Mexico decision which Missouri relies upon at length, and you go to page 736, and I pick this out -- this is illustrative. You were talking about whether those particular Federal contractors were exempt from State tax, and you said, the Court's other cases describing the nature of a, quote, Federal instrumentality. That is a term of art. It's been a term of art since Justice Marshall first coined it in McCulloch v. Maryland, and the one attribute that's always been associated with a Federal instrumentality in this Court's cases is an exemption from State taxation absent a waiver. I mean, I've looked -- I can't claim that I -- this is complete. The Court has never held that an entity which is a Federal instrumetnality is taxable in the absence of an affirmative congressional authorization, whether you're talking about the Department of Employment, you're talking about New Mexico, you're talking about Graves, you're talking about James v. Dravo, never, at least not that we can find. That term carries with it that attribute, and we submit that Congress, in designating us a federally- chartered instrumentality, consistent with what we do -- they didn't do it haphazardly -- intended precisely the same designation, and we would suggest that that also fits with the overall goals of Congress in passing the 1985 act and rescuing the farm credit system and trying to give the agricultural borrowers some relief from high interest rates. It seems to us it all fits together, and what the State is literally saying is, well, we want to act like the law didn't change, that there was no repeal. Well, there was a repeal. The law did change, and the question is, did Congress intend that we become taxable without regard to the Federal investment, or did they intend that we become exempt under the McCulloch rule, and those are basically the choices facing the Court. If there are no further questions --"

      "speech": "I'll note first that I believe that the banks for cooperatives were subject to Federal income tax prior to 1985, but I'd also note the franchise tax that counsel referred to. In the 1971 act in section 4 it sets out a franchise act that could be as high as 25 percent of net income for the banks, but interestingly, that franchise tax applied so long as the Government holds shares in the bank, and that the Government didn't hold any shares at that point, and there was obviously an incentive, given that franchise tax, not to allow the Government to pick up any shares in your particular bank. I should note also that although the National Bank for Cooperatives was formed in 1989, it was the merger of other banks for cooperatives, and there have been banks for cooperatives operating in Missouri for many, many years prior to 1989. Turning to the legislative history, if, indeed, we have to get to the legislative history, the history does talk about the reasons for the 1985 act, and one of the things that's there is a note that the banks for cooperatives themselves were healthy. This was not prompted by a problem with the banks for cooperatives. It was prompted, as Mr. Hanson accurately said, by a system- wide problem. That is, there may have been -- there were other entities within the bank, the farm credit system that were having enough problem that it was bringing down the ability of the entire system to sell bonds, and yet the argument being made here is that because some other entity had a problem and Congress created a system-wide remedy, that is a remedy that would provide Federal financing to the system as a whole, and never to particular institutions, that somehow these banks for cooperatives attained a new exemption. Before, they only had an exemption when they had Federal investment. Afterward, according to CoBank, they all have an exemption even if no one has a Federal investment, and the most that's likely is that some production credit association or someone else would have an investment, and yet somehow they get this exemption back. They also -- the --"

      "speech": "I think one reason is to ensure that that entity -- in the tax context one reason is to ensure that that entity cannot be subjected to discriminatory taxation. Missouri, for example, could not pass a tax that was restricted to the income of federally charter -- or, excuse me, of cooperative banks that serve cooperatives, farm cooperatives. Because the only one that exists is this instrumentality, that would be aimed at a Federal instrumentality and would be a discriminatory tax and it would be illegal, becuse that is a Federal instrumentality. There may be other reasons as well, but certainly that is one impact of use of that term. The change that is alleged to have come about in 1985 is not just to remove the connection between the Federal investment and the bank that is asserting the exemption, but also to remove the temporal aspect. That is, before, the exemption only was in place while the Federal investment was in place. At the time in 1985 there was 5-year sunset provision on the credit corporation through which the funds that Mr. Hanson spoke of would be channeled, and yet the exemption that he asserts is one that would exist indefinitely. That's inconsistent with the legislative history and with the language of the statute. CoBank poses the question as to why differentiate between production credit associations and banks for cooperatives on the one hand and other institutions such as land banks on the other, and we shouldn't have to ask that question, because Congress made that determination in 1933. There has always been a distinction. We're just discussing today what the distinction now is. But there are a couple of possible reasons for Congress to have made that distinction. One is simply temporal. In 1933 we were in the Depression era, and not only was there a problem with the farm credit, with credit for farmers, but there was a problem with banks generally, and so here Congress was setting up some institutions that would compete with commercial banks that themselves were failing throughout rural areas in the United States, and Congress set up a system that said, okay, for the time being, we will give you an advantage over your commercial competitors, but only for the time being. At some point it's going to go back to where you do not have that extent of commercial advantage. Sure, you can still issue obligations that will be tax-free, but you won't be able to avoid tax entirely. Another reason that there may be a distinction is that the land banks that Mr. Hanson referred to lend, as I understand it, based on the farmer's land as collateral, and there has always been a feeling in Congress that we don't want to take the land away from the farmers. That is distinguishable from the question of lending based on their crops, which is what a production credit association would do, or based on the equipment and land that is held by a cooperative that may be producing or processing the crops or otherwise providing services for the farmers. There is a distinction. It's worth noting that today betwen two-thirds and three-quarters of agricultural lending in the United States is done by entities outside of the farm credit system, and those entities must compete on the grounds that Congress set forth, and not on the grounds that can be divined by some reference to past history. If there are no further questions, I thank the Court."
