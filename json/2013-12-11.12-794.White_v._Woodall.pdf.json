And that was, of course, not a sentencing case. Then Estelle says, we discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital murder trial, so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment, so a kind of general view that the Fifth Amendment applies equally in the two. And then Mitchell holds ­­ it basically repeats that from Estelle and says, we must accord the privilege the same protection in the sentencing phase of any criminal case, as that which is due in the trial phase.

When I looked at those, I saw they reaffirm Estelle. As they quote Estelle, they say its reasoning applies with full force. Estelle says, \"The court could discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned.\" I marked five separate statements in those two pages that came to the same thing. I looked at Estelle. Estelle has to do with the right to note ­­ note the comment that he wanted in respect to a sentencing fact that the jury was going to decide; namely, future dangerousness. Nothing to do with a fact about the crime, a sentencing fact. So then I said, well, what favors you here? What favors you is the last sentence of the first paragraph on 330, which says, \"Whether silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in 3E1.1 of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines is a separate question. It is not before us and we express no view on it.\" Right. It's, one, not just a sentencing fact, but a state of mind of the defendant, lack of remorse; two, it's in the sentencing guidelines; three, it is a decision for a judge, not the jury. If it isn't confined, as I just said it, then Mitchell overrules Estelle, what it explicitly denies doing. Here, we have sentencing facts, facts about his childhood.

You looked at the instruction, and the instruction is just a broad instruction. It says no adverse inference may be drawn from anything. All right. So there seemed to be some objection you had to the breadth of that instruction, so I looked at the instruction. The instruction does say exactly what Justice Alito said and you have said. It says the ­­ the instruction is ­­ \"The defendant is not compelled to testify, and the fact that he does not cannot be used as inference of guilt and should not prejudice him in any way,\" with a couple of, here, irrelevant modifications. All right? The instruction I just read you is not from this case. It's from the Carter case. In the Carter case, the court said that instruction must be given. It must be given at the sentencing phase. So what they did was copy the instruction out of the case, the very instruction that the court said, in Carter, the Fifth Amendment requires to be given in the sentencing phase. And that was a noncapital case. So what's the objection to the instruction, on its breadth? Not only is it the same, but the government never objected that it was too broad, and the only issues in the case were factual. They were about what happened to him in his childhood, namely, sentencing facts. And the instruction that you did read about what they should consider referred to facts and circumstances. And where, in Estelle, does it say that matters at sentencing related to facts and circumstances, you don't have to give the very instruction that Carter and Estelle required?"

Beathard in the Red Brief, which is Texas's description of their ­­ of those special circumstances questions at the time. So this Court has applied this Fifth Amendment prohibition in a pure sentencing selection occasion, and Estelle deals with ­­ there's a component of silence to it because the psychologist that testified as to the future dangerousness factor relied on the silence of the individual, his failure specifically to say, I'm sorry, and express remorse about the actions that he did. And this Court cited that component as part of what the psychologist relied on in making the future dangerousness assessment. So Estelle is not totally ­­ it obviously has a compulsion component, and it's driven by the Miranda violation, but there is a component of Estelle which relies specifically on silence and how the silence was used to penalize the individual in becoming a factor in favor of death in the selection process."
