Those included State navigable waters, and that included over 40 percent of the native corporation land selections under the Native Corporation Settlement Act.

If the Park Service ­­ this is a Park Service regulation issued under the Organic Act and you read this code of Federal regulations and the Park Service is saying, we want fires here on public lands; we want fires here not on public lands.

You can camp in Alaska parks. You can hunt. You can fish. You can use snow machines. You can fly. The list goes on and on. Right? Under the Ninth Circuit ruling, those relaxed rules, they don't apply to the non­Federal land.

Congress provided in ANILCA that Alaska would lose over 100 million acres of land. But at the same time, Congress provided concrete protection against further encroachments on the lands and waters that Alaska did retain. This Court should reject the Park Service's attempt to redefine the Federal/State balance that Congress chose. We know from ANILCA that Congress intended to provide unique management rules for Alaska, and there are good reasons for that. This was the continuation in a trilogy of legislation that began with the Alaska Statehood Act and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and this piece of legislation furthered the goals of those predecessors. One purpose of the statute was to provide adequate opportunity for the satisfaction of the economic and social needs of the State of Alaska and its people. And Congress explicitly balanced that goal with conservation goals and the goals of completing the land selections within the States. And that means that the National Park Service's authority in other States or in other parks are not the baseline here. The starting point is the power that Congress gave to the National Park Service and other Land Management agencies in regulating ANILCA parks. And what Congress did in Section 103(c) was to set aside the inholdings of the State, private, and native corporation lands that might be surrounded by the parks, but should not be regulated as though they were in fact part of the parks."

It is about the Land Management agency's ability to regulate parks. And our position is that the park ­­ the park management can't encompass State waters and lands. And there are good reasons that Congress made that choice. Alaska's waters are used in ways that are different from the lower 48 in, for example, the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, there are three villages of less than one hundred people that are hundreds of miles from any road. And this is common in Alaska. So these rivers are the way that you would travel to get medical care or groceries or obtain school books for your children. And Alaska's ability to make choices about what sort of conduct is permissible on the rivers furthers its ability to provide economic and self­sufficiency for its people, which was one of Congress's primary goals in passing this legislation. The idea that the creation of a park somehow transforms Alaska's waters into Federal waters, Alaska lands into Federal lands without a clear statement would dramatically change Alaska's sovereign ability to control its property in a way that this Court never has sanctioned and should not do so now."

The first is, when Congress is setting aside land for parks ­­ and let me use the park here as an example ­­ it states it's ­­ its purposes.

Let's think about this as a native corporation's land allotment. You have 40 percent of their land allotment that they were given under Native Claim Settlement Act, land that was given to them in exchange for extinguishing their entire claim for aboriginal land rights. It's there for economic development. It's about to be surrounded by these ANILCA parks. It's worth taking a step back. What does 1 ­­ Section 103(c) doing? It is saying before ANILCA was passed, you're not part of the park and you're not subject to Park Service regulation. The day after ANILCA was part ­­ excuse me. The day after ANILCA is passed, you're still not part of the park and you're still not subject to Park Service regulation. The government's position here, they keep saying their authority is limited, and Mr. Chief Justice hit the nail on the head. They're relying on the Organic Act which allows them to enact any regulations they feel necessary at any time. They've already done that with the 9(b) oil and gas regulations, seeking to apply those to non­Federal land within Alaska. And the hits are going to keep on coming unless this Court stops this interpretation and goes back to what 103(c) was meant to do, which was to prevent the Park Service from taking these lands that aren't owned by the government and regulating them as though they are part of the park. And the second point want ­­ I ­­ I want to make ­­ I imagine about 45 seconds at this point: There's a lot of discussion about whether ANILCA covers navigable waters or not. The clear statement rule covers that question. And in that circumstance, it's a question of is anything in the statute clearly saying we are taking away State authority over navigable waters? You will not find the term navigable waters in the statute once. Let's contrast this to other park­enabling legislation. This is for Olympic National Park, and you'll find this at 16 U.S.C. 251(n). And here's what it says: \"The boundary of Olympic National Park Washington is\" ­­ if I may just finish the quote ­­ \"is hereby revised to\" ­­ \"is hereby revised to include within the park all submerged lands and waters of Lake Ozette, Washington, and the Ozette River, Washington.\" There's your clear statement.
