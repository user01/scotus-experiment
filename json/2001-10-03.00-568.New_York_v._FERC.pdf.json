      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: From 1910 until the issuance of the FERC decision under review, all 50 States regulated transmissions of electricity to retail customers. You didn't see the rates, terms, and conditions of that regulation, with a few exceptions, because the rates were bundled in bills that charged customers for all of the elements of retail service which are basically the energy itself, or the commodity, its delivery over transmission high voltage and distribution low voltage lines, and metering and billing. The issue in this case is whether the 1935 Congress intended the Federal Power Commission, now FERC, to displace the State laws that required that regulation from 1910 until 1996 if the commodity, the energy -- not the transmission, but the commodity -- is unbundled from the retail customers' bills. The FERC, while conceding that unbundling was never contemplated by the 1935 Congress, nonetheless has taken the position that if the commodity comes out of the bill, in order to give the customer knowledge to effect a choice to buy energy from a utility or a non-utility, then the transmission, although it still remains bundled with other elements and is never shown on the bill, except in the State of California, becomes a new and separate service and that that transmission is subject to preemption so that the States have to leave the scene for only FERC --"

Remember that retail is essentially a local business. Retail electricity. We have 127,000 customers in this country, and FERC certainly is in no position to be regulating the rates, terms, and conditions charged those customers for transmission.

The Indiana Consumer Council's reply brief points that out. So, there's no question that the '35 Congress knew that interconnection was coming. There certainly was interconnection at the time in '35, and it recognized that notwithstanding that interconnection, that retail regulation was a local service and that the States should continue it. And that's why, in addition to crafting 201(b) which referred to transmissions and sales -- and frankly, the Congress wanted to give FERC jurisdiction to regulate transmission independently of sales because if you have a sale from company A to company C, you might have company B that isn't taking title and is simply transmitting."

As I read the statute, if -- if there's anything wrong with -- with FERC's position, it is that the statute divides the -- there are a lot of ways of dividing the universe. The -- the statute divides it between transmission and sale, and giving -- giving FERC authority over transmission means it can regulate the manner of transmission, who -- who is authorized to transmit, who is required to transmit, and all that. But the universe of sale is covered by the next portion. And FERC is authorized to fix prices, to interfere with the sales, only at wholesale in interstate commerce. And once -- once you're dealing with a sale at retail, FERC is just not given sales regulation authority. It's still given transmission regulation authority, and it could still forbid certain people from transmitting and it could still impose certain requirements over transmission, even at the local level, but it simply cannot regulate the sales price. Why isn't -- why isn't that the way to look at it rather than --"

And her question focused on the fact that it just says, sale of electric energy, and doesn't say, sale of transmission. Now, it seems to me your response to that -- if I were making the response, at least, I would have said that if -- if sale of electric energy in (b)(2) is so narrow that it just means the commodity and not the -- the transmission and the servicing and -- and the metering and everything else, if it is that narrow in (2), it would also be that narrow in (1). And -- and (1) gives -- gives FERC authority over the sale of electric energy at wholesale. And I -- I assume that that authority over the sale at wholesale includes authority over the price of the commodity, the price of the transmission, the price of everything else. So, if you're going to give it an expansive reading in (1), it seems to me you have to give it an expansive reading in (2).

When we have a decision to make in New York, over the last 30 years that I've been involved in this, we're going to look to try to minimize the number of people who go into the dark. That's number one. Number two, we're going to protect critical customers: hospitals, prisons, people on life support systems. We're on the ground and we're there to protect retail customers. When FERC preempts us on curtailment in this case, it -- it says that curtailment under that situation has -- has to be nondiscriminatory. It sounds wonderful, and it's consistent with our economic plan. But it has to give way to critical care customers and keeping the most people in the light that you possibly can. This is an example of where an agency has overstepped its bounds. It's moved into retail regulation, conceding that Congress didn't intend it. There's a Federal/State balance that this Court has protected, absent clear evidence from Congress that it should change. And here that balance has changed and it's creating difficulties. We now have two hands on the retail wheel, and it doesn't work. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal."

The OATT does require that interstate transmission rates be published and be proportional to usage, but its major concern, as Pennsylvania's amicus brief says more eloquently than we did, is rules of the road, access, usage priorities, classes of service, reservation and scheduling of service, access to real-time information about the system, pro rata curtailment in periods of constraint, and similar matters that the States don't and can't regulate. FERC found endemic, undue discrimination in the provision of interstate transmission service by the traditional utilities that collectively own most of the grid. But FERC did not comply with the statutory command to cure that discrimination. FERC imposed the OATT but said it had no jurisdiction to apply it to transmissions that are bundled with retail energy sales, and thus exempted about 60 percent of the traffic from the rules of the road."

Some States have chosen to maintain the traditional monopoly system for the delivery of power to retail customers. In that situation, there is no separate transmission service, and the customer pays a single rate that includes all of the utility's costs, basically calculated by that utility and regulated by the State, for the generation, the transmission, and the distribution of power to the local customer. Order 888 does not affect those traditional monopoly arrangements. Other States, however -- now about half the States -- have decided to take a different path, which is to separate out the transmission service and -- and introduce competition in the purchase of electric power at retail. In that system, the retail customer has the right to purchase the power not simply from the utility that previously had the monopoly control, but from a broad variety of utilities. In that situation, that power might have to be generated, purchased and transmitted from out of State or in State by another utility. In that situation, it is necessary for there to be access to the transmission facilities to move the power from the generation place to the place of -- of retail delivery. In that situation, there is now a new transmission service that did not exist in 1935 when the Federal Power Act was passed."

And the transmission -- it's the transmission of the commodity, to use your words, or the wholesale interstate commerce of the commodity. In both cases, the electric energy is the commodity. And what FERC can regulate is two different things. As Justice O'Connor pointed out, these are two separate and independent grants of jurisdiction to FERC. One is wholesale sales of -- of the commodity, and the other is the transmission of the commodity. Now, it's true in this case, this case turns primarily on rights of access, physical access, to the transmission capacity. But a necessary part of regulating access is also regulating the rates because different qualities of -- of access, rights of access -- you could have firm or non-firm power. Those different rights of access necessarily would -- would cost more or less. A utility would charge more for -- for a firm power than -- than non-firm power. And that -- so, in that situation, the rates being charged for the access are essentially inseparable from setting the rules of the road. So, it seems to us not -- not feasible as a practical matter and not textually the natural reading of the act to say that somehow FERC does not have authority to regulate the costs -- or excuse me -- the price on which interstate transmission will be sold.

But the other point I wanted to make -- and this -- this ties in, I think, to a -- a misconception of Attleboro and Pennsylvania Gas, which is the background against which Congress acted, that I -- that I would like to address here. States, in setting retail rates, have the authority -- and I was saying this before -- have the authority to take into account all of the costs that the utilities serving retail customers may incur. And in the monopoly situation, the -- the State will regulate the -- will take into account the generation costs, the transmission costs, and the -- and the retail delivery costs and come up with a rate. And in -- in the Pennsylvania Gas case, this Court held that a State, consistent with the Interstate Commerce Clause, could regulate the retail rates of natural gas that were -- that were paid by retail customers at the end line of the distribution system for the cost of natural gas. And the Court rejected the argument that because that gas had moved interstate, that the State had no power to regulate the delivery to the retail customer. But in so holding, the Court didn't say that the States could regulate interstate commerce. What they said was that the States could regulate the local distribution, even though it had an incidental effect on interstate commerce. So, the rates that were left to the States, under Attleboro and under Pennsylvania Gas, were the ability to actually regulate the rates that the local utility is going to charge to the local customer, but it -- the Court did not say that the States had affirmative authority to directly regulate the interstate transmission itself."

That would -- that would be, in effect, imposing an obstacle, like cutting the line, that is frustrating the ability of FERC to regulate the -- the aspects of transmission that New York, I think, concedes that FERC has.

Nothing -- this tariff -- and I'd point the Court to pages 772 to 775 of the joint appendix. Utilities are allowed to set curtailment priorities under their tariffs, and therefore, they could protect retail customers, they could protect hospitals, that sort of thing. It's just that when you have curtailment, the utility has to curtail in a nondiscriminatory way. It can't favor its own transmission at retail to hospitals and discriminate against another supplier of electric power to hospitals. In other words, it has -- it can have -- it can have priorities based on the -- the need for the power, but it can't discriminate against suppliers of the power. And that is the whole point --"

      "speech": "Your Honor, Justice Scalia, in response to your question as to whether FERC has given the authority to the States to decide prioritization of curtailment, the answer is no. The utility has sole discretion to decide that, not the State of New York. It's joint appendix 350 where FERC says, in asserting jurisdiction over unbundled retail transmission in interstate commerce, the commission in no way is asserting jurisdiction to order retail transmission directly to an ultimate consumer. 888 directly says that they cannot order retail wheeling to a consumer, and they are correct in that respect. Transmission is not a new service. It is the same service that we have always seen. It is a monopoly service to retail customers. Justice Kennedy, when we have a bundled sale, there's no question that the State is regulating the transmission within that bundled sale, and that's why the Northern States case held that FERC could not govern curtailments in the bundled case, as it is attempting to do in this case in the unbundled case. The FERC order is at war with itself in several respects. It says that it has exclusive jurisdiction over transmission and it can't delegate an iota of it. And yet, it turns around and says, but, States, you regulate customer complaints. That's the sort of thing that happens when a Federal agency is over-reaching, rewriting the law, and trying to regulate, in this case, retail transactions which Congress expressly left to the States in 1935. There's no question Congress in '35 did not intend FERC to do what it is doing today, which is taking over the relationship between 127,000 retail customers and the people who deliver electricity to them. Thank you very much."
