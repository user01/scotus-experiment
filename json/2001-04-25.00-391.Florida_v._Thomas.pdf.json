      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Florida supreme court, based on the facts before it, added an unreasonable and unwarranted condition to this Court's holding in New York v. Belton. The Florida supreme court has determined that it is improper to conduct a Belton search unless the police initiate contact with the arrestee while he is still in the automobile, or he exited at the direction of the police. The facts of this case are very simple. Mr. Thomas drove his vehicle into the driveway of a residence of a home at which drug arrests were being effected at the time. Mr. Thomas exited his vehicle, walked around the car, and was at the rear right, near the trunk, when Detective Maney stopped him. Detective Maney asked Mr. Thomas for his name and for his driver's license. An immediate check of that driver's license was run, and it came back outstanding."

      "speech": "Well, it may have been part of one ongoing transaction, but it -- that does not, I think, affect the fact that the moment of the search seems to have been totally untethered from the justifications for the Belton rule because, as I understand it, at the time the search was made, the defendant was in the house. The defendant couldn't reach into the car for weapons or for evidence. There was nobody else with the defendant still in the car who could have done so, so that it seems to me the justification for the Belton rule has vanished, totally, in this situation."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, if that's going to be your justification, I don't see how you can put any limitation on it at all, because there was just as much an arrest 24 hours later, or 48 hours later. There was just as much an arrest as if he had been 3 miles away, or 30 miles away, and on your reasoning that the moment of arrest is the only operative moment here, then they could search 2 days later, and they could search 30 miles away."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRAUSS",

    {
      "speaker": "KRAUSS",
      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. It would certainly -- if we're talking about the contemporaneous requirement, certainly it would have to be, and that's why I suggest that, especially in this case, where it was one flowing, fluid arrest scenario, where Mr. Thomas was placed under arrest right when he was by the car, and that is when the need to either preserve evidence or exhibit concern for officer safety arises, at that moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Why -- Mr. Krauss, he's in the house with handcuffs, so any concern about his destroying evidence or getting a weapon is attenuated, but the need with respect, even to the car -- isn't it ordinarily the case that if you arrest a person, and there's the car out there on the street, the car will be impounded, and there will be an inventory inspection, and there will turn up the same thing that this turned up on the scene, so why do the police, once they've gotten the driver out of it, have to search on the spot, instead of going through the lawful procedure of getting the inventory --"

You can protect yourself the Belton way, do an immediate search while the arrested person is still nearby the car, and possibly able to dive in and get a gun, or, if you want to play it really safe, handcuff him and take him back to the police cruiser."

Robinson, where the very fact of arrest alone is enough to justify the search, and it's the same situation in a Belton search. I would further submit that at least via dicta, this Court has recognized the point of law we are advancing today in Michigan v. Long. It was assumed in a footnote that had the suspect in that case been arrested for speeding or driving along intoxicated, that a valid Belton search could be effected --"

They brought Mr. Thomas in there for safekeeping, not unlike the common situation that's assumed in these cases, where a suspect is handcuffed and placed in the patrol car. As we have stated, the need to do the search arises at the time that he is arrested in the proximity of the car."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "KRAUSS",
      "speech": "No. I think when you're at the scene and you're dealing with vehicles, there are different interests involved. We are dealing with an automobile versus a home. There are certainly further protections in a home, and when you're in a situation on the street, where anything can happen, it's a volatile situation, there may be other codefendants or other confederates mulling about, the ability for the police to protect themselves is paramount."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "KRAUSS",
      "speech": "The Chimel rule helps, but I want to make it clear that Chimel is limited to the immediate area of control, whereas Belton is a little more expansive, in that you have defined what that area is, and I think that is a little more expansive, and I am saying that Belton would assist the officer in that type of situation if there are others in the area, absolutely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Krauss, there's another distinction, another unusual feature of this case, in addition to the defendant being removed from the scene. That is, in Belton the man was speeding, I think. In all the other cases that I know of, there was a stop because of a traffic violation, and here, the car wasn't implicated in the justification for the arrest at all. He wasn't doing anything wrong with the car. The car is totally apart from -- the justification for the arrest is the probation violation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRAUSS",

      "speaker": "KRAUSS",
      "speech": "No, definitely not. This officer had no suspicions, and I'll be even further candid with the Court. If Mr. Thomas had said, no, I'm not going to give you my name or license, the officer candidly said, I couldn't have done anything about it, so those are the facts that we're dealing with. If the Court has no objection, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time."

      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When an individual is arrested alongside the car that he has just occupied, the rule of New York v. Belton permits the police to search the car incident to the arrest. In our view, that is true regardless of the reason that the suspect got out of the car before the arrest. The Florida supreme court's contrary ruling in this case should be reversed for three reasons. First, it compromises officer safety in the dangerous and recurring context of vehicle-side arrests. Second, it needlessly complicates --"

      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "I'd like to make one thing clear on that at the outset. Respondent has never challenged the search in this case on the ground that it was not contemporaneous with the arrest. That was not a basis for any of the decisions below. It's not within the question presented by petitioner."

      "speech": "Absolutely. We cite statistics in our brief, I believe it's on page 22, where people who are handcuffed and on the scene do continue to pose a danger to the police. We think that with respect to the question --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "The danger was totally unrelated to the car, wasn't it, because he was in the house."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "The danger was related to the fact of the arrest, and that's what justifies the search under the Belton doctrine as well under the search incident to arrest doctrine. When someone is placed under arrest, he immediately has an increased incentive to get to a weapon that may be nearby, or get to evidence that may be nearby."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but after the person has been removed -- arrested and handcuffed and removed from the scene, put in a house, what's left of Belton to justify the officer going back to the car and making a search?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Well, first of all, I think it's important for the Court to recognize that this case is a little bit unusual in that the person was put into a house. In the more typical Belton situation --"

Belton requires that the search be a contemporaneous incident to the arrest, and we think in a situation like this, where the search and the arrest are plainly part of the same process, where only five minutes separates the arrest from the search -- the officer on this scene had a choice. When he arrested the respondent at the car, he was by himself outside. He had a choice of leaving the respondent unattended by the car as he searched the car, or he had the choice of bringing the respondent into the house, which, although the record is a little bit unclear on this, it suggests it was only about 20 feet away, where other officers were, and where other people were after drug arrests had been made in that house. We think that the Constitution and the Fourth Amendment gives the officer in Officer Maney's position the leeway to make that choice, and if the Court were to adopt a different regime, it would be inviting all the sorts of line-drawing, case-by-case determinations that it sought to foreclose in Belton with respect to the initial just --"

Michigan v. Long, which was decided just a year after this Court's decision in Belton, is that type of situations. Police may be conducting surveillance activities.

When he approached the car, he smelled the odor of burnt marijuana, and he looked inside, and saw an envelope marked Super Gold. That envelope he immediately recognized as being associated with marijuana. Therefore, he had probable cause to believe not only that these four passengers were in possession of marijuana, but that they had used marijuana because of the burnt marijuana smoke. He ordered the passengers out of the car and placed them under arrest. He did not handcuff them, either because he could not, because there were four of them, or because he chose not to do so. What he did to protect himself was merely to separate them on the Thruway. He separated them so that they could not touch each other, being in reaching distance of each other, and this was one officer without backup, and he was confronted with four individuals. With the --"

So in other words, if it were a knowledgeable subject it would be a disincentive to distance yourself, because not only that, you might get a charge for fleeing and eluding. You're running out of the car, but that car is always subject to search once that officer has put on those lights, has put on the siren, has announced over a loudspeaker that he wishes confrontation, has shouted, hey you, sir.

What Belton says, in exact language is, it says, as a custodial arrest of the occupant, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, you may search the passenger compartment, and then to make clear what they're talking about, they say, we're asking when police may search inside the automobile after the arrestee is no longer in it, all right.

Not only that, I think it would be very dangerous to tell a person who is still in control of the accelerator, the steering wheel, and the key, you are under arrest. I think that that might be an invitation to get run over, so it might be a good idea to wait and say, would you please get out of the car, and now that he has some modicum of control over this individual, because in Mimms face-to-face confrontation reduces the danger, then say, sir, I am placing you under arrest."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DODGE",

However, if there is probable cause to believe that that person is going to the crack house and is carrying contraband, then the car could be searched pursuant to the automobile exception, so it would be a decision -- the officer in that case might want to search that car. He might desperately want to do so, to see what's in it, but it doesn't equate with the necessity to do so to protect himself or to protect any evidence that someone might grab during an arrest process that occurs as the person has distanced himself from the car."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DODGE",
      "speech": "Correct. I don't think it necessarily has to be a nexus, for example, if an officer were following a car, he knew the occupant's identity, and he knew for sure that there had been a warrant issued for the arrest, he would be stopping for the warrant and not for a traffic violation, so that there would not be, necessarily, a nexus, other than the fact that the person is in the car at the time that he is actually apprehended, or the officer's pursuing him. What this does -- and I believe the Florida courts have never considered the Chimel aspects, or Chimel aspects of this case. They've never decided whether or not the passenger compartment and all of the closed containers, the glove box, the pocket on the side of the door were still within the actual grabbing area of Mr. Thomas. In fact, the record is rather sparse with regard to the facts. We know that the door was closed. However, we don't know whether or not the door was locked. We know that Mr. Thomas was in the company of at least three or four narcotics agents who were in the house finishing up the arrests of the residents, so what we're saying is, this case isn't really finished. It was remanded back to the trial court to determine whether or not the officer could have searched the car under Chimel, or Chimel."

There are officers on the street everywhere. Not any of them is a threat to an individual unless the officer is in pursuit of that individual, or has somehow put him on notice that there's going to be some kind of confrontation. So I think it's a good balance to be struck between the privacy rights of an individual in a vehicle and in his containers, because Belton does -- it does cover containers therein, very personal items. That would be purses, brief cases, anything that's in the console, any decorations or mail that you might happen to be carrying from the post office -- if you picked it up at your post office box, that might be carried in your car -- and so it's a good rule that protects both the officers and the individual's right to privacy.

It would be our point that, first of all, what the Supreme Court of Florida has done has remanded to determine whether the Chimel factors exist. That is a question of fact. No matter how that is determined below, the question of law that has been decided, the question of Fourth Amendment interpretation made by the Florida Supreme Court limiting this Court's Belton holding is going to survive, and we therefore submit that this Court certainly has jurisdiction. It's the final decision of the highest court in the State, and it will not be modified. Lastly, I would just like to point out, at pages 31 and 32 of respondent's brief, they make a statement that the danger arises to the officer at the moment that contact is made with the arrestee. Well, in this case, as in many cases that we've cited, that danger arises regardless of the reason.
