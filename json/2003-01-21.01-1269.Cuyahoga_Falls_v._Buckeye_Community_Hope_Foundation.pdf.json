      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that a municipality may be held liable in damages because it withheld the issuance of building permits for a proposed housing project pending a citizen- initiated referendum election on the ordinance authorizing that housing project. In so doing, the Sixth Circuit failed to appreciate that the municipality's actions here were all taken pursuant to pre-existing procedures set forth in the city's charter, procedures that the city followed to the letter. As non-discretionary acts taken in the normal prescribed course, the municipality's actions here were necessarily rational ones taken without discriminatory motives and without treating the respondents here any differently than any other beneficiary of an ordinance would have been treated that was subject to a petition. And for that reason, we respectfully suggest that the Sixth Circuit --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

I guess what I'm getting at is that if city officials -- let's just say the mayor, for the sake of argument, or the mayor and the city council -- in effect, do not establish a policy in the sense that they say, we want to stop black housing projects, but they follow a policy of trying to make it difficult for those housing projects to be approved, and one way they do that is by spurring the -- the request for referendums. Assuming we're going to apply the Monell rule here, isn't that a policy position of the city even within the meaning of Monell?"

In this case, that balance is clear. The city's actions in giving effect to the properly filed referendum petition cannot give rise to liability under the Fair Housing Act or the Equal Protection Clause. It is undisputed that the referendum petition was facially neutral and that numerous reasonable, non-racial grounds supported it. It is also undisputed that the city's process for handling such petitions was longstanding and race-neutral.

And the -- the people who are mechanically in charge of seeing that those things are voted on, that's their job, they should do it, and if those are evil and terrible and contrary to the Constitution, the courts will strike them down when they get passed.

In the first category and the second category, once we got into the business of paying damages, because it turns out that they are evil, that would, in fact, chill the legislative process, which is a democratic process.

There was a series of discretionary acts. For example, the strategy of the city was to do two things. One was to delay this project because they knew that there was a -- a very finite period of time for our little non-profit tax-exempt developer to build this project or lose their financing. So they knew the longer they could delay, the more likely the project would die. And second of all, they wanted to make the project more costly. So, for example, they required, before we even talked about a referendum, a barrier wall to be built before even a building permit that could be issued, a 6-foot earthen wall with a 5-foot fence between two conforming multi-family projects."

Or is -- is its relevance that it increased the damages otherwise attributable to the day -- delay in the permit? How exactly should we regard the referendum? You -- you understand the problem that we're all having with -- with it. Precisely how does it figure in your claim?"

And so the injury that we're talking about from -- from the referendum deals with the city officials using that as the legal shred to be able to deny the building permits. And the evidence we believe that we have proffered to the Court through the summary judgment motion is that there was not only citizen bias, which under Arlington Heights, this Court has indicated we certainly can allow -- it's competent evidence that can be looked at of whether or not legislators used that bias to be able to take that action."

So that the -- the mayor, to that extent, was just telling them to do what the law would require. But in understanding your complaint and how you are tying in the officials to the referendum, are you saying that absent the official prompting, instigation, or whatever you call it, that there would never have been a referendum, that in -- in fact that the mayor whipped up the referendum?"

The referendum was part of the -- an overall scheme by city officials to delay and ultimately kill this project. If that is the case, then the referendum, which Ohio Supreme Court has ruled was illegal to begin with -- even if it was legal, we believe under your jurisprudence if the motivation of the city to use the referendum was unlawful, the violation occurs under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. With regards to your question about the regulatory taking, we saw this -- this case under a due process -- substantive due process, procedural due process -- examination very similar, I think, to the situation that's actually the exact opposite to the City of Eastlake versus Forest City case, which Justice Stevens is the only participating member that was on that particular case."

We're talking about a process where there was a whole set of procedures set up by the City of Cuyahoga Falls of how to approve this site plan ordinance. The -- the site plan procedures were set forth, permitted for a record to be developed, and there was a -- planning commission meetings. There was the city council meetings. And if the city council or the planning commission had denied our right to the site plan ordinance and its benefits, we would have had a right under Ohio law to go under the Ohio Administrative Procedure Act and get a court to review that issue."
