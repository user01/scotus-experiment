One of those enforceable obligations is the indecency restriction which Congress has instructed the Federal Communications Commission to enforce between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Respondents in this case have for years benefited enormously from their free and exclusive use of public spectrum. They argue, however, that neither Congress nor the commission may as a condition of their licenses require that they refrain from broadcasting indecent material when children are most likely to be in the audience."

And I think if one looks at the FCC orders that this Court cited in its prior decision in this case, one will see that a lot of the most vile and lewd material really is in radio.

I want to put a marker in at the outset here with respect to radio, because I do think it's quite important, that they haven't made any argument that those circumstances are any different with respect to radio. It's just as ubiquitous as it was. There isn't even any argument that there's blocking technology available. And I want to make sure, given the kind of vile material that the record demonstrates has been transmitted over time on radio, that the Court focuses on the breadth of the argument that the Respondents are making here. Now, with respect to television, I do think they're making an argument that -- that television broadcasting is no longer uniquely pervasive in the way that it was before. They're not making an argument -- but that, if I may, is a very different kind of argument than one would normally get in support of a -- the suggestion that we ought to depart from stare decisis. They're not -- they're not arguing that broadcast television is any less pervasive than it was. If anything, it's probably more pervasive now. They're not arguing that the harms of that pervasiveness no longer exist. What they're arguing is that there are other media that present harms as well and that with respect -- and that because those other media also present harms, the circumstances require a change in the rule with respect to broadcasters. Now, that -- you can I think look at that in one of two ways. You could say either that's an argument that it's futile to continue to impose this restriction on broadcasters. And I think that's what Fox says at page 33 of its brief. Two points in response to that. I think a significant, if not complete, answer was in this Court's prior decision in this case in which it said that the maintenance of a safe haven is actually particularly important in the context of these changes, a broadcast safe haven. And also I do think that the idea of futility in that nature is foreign to our First Amendment jurisprudence."

And I do think that that is the major objection, that we have a government agency that is going to make decisions about when nudity is okay and when it isn't. You can't do it in terms of time because \"New York\" -- the \"NYPD\" was 7 seconds and another broadcast, \"Catch-22,\" was 40 seconds. So, it's -- it's the appearance of arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in concrete situations. That I think is the major flaw."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VERRILLI",
      "speech": "Let me turn to that, Justice Ginsburg. The -- two points about that: The first one is that as we read this Court's recent decision in Humanitarian Law Project, the question on the Fifth Amendment analysis of whether there is vagueness and arbitrary enforcement has to be answered by reference to the specific broadcasts at issue here. In other words, was there fair notice with respect to these specific broadcasts? And I will get to that, but I -- but let me first go directly to Your Honor's more significant question. And I think the -- the problem with looking at the case that way is that the lens is focused too narrowly in that there, actually, if you -- one broadens out the lens and looks at the wide range of decisions that the commission is making about indecency and then broadens it out even further and looks at the wide range of broadcasts that occur, actually the number of broadcasts are -- that have been identified as even raising a question of arbitrariness or inconsistency is a -- is really quite a miniscule fraction. It's even quite a miniscule fraction even with respect to broadcasts that the commission has adjudicated as indecent or not indecent. And, yes, we would concede that there is not perfect clarity in this rule. It's a context-based rule. As we read Pacifica, the Court suggested in Pacifica that a context-based rule may well be what the Constitution requires here, and that's going to result in some -- something less than absolute precision. But the -- of course, the alternative, I would assume from my friend's perspective, would be worse. The commission could have a list that said never say the following, however many words; never show broadcasting between the hours of 6:00 a.m. -- nudity between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. That would be clearer, but it would -- but, in a way, the commission here, I think by following the context-based approach that I think Pacifica suggested was required, is being -- I mean, \"punished\" is too strong a word, but it's being held against it that it's trying to make reasonable accommodations for First Amendment values. And so, I think when one looks at it both in terms of where the lenses actually ought to be focused here and the fact that the -- the alternative of perfect clarity would reach a less effective accommodation of First Amendment values, then I do think that the commission's position is quite -- quite reasonable and defensible."

When it was here last time, we were dealing with an issue called \"fleeting expletives,\" and that was Fox. And the Fox case involved just that. They didn't really, or we didn't, or the Court didn't, attack the 2001 order which is now at issue. And then, without it going back to the commission, the Second Circuit decided it on a ground that sets aside the 2001 order. Now, can we here just decide the fleeting expletive case, because the fleeting expletive case has to do with one subset of applications of the 2001 order and has to do with part 2(2) or something. I mean, it has -- and how you interpret the words \"material dwells on or repeats.\" Now, that I -- that I understand how to get at. The ABC case raises -- doesn't raise fleeting expletives. It wasn't fleeting. And it raises the question of the validity of -- under vagueness grounds, of 2001 industry guidance and how that's been applied. But the Second Circuit didn't deal with that case. It sent it back to the commission. So, has there been a commission decision recently which has reviewed the basic arguments being made here about the validity of the 2001 industry guidance as applied? Has there been such a thing? Alternatively, has there been an appeals court holding on the -- or analysis of the ABC case?"

This is a new case, nothing to do with what we decided before. This is the case of ABC, period. And it is an attack on the 2001 guidelines, not fleeting expletives. And, therefore, I want to know, at least satisfy myself, that this Fox -- this ABC case has gone through ordinary procedures and, indeed, these arguments have all been made in front of the commission and they've been rejected."

    {
      "speaker": "VERRILLI",
      "speech": "In fairness, I do think that -- that if one reads the commission's disposition of the -- the ABC case, it is applying the 2001 guidance reaching the conclusion that the broadcast was indecent under the 2001 guidance. ABC paid the fine that it was assessed and then, as it has -- as it can do, then invoked the Hobbs Act, went to the court of appeals to challenge it. And so, I do think -- I do actually think that the issues have been considered by the agency and are before the Court. And I do agree with Your Honor, moving I think more directly to the vagueness point, that there really isn't a vagueness issue left with respect to the fleeting expletives in the -- in the Fox case because the Court said the last time the case was here that there is no problem of arbitrary punishment because there was no forfeiture or any other sanction. ABC is in a different position because they were sanctioned. And so, there is an issue with respect to the question of whether the commission's indecency standards can constitutionally be applied here and whether they're too vague. But I do think, and I do -- I would like to spend a minute on that question of whether there is vagueness as applied to the ABC broadcast. Now, the commission's standards in the 2001 guidance say that this is essentially a two-part test. First is a subject matter question: Is there a description or depiction of sexual or excretory activities or organs? And then there's a question of whether the depiction or description is patently offensive under community standards for broadcast informed by three factors: whether the expression is explicit, whether the broadcast dwells on it, and whether it's shocking or pandering or titillating. Now, ABC makes an argument with respect to this broadcast that the nudity in the \"NYPD Blue\" episode is outside of the first subject matter criteria because it didn't have fair notice that buttocks would be considered sexual organs for purposes of application of this -- of this standard. The commission said -- and this is at page 137a of the appendix to the petition -- that it's impossible to believe that they didn't think that the naked display of buttocks would bring them within -- that weren't -- didn't have fair notice that the naked display of buttocks would bring them within this rule.

A lot of it goes to the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the codes, the labels that -- that the programmers put in to begin with, which have to be there in order for the V-chip to decide what gets through and what doesn't. And I would point out in this very case, for example, with respect to the -- for example, the 2003 Billboard Music Award broadcast with the Paris Hilton- Nicole Richie back and forth, one would never have known from the code affixed for the V-chip purpose that that broadcast was going to have those kinds of words in them."

      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to respond initially to some of General Verrilli's general observations. First of all, he talks about indecency as somehow serving as the core of the overall understanding of the regulatory deal that was made here. And it's difficult for me to accept that notion when there was no effort whatsoever to enforce the -- the standard of indecency between 1927 and 1975."
    },

So, it seems a bit much to say, well, they didn't bring any cases for that period. There were no cases to be brought."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "The only point I'm trying to make, Chief Justice, is that if you're talking about this as sort of the core understanding between the parties, it simply played a fairly minor role in the process through the bulk of the regulatory period we're talking about. And, indeed, if you put it in context, this is a statute that prohibits obscenity, profanity, and indecency. And while the FCC spent a lot of time writing about profanity as somehow being offended by what went on in this omnibus order, the commission has completely abandoned that under these circumstances."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
      "speech": "But how about this, Mr. Phillips: Look, you've been given a privilege, and that gives the government at least somewhat more leeway to impose obligations on you. Not -- can't impose everything, but at least has a bit more leeway. And here we've had something that's very historically grounded. We've had this for decades and decades that the broadcast is -- the broadcaster is treated differently. It seems to work, and it -- it seems to be a good thing that there is some safe haven, even if the old technological bases for that safe haven don't exist anymore. So, why not just keep it as it is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, first of all, Justice Kagan, it was important to catch the answer to your question when you asked it of General Verrilli, which was you're not saying that we lose all of our First Amendment rights. So, clearly we retain our First Amendment rights. And, under those circumstances, it seems to me you've got this two ways: First of all, the idea that it, quote, \"worked\" -- it worked perfectly fine from all the way up until 2001, even I would say until 2004, when the commission wildly changed its approach. And it's only become dysfunctional since 2004 and, as we sit here today, literally facing thousands and thousands of ginned-up computer-generated complaints that are holding up literally hundreds of TV license renewals, so that the whole system has come to a screeching halt because of the difficulty of trying to resolve these issues. So, to say that the system is working well, it seems to me, at least from the broadcasters' perspective, is to say -- is to suggest that's just not true."

    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Absolutely, Your Honor, because there are fundamentally different media, and there are different protections and the circumstances are different, and the Court has recognized that media have to be evaluated individually. But what has happened over the 30 years with respect to the broadcast side of television is a very fundamental change. Cable is now equally pervasive. Cable is now equally accessible to TV, satellite equally accessible to TV."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "But that -- but that -- that cuts both ways. People who want to watch broadcasts where these words or expose their children to broadcasts where these words are used, where there is nudity, there are 800 channels where they can go for that. All we're asking for, what the Government is asking for, is a few channels where you can say I'm not going to -- they're not going to hear the \"S\" word, the \"F\" word. They're not going to see nudity. So, the proliferation of other media, it seems to me, cuts against you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, it seems to me there are two answers to that: First of all, the notion that one medium operates in a certain way in the exercise of its First Amendment rights can be used as an -- as an explanation for taking away or for -- for restricting the First Amendment rights of another medium is flatly inconsistent with what this Court has said across the board in the First Amendment context. You don't balance off one speaker against another and give one favored status and give another unfavored status."

      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, you can get a safe harbor, and, indeed, there are a number of safe harbors that are out there. First of all, there are a ton of cable networks that are aimed exclusively at children. And, you know, there are five, six, eight stations that, I guarantee you, you will see -- where you'll see none of that language. And, second of all, it's always available to the United States Government to decide to hold this -- to create its own license for the United States to be a broadcaster and to ensure that the broadcasts of the United States public network exclude anything they want to exclude because that's government speech and is in no way restricted by what the First Amendment would provide."

There's a whole slew of questions. I mean, the -- and if you go beyond that and you think about what speech has been chilled, the Tillman memorial service is not broadcast because of fear of what's going to be said there. Football games, basketball games, local news events --"

I doubt in Golden Globe, when it was before the commission, they raised all these vagueness challenges to the whole 2001 policy. So, why -- here you've taken a much broader stance now, though you didn't before. I mean, do you want to say anything about what I think is the basic issue that Fox raises? We don't have to overrule Pacifica. What Fox was penalized for was two women on television who basically used a fleeting expletive which seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary."

But you have to realize, Justice Breyer, that what -- I mean, the Second Circuit, because it didn't have available to it sort of what to do precisely with Pacifica, tended to focus on the question of vagueness. Vagueness was certainly an argument that we made there, but --"

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

I mean, if you want us to be really clear, you should ask the FCC to simply outlaw any fleeting use of the \"F\" word, the \"S\" word, any -- any shots of any nudity in any movie, buttocks included. That would give you all of the notice that you need. Why don't you propose that? Boy, that's certain as can be."

      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Well, our basic argument would then -- I mean, obviously what you'd be taking away is the vagueness argument, but that would just bring you back then, Justice Scalia, to the core Pacifica argument and the question of how far can the -- how is it permissible to allow the FCC to regulate the broadcast networks on standards that are fundamentally different than cable, the Internet, and every other medium that exists? I -- you know, I'd be perfectly happy if they want to try to adopt those kinds of standards and subject them to the strict scrutiny requirements that this Court applies to every other medium, because the truth is those requirements will not withstand scrutiny under those particular standards."

So, yes, I do think you can expect on cable and any other forum in which you have humans speaking that this kind of language will expand. I don't know that it -- and it will probably be the case that in some context, particularly live television, which is really what's placed in jeopardy by this, that you will have less live television because your concern is people will continue to use this language. On a lot of awards shows, I think it's candidly easier to go ahead and -- and bleep this. It's not always -- it's not foolproof, but the stations are committed to doing that. They've all got their standards. And that was applied in this particular case. So, while there may be some marginal increase in it, if you compare it to the use of this language beyond the broadcast context, it's the -- it is just the narrowest of slivers of increase, Justice Kennedy."

So, yes, I think there's probably a certain edgierness to it, but that said, it's still clear that -- that as long as you have advertising revenue that drives a significant amount of the decisionmaking here, you're going to have the kind of self-restraint that frankly ought to cause the Court to say we should no -- we no longer need to treat the broadcast medium as the weak sister of -- of the media. And, therefore, they ought to have the same protections that everybody else has, and that they will engage in the same restrained approach to these kinds of issues that newspapers do. I mean, the Post doesn't run the language of the case that's -- that's being argued before it. Cable does. All of those media do. Because there are natural restraints.

A regime in which government officials decide years after the fact that 7 seconds of rear nudity in this particular episode of \"NYPD Blue\" is indecent, but 40 seconds of nudity including full frontal nudity in \"Catch-22\" is not; that expletives in a documentary about blues musicians is indecent, but even more of those expletives in a fictional movie about World War II is not, is constitutionally intolerable."

In other words, what I'm driving at is the basic thing that's worrying me here: Does this case in front of us really call for the earthshaking decision that you all have argued for in the -- in the briefs? And that's what I'm trying to figure out, and that's why I am particularly worried about whether or not this whole big argument here was presented to the FCC about whether we have to reach that far. Now do you see where I was trying to get?"

We, of course, didn't ask the -- suggest to the commission that it should no longer apply Pacifica because the factual predicates for more relaxed scrutiny didn't apply, as we didn't in the Second Circuit, because only this Court can reconsider the application of that standard. So, that's an argument we're making here. That argument is not necessary to resolving this case, either on First or Fifth Amendment grounds. This broadcast -- and particularly in light of the ubiquitous V-chip, this broadcast is not actionably indecent under Pacifica, number one. With respect to notice or the vagueness of the application to this show, clearly this was a shot out of the blue. The commission cannot identify -- I challenge the commission to identify a single decision of the commission issued before this was broadcast in 2003 in which it had sanctioned any display of nudity, and I'm going all the way back to 1978."

I haven't cited the -- I haven't attempted to hypothesize about all the other instances, but let's just look at what's at stake here because the issue, Justice Breyer, is not just notice to ABC in this case. The question is whether the standards -- the commission's standards as it's currently applying them are so vague and capacious that they not only permit arbitrary action, but they are engaging in arbitrary action. Right now, as -- as Mr. Phillips suggested, the commission has pending before it, which it has not denied for years, complaints about the opening episode of the last Olympics, which included a -- a statue very much like some of the statues that are here in this courtroom, that had bare breasts and buttocks.

The first one is to revert back to the prior enforcement regime that existed before 2004, which deferred to reasonable judgments, was restricted to material that is not momentary exposure but is dwelled upon, and that, as Pacifica explained, was egregious material akin to depictions of erotic activity. The second thing they could do is make this three-factor test -- or however many factors it is -- a test, not just a nonexclusive list of an infinite number of factors that could or couldn't be balanced in any way the commission wants to. Even if it wants to leave it as factors -- and this is number three -- it could at least identify what they are and apply them consistency -- consistently through adjudication that explains why one over-balances the other, which it certainly did not do in this case. And it also could clean up the actual form of the words that it uses, referring, for example, to sexually explicit or excretory activity. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."

So, the idea that there's a significant First Amendment problem that encompasses a wide variety of broadcast expression I just don't think comports with the facts. Second, I do think if one looks at the corpus of decisions that the commission has made about what's indecent and what isn't, I think one can see with respect to the large majority of them, the vast majority of them, that it's clear which side of the line something fell on. Yes, there isn't perfect clarity. There are going to be some hard cases. But they really have identified what is, in the great scheme of things, a trivial number of hard cases. I don't think one can say that this is a situation like Reno in which there's effectively no standard at all. In Reno, this Court distinguished the Pacifica situation eight ways to Sunday, and I think we've identified them in our brief and those are valid. I do think there's a significant problem certain artists to be interviewed because, even though it's unscripted, there's always a risk they're going to say something they shouldn't say."
