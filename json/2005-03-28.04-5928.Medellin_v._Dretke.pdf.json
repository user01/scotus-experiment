    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: This case was exceptionally important when the Court granted it, and it's even more important now. It belongs in this Court. At the same time, Mr. Medellin requests that the Court hold the case while he goes back to Texas. I'd like to explain why, before I turn to the merits. Under its decision last year in ex parte, so far, Texas has modified its longstanding two-forums rule. Court of Criminal Appeals will now entertain a subsequent application for habeas writ, even if there are proceedings pending before a Federal Court, so long as the Federal Court stays its proceedings. The Court designed that procedure so that a habeas petitioner could return to state court to exhaust an unexhausted claim without compromising his right to federal habeas ­"

The question, whether or not the United States will comply with an international obligation that every actor here -- the United States, Texas, and the Petitioner -- all recognize as binding, is an important question.

The President's determination, in fact, eliminates the -- even setting aside its independent force, eliminates the basic objection of Texas to that course of action. And then, of course, there's the basic independent full force of the Supremacy Clause. So if I may move to that, the Court, as I said, has recognized the importance of the United States complying with an international obligation reflected in treaties entered into by the democratically elected representatives of the American people. I want to address the question presented first, because, I -- before -- setting aside the presidential determination -- and just take a look at where we stand after the briefing by the parties as a ­ - on the question whether or not the Avena judgement provides the rule of decision. First of all, there's an extraordinary amount of agreement between petitioner and respondent. Respondent agrees that the Vienna Convention is a binding legal commitment of the United States. The Respondent agrees that the Convention is self­ executing. The Respondent agrees that the United States agreed to submit disputes concerning the application and interpretation of the Convention to the ICJ. He agrees that the United States agreed that any determination by the International Court of Justice would be binding."

But the Respondent confuses the creation of a cause of action with what the -- a treaty will typically do. The treaty here lays out the rights, and the treaty lays out an individual right, as determinated by the ICJ. The treaty will not customarily create the cause of action. For how the United States will abide by its legal obligations -- that is, how the United States will give effect to the international obligation -- we look to domestic law."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

And that's the posture which this case went forward. Mexico asserted rights not only on its own behalf, but on behalf of its nationals. And, therefore, if we think of the -- the three objections that was -- the Respondent has made to whether this Court can give us back the Avena judgement, they come down -- they include the two we've just discussed, and one more. First, they've said there are no individual rights here. But, of course, the treaty, as this Court suggested in Breard, talks specifically about rights -­ quote/unquote, \"rights.\" And that, of course, is what the ICJ held.

And the difficult questions about the constitutional authority for the Executive determination may come back to this Court, but they're not presented by the case right now before the Court.

So I don't believe the Breard case answers it, one way or the other; but, given the United States' consistent position -- and, indeed, it uses very similar language in later treaties, such as the two terrorism treaties that are cited in the United States' brief. It is worth underscoring that on every question currently before this Court in this proceeding, the United States agrees entirely with Texas, that this Court's resolution of this case should be to affirm the judgement of the Fifth Circuit because a COA should not have issued."

I agree with the judgement, or at least I think it should be enforced, and the only place it can be enforced is in the state court that rendered the judgement, because the ICJ said what the United States has to implement is, they have to give a review and reconsideration.\" Now, I suppose, as far as the ICJ is concerned, they don't care if it's done by some federal tribunal, or state, but within our system, it must be the state, mustn't it?"

That's the position the United States has articulated. And so, to the extent this Court gives deference to the Executive's position -- and in matters of foreign affairs, this Court has historically given great deference to that position -- that position states that that should have no effect upon this proceeding."

    "speech": "Under the terms of the applicable treaties, the ICJ has jurisdiction to determine, as a matter of international law, if there is a treaty breach. But those treaties also specify the remedy for any judgement of the ICJ, and that remedy, under Article 94 of the U.N. charter, is recourse to the Security Council. That was explicitly adopted as a political remedy, because it is the prerogative of the President and the political branches to determine how to respond. One of the responses open to the political branch, as the United States has articulated, is to decline to respond. And with respect to the Nicaragua case, that's exactly what the United States did. In that situation -- and that matter was ultimately litigated; Judge Mikva, for the D.C. Circuit, wrote a compelling opinion laying out that decisions of the ICJ are not judicially enforceable in U.S. courts; they are, rather, matters sovereign-to-sovereign. That same reasoning applies here. It is a matter for the Executive to determine how to apply. I would note that Medellin also presents an argument -- two arguments as to why he's presented constitutional claims. One, a due-process claim. Due process was not in the questions presented, as he authored. It was not in the brief that he wrote to the Fifth Circuit asking for a COA. The words \"due process\" do not appear in his merits briefs. And, indeed, under the sections -- the constitutional sections cited, he does not include the Due Process Clause."

    "speech": "There have been cases in the Circuits, Justice Kennedy, that have held that once a COA has issued, the Court of Appeals may consider a claim that would otherwise be beyond the jurisdiction of the courts. But this is a case where a COA has not been issued, and there is a plain procedural obstacle to its issuance that this Court can determine and, therefore, obviate the need to consider the very sensitive and delicate questions that Petitioner has raised."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "I don't think so, Justice O'Connor, because a COA is a jurisdictional requirement. And just as a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement and the prerequisites for proper notice of appeal have to be satisfied, the prerequisites for a proper Certificate of Appealability should be satisfied before this Court goes on to reach the merits of a question, which, as Justice Stevens has pointed out, may never need to be reached at all if the Texas courts recognize the President's determination with respect to the Avena decision or apply the Avena decision itself. And I think it's very noteworthy that the filing that Petitioner made at the end of last week in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals seeking a successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus under Texas law specifically, at page 25, says that Petitioner is relying on the Avena judgement and he's relying on the President's determination, which are two new sources of law that were not available at the time the Texas courts previously addressed the matter and that now are available, which constitutes a ground for a second petition under Texas law, and that, accordingly, the Texas courts should allow this claim to be developed in the state courts and to be litigated there. To me, those statements are almost an admission that the claims that Petitioner has brought here are barred by failure to exhaust available state remedies."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Dreeben, could this question of the effect of the Avena Treaty be brought before the Court? Mr. Donovan raised, I think, the All Writs Act, and he also raised original writs in this court. If the COA doesn't work, then treat this -- I think that's what he's saying -- treat it as though it were an application under the All Writs Act or an original writ."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "I do think that the Court would have the option of availing itself of extraordinary jurisdiction, but, as the Court made clear in the Felker case, its exercise of extraordinary original writs would be informed by the limitations that the AEDPA imposes upon the grant of habeas corpus relief; and, therefore, the Court should look to at least the additional jurisdictional obstacle that the United States and Texas has raised; and, namely, that is that the decision that the Texas courts raised -- issued in this case is not contrary to any Supreme Court decision or a misapplication of any clearly established federal law."

And if we affirm or reverse that jurisdictional ground from the Court of Appeals, we'll decide a lot of issues that will create guidance. We might not have to decide it, because Texas may deal with it; or we may decide, if they come out the other way, they're wrong. But we might. And that's why I was thinking perhaps we should hold it rather than dig it, particularly because that other issue does have some authority the other way.

The Avena decision is not a freestanding source of law that can be administered by this Court wholly apart from the President's determination. What the President did was to determine not that the treaty has a particular meaning that favors Petitioner's case, but that, as a matter of compliance with the obligation of the United States, under international law, to comply with a judgement of the International Court of Justice -- or to determine not to -- but that, in the interest of the rule of law and the obligations that were taken on, the President would create a new source of law, in effect, that would enable the enforcement of that particular judgement, without respect to the validity of the underlying merits determination that the ICJ made. But if this Court were to treat the ICJ judgement as a freestanding source of law, it would frustrate the Executive's ability to determine, in a particular case, this determination by an international tribunal should not be enforced and it should not be given effect; rather, that the President might, in a particular case, choose to -- not to comply with that determination.

And the Court, of course, didn't know that Petitioner would then file a petition for successive writ in the Texas courts that could provide him the review and reconsideration that he now seeks this Court to announce in a ruling that would have extraordinarily broad and detrimental foreign-policy consequences for the United States' freedom to respond to the decisions of international tribunals in a manner that the President sees fit in accordance with his foreign-policy judgement.

    "speaker": "DONOVAN",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The Respondent came to this Court saying that he agrees with Mr. Medellin that America could keep her -- should keep her word. Here's the situation we have. Everybody agrees that these treaties are binding. Everybody agrees now that the President has determined that Mr. Medellin should get exactly what he came to this Court asking for, which is review and reconsideration from the state courts. The -- as Mr. Dreeben has pointed out, and as we advised the Court last week, in order to protect against any statute of limitations bar, we have, in fact, filed in Texas, in order to make these claims, pending the disposition here. And Mr. Medellin is prepared to go forward in state court, making exactly these claims, which the state courts have never had an opportunity to occasion. The question here is, How does this Court fulfill its function of ensuring that the United States complies with its international obligations that the President has now confirmed he will comply with? And, of course, the question here is not whether this -­ whatever this Court does with respect to the question presented here -- that is, Does the Avena judgement having binding effect under the Supremacy Clause? -- in this case, would no in any way constrain the President's determination at some future point, because here we have a situation where the President has said \"comply.\" And so, this case does not raise questions -­ if it operated directly under the Supremacy Clause -­ does not raise a question about what would happen if, in some future case, the political branches made a different determination once an ICJ judgement came to this country. Here, we have the President saying, \"You should do exactly what -- the United States -- what the ICJ said to do.\" So the question is, How does one proceed? We have proposed a means of going forward that, in our view, is respectful to the authority of this Court, that is respectful to the Texas courts, and that's respectful to the President; and that is, to go forward on the subsequent application in the Texas courts, giving them two issues that they've never had a chance to address, the Avena judgement claim and the claim under the President's determination. What should not happen is, that application should not be compromised by any adverse action on this Court, and the suggestion of a dismissal might have compromising effects. At a minimum, it might be perceived as leaving in place a judgement that this Court has already said warranted review and is now, in our view, fatally undermined by the President's determination, as it has been previously fatally undermined by the plain command of the Supremacy Clause. In addition, we would, no doubt -- we're already hearing arguments from the opposition to the motion to stay -- we would no doubt hear arguments that, on some subsequence habeas which the United States says is -- would be available, that that would be a second or successor habeas, even though Mr. Medellin has never had a chance to bring the -­ otherwise, to bring these claims to the Court. And, therefore, the Court might, at some point -- at this point, the best thing to do, if we are going to achieve expeditious compliance with the President's determination -- is, in fact, to stay; not to deal with any of the questions that have been raised here, but to let the Texas courts deal with them in the first instance. If it comes back to this Court in the posture of a direct -- for example, request for certiorari review from a judgement of the Texas courts -- there should be no adverse impact from anything this Court did at this posture, simply because Mr. Medellin came here. And, indeed, it was Mr. Medellin's case that presumably prompted the President to act. That would be unfair, and it would complicated the Court's own disposition. What do we have Texas saying before this Court? Effectively, Texas has come into this courtroom and said neither the President nor this Court can effect -- can give effect of the Avena judgement, because Texas has opposed the Court's authority under the direct operation of the Supremacy Clause, and now Texas has told the Court that the President can't do this either. And in the face of that suggestion, Mr. Medellin has every hope and expectation that the Texas courts will see their obligations under the Supremacy Clause in a form of both the Avena judgement interpreting and applying the Vienna Convention and the President's determination, differently than the Texas authorities have so far announced. But if it does not, this Court should have the full complement of means at its disposal in order to ensure that the United States complies with its international obligations. Mr. Dreeben has, himself, just suggested that there may be circumstances if it were not otherwise achievable. It's hard to think of a more important case for the exercise of this Court's extraordinary writs. But none of that should be in any way compromised by a dismissal, at this point, simply because the President came in in the midst -- in fact, concurrently -- into Mr. Medellin's own case before this Court and made this determination. Instead, as we'd suggest, the appropriate thing would be -- to do is to stay the case, to allow it to go forward in the Texas courts. But if the Court does not wish to stay, we would respectfully suggest that, at this point, under direct command of the Supremacy Clause endorsed by the President's determination, as well as the President's determination itself, the Court should give effect to the United States' promises. Thank you very much."
