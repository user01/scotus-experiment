That violates the Sixth Amendment under Ring. In Florida, and Florida alone, what authorizes imposition of the death penalty is a finding of fact by the Court of an aggravating factor, a finding that the trial judge makes independently, and, quote, \"notwithstanding the jury's recommendation as to sentence.\" Now, the State here contends that capital sentencing juries make implicit findings that satisfy the Sixth Amendment under Ring, which the trial judge then simply ratifies. That is wrong. Whatever the jury's recommendation might imply about the specified aggravating factors, the Florida Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that the jury's verdict is anything other than advisory. Florida law entrusts the factual findings of aggravators to the judge alone, who may do so on the basis of evidence that the jury never heard, and aggravators that the jury was never presented with."

And the State isn't even arguing harmlessness with respect to that. And as to robbery, I think it's important to ­­ to recognize the following: The State made a choice. They didn't even indite Timothy Hurst for robbery. The sentencing jury was not even instructed on the elements of robbery. This argument of harmlessness was never raised in these proceedings from the sentencing proceeding onward, including in the brief in opposition in this case, until the Red brief, and even there the Red brief is simply arguing that there was a fatal concession. But in any event, Justice Ginsburg, there is evidence in the record from which a jury could certainly find that Timothy Hurst, although he was found guilty of first­degree murder, did not, in fact, actually commit the robbery. The jury was told that to find the existence of the felony murder aggravator, it had to find ­­ and I believe this is on Page 211 of the Joint Appendix ­­ that it had to find that the murder was committed while he ­­ in the course of him committing a robbery. All of the physical evidence in this case that relates to the robbery, the ­­ the ­­ the bank deposit slip, the money, the bank deposit envelope, and a piece of paper in Lee­Lee Smith's handwriting toting up the proceeds were all found in Lee­Lee Smith's possession. And so, although it is not this Court's ordinary function to determine whether something was or wasn't harmless, as in Ring it was remanded for that purpose, I think in this case it manifestly was not harmless. And if there were a remand or any question by this Court on that count, it ought to be remanded to the State court, not only to determine constitutional harmlessness, but whether there was a waiver by the State in its deliberate choice never to mention this either to the second sentencing jury or thereafter."

The legislature has determined that the elements necessary to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty is the existence of a murder and one or more aggravating circumstances. And what the other side calls the advisory sentence included within it a finding, as this Court recognized in the United States v.

But I'll say this too, the seven to five is not the same kind of jury verdict that you'd have at a ­­ at a guilt phase because of this judicial backstop, because of the other protections that Florida has put in in place. And so even if it's a seven­to­five vote, you still have the judge coming behind that jury, who ­­ unlike at the guilt phase where he must accept the jury's findings, unless they're not supported by evidence, he or she can disagree for any reason. He or she can give mercy for any reason. And that happens a lot. And so we've cited the ­­ some cases in our brief where a man was convicted of murder in a horrible sexual assault, and by virtue of those two convictions was necessarily eligible for the death penalty. The jury heard all of the evidence, made a recommendation that he receive the death penalty, and the judge said, no, I'm going to sentence him to life. And so this Court ­­ you know, this gets back into the jury versus judge sentencing. But there are some real benefits associated with judicial sentences. And if you go back to Proffitt, when this Court first upheld Florida's capital sentencing system, it recognized the advantages of judicial sentencing because you're not going to have someone's life or death being determined exclusively on the ­­ perhaps the ­­ the emotions of a jury."

      "speech": "Notwithstanding this flurry of papers, I'm aspiring not to use the six minutes. Let me first ­­ let me go right to Justice Scalia's question, which is not a hypothetical, although I'm happy to answer hypotheticals. Your question was: Was the jury told and doesn't a jury have to be told that as to death eligibility, the element of the crime of capital murder, that it makes the decision? The answer is: It does have to be told that. It certainly can't be told the opposite, and it absolutely was not told that. It was told over and over again, consistent with the statute, that its decision was purely advisory. And I want to refer the Court to the Florida Supreme Court's decision in State v. Steele, which is at 921 So. The Florida Supreme Court in Steele said, first of all, \"Nothing in the statute, the standard jury instructions, or the standard verdict form requires a majority of the jury to agree on which aggravating circumstances exist. Under current law, the jury may recommend a sentence of death where four jurors believe only that one aggravator applies, while three others believe that only another aggravator applies, because seven jurors believe that at least one aggravator applies.\" Florida goes beyond that. It ­­ it is unlawful ­­ and the Supreme Court of Florida has said ­­ to require ­­ to ask the jury, the sentencing jury, to provide a special verdict that in any way indicates what their, quote, input is on the sentencing factors. Again, Steele, at page 546. \"Specific jury findings on aggravators, without guidance about their effect on the imposition of a sentence, could unduly influence the trial judge's own determination of how to sentence the defendant. The trial court alone must make detailed findings about the existence and weight of aggravating circumstances.\""

      "speech": "Yes, this is post Ring. And the Court also held that Ring didn't apply. It has no jury findings on which to rely. And, in fact, the Court also explained in ­­ later in the decision ­­ in the same decision and also in its decision in Franklin, that Florida bar ­­ quote, \"Florida bars a special verdict precisely because requiring specific jury findings on aggravators, without guidance about their effect, would harm the jury's independent\" ­­ \"the trial court's independent determination.\" Now, counsel ­­ my ­­ my colleague on the other side here says that, well, there ­­ there would not be a statutory problem, but there would be a Ring problem if we knew that the jury found that no aggravators existed. So how can Ring be satisfied when we have no earthly idea what the jury found? It could be, as in this case, as Steele acknowledges, three for one and four for the other. As to the, I think, hypothetical question that Justice Kagan was asking ­­ so, you know, in a circumstance, how much leeway does the judge have to make his own ­­ his or her own decisions on the death penalty, the Florida Supreme Court has specifically allowed the death penalty to be imposed and a determination of death eligibility to be made based on evidence that was never presented to the sentencing jury and based on an aggravating factor on which the sentencing jury was not applied. And the notion that there hasn't been a life­override since Ring is ­­ is an interesting fact, but this Court, in this Court's Sposiano decision, in this Court's Daubert decision, that's exactly what happened: The jury said, we want life. The judge said, I'm hearing ­­ I'm hearing independent evidence, and you're getting death. Now, as to the supposed concessions in this case, I think I'll rely largely on our brief. But the notion that somebody ­­ that the lawyers said this is a two­aggravator case is certainly true. There were two aggravators charged. And maybe the jury ­­ we know that the trial judge found that two aggravators were satisfied. This defendant has been making the Ring argument since before Ring was decided. He raised this as an Apprendi issue at the very first trial. He asked for a bill of particulars for the ­­ the State to indicate which aggravators it was going to rely on, and he was denied on the grounds that Apprendi doesn't apply. Even the ­­ again, the central Ring problem in this case, the central Sixth Amendment problem in this case, leaving aside the indeterminacy of seven to five ­­ and maybe it's three for one and four for the other ­­ is that, when a Florida sentencing jury finishes its work, there is simply no question: The defendant is not eligible for the death penalty. Only the trial judge can do that. Thank you."
