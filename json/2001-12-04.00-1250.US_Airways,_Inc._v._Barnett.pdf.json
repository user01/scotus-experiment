      "speaker": "DELLINGER",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act does more than merely prohibit hostile discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Congress recognized that an additional kind of discrimination is the failure of employers through indifference or whatever to undertake reasonable accommodations to the physical or mental limitations of otherwise qualified individuals. As a result, this act does affirmatively require businesses to lift barriers that inhibit employment opportunities for those with disabilities. The question here, though, is whether, in one particular respect, the act goes beyond a requirement that obstacles be cleared away. The issue is this. Where an employee is unable, because of a disability, to continue in his job, is that employee entitled to be placed in another position instead of a more senior fellow employee who would be entitled to the job under the normal operation of a bona fide seniority system? Now, this is not an easy question, but we believe that in the end a clear answer necessarily emerges from the act, and that is this, that the act simply does not require an employer to override neutral selection criteria wholly unrelated to disability in choosing among applicants for a position, and in particular it does not require the employer to set aside the normal operation of a bona fide seniority system."

      "speaker": "DELLINGER",
      "speech": "That is correct. In fact, I think the presence of that provision in title VII is part of a background assumption in which neither title VII nor any other Civil Rights Act has ever taken what would be a fairly substantial step of requiring an employer to prefer someone for a position over an employee who is entitled to it under a seniority system or, indeed, to prefer any applicant over a more qualified employee."

      "speaker": "DELLINGER",
      "speech": "Title VII took especial care to do that, but if you look at the more relevant statute, the Rehabilitation Act, it also does not contain any express exception and, moreover, it was interpreted not to require that, but most importantly under title VII, is this Court's decision in TWA v. Hardison, where the Court said it would reach the same result as the principle we argue for here, even without, even before you get to the portion of the act about bona fide seniority systems. The Court in Hardison held that the reasonable accommodation language of that act for religious adherence, the same reasonable accommodation undue hardship language does not require displacing the rights of more senior employees under a seniority system in order to accommodate a religious adherence need to avoid working on a Saturday shift."

What they were not obligated to do at this point, after they've identified available positions, overridden any arbitrary rules that say, you know, some people can't have that position, altered the position, they then consider whether there's any good reason not to place Mr. Barnett in that position and, in the absence of a good reason, they are required by this provision to do so.

Now, nobody's doubting the employer's good faith. The question is, well, why not make na exception for us. You have a lot of others. Let's have a trial on it to see how open to you that is."

      "speech": "All right, then at that point I'd become uncertain what exactly -- why we should hold what you want, from my point of view. That is, I can easily see this act simply requires the employer to act reasonably, and now you could say, where there's a longstanding seniority system, and there's nothing special about it, and there are zero or very few exceptions, it's automatically a reasonable thing to not stir up enormous trouble in the workplace by saying, we're going to start making exceptions. I could see that. I'm not saying I agree, but I understand it. But now, why is it, if there are, however, quite a few exceptions, that it isn't even open to the handicapped person to argue, make another, it's not unreasonable to make another?"

But it seems to me that under -- if you look at the sequence from the title VII through the Rehabilitation Act, through Hardison, the background principle that our civil rights laws have simply not restricted the ability of an employer to make a good faith determination about how to fill positions, and that nothing in the ADA itself seems to question that bedrock assumption. That is to say, no one suggests, though it would be a perfectly -- not unduly costly that you need to add positions. Everyone seems to concede and agree that you don't need to transfer an employee to a position that would constitute a, quote, promotion, unquote, even though that might -- the employee might be qualified to do that position. No one suggests that you have to bump an employee who was actually sitting in a position. Here, what you have is the defeated expectations under a seniority system, and if that system is bona fide, the way it works is to allow each employee to determine what his or her most important desires are, and that is what you gain through seniority.

      "speech": "-- one of the reasons that I find this particular statute puzzling is that it's not like title VII. Title VII says, thou shalt not discriminate. It says, you don't prefer -- you don't just redress imbalances. It's a straight nondiscrimination statute. This one isn't. This one is driven by a concept called, reasonable accommodation. It makes reasonable accommodation -- if you don't reasonably accommodate, you're discriminating, and so it seems to me that this statute has reasonable accommodation, if it's undue hardship, then it would be unreasonable, but there's nothing like that in title VII. This disabilities act gives a starring role to reasonable accommodation, which it truly doesn't have in title VII, so to give that effect, couldn't you look at this and say, well, this man was already in the job, and no body is going to be out of work, so the accommodation is reasonable. If he were seeking to bump somebody else, it wouldn't be reasonable. Why isn't that an appropriate way to look at this act that's driven by the idea, reasonable accommodation?"

The general language of the act, though, in my view is not sufficient to change the landscape that existed under the Rehabilitation Act, where the Courts had uniformly held that reassignment was never required. It's now a possibility, but you're never required."

We're never -- even though the religious part of title VII requires a reasonable accommodation, we're never going to require another employee to sacrifice his or her standing under the seniority policy. Now, the other part of your question, I think the question asked by Justice Breyer was, but what if it's really reasonable in a particular instance, and here's where I need to suggest why that approach is fundamentally inconsistent with how a seniority system operates. You are introducing an element of judgment and discretion which will unsettle settled expectations in a way that is completely unpredictable. What happens is, you simply can't know what the domino effect will be of substituting for a seniority system. This is a system that is now operated by lower level managers who need to keep a posted list where every employee knows what the position is.

People rebid on positions, and that seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do. It is a -- there's nothing -- what is the bright line, I think, here is that Congress has -- would have fought long and debated hard before it took the major step of saying an employer could not, at the end of the day, once all accommodations had been made, choose a person for a position based on who was the best-qualified or who was the most senior.

I mean, if a company like yours was going to have 100 disability exceptions a month at every terminal, yes, I can see it, but is there any reason to believe that the magnitude of the possible disabilities exceptions under reasonable accommodation would be so great as to have that kind of cataclysmic effect on the general reliance that employees can place on seniority?"

First of all, the petitioner's proposed definition of the term, reasonable accommodation, as meaning fair, proper, fit, appropriate, not extreme, not excessive, et cetera, et cetera, must be rejected, because that construction eviscerates all of the statutory defenses, is contrary to all of the regulations, and it is contrary to the listed reasonable accommodations, including reassignment. Second, the term reasonable accommodation in the ADA means a modification that enables the disabled employee to participate that is reasonable to the disabled employee. Third, even if you --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CENTER",
      "speech": "That's correct. Third, even if you disagree with my proposal for the definition of reasonable accommodation, the term must include the listed reasonable accommodations. Where it says reasonable accommodations may include, those accommodations listed, which include reassignment to a vacant position, are reasonable accommodations by definition."

Why is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CENTER",
      "speech": "Well, I think there are several reasons that the agency, the EEOC has come to that conclusion, which I agree with. First of all, the listed accommodation is reassignment to a vacant position. Congress did not say promotion, and reassignment describes a lateral transfer, ordinarily."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but this is a vacant higher position. They didn't exclude that. This is a vacant position at a higher level. Why wouldn't that be included?"

    {
      "speaker": "CENTER",
      "speech": "Further, the EEOC regulations explain that the purpose of the reasonable accommodation is to enable the disabled employee to enjoy the privileges of employment along with similarly situated disable -­ nondisabled employees, to enjoy equal benefits, and if there's a promotion it's sort of -- it's contrary to that principle."

They wouldn't be allowed to stay in that job, so why can't you do the same thing for a promotion? I mean, the other side has a criterion. Their criterion is, it is -- reasonable accommodation is limited to accommodation to the disability, so you provide him with a working space that will accommodate the fact that he can't stand up for too long, or you put him in another job at the same level that's vacant which doesn't require him to stand up. All of this accommodates the disability, they say. Whereas the accommodation you're urging here has nothing to do with accommodating the disability. It has to do with, I don't know, giving him a different job."

It throws everything up for grabs.

The harm is precisely the same. It's a question of which people suffer it, so I don't see why there isn't a domino effect. It's this chain, or that chain."

It's terrible, and the one think that the 7, the 14,000 who remain have to be certain about is that there's a fair system in place, and once we open it to this kind of argument, well, it's over. Your client has a very bad back. I might think that's somebody that this act should protect, but when we get to the reasonable accommodation stage, at that point, if all those people are in the act, I can't run my system, says the employer, because the claims for special exemption in the bumping will be endless.

Your answer is, well, there's a Federal law and it doesn't protect you, but that would create the same kind of friction in the workforce. People feel that they have been disadvantaged for no just reason, so -- but all those, what the statute lists as reasonable accommodations, every one of those could adversely affect someone who has in that person's view an equally good reason to get the break.

That doesn't destroy any of their expectations when they took the job, and the same thing with allowing somebody to work part- time. It doesn't help me any that somebody can work part- time now. Sure, I'm not allowed to do it, just as I'm not allowed to do the job sitting down, but it doesn't hurt me, whereas what happens here is that the person who had an expectation of seniority entitlement to a certain job has been frustrated in that expectation. It seems to me that's quite different. I mean, we're not talking about whether one employee can be preferred over another. Certainly, the disabled employee can be. But the question is whether it's a reasonable accommodation when it requires you to harm another employee in that employee's job or in that employee's legitimate expectations, and I think that's really what's at issue here, whether it's just the employer that's going to be inconvenienced by this statute, or other employees as well. Why isn't it reasonable to say you cannot destroy the expectations of other employees? What in the statute shows that you can?"

If you approach it the way you do, that it refers only to what's reasonable for the disabled person, that's different, so we have to decide what reasonable accommodation really means, don't we?"

The person who came in and bid on Mr. Barnett's job had no compelling need for the job. He was perfectly able to continue doing his existing job, and Mr. Barnett, by contrast, because the accommodation was denied, became inevitably unemployed, so the equities will frequently favor the disabled employee who faces job loss, even if you pull out reasonable separately like that."

If we reject your client-centered interpretation of reasonable, it's just the same thing. Nondiscrimination, this statute goes beyond nondiscrimination. It requires reasonable accommodation. What's reasonable? Of course, you always have to take into account the interests of other people."

If we -- if the Court rejects my view of the term, reasonable accommodation, you'd have to take into account all of those considerations, but you could not adopt, I don't believe, the per se rule suggested by the petitioner that neutral, you know, selection criteria are always going to trump the ADA. For example, your part-time working scenario, that could be eliminated by a neutral rule that no one can work less than full-time, so that can't be the rule. If it's reasonable, pulled out and looked at in the different criteria, then it has to be case-by-case. It can't simply be deference to a neutral selection criteria."

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, when it comes to filling positions, which is fundamentally different, I think, than adding other elements, there's nothing anomalous about a per se rule, nor is that inconsistent with giving individualized considerations. The rehab act and title VII both said that you don't displace seniority systems. In Hardison v. TWA, this Court did not say you have to ask whether the more senior employee's reason for needing the Saturday off was either trivial or serious. When it comes to positions, there is a good reason for letting the more senior employee choose the more desirable position. I don't think either the line managers or the Ninth Circuit engaging in an individual case-by-case assessment could possibly make that a workable system. The notion that there's no one who's going to be hurt reduces to this, that when the more senior employee claims the position under the regular operation of the statute, their response is to say, well, that more senior employee can always go and be a cargo handler on the night shift. We don't know that. We don't know if that would work. In effect what you're doing when you promote somebody to a greater seniority priority is that you are promoting, and we do know that however reasonable it might be in a particular case, if you did an intensive case-by- case thing to say, why don't we promote this person to the secretarial supervisor, that itself is never required, because we think that in a sense you're really going to lose your way in trying to manage a company if you move away from bedrock proposition that an employer is never required to choose the less-qualified or the less-senior person once they've made all the other accommodations. That would be a major social change. There is an argument that someone who loses one position because of a disability ought to have a priority claim for another position even over someone who is more qualified or more senior for it. That would be a major policy change that we -- for which there are arguments for and against. The Congress --"
