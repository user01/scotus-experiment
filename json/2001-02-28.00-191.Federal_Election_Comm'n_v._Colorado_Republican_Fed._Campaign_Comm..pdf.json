Nothing in the First Amendment requires an exemption from these rules for political parties. Congress recognized that parties are different from other political actors and gave them somewhat higher contribution limits and much higher limits on coordinated expenditures."

But it's very difficult, at least for me to see how receiving a contribution would corrupt a political party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Political parties present the risk -- a risk of the corruption that justifies limits on contributions and coordinated expenditures in two ways. First, because they can receive contributions in much larger amounts than other actors and then redistribute them to candidates, they provide a conduit for other actors to circumvent the contribution limits of the act. Other donors can make large contributions to the party which, though not technically, literally earmarked, and therefore not in violation of the specific earmarking provision of the statute, nevertheless through informal and well understood arrangements find their way through the party to the candidate and create the same risk or appearance of corruption as a direct contribution to the candidate."

      "speech": "Congress has prohibited earmarking, but the Court recognized in Buckley itself that a prohibition on earmarking cannot reach, cannot be effective to reach the whole problem of, in effect, using an intermediary to exceed the limits, and the reason is for one thing an earmarking arrangement requires something more rigid than what would usually happen. I mean, it's not earmarking, for example, if -- within the meaning of the statute, if a contributor understands that there is a good likelihood that the money will be passed by the party to the candidate, although there might be reasons why it would not. In that case it's not earmarking, but it still has the prospect of being regarded by the candidate and by the donor as virtually a contribution."

I can understand why there's, you know, corruption if the donor gives the candidate money and there's a quid pro quo, the candidate says I'll vote for your bill. But you allow individuals to spend $100,000 in their own advertising for this candidate, and it says at the bottom of the ad, you know, paid for by Schwartz, and the candidate knows Schwartz has bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of television advertising, that is perfectly okay, right?"

That seems to me so fanciful to think that the one situation presents, you know, an opportunity for corruption and the other doesn't. You're much better off if you want to corrupt Schwartz, spending the money on an advertisement that says presented, you know, presented by XYZ Corporation."

When you pay somebody's bills, it's no different from handing them a check, and that's what we have here. Now, the additional point that I was addressing was the use of an intermediary to make the, that is, if we, if we have a prohibition on contributions and coordinated -- not a prohibition, a limitation on contributions and coordinated expenditures to protect against corruption, then it can be easily circumvented through intermediaries, and there are only a few ways to solve the intermediary problem. One of them is to limit contributions to the intermediary, in this case the party. Another is to limit contributions by the intermediary to the candidate. That would be from the party to the candidate. And the third is to try to prevent earmarking directly. Each has its pros and cons, and the statute uses each of them to some degree to complement the other. This Court recognized in Buckley that it's impossible to police earmarking sufficiently because of informal and nonrigid arrangements. The approach of limiting contributions to the party so that it can't operate as a pass-through, would starve the party of needed funds. It has disadvantages of that sort. There is a limitation, but it's a high limitation."

There is no limit on its independent expenditures. There is no limit on a large variety of party building and get-out-the-vote and message-communicating activities, and there is a not -- there is a not -- there is a limit, the limit on contributions to candidates, and the limit on coordinated expenditures which are a form of contributions is not disabling.

I think that the most basic common sense proposition here is that so long as there's a limit on what donors can give to a candidate, they will be trying to find ways to get around it, and one good way is to use intermediaries that are not subject to the same limits and that Congress recognized that and attempted to address it without crippling other important functions by putting a limit on the contributions, by not prohibiting, but putting a limit on the contributions and coordinated expenditures that parties can make to candidates. There is a second corruption concern, and that is the concern, not that the party would act as a conduit, but that the party leaders in charge of dispensing funds would, in effect, exact -- pay for votes, would themselves tie money to legislative actions. There is no direct evidence in the record of that happening, but it is the case that if a candidate's own family can be subject to a prohibition on contributions in order to protect corruption, there is no such thing as being too close to corrupt, and --"

Moreover, this particular Federal limit stands in contrast to the majority of State laws which may restrict contributions to political parties, and contributions to candidates do not restrict the amount of party support that can be received by candidates themselves with State elections. The money that the party can spend for the prohibition --"

Three have repealed these restrictions, most recently Colorado last year and also our largest State, the State of California in November of 2000 had a referendum and over 60 percent of the voters of California supported that proposition, which was number 34, and that proposition placed numerous restrictions on contributions to candidates, contributions to political parties, but at the same time repealed a short-lived restriction that the State of California had on the amount of contributions or expenditures that parties could make in support of candidates for office in the State of California. The money that the parties can use to support their candidates for the House and the Senate and even for President has to be the so-called hard money. The District Court noted in its opinion that the majority of this so-called hard money that the national parties raise comes in sums of less than $100. It is true that there are contribution limits that are somewhat higher for parties and for candidates. For my client, the Colorado Republican Party, that limit is $5,000 per year. And for national party committees the limit on individuals is a maximum of $20,000 a year. I believe the record shows that there are very few $20,000 contributions --"

And then if you win, instead of $4,000, he could take $80,000 through the party. All right,so if you assume a Senate race that costs $4 million, let's say, the difference would be between whether you had to find 50 willing donors with families or a thousand. So couldn't Congress conclude that where a Senator is dependent upon 50 families with $80,000 each, the appearance, anyway, that the Senator will be quite beholden to those 50 is far greater than where he must, in fact, get that $4 million from at least a thousand? Now, that it seems to me is what the government's argument boils down to, and they're saying we never know about these corruption things or the appearance, but the difference between fifty families and a thousand families is as good as any."

But if you win this, the limitation's gone, and therefore the first thing a candidate does is he says to the 50 people who know him the best, thank you for the four. Now I'll tell you how you give me $76,000 more. Just write the check to the party, and I'll keep a tally, and so do they. And believe me, I'll know where it comes from."

      "speech": "Well, the record reflects that many candidates, primarily incumbent office holders, are very active in raising money for their parties. The record also shows that political parties are the only source of financial support in our system that do not primarily support incumbents. In fact, this past election we have experienced the phenomenon that more money is being donated to political parties from excess funds of incumbents who face virtually no competition in their reelection efforts than the amount of money that is actually being spent by political parties to support other incumbents who are in danger of losing reelection. So we have a possibility here that the people that candidates should really be indebted to are incumbents who are relinquishing large sums of their own money to help their party elect challengers and open-seat candidates to join incumbents in the House or the Senate. And that is what this record shows. This record also shows that the money, the hard money that's being spent is being spent on party speech. Over 90 percent of the money that's subject to these spending limits is for direct mail and television and radio. Now, that's as of 1997. I believe that percentage has increased since we took all of those facts back in 1997. The record also shows that the political parties like to control how they are going to spend their money. They don't like to just give a pot of money over to the candidates. The record shows in the testimony of Donald Dane, Colorado Republican Chairman, that we don't want to do that. We don't know how our money is going to be spent. We have so much difficulty raising this money, why would we want to do that. We want to decide how it's going to be spent, for what purpose and whether or not this was a good use of our limited resources, and that is actually what the practical effect is of striking down this spending limit is, I think there is a misconception --"

It doesn't do a party any good to have a right to spend $3 million under this limit in California if there isn't a competitive race there for the Senate and at the same time, there might be an extremely competitive race in the State of Colorado where the limit is 200 or $300,000, depending on the formula, so the party has whatever money has been voluntarily contributed to it under all of those other restrictions. It's hard money. They decide well, we want to spend perhaps $500,000 in Colorado, or we want to spend a greater amount of money in California if we did have a competitive race."

They contradicted their candidates. They may have mischaracterized their position, and the result is, that in order for them to exercise their full First Amendment rights by spending their money independently and ripping themselves away from their indispensable candidates, they actually run the risk of harming the candidates who are so important to their own electoral success.

There is no reason why a party could not say we will only financially support candidates who agree with our party platform to cut taxes.

Right now, there is actually a perverse effect of these limits, rather than preventing corruption, arguably, they are promoting corruption because the limits tell a party chairman or fund-raiser it really doesn't matter how much hard money you raise. You are not going to be able to spend more than this amount to promote your candidates. So a party leader says, well, why should I devote my limited resources and time and energy on raising more hard money that I cannot spend, as opposed to going out and raising more of the soft money, which cannot be spent for perhaps the same purposes, and can't be as politically effective, but I'm going to raise more soft money and the statistics that are in the record show that soft money has increased at triple digit rates from '92 to '96, '96 to 2000, and yet hard money fund-raising has essentially plateaued."

And the genesis of this particular limit was introduced in the United States Senate back in 1973 or 1974 at a time they were considering a bill which provided for no private contributions in general elections for the Senate or the House and that there was going to be completely publicly-financed and when they got to this public financing proposition, somebody got up and said, well, what about the parties? I mean, we have got to let them operate and they said, well, that's great, we're going to let them operate, but of course, our principal concern in addition to corruption is we want to equalize resources and we want to make sure that there is not excessive spending so we're going to devise this formula, which is more generous than we are providing to anyone. In fact, it's generous exponentially because we're telling individuals and political committees they cannot contribute to these candidates at all, and that's the genesis of this limitation. We discussed that in 1996 before this Court that shows that historically this was a limit imposed to prevent excessive spending. This court noted it in the decision of FEC vs. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the plurality decision noted that congressional purpose."

And other than the report language that was noted in the Government's brief regarding the effect of this provision after Buckley, there is no other congressional utterance that I'm aware of regarding the purpose of the statute. This really is a relic from Congress' effort to basically control spending in the entire political process. There is one final point I would like to bring to the Court's attention. There has been discussion about Congress' treatment of family members and there is an intimation that perhaps there was no record or legislative record regarding Congress' actions in that regard. We noted in our reply brief in 1996 that there is legislative record of concern back in 1974 about wealthy family individuals contributing to candidates of their family. There was even the example noted of concern that Nelson Rockefeller's mother had contributed one and a half million dollars to his campaign in 1968, and there are some floor statements by legislators as well. So it is not accurate to say that Congress did not have any expression of concern about family members, as opposed to political parties, and that record was presented to this Court in Buckley when it considered all of those statutes at that time. I would also like to address the question about what is the definition of coordination. That is in the statute, Section 441A. It does prohibit or it does turn an expenditure into a contribution if there has been a request or a suggestion, if there has been consultation with the candidate and I don't believe it's at all clear whether the Government would not restrict a political party's spending if they simply went to a candidate as suggested by Justice Scalia and said, well, will this help you or will this hurt you? There is some history of FEC enforcement that suggests that at least as far as the commission is concerned that would constitute coordination and therefore would be either subject to our limit or somehow barred under the contribution limits. If there are no further questions, I have covered everything I intended to cover."

      "speech": "Well, at pages 28 and 29 of our brief, we quote some legislative history. I think my colleague discounts it because it was at a time when the structure of the statute was somewhat different so the evasion and the conduit that was possible was somewhat different but it was nevertheless then, and is now, aimed at preventing parties from enabling individuals to avoid their limits. I mean, at page 28, Senator Matthias says that the point of this is to prevent an indirect contribution by a candidate -- by a contributor to a candidate going through the party. That was why the provision was in the statute. The coordinated expenditures are like contributions and it was the premise of Buckley, over some objection to be sure, that they have a greater potential for corruption than independent expenditures. That's true for parties and for political action committees, as well as for individuals, and it's true for fat cat contributors, as well as for small contributors, so the right that's being claimed here, the constitutional right here to unlimited coordinated expenditures is, in effect, a claim of right to unlimited contributions. The Colorado Republican Party isn't making that argument, but it seems to follow from their argument because parties -- and the reason why, although parties are different from other kinds of actors in the system, they nevertheless need to be subjected to some limits, is precisely because, as intermediaries, they can serve to defeat the other limits of the statute. A party has no more -- that was a judgment Congress was entitled to make, not compelled to make, but entitled to make. It solves a part of the problem but not the whole problem. Political parties, though, have no more a constitutional right to exemption from limits on contributions than do political action committees and, in fact, Congress gave them much higher limits."
