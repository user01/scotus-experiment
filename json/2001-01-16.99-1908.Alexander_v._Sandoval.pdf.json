      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: There are two points that I would like to make this morning. The first is that it is never appropriate for a branch of the Federal Government to imply the creation of a private right of action under the spending power. The second is that, regardless of the participation of the State as a defendant in this case, the Court's implied right-of-action doctrine does not extend to these disparate effect regulations. Let me start with the first point. In case after case over the last two to three decades the Court has made clear that States are not run-of-the-mill civil defendants. They are not mere interest groups. They are coequal sovereigns and, as a result, the Court has not lightly inferred that Congress means to regulate the States as States, to regulate in core areas of local sovereignty, or, as here, to expose the States to a private right of action. Those principles are particularly critical when it comes to the spending --"

Indeed, in Cannon, the Court distinguished a case not unlike this one on just this ground. In Cannon, in footnote 13, the Court reviewed many of the implied right-of-action cases it had decided, and it looked at a case called Santa Clara Pueblo, a case in which the Court had not implied a right of action against a tribe, and for that -- and the reason it did not imply a right of action was because tribes are sovereigns. Now, they're statutory sovereigns, whereas States are constitutional sovereigns."

Dole, Pennhurst, all of those cases made clear, when you alter the Federal- State balance Congress has to be unmistakable in what it's doing, and in this case it was anything but unmistakable.

The Court -- the only case that's been identified so far by respondents involving what seems to be an oxymoron, implied right of action against the State, is the Allen case from 1969. That was not a Spending Clause case, point number 1, but point number 2, more importantly, that's a case that falls under this case's -- this Court's decisions, specifically Atascadero, where you can have an overwhelming implication in the statute that a right of action was created. In Allen, had there not been a right of action, the individuals would not have been able to enforce other parts of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. That case is not a classic implied right-of-action case where there's no suggestion in the statute that Congress meant to create a right of action. In this case, it's just the opposite. Here, Congress did create a right of action, just not by private individuals, by agencies, so you said my first proposition is a sweeping one, and perhaps it is, but there are not a lot of cases recognizing the implied right-of-action doctrine against States. I mean, that's not something the Court has been doing."

But I do want to go back to, I think a premise in your question, which is that this argument is somehow sweeping because there are lots of other civil rights statutes where somehow there would not now be a right of action against the State, and we're concerned about that. I don't think that's true, however. I don't know what those statutes are. No one's pointed them out. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 itself, Congress was very explicit when it wanted either private rights of action, as in Title II or Title VII, or AG enforcement actions, as in Title III and Title IV. Title VI --"

      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "That's true, Your Honor, but as I pointed out, in Cannon, in footnote 14, the Court has already dealt with this very issue. Santa Clara Pueblo was a case that was an ex parte Young action against a tribe. What the statute in that case said is, we create an express right of action for habeas corpus relief. It said nothing else under the Indian Civil Rights Act. That was the statute at issue. The Court said, in light of the silence, in light of the express creation of one cause of action, silence about any other one, and in light of the sovereignty of the -- the statutory sovereignty of tribes, we're not going to imply a right of action. That's Cannon itself, and that is this case. If you don't imply rights of action casually against statutory sovereigns, you surely don't do it against constitutional sovereigns."

It does not contest the standard, because what happens in 1986 is, Congress shows it understands this dialogue between the Court and Congress as to what is required before you regulate the States in these areas, and I think there's a very good argument that Congress was express in 1986 that there were causes of action against States, but conspicuously missing from those amendments is any indication that they were causes of action under regulations, as opposed to the statutory antidiscrimination --"

I mean, in other words, all statutes that are silent about creating a private right of action, and I'm acknowledging the argument is sweeping in that respect. It applies to all statutes. You are right, after 1986, when it comes to Section 504, Title IX and Title VI, the argument's not sweeping at all when it comes to the antidiscrimination mandate, because, as respondents have argued, in 1986 Congress picked up on the dialogue and said, we are going to create an express right of action, so when it comes to intentional discrimination, that which is barred by Title VI or Title IX, there is a right of action. But the critical failing with that particular argument, and I think that's why it's really not being relied upon by respondents, is Congress says nothing at all about rights of action under regulations, which you know, after all, is an extraordinary concept."

    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "There would be with respect to the first argument I'm making, but let me switch now to the second argument we're making, where I do not think there would be a right of action against a city, county, or for that matter, a private person. When one looks at all of the Court's implied right-of-action cases whether it's 1964 in the Borak decision, or Cannon, or more recent decisions, they all start with and agree that the most important point is congressional intent, congressional meaning and design. There are several indicators in Title VI that Congress did not mean to imply the creation of a private right of action under the section 602 regulations. The first is that as this case comes to the Court there's no doubt what the antidiscrimination mandate means. Everyone agrees. No one's contesting Bakke, Fordice, for the view that 601 only prescribes what the Equal Protection Clause prescribes, so first of all it's a very unusual way for Congress to work, to prescribe one type of State action or city, county action and then somehow implicitly create a cause of action with an entirely different standard of review. The second indicator of congressional intent, it may be helpful to look at the statute itself, and if you look at -- if you're interested, if you look at page 1 and 2 of the blue brief, our opening brief, I'd like to point out some language that I think is -- well, we're obviously a little biased, but close to dispositive on this particular point. If you're relying on Section 602 to implicitly create this cause of action, you've got to read all of Section 602. Granted, it does create rulemaking authority for the agencies, but if you look on page 2 -- it's about eight or nine lines down, the beginning of a new sentence -- you have the sentence that says, compliance with any requirement adopted pursuant to this section may be affected, so once again, compliance with any requirement adopted in accordance with this section. In other words, Section 602 does give rulemaking authority to agencies, but it then says, if you want to enforce those rules, here's how you do it, and the here's how you do it creates special rules when it comes to termination of funding --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "Exactly, Your Honor, and this is critical. The second possibility for getting compliance with these rules is by any other means authorized by law and, as the Federal Government acknowledged in its brief, I think at page 11, that includes, for example, injunctive relief so, for example, under that, at a minimum all agree an agency could come in and enjoin the State conduct, for example, the way Alabama is administering its driver's licenses. But here's now the critical second statutory point. You then have this proviso, exactly after the line that Justice O'Connor has quoted, that now says that no such action -- the such is obviously referring to everything they've discussed so far -- says, shall be taken until the department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate persons, here the Alabama Department of Public Safety, of the failure to comply with a requirement, has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means. How in the world could a private individual establish that a State is in compliance with a Federal agency rule? That's not something they have --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, one way the two could be reconciled, and I'm not suggesting that it's the best way, but one way to reconcile them would be to say that the private right of action is contingent upon the States having taken the steps in the proviso, so that until the State had notified, and until there had been some conclusion drawn that voluntary compliance would not be reached in the absence of action, the private party could not seek the injunction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "But Your Honor, let's take the most virtuous and earnest State Attorney General. They're faced with one of these private enforcement actions, and the private litigant does what you're suggesting. They first put them on notice. They send a letter, listen, we don't think what you're doing is permissible under this rule --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I was suggesting something perhaps even more awkward. I was suggesting that the private litigant couldn't go ahead until the State agency had said, you know, you're out of compliance, and the State agency had come to some conclusion that voluntary compliance was in fact not feasible. At that point the individual could then go ahead with the suit, and one of the predicates for the private injunctive suit would be, the State has tried to get voluntary compliance and it can't."

They get this lawsuit, and the private individual says, listen, we'd like to give you an opportunity to voluntarily comply, and here's how we suggest you do it. What assurance, what guarantee is there that the State is now in compliance with a Federal agency's rules that this --"

      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "speech": "It does, Your Honor, and you're -- this is a better point than the one I'm making in response to Justice Souter. That language makes it clear who is the one that's doing the advising, and if we're going to draw any inferences from this statutory scheme, it's an inference that whatever could be done under Section 601, under Section 602, that was an enforcement provision for agencies, enforcement provision in the sense that they could promulgate rules to effectuate Section 601, and then they could go about enforcing them, but as the Chief Justice's question points out, it is the Federal department or agency that they're referring to."

After all, in 1986 they didn't create a right of action. All they did is, they said, we're abrogating the State immunity. But I want to make sure I'm understanding a point that I'm not sure I addressed, and this goes back to the compliance sentence about nine lines down on page 2. It says, compliance with any requirement adopted according to this section, and I don't know how one can read that to say, you don't follow these rules when you try to obtain compliance."

In fact, it even comes from the line of authority in which respondents are relying, and that's the securities cases. There have been many cases under Section 10(b) and under Rule 10(b)(5) where plaintiffs have attempted to bring a cause of action that broadens Section 10(b). The most notable of them is Central Bank from six terms ago. Another one, Ernst & Ernst v. Hockhelder in 1976 were both situations in which the private litigants attempted to create a cause of action to Rule 10(b)(5), which actually has an even broader source of statutory authority, and the Court rejected them because they created a cause of action that contained fewer elements than the statutory right of action, and I think that's a good analogy here."

Petitioners have suggested that there can never be an implied cause of action to enforce a regulation, or I would have to say here as well a rule, because that's really where this has come up, that contains a prohibition not contained in the statute itself. This Court has done that on two occasions. In Borak v. J.I. Case, which was decided shortly before the announcement of the adoption of this statute, the Court recognized an implied cause of action to enforce rule, part of Rule 14.

In any event, those decisions reflected the standard for implying causes of actions that were prevailing at the time the 1964 Civil Rights Act was adopted and it's been the practice of this Court, in addressing the question of whether it would imply a cause of action, to look at the law that existed when the statute was adopted, on the presumption that Congress would have intended whatever result would follow from the then-prevailing law."

Finally, with regard to the suggestion of the petitioners, they urge quite specifically that a regulation cannot forbid action not forbidden by the statute itself. The Court has addressed that question on several occasions, in Morning v. Family Publications Service with regard to the truth-in-lending law, and in Gemsco v. Walling, a 1946 decision with regard to the minimum wage. Both cases involved prohibitions containing regulations which clearly went beyond the language of the statutes. Both cases, they were upheld by this Court, and Gemsco again was the prevailing law at the time the Congress authorized regulations in 602, so it seems to me that's appropriate to look to here. With regard to the argument regarding the limitations on the preconditions for certain actions under Section 602, this Court has addressed that question already in Cannon. It's important to note here that Congress clearly intended that the limitations in Section 602 on an agency action would apply in a discriminatory intent case. Indeed, the -- that was a particular focus -- intentional commission was a particular focus in 1964. The one thing that's certain is that Congress didn't intend to permit an agency to cut off a State agency or a city agency or a private entity from Federal funding without going through all the loops set up in Section 602. That is to say, Section 602 applies even where we're dealing with a Section 601 violation. So the Court had that problem before it in Cannon, and this very argument was made. It was made in Justice White's dissent in Cannon. It was made in Justice White's opinion in Bakke. It was made in Justice Powell's dissent in Guardians. It was made by the defendants --"

That the notice and predetermination clause of Section 602 would be evaded if you allowed a private cause of action, because private parties don't make those -- you know, can't, or don't do those things. That very argument was made in all three cases and it's never been accepted by the Court, indeed, specifically was rejected by this Court."

There is no case of which I am aware in which this Court has ever even suggested, much less held, that in determining the scope of a right of action, whether expressed or implied, that a distinction should be made between rights articulated in a statute itself, and rights articulated in substantive regulations that the statute mandates that the agency promulgate."

We have -- since the statute was passed, we have taken a different and at least in the minds of some of us a more realistic view of the circumstances in which you really can in fact infer a congressional intent to provide -- to recognize a private right of action, so we're trying to preserve Congress' expectations with respect to the law that was passed under the earlier regime, but it's also sensible for us not to expand that earlier regime any further than it necessarily has to go based upon the precedent that the Congress might have assumed."

First of all, the implication of drawing the kind of distinction that's been suggested here has very, very broad ramifications beyond enforcement of civil rights statutes. If you look at the cases, either implied or under 1983, in which private parties have sought to enforce against State agencies obligations under the medicare and medicaid statutes, those are regulatory obligations. The contemporary legal context in which Title VI and the other civil rights provisions of the '64 act were enacted, as this Court recognized in Cannon and, in particular, in then-Justice Rehnquist's separate opinion in Cannon, were enacted in a regime in which it was understood that legislative silence with respect to a statute that created substantive rights for the benefit of individuals would be enforced by the courts in an implied right of action, and that existed in regulatory cases. We've talked about Borak. Merrill Lynch was decided somewhat later in 1982. The --"

      "speaker": "WAXMAN",
      "speech": "Correct. What we have on our side is, I believe, a completely unbroken practice of enforcing obligations under both the Spending Clause and otherwise equally, whether they arise within the four corners of the statute, or under substantive regulations that are mandated by the statute. Now, I understand that this -- that our position puts great weight on the validity of these regulations, but that point, as the court of appeals noted, was expressly conceded by the State below, and we don't think that it's at issue here. With respect to the implication of a, an implied private right of action against a State official, which was Mr. Sutton's first point, Mr. Schnapper cited some of the cases under Title VI and its cognate statutes, but I think it's also important to recognize not only the long line of 1983 cases, many of which enforce Spending Clause statutes and their regulations in injunctive action, but also the point that Justice Kennedy made in his dissent in Golden State Transit for himself and Justice O'Connor and the Chief Justice, which is that there may be instances in which a healthy disagreement may arise as to whether a particular provision of Federal law creates a right, privilege, or immunity, but when what is being sought is injunctive relief, prospective relief only against a State official, the courts have long recognized a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause, Sections 1331 and 2201, including in Spending Clause cases which we have cited and discussed probably too briefly in footnote 12 of our brief. Cases like Blum v. Bacon and Lead-Deadwood are Spending Clause cases -- Blum was, even involved a regulation -- in which a suit was brought by a private party against the State official saying, look, the State has a policy. It's reflected in a regulation or a statute that operates in a manner that's inconsistent with Federal law and therefore it is preempted, and the background principle, the principle of law, I respectfully submit, that Mr. Sutton is advocating runs directly contrary to the particular cases we cited under Title VI and its cognate statutes and 1983, but also this more underlying, long line of cases that includes but goes well beyond Spending Clause precedents. Our position fundamentally in this case is that for 25 years, it is true, Mr. Chief Justice, there is not a holding directly on point that says, you may have a private right of action to enforce the Title VI regulations, but there -- for 25 years at least there has been a shared understanding among the three branches, reflected in a unanimous set of, body of case law from the federal courts, from successive congressional enactments. In addition to the attorney's fees amendment, the Rehabilitation Act amendments, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act, Congress has enacted 11 cognate civil rights statutes in which the funding agencies are expressly directed to promulgate regulations patterned after those under Title VI, all against a backdrop in which, at least since Lau v. Nichols and running up to the present, implied rights of action against State public agencies and other public agencies have been adjudicated, and the executive branch across administrations -- I've pulled out briefs filed on behalf of the United States by my predecessors, Robert Bork and Rex Lee, explaining to the Court that the implied private right of action to enforce these cases, and I believe that the former one was in Alexander, which was a case against a State, are important for the -- an important complement to Federal enforcement officials. Our brief in Darrone said, quote, the award of individual relief to a private litigant who has prosecuted her own suit is not only sensible but is fully consistent with and, in some cases, even necessary to the orderly enforcement of the statute. If there are no further questions, we'll submit."

      "speech": "A few brief points, Your Honor. In terms of the question of what vantage point the Court uses in looking at this issue, there are many cases from the eighties and nineties where the Court has not looked to the date on which the statute was enacted for determining whether it's an applied right of action. Touche-Ross, involving the 1934 Securities Act, is the very same statute that Borak involved, and it didn't look back in time. It followed what the Court was doing at that point in time. The true is -- the same is true of Transamerica, California v. Sierra Club, and Northwest Airlines. Even Cannon itself applied the Court v. Ash test which came 4 years after Title IX. Now, as for the question whether Guardians has resolved this, the last thing that Guardians resolved was the question of whether there was an applied right of action. Even if one allowed for the counting of dissents and plurality votes, you only had two justices agreeing there was an implied private right of action in Guardians, so that surely was not decided there. And the notion that pre-1983 there were settled expectations on this point can't possibly be true. Look at Justice Marshall's opinion in Guardians. Footnote 1 identifies the split in lower court authority on the very question the Court tried to resolve but didn't, so that doesn't seem possible. As far as the preemption cases that the Federal Government is relying on, I think it's footnote 11 or 12 in its brief, that's a very different issue. The question of whether a properly promulgated rule would preempt State law is one issue. It's a second issue whether a private individual can enforce it. I have no other points. Thank you, Your Honor."
