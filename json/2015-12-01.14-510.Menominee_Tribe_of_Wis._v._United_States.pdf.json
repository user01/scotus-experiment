      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: The facts in this case are very complex, but the legal question that is presented to you today is relatively straightforward to state. And the legal question is whether or not an individual or an entity that reasonably relies on class­action tolling can, if tolling is found to be ineffective at a later date, then rely on the same facts to argue that equitable tolling under Holland should apply. In the Irwin case, this Court specifically cross­referenced American Pipe as an example of a defective pleading that could satisfy equitable tolling. American Pipe obviously being a class­action tolling rule. We read that cross­reference as a suggestion that, under the right circumstances, if somebody reasonably relies on class­action tolling facts that ultimately prove to be ineffective, that that individual has the ability to ask the Court to find that equitable tolling should apply. If there is such a case, the facts of this case really should satisfy this test. The test is set forth in the Holland case. Due diligence and extraordinary circumstances are the two prongs that have to be satisfied. Both of them are well­satisfied in this case. First, the Menominee Tribe relied on a preexisting class action which dealt with almost identical substantive claims against the United States."

But if ­­ but if the Tribe exhausted while it still had time during the pendency of the Cherokee Nation class action, we wouldn't be sitting here today. Secondly, if it exhausted, because ­­ let me just be clear, that one of the problems with the class action ­­ or a fundamental problem with the class action tolling argument is the Tribe is trying to toll the wrong deadline. Class action tolling doesn't apply to the time to file administrative prerequisites to suit; it applies to the time for filing a lawsuit in Federal court. And there is a good reason for that. And that's because the policy of class action tolling is to relieve litigants of the difficult choice of whether to file an individual lawsuit or to wait and participate in the class and risk forfeiting their right to the lawsuit. But that doesn't apply to an administrative prerequisite that must be completed either way. Whether the Tribe proceeded individually or as a class, the first step and mandatory step it had to take was to present its claim. And it failed to do that within the requisite time frame."

      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. They can't get class action tolling for the time ­­ the administrative period, because that's not what American Pipe refers to. It refers to the time for filing a lawsuit. And ­­ and in any event, the ­­ the class action rule under American Pipe ­­ American Pipe made clear that it only applies to asserted class members who would have been parties to the suit had it been permitted to continue as a class action. And the Tribe fails there, too, because it was jurisdictionally barred, at the time the class decision was pending, from participating in the suit. So even if Cherokee Nation had been certified during the pendency of the class certification determination, the Tribe was barred. But importantly, the Cherokee Nation class was not granted. It was denied. And it was denied, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, two years before the CDA deadline would expire for the first claim. And the Tribe waited more than four years after class denial to present its claim. There was no basis for waiting. At that point, the Tribe knew it must pursue an individual action, and the only reason it waited was to hope that this Court would more conclusively reject, and did eventually conclusively reject, the government's affirmative defense that it was asserting in that case. But the ­­ the idea that a ­­ a Tribe, or ­­ or any litigant, who could have acted earlier chooses to delay for strategic reasons, and then could get tolling when it finds out that it miscalculated the deadline, would be unprecedented. And in fact, the fact that equitable tolling is foreclosed follows directly from this Court's cases. It simply is a common litigation problem that this Court has addressed time and again, where a litigant believes the deadline is longer than it is, believes their claim occurred later than it did, believes that tolling applies, and in fact, it didn't. That was the case in Lawrence; that was the case in Pace; that was the case in Irwin. And in each of those cases, the Court found equitable tolling did not apply."

But that said, what the Tribe's argument, that it was the subsequent deadlines that would have led it to delay, is really an astounding proposition, which is that their basis for tolling is the existence of the statutes of limitation. And that really can't be the case, that the fact that once they filed their claim, it may then follow; that additional limitations periods may kick in; that that could warrant delay in and of itself. But even putting that aside, there were other options that the Tribe could have pursued. For example, having presented its claim, and if it did so prior to ­­ it said it hoped to be a part of the Cherokee Nation class action, if it did so prior to the Cherokee Nation class action, and the Cherokee Nation class action was in fact certified, then ­­ then it may have an argument it's part of that class.

      "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. I'll start with a few comments on the last point that counsel made. The stamp­and­an­envelope quote is more than hyperbole; it's just flat wrong. There's costs incurred by the Tribe to calculate the amount of claims. There's costs in pulling together the letter that then goes into the envelope that is the claim itself. But more than that ­­ and your question alluded to this, Justice Ginsburg ­­ the ­­ once ­­ once the claim is filed, and the government, undoubtedly, as it did during this period of time with all of the claims that were filed, they would have denied the claim. That triggers another statute of limitations, either 90 days to appeal in the civilian board of contract appeals, or one year to appeal in Federal district court. And that deadline had been found by courts to be jurisdictional. So in fact, what we're talking about here is a conundrum, because the six­year statute of limitations under the Contract Disputes Act had not been found to be jurisdictional. It was later on found to be jurisdictional as a result of the presentment requirement, but the statute of limitations that would have been triggered would, in fact, have been jurisdictional, and the Tribe would have had no option but to litigate. And if we place these facts on top of what happened in Cherokee Nation, it perfectly illustrates the conundrum. 707 days it took for the certification process in that case. If the Tribe had filed at the beginning of that process and received a rejection of its claim during the first 100, 150 days ­­ let's give the government, you know, ample time to respond ­­ then it would have triggered a statute of limitations that was jurisdictional that the Tribe would have had to have acted on, in order to make sure that its claim was, in fact, going to still be alive. And that would have happened before the end of the 707 days. So it's more than a stamp in an envelope. It really is a jurisdictional conundrum that the Tribe was aware of and concerned about, that partially factored into the Tribe's decision not to file a claim."
