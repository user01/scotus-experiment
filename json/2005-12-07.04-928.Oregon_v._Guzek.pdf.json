And -- but coming back to what the court's holding focuses on is how that alibi evidence can be used in the remanded proceeding. And not only does it come in, and the primary statute on -- that they dealt with for the grandfather's testimony is really a statute that deals with admissibility of evidence -- prevents the parties from having to go through making foundations and other showings in order to get evidence admitted. But, under the Oregon Supreme Court holding, defense counsel can argue, based on that evidence, that the jury should consider the possibility that defendant is innocent, as a mitigating factor in determining the sentence."

And I believe that under Oregon law -- and I'm not certain -- that, an ordinary case, a death-eligible person does have the right to argue in the sentencing proceeding.

The Oregon Supreme Court squarely confronted, and resolved, the Federal constitutional question, and it is ripe for this Court's review. It is true, as Justice O'Connor suggested at the outset, that the Oregon Supreme Court appears to have been laboring under a factual misimpression -- namely, that Respondent's mother did not testify at the initial trial. That having been said, it appears to be clear that Respondent was seeking -- and is still seeking, even before this Court -- to introduce the live testimony of his mother."

Were that not true, the failure to admit the evidence would, in some sense, be harmless, since it is true, certainly to some extent, that the mere presentation of the evidence might lead to the jury taking it into account even absent an argument or instruction to that effect.

That may be a good thing or a bad thing, but that's what our statute says, and they may consider it. But when the question comes, What new evidence may be admitted at the sentencing hearing -- the sentencing phase only, then we're going to restrict that only to evidence which, in our view, is required by the eighth amendment.\" So, if that is, then -- we don't -- I don't know whether the Oregon Supreme Court took that view, or not. But if it did take that view, and, in this case, the Respondents say, \"We no longer want to introduce any new evidence,\" then we would not have a case left, it seems to me."

And the fundamental point of the reasonable-doubt standard is that it is the highest standard of law -- of proof known to the law, short of absolute certainty. And I think, turning to this Court's case law in the mitigation area, this Court has, time and time again, limited mitigating evidence to evidence concerning the character or record of the defendant and the circumstances of the offense. And the reason for that, I think, is that the very concept of mitigating evidence really does presuppose that the defendant has committed the crime in the first place. To put it another way, mitigating evidence is evidence that suggests that a defendant who has committed the crime is somehow less deserving of the death penalty. And going back to --"

A State could certainly decide to adopt an absolute- certainty standard. But I think my point is simply that no State has expressly permitted consideration of residual doubts. Courts have construed statutes in some States to permit it, typically because those State statutes contain broad language either with regard to the definition of \"mitigating factors\" or with regard to the discretion the jury has in making the ultimate sentencing determination."

And these are factual questions related to the crime. Did the defendant act deliberately? So, in essence, what we have is -- a case which is charged as an aggravated murder does not make the defendant death-eligible at that point. The defendant is not death-eligible until he is first convicted of aggravated murder beyond a reasonable doubt, and then, in the penalty phase, he is found to have committed the act deliberately, he is found to have -- the victim should not have -- did not provoke him, and his response was unreasonable to that."

Every juror who hears sentencing matters directly after a trial automatically takes that into account. Therefore, those who are resentenced and have a new jury should have the same kind of right. Otherwise, it's cruel and unusual. Now, I made that argument. You didn't make it. But it seems to me that there are several arguments that you might make in favor of the Oregon Supreme Court's approach if, at least, you concede that it is up to Oregon to control, through its evidentiary rules, whether a matter is relevant, what form it comes in, et cetera."

And obviously I agree with you, Justice Breyer, that if the -- if a defendant must run the gamut of having -- we have to remember that the first trial was set aside because it was defective in some way. And it would be an anomalous result for the resentencing jury to not be entitled to hear what the first jury heard when the defendant had an unconstitutional, or a defective, trial. So --"

My recollection is that you stated, in your answer to Justice Stevens, that you currently maintain that you have a right to recall the mother to the stand at the -- at the sentencing proceeding. My question, which is prompted by your motion -- my question is, Is it your present intention to call the mother to the stand, or is it your present intention to use the mother's testimony, which we all Â­ - I understand to be admissible?

We think it's much -- we think it's better for a jury to be able to see a live witness than hear a cold transcript being read by surrogates. And so, of course, in -- as we know, in -- if she were to stray from what she testified at the original trial, of course she would be impeached with, \"Well, you didn't testify about that the first time.\" But the jury, we think, as the statute clearly indicates, should allow witnesses who testified originally to be recalled, unless, for some reason, they're unavailable --"

The jury is going to be instructed, \"The defendant stands convicted, has been found convicted beyond a reasonable doubt.\" It is to decide these four questions: Did he act deliberately? Does he constitute a future danger? And, to the extent the Government puts on evidence that addresses those concerns, we believe we have the right to respond to that. And also -- we also have to remember that the -- that the alibi in this case was -- really was offered as impeachment of the codefendants. The codefendants are really the only evidence that links the defendant to these crimes. And so, to the extent that -- it's impeachment by contradiction. So, while they may find that if the codefendants say, \"He did A, B, and C,\" and mom says, \"No, he was with me,\" it doesn't necessarily mean that he was with mom, only that they should disbelieve the codefendants. And that is a -- although it seems incongruous, that's standard impeachment by contradiction. The jury is given an instruction that they're to consider it for the limited purpose of whether or not to believe the codefendants, but not necessarily as substantive evidence of alibi. And that happens in trials every day. So, we don't think it's that unusual for the -- if the evidence relates to the sentencing questions the jury must consider, then it should come in. So, the other point that I think is important in this case is that the -- you know, the -- it's really not unlike this -- cases that this Court has held, Sumner versus Shuman, and Skipper. If the Government puts on evidence -- I see my time is up."

It says that after having been convicted of aggravated murder -- aggravated murder -- the sentencing jury shall be presented with the following questions. Number one, whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death of the deceased, or another, would result.

It was not offered as impeachment evidence. It was not offered under any State statute. If you look in the joint appendix, the second volume, at page 94 is the notice of intent to rely on evidence of alibi as mitigating evidence. And then there's an accompanying memo that follows. And, also, at page 88 of the joint appendix, there's a colloquy between defense counsel and the trial court, where defense counsel says, \"Your Honor, I made it very clear that alibi is being offered as mitigation. It goes to the circumstances of the crime. It's mitigating evidence that someone is not there.\" And, later, circumstances of the offense is part of the fourth question, which, in Oregon, is the mitigation question. If the --"

The crimes occurred in the early morning hours. And so, there isn't any way to parse this out and say that the alibi testimony might have been relevant, in some small piece, on deliberateness. To the extent that the State puts on additional evidence to establish deliberateness, of course defendant can respond to that additional evidence, but the State doesn't make the question of whether the defendant was there wide open again in the penalty phase."
