We do not base our claim on policy untethered to statutory text, but instead we base our claim today on section 20(d) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act codified at 25 U.S.C., section 2719(d). Unfortunately, for all concerned, that statutory text is ambiguous, as every appellate judge which has examined it has held either expressly or implicitly, and as we expect the Government to admit today if the question is put to them. One of the possible constructions of that ambiguous statute, based on its text and structure and giving effect to every word of the statute and bolstered by its legislative history, is that the tax exemption afforded States by Internal Revenue Code chapter 35, expressly referenced in section 2719(d), applies equally to tribal wagering operations."

One is the disjunctive or that connects gaming and wagering operations, and the additional support we find is in the parenthetical that precedes the reference to these two discrete concepts.

Now, we have two possible explanations of what happened. They cut out the word taxation and they changed it to the present.

Two areas. There was a committee report from the House that is set forth in our brief at page 30 that commented on that text, and it noted that related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, such as section 3402(q) and chapter 35, then it said concerning taxation. So, it appears that you could conclude that the initial phrase, concerning taxation, referenced chapter 35."

We -- we know that in the legislative history. The next thing that happened is the text was changed. Concerning taxation was deleted, and the synonym for concerning taxation contained in House of Representatives Report No. 99488 that accompanied the prior bill -- the synonym for taxation, chapter 35, was inserted in the text. And when you see that legislative history, how the synonym for concerning taxation was removed from the legislative history committee report and brought to the text, and then you see what the text consisted of, which is the parenthetical that contains five references, two -- two of which have nothing to do with the reporting and withholding."

One is that you don't presume exemptions from taxation from ambiguous language. On the contrary, we have said that there are presumptions that favor Indian tribes when there's an ambiguity. And it seems to me these presumptions are maybe a little bit in tension with each other, and which one should we rely on here, do you think? And is there anything -- in the Mescalero Apache case, which this Court decided, we did refuse to read an exemption into vague statutory language for tax purposes. How do you distinguish the principles we applied in Mescalero?"

One was a gross receipts tax on off-reservation ski resort receipts, and in that the Court went through the various statutes that were being cited for the purpose of an exemption -- the New Mexico Enabling Act, the Indian Reorganization Act -- and found no ambiguity. So, there was no need to provide application of the Indian law canon. Specifically the Court said on the face of 465 there is no reason to hold that it forbids income taxes. No ambiguity. Then there was a second part that this Court decided in part 2(b), and that's whether or not section 465 of title 25's lands tax exemption extends to a use tax. And in that course -- in that case, the Court construed the statute, actually used the word construed."

What 6050I relates to is anyone operating a business who receives $10,000 or more in cash from anyone in a business transaction or a series of transactions, and that is required to be reported. It's a regulatory measure. Now, one can certainly understand why that does and should apply to these operations like other business operations. And it's in the same family as tax reporting obligations, but there's certainly attention in the language with respect to that one as well. Now, there are several things to point about -- out about all this. One is that we don't know what happened in the committee that revised the statute, but what we do know is that the statute went in to that committee in a way that clearly would have referred to all taxation, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code covering all taxation of wagering operations, and that would have imported chapter 35 and also the State exemption. It came out in a very different form. It came out not only with the word taxation deleted, the parenthetical added, but also with the language about winnings added, and that is why it's not, in fact, possible to say that chapter 35 was just a substitution for the deletion of the word taxation because it's not all they did. They also added the limitation that it applies to winnings from gaming or wagering operations. And that's completely inconsistent with the application of chapter 35."

The other thing I would point out about the language is that when they -- when the committee reformulated this language to include the parenthetical, the kind of parenthetical it is I think is important. It's an example. It's exemplary parenthetical. We're not in the habit of ignoring parenthetical qualifications in statutes, particularly not in the Internal Revenue Code. But this is a special kind of parenthetical. It's one that says provisions of the Internal Revenue Code concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes, and then it has what is intended to be a helpful list of examples, including 1441, 3402(q), and so on. Now, I just think it's interesting to remember that if all of those examples were perfectly apt, then one could properly characterize the entire parenthetical as superfluous. So, what's interesting here is that although it's true that our interpretation will give no effect to the reference to chapter 35, what my colleague's interpretation would do is to give particular and surprising effect to one anomalous cross reference in --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But the State interest is not -- I mean, you're -- you're saying that part of the compromise might be that the States end up without taxation and the Indians get taxed. I -- I could understand that if we were concerned about sort of allowing a disparity between the States and tribes and the ultimate tax effect to them. But I would have thought that the competition between the States and the tribes would have been a competition for gamblers, for money coming in. And this taxation of the States at the other end wouldn't seem to affect that at all. If somebody is going to wager a dollar, he doesn't care whether -- whether the casino has to pay a tax on his dollar or whether -- whether it doesn't. He's just interested in the payout. And -- and so I'm -- I don't quite see why it is plausible that taxing the Indians but not taxing the States might have been part of a -- a compromise in the competition between States and Indians for -- for gambling business."

But I think it also points up that it's a mistake to get wrapped up in the details of this case and to think about section 2719(d) as a provision that was -- was directed specifically at State wagering taxes. What it was directed at, I submit, is making sure that from the point of view of the gambler, there would be no difference -- the tax point of view of the gambler, there would be no difference in going to a State lottery or a tribal lottery or a State game or a tribal game. And that's why what it says is provisions relating to the reporting and withholding of taxes on winnings, on the gambler's winnings, are to be observed by the tribe in the same way that they would be observed by the State. And the only thing that has gotten us -- and that's a perfectly clear set of rules and there's a perfectly good reason for it. The only thing that gets us mixed up in this case is the fact that there is what would appear to be a leftover or inadvertent reference to chapter 35."

Before you depart from that subject, I -- I assume that there would be a -- a motive for the States to want to have these taxes imposed on the Indian lotteries even though they are not imposed on the State lotteries. Just sheer competitive reasons. True, it doesn't affect the gambler immediately, but that lottery which does not have to pay the tax can give much better odds and gamblers tend to bet with a lottery that gives the better odds.

What do you say to that? I really think you have the burden of showing that -- that the Indians' interpretation is not only strained, but it's really so strained, it's just -- it's just an impossible interpretation. Why is it an impossible interpretation using, you know, that A, B, using the or to mean -- you know."

Second, I also agree that our answer to that is that the statute is not ambiguous, and this gets back to the canon point. The statute is not ambiguous because it cannot be fairly read to -- to impose the exemption that my colleagues want. And I would say that not only because it's not the natural reading, as you pointed out, Justice Scalia, of the statute, but also because you put several things together. First of all, I'm looking at page --"

      "speaker": "MONT",
      "speech": "But -- page 90a. The -- at the end of the -- what they want to do is to split gaming -- winnings from gaming or wagering operations. Now, first of all, the very last line of the statute refers to State gaming and wagering operations, and there it is used as a phrase. And we submit that that's powerful evidence that it's used as a phrase a few lines up. Second, in the very next breath from where it says, with respect to the winnings from gaming or wagering operations, the statute says, shall apply to Indian gaming operations. It doesn't -- doesn't say, apply to Indian gaming. It says, apply to Indian gaming operations. Again, clearly the statute is using those two together. Third, even if we were to accept that interpretation, I'm not sure where it would get the tribes here because if you accept that interpretation, then you are divorcing winnings and gaming -- or sorry -- wagering and gaming. It means they don't mean the same thing. And all the statute confers is a right to have these provisions apply to Indian gaming operations conducted pursuant to this chapter in the same manner as it applies to the States. Now, if we're going to divorce gaming from wagering operations, then having the provisions that apply to gaming by the States tells you nothing about chapter 35 because chapter 35 applies to wagering operations. So -- and -- and finally, I think, as Justice Ginsburg and some of the other colloquies pointed out earlier, the implication of that reading would be that the reporting and withholding requirements that we all agree are central to this statute somehow only apply to the Indian gaming piece and they don't apply to the wagering operations piece. And that makes no sense out of the statute."

      "speech": "I think that's right. I think in -- in effect what one has to do is ignore the parenthetical, the examples in the parenthetical, and give effect instead to the -- what we would call the operative statutory text. And as I said, if you took out the entire parenthetical, it wouldn't change anything about the -- the effect of this statute on sections 1441, 3402(q), or 6041 because those are provisions of the Internal Revenue Code concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes with respect to winnings, and so they would continue to apply even if we deleted the entire parenthetical. What wouldn't continue to apply are these two inapt examples -- or the one inapt example of chapter 35 and possibly 6050I. And in a particular situation like this, I take no joy in saying that there are some words that have no effect in the statute, but that is the position we're left with, and it is by far the better position of the two that are possible."

If you go down to the bottom of 1a, subject to subsection (b), for purposes of any exemption from, credit, or refund or payment with respect to an excise tax imposed by chapter 31, chapter 32, chapter 33, chapter 36 of the Internal Revenue Code, but not chapter 35. And so, that we think is very strong evidence both that Congress has thought through this problem carefully, and when it did, it chose not to extend the wagering tax exemption to tribes. And number two, when IGRA came along a few years later, there would have been a very easy -- there would have been two very easy and clear ways for Congress to extend the exemption that the tribes are now claiming. Number one, amend section 7871 to add chapter 35 in this list. Number two, go to chapter 35 and where the State lottery exemption is extended, say or a State -- or a tribe.

With respect to 7871 that my colleague has mentioned, that article -- that argument is impeached by 2719(d)(2) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act which says that the provisions of this subsection, which includes the statute we've been talking about today, shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of law enacted before, on, or after October 17th, 1988. So, that particular section provides the preeminence. At the end of the day, I think we know this. The language in question that we've been wrestling with here today is ambiguous. They call it cryptic. That's a synonym for ambiguous, as the dictionary tells us. Secondly, the Government's construction requires a reading out. Our construction gives effect to every word of the statute and is possible. If possible, under the test of this Court in County of Yakima, the Indian canons must be applied to resolve the ambiguity in our favor."
