And ­­ and therefore, with respect to this matter, it's our position that he has every right to maintain this litigation with respect to violation of his First Amendment right.

Furthermore, the Third Circuit makes its mistake in requiring Heffernan to actually engage in some type of political activity, campaigning. That's not necessary, as I've indicated, with respect to Elrod and the Rutan plaintiffs. Additionally, the Third Circuit's decision in this case is actually ­­ lacks common sense. I mean, if you take a hypothetical with two police officers going to pick up a sign, and when they go to pick up the sign they're at a campaign gathering, and one police officer states to his employer, yeah, I was supporting Spagnola, and Mr. Heffernan would say, no, I'm ­­ I'm not supporting it. I'm doing this to pick up a sign for my mother, should make no difference. The outcome is still the same in the sense that they're both engaged in that activity. The only difference is, is that the employer perceived Mr. Heffernan as engaging in protected activity. They went to stifle and squash his rights of association or nonassociation. Their motive was to suppress that. And clearly, that has a chilling effect on other employees. I mean, it's just very clear from the testimony in this case. And if you go to the Appendix, page 50, what is very telling about this case is the fact that when he went to pick up the sign, there was a councilman there who was a chairperson of the election. And he says to Heffernan, says, boy, you better be careful. Maybe you should come back later while we're ­­ because we're hanging up these signs. And that clearly shows the chilling effect that it would have not only in this police department or in the City of Paterson, but other employees in different jurisdictions and different areas would have the same issues. You would have to think twice before you did something. If you went to a political gathering or a campaign, or you went to hear a speaker speak and you picked up a pamphlet and put it on your desk, the ­­ if your employer saw that and they didn't like that candidate and they took action against you, you would see that that is action based on a motive to suppress one's rights."

So if you look at the ­­ the summary judgment filings, this is document No. 189 on Pacer, there ­­ there are, in ­­ in the Respondents' statement of undisputed facts, some assertions that this was in fact a neutrality policy. Now you definitely have a dispute about that coming back from the other side. Petitioner says that nobody knew about that policy. So we think that is one thing that potentially the lower courts would have to look at, decide whether it was preserved and ­­ and resolve the dispute in that sense. But I do want to get back to another concern that I think Respondents' position raises. You know, we do think that ­­ that Petitioner has his own First Amendment right here. That was violated. We do think that when an employer acts against an employee based on a mistaken perception of his beliefs, that creates exactly the same chilling effect with which the Elrod cases are concerned. So the other employees will know that the employer expects political orthodoxy and will be chilled in their ­­ in their own association as a result. And I think there's another concern here that deepens the chilling effect, and that is that the logic of Respondents' position applies not only in cases of honest mistake, it also applies in cases in which the employer acts to exploit a loophole, essentially. You can imagine a situation in which the employer knows that some people have engaged in political affiliation. The employer wants to send a message, and it does that by acting against the employee it thinks didn't actually engage in that association. And so I think that is one of the dangers of Respondents' rule here, that it will create a loophole. And so what we are saying, essentially, is that it's just a narrow corollary to the Elrod right that the Court has already recognized. When the employer acts with the exact same intent that ­­ that is already impermissible under Elrod, and it injures the employee in his employment as a result, then the employer should be equally liable. It shouldn't get a free pass simply because it ­­ it's ill­motivated and wrong. If there are no further questions."

You described this in First Amendment terms, that if this was a speech case, which it used to be, rather than an association case, he would lose. It is well settled in this Court's precedents that the threshold inquiry under Pickering is did the individual engage in the constitutionally protected activity? This actually is at issue, I should say, in the Court's other associational case, public employment association case, this sitting, where there is a significant issue of is there a different rule that applies ­­ when we're talking about a policy, Justice Kennedy ­­ that applies broadly to a lot of employees versus an individual, one­off employment action which is what is at issue here? We think that's a critically important distinction, whether you look at this as kind of a Pickering standard case, where the first thing that has to happen is that the individual has to assert at least that they engaged in the constitutionally protected activity. If you have an Elrod and Branti­type case, which is what's discussed in that part of O'Hare, it's an entirely different kettle of fish because there, you do have a general policy.
