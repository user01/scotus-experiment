    "speaker": "STANCIL",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The city chose a method for abandoning its sewer funding mechanism that left Petitioners paying 30 times more than their next-door neighbors to connect to their neighborhood sewer project simply because Petitioners had paid their tax bills in full. Mere timing of payment does not render similarly situated taxpayers into separate groups. And that is particularly true here where the taxpayers are a discretely defined group of homeowners sharing equally in a common specific benefit and State law explicitly defines them as similarly situated. The city's principal contention is that jettisoning the Barrett Law, the way they funded the initial taxation, was itself an end for this justification and itself justified the gross disparity imposed on Petitioner -- on Petitioners. That does not. The fact that an arbitrary classification may yield a desirable result does not render it any less arbitrary. The city must have a reason for drawing the distinction, but paying one's taxes in good faith does not eliminate a taxpayer's right to equal treatment. Indeed, State law here makes clear that delaying payment by choosing an installment plan does not put a taxpayer on special footing. For example, the Barrett Law declares that installment payments, quote, \"shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes.\" And installment payments are automatically secured by a lien against the property. Taxpayers who select the installment plan, which they may do for any reason or no reason whatsoever -- and, in fact, if they make no choice, they default into the installment plan. They are required, if the city asks as it did here, to sign an agreement, agreeing to pay the installments in full with interest and not to contest the validity of the underlying assessment."

So -- that's under State law. So, they've already committed to who is and who is not similarly situated. So, all you need to decide in this case -- and this is brought as an as-applied challenge by -- by these homeowners -- is: Are these people who are promised you will pay the very same as your next-door neighbor for this pipe that you're going to flush your toilet into -- are they allowed to then change their mind and say actually you're going to pay 30 times as much?"

The rest have the 10-year option. Anything from 2001 prior. So, in fact, I think I can give you specific numbers. There are seven projects that are less than -- that are half paid off or about less than -- or less than half paid off.

I think they'd have to have a reason for saying we're going to -- it would be the very definition of arbitrary to say, well, even though you're entitled to equal treatment as a matter of law, you know, and even though we're not -- it's not -- liability isn't triggered except for gross disparities, I think they would have to give us that -- that figure. And, Your Honor, if I could, I'd like to get back, Justice Ginsburg, to your question about how these other projects -- there's a suggestion by Respondents that there's a terrible line-drawing problem in how do we calculate these benefits. It's simply not the case. We have this Federal class action in the Cox case, which The city put together a damages pleading, and it -- and it produced to the dollar a calculation of every overpayment in every Barrett Law project."

The next day in my office, there show up 15 people who say: Last month, we happened to be in project 2, and we paid all our money. Why don't you give us back our money? You just gave it to the people in project 1. Give it to us. And the next day after that, there are 14 people from project 3 and from project 4.

Your Honor's hypothetical -- actually, if I could tweak it a little bit, it -- the question is not who comes in for somebody -- who comes in from a project last month. The only question is who comes in from a project 11 or more years ago, because those are the only ones that'll still be in repayment. The Cox -- if we win -- well, there's a repayment plan. That's the only thing that creates this -- this asymmetry. The only people who are going to come in and say, well, you refunded some people on my project but not me are people in repayment.

And that goes to what Justice Breyer's point was. Moving forward, every old project and every new project is going to pay more money than they did under the Barrett Law because I think, if I understand correctly, the city is raising a -- essentially not a flat fee, but a fee, assessing a flat fee across all taxpayers so that these sewer lines can be built. Am I correct about that?"

Every resident citywide who uses the municipal sewer -- new, old, or whatever -- pays an extra about $10 a month under the new system. So, what they did is they decided this program, the Barrett Law, is politically very unpopular; we would like to get rid of it. Fair enough. But they chose a way to do it.

    "speech": "No, Your Honor. What I'm saying is when they want to change tax policy, having already said these taxpayers are the same and entitled under law to equal treatment, they can't just say, well, it would be too expensive on us to treat them equally when unwinding that program. This Court in Plyler has said resources are not sufficient. And any tax case could be justified. If the -- if the city says, well, you know, we want to have -- we want to refund X dollars to our taxpayers, but we only have enough to refund to the blonde people and not to brunettes, that's arbitrary, even if they couldn't afford to do it other ways -- another way. So, they can't just pick a method that sort of where the math works out or is convenient, and just say, well, that's the way we could have done it. I would, if I could, just return to the practical ways they could have done this, And I think that highlights just how arbitrary this line was. They could have increased those monthly fees under STEP, the new program. I mean, that's how they paid for the rest of these projects. They're paying off the bonds of the old projects by charging everybody in Indianapolis $10 more a month. They could have just collected -- in our project, they could have collected for 2 more years. They could have said you'll be forgiven -- I think it's about 27 months. You will -- we're going to forgive your balances as of, you know, whatever that would be -- June of 2010, whatever it would be, 2007 -- collected that money, and then they would have had the cash to refund to the people who had paid in an equal amount that they were forgiving to the others. So, I think -- I think that's sort of -- it's a red herring to say, gosh, we had no other way, or we only had these options A, B, and C. I'd like to -- I really want just to drill down on the illustration of just how crazy I think this is. Suppose that the United States decides tomorrow to go to a national sales tax instead of the Federal income tax. It's February 29th; millions of people have paid their taxes for 2011; many, many -- most of us have not yet paid. Could the IRS come in and say: Well, if you've already filed and paid your taxes for 2011, too bad. But lucky you, if you're a late filer; you're going to get your entire tax bill forgiven. I don't think that's remotely close. I think that is arbitrary, and I'll give you a couple of reasons. One, absolutely no notice. So, the timing of payment, the method of payment that was selected, gives were somehow sacrificing their chance to equal treatment or that the city might some day wipe out 97 percent of their neighbors' tax obligations."

I think that's common ground here, which I think ultimately shows why this is a very curious equal protection theory, because if the city would have continued to collect these, you know, for 30 years, then they agree, there's no Equal Protection Clause problem at all. Now, I think as Justice Kagan was suggesting, if you now create a rule that says when they do forgive, they actually have to provide refunds and face Equal Protection Clause violations, then in the future, nobody is going to ever forgive. What they're going to do in the future is, even though they're trying to move away from this policy, even though they're trying to get out of the Barrett Law business, they're going to be stuck."

  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

In Allegheny Pittsburgh, it says you have the right to be treated equally with respect to assessments. And you weren't. Here the law says you have the right to be treated equally, or whatever it is, the apportionment, and they weren't. All that you're saying there is that State law gets to set the base. And if the State law says we don't treat people the same in extending sewer hook-ups, then that takes away your Equal Protection Clause. But it just sets the base."

There the problem was that statute was very different. It was facially neutral, and it was being applied in an unequal way. Nothing, not one word, in Allegheny Pittsburgh suggests that if the State of West Virginia wanted to change its policy and adopt proposition 13 as the law of West Virginia, that it couldn't do so.

I'm not -- I don't -- I'm not aware of any other area of the law where you can have a statute or an ordinance that draws an invalid distinction, and one remedial option is not to invalidate the statute or the ordinance. And that's the position. Their position is, you know, if you would have put something in there that said we're not going to do anything, you'd be fine.

And I think contrary to what was suggested, administrative expenses, of course, make a difference where the Equal Protection Clause is concerned because they differentiate between the two classes. And trying to avoid an administrative expense is a rational reason, normally, for making the distinction.

That's why it's equal in the beginning, even though somebody pays 400 and somebody pays 10,000 because they're going to pay the same over the period. Then you lop off the period. So, you're not treating them equally. Go -- when you started. You can no longer say don't worry about the inequality; it will sort out in 30 years.

But I also do want to make clear that you will look in vain in the Barrett Law for this stern promise that no matter what happens, we will eventually collect the same amount from everybody. What there is, is there is a requirement for equal assessment in the first instance -- nobody says that was violated -- and then, if you elect four installments, there's a provision that says you shall collect. The irony of their position is they say it's perfectly okay for the city to break that promise. It's perfectly okay to give forgiveness. They don't have a quorum -- a quarrel with forgiveness.

I'm not here to tell you otherwise, but the point is the Barrett Law, like most laws, doesn't have a clause that plans for its own demise. It doesn't say, well, you know, if -- if we get rid of this law, we either will or will not enforce the installments. And I think the question here is at a different point in time when they've made a different judgment -- we don't like the Barrett Law. It's proven unpopular. It's proven unwieldy. It's not just popularity or political. It's that, you know, they're facing lots of low-income subdivisions with septic tanks, and, you know, they're forcing the prospect of trying to get people to pay $10,000 to improve a -- the sewer on a house that's worth $50,000. They realize that's a non-starter. We've got to get out of this business."

    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "It's not just popularity. You know, every once in a while the people have a point. And it's not just that they don't like something; it's their right to not like it. And they're very much right to not like a law that says you got a $50,000 house and we're going to make you pay for a $10,000 sewer hook-up. They were right to get out of the business. Having done that, I don't understand why they're saddled with a provision of law that exists in the old law that they're trying to get away from. And just to be clear -- I mean, if you want to look at a case that I think shows you why the State law is not as equality über alles as they're presenting, take a look at an old Indiana case called Allendorf, 176 N.E. 240. That's a case where some people in the project challenged the -- the assessment, said, you know, that's unfair; it's too much. Other people paid in full. The people who challenged it went to court. They eventually settled with the city for a reduced amount. Then later on the people who had paid in full went into court and said we're entitled to pay no more than those guys. You know what the Indiana appellate court said? No dice. That doesn't work. You basically -- you either waived your right in express waiver or if you paid in full, it's -- you know, it's too late. It's too late. So, the -- and this is, with respect, I think part of the problem with the Allegheny Pittsburgh, and particularly this extension of it. You're putting so much weight on the State law, and it gets you in this business of flyspecking the Barrett Law. I mean, you know, this -- I mean, Justice Thomas made this point very well in the Nordlinger case, that there's an anomaly here, which is you're looking -­ supposed to be looking at Federal law, and the violation seems to be tied to potentially a violation of State law. If I could focus on that for a minute, because this is another really important difference between Allegheny Pittsburgh and this case, which speaks right to the remedy. In Allegheny Pittsburgh, it's a facially neutral statute. And so, it would be an anomaly there to say that when there's a facially neutral statute, you're going to invalidate the -- the statute. The statute's fine. The problem is you've been assessed at 100 percent; everybody else has been assessed at 50 percent. The Court in that unique context says, you know, there's no obligation to go and sort of mandamus the assessor, to bring everybody else up. You get to sort of go back to that level. This is very different. The challenge here, like in Nordlinger, is a challenge to a distinction drawn in a law. Resolution 101, unlike the law in Allegheny Pittsburgh, is not facially neutral. It draws a distinction. So, the relevant question is the rationality of that distinction. Is it rational? We submit there are multiple reasons why it is rational. But if you disagree with me, the obvious remedy is to strike down the statute or at least remand to the State court with express instructions that they have the option, which is exactly what happened in the sex discrimination cases. And, Justice Scalia, if you're worried about incentives and standing, look at Heckler v. Mathews, another sex discrimination case. This exact issue came up. And what the Court said is standing is based on your right to guaranteed equal treatment. Whether or not it's a pocketbook injury, you have standing if you're denied equal treatment. Now, these guys may have been denied equal treatment on the assumption they're right. But they can get equal treatment restored just as easily by Resolution 101 being invalidated in full as they can by getting an additional windfall by getting a refund. And as Justice Alito -­"

And the idea is, if you strike down the limitation, the default option is everybody gets the benefit. This is different. I mean, you know, really what Heckler is talking about is severability concerns. There's no severability that works here. Resolution 101 -- if you look at it, it doesn't say anything about refunds. It simply says we're going to forgive the balances on the outstanding accounts. If that's somehow impermissible, then the law goes. There's nothing to sever. There's nothing -­ there's not one word in the statute about refunds.
