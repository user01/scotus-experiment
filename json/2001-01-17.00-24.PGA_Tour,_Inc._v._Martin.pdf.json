    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit in our view made two critical mistakes in applying the Disabilities Act to this type of claim by a professional athlete. First it failed to recognize that Title 3 of the act, the public accommodations provision, apply only to claims by persons seeking to obtain inputs of a place of public accommodation, that is seeking to enjoy its goods or services, not to claims by persons seeking to supply inputs as employees or independent contractors. Second, the Ninth Circuit never took account of just what a top-level professional sport really is, nothing more or less than a competition that tests excellence in performing what its rules require. Any attempt to adjust the rules to compensate for an individual player's physical condition fundamentally alters the nature of that competition. Now in turning to the first issue, our position is simply this. That Title 3 of the act would not apply if Respondent were playing in tour events as an employee of the Tour, and the results should be no different just because he is playing in the events --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Farr, the language of Part 3 of the act literally could cover the player. It says, it refers to any individual, and it refers to any kind of advantage or privilege on a golf course. So you have to construe it some way, it seems to me, to avoid that language."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "That's correct, Justice O'Connor. I mean, the argument --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "To reach your conclusion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "That's correct. The argument made by Respondent is essentially that Title 3 covers any person who is present at a place of public accommodation, whatever he or she is doing there, whether they are a customer, an employee or an independent contractor. I think that's wrong for several reasons. First of all, just looking at the specific language that you point to, the notion of full and equal enjoyment of goods and services, it seems to me, is quite different from the notion of being allowed to provide the goods and services."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, Mr. Farr, you keep talking about goods and services, but the statute is not limited to goods and services, as Justice O'Connor's question indicated. It covers the enjoyment of, among other things, privileges, and I, it seems to me the straightforward argument is that the person who is making a claim here is somebody who says, like any other member of the public, I paid my $3,000 and I got my two references and I want to enjoy the privilege of competing at this, at this place of public accommodation. Why doesn't it literally fall within that quite easily?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Well, if I may separate this into two things, because the $3,000 applies only to a very small piece, which is the qualifying tournament. There is no requirement playing on the Tour itself or on the Nike Tour."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Right. But that's, that's where you start. That's where you start."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "But that's where one starts. But in terms of privilege, I'm using the term goods and services not to skip over the others, but simply as a shorthand reference to all of that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, except that it makes a difference because I think in a common sense kind of way we can say well, he is not getting any goods and services, but he is trying to exercise a privilege of playing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Well, except for, it seems to me that in fact the word privilege, if it means the privilege to work for a place of public accommodation, to provide the input of labor to a place of public accommodation, then naturally following that logic, Title 3 would apply to anybody, an employee, an independent contractor or anyone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But once again, when you phrase it the way you do, it makes it easier for your case. You say a person supplying labor at a place of public accommodation. Another way of looking at it, and I frankly would have thought in this circumstance an easier way of looking at it would be not that he's supplying labor, but that he wants to play a game and if he plays the game well enough to win a prize. That's, that doesn't fall within the sort of aura of employment that Title 1 covers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Well, I think it does, to be honest with you, Justice Souter. For example, this happens to be a game of golf. But if one thinks of the game of football, for example, professional football is a game that is played by employees. They are, they are hired I think, basically by the teams. They compete against each other."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yeah. And they get -- and each one of them gets paid by his employer win, lose or draw. In this case, maybe, maybe you'll have to help me out here. I thought whether one got paid depended on whether one won the prize."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Well, it depends on performance but in a very specific sense of course, the performance by any professional athlete determines ultimately what he or she gets paid. So if in fact one can say it is a privilege of a place of public accommodation to be able to compete in a professional sport, then it seems to me that would apply to any professional sport."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, except that the statement is too broad. The football industry, I suppose, does not say we will give anybody who wants to come in and compete for a place on our team a spot. They are not going to invite me to try out. But as I understand it, that, that is what is at stake here. Anybody who can start at the first qualifying level with his money and his references and keep on playing well enough is in a position the way the PGA is run to get to this top echelon of athletes and compete for a prize."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "I'm not sure what difference that makes, Justice Souter, because in a sense, anybody can compete to play on a professional football team. I mean, professional football teams are drawn from the public at large --"

      "speech": "Well, Mr. Farr --"
    },
    {

      "speech": "-- if they are good enough to qualify."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "We don't have to decide the football case here, but I'm wondering if you take too narrow a view of what the PGA's business it is. You think of it as just two dimensional, the PGA wants spectators, both public and on the television, and that's the service involved. But the other thing, as Justice Souter's privilege question indicated, it also offers to a subset of the public, a very talented subset from all over the world, the opportunity to win a prize. And that's also part of its business. It is offering an opportunity to win a prize."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Well, the -- the thing that I think makes it more confusing, it seems, is that normally, our position would be that the opportunity to earn something, to start with, without using the words win a prize from it, but the opportunity to earn something would not be the kind of privilege or good or service that is being offered by a place of public accommodation. Indeed, people who want to provide the inputs would be the kinds of people who wanted to provide services and earn what they would get in return. I think what makes this case seem different is because what Respondent in fact does for a living is something that other people do for recreational purposes or part of educational purposes. But again, to take an example, if the Tour constructed its operation just slightly differently, instead of saying we will have everybody just compete for the prizes as independent contractors, if they said what we will do is we will hire a group of approximately 200 professional golfers, we'll make them employees, we'll pay them a modest salary, just enough to kind of cover their expenses as they play and then whatever they win over and above that, that will be their earnings. Now, our argument would be that in that arrangement, the Tour would clearly not be subject to suits by those golfers under Title 3."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well all that -- I mean, this -- that's true, that's it's a very, it's an unusual situation here, and we could go on forever about the pros and cons and who they are really like. But people go to race courses for entertainment, but a few go to earn a living. They're touts. Some people go to casinos for fun and an occasional person goes there to earn a living. So, given the purpose of the statute, and the language of the statute, why does that make any difference?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "I think the difference between the examples you are using, Justice Breyer, and this example, is those, the people who go to the race tracks, some of whom may go to make a living, are essentially doing the same thing, receiving the same outputs, if you will, from the race track, as the people who are there simply for recreational purposes."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "But, but I think the difference, Justice Breyer, is that at the time the tournament is going on, in fact, there are no people there playing for recreational purposes. During the time of the tournament, which is the time when the PGA is operating the place of public accommodation, that's what's bringing the PGA within Title 3 with respect to the spectators, for example, is because it's operating a particular tournament at a place of public accommodation. It seems to me --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Farr, I understand you are behind the ropes, you say those are the spectators, it's a public accommodation with respect to them."

      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "That's correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But I'm, I'm sure that you must have an answer to, the public accommodations provision is not new with the American disabilities. It comes up in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where the concern is race. Now, with respect to race, could the PGA say that we don't want any African-Americans to play in our game?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Well, Title 2 does not apply, we believe, in the same circumstances as we don't think Title 3 of the ADA applies, to situations in which somebody is simply seeking to provide, seeking to obtain employment or trying to obtain work as an independent contractor, so Title 2 of the Civil Rights Act would not apply in that case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So your answer is the same for both? That neither public accommodation --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "For both those situations. Now of course, the -- the disabilities act itself and of course the Civil Rights Acts that apply to race, and sex and age have provisions that deal specifically with the question of who is working at different places and claims about discrimination, saying the terms and conditions that you have set for a particular job are discriminating against me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But you're saying they don't come under the employment provisions because they're not employees, not coming under the employment provisions, they are not covered at all?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Under the disabilities act, and not under Title 2. Whether there are other provisions like Section 1981, for example, in the case of race, might extend protection in that situation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes. But as far as the public accommodation is concerned, you are being consistent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "The public accommodations provisions in our view are intended again to deal with essentially people who are consumers, clients and customers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Farr, can I just identify your theory a little better? Are you contending that when the golf course is being used for a PGA tournament, it is not a place of public accommodation because of the limited number of people that can play on that day or are you contending that even though it's a place of public accommodation, the contestants are not individuals within the meaning of the Act?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "It is a modified version of the second, Justice Stevens. It is that they are not individuals seeking full and equal enjoyment of goods, services, privilege and accommodations, as those terms are properly interpreted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But you are assuming that the golf course, even though for a specific purpose, continues to be a place of public accommodation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "That the area generally. There is a difficulty. I mean, one of the questions that one has is, is every piece of the property a place of public accommodation or is the -- are the ropes, for example, dividing a place of public accommodation from a place that isn't? That is one way to look at it. In our view, the simpler way to look at it is the second way that you have which is to say, you have to be asking in this question, is the person an individual receiving the kind of goods, services and privileges that are covered?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I see. I think you conceivably could have taken the position that when it's rented out for a particular purpose it loses its character as a place of public accommodation because only certain people can use it. You rent a hotel, say, to have a wedding. Is it then still a place of public accommodation? But you are not questioning that it is a place of public accommodation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "But that's because, that's because they clearly are. The Tour doesn't deny. It's putting on an entertainment. It is putting on an entertainment to which spectators are allowed, so if one asks, is the golf course at this moment a place of exercise or recreation, as that's typically thought of under Title 3, our answer would be, I think the better view is no. And the Ninth Circuit actually interestingly didn't say that it was a place of exercise or recreation and noted that we made the argument it wasn't and basically said be that as it may, it is a place of entertainment, and we -- and what we are saying is yes, it is a place of entertainment and there are people present at the tournaments who in fact are enjoying goods and service and enjoying the entertainment that we are providing."

      "speech": "That's correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And that it seems to me is a public accommodation in that it's open to golfers from all over the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm not sure I agree with that. I mean, if, if -- the thing that makes the Tour have the obligations to the spectators is the fact that they are operating a place of public accommodation during the tournaments. You have to be operating a place of public accommodation before you become subject to Title 3."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I assume you could have a place of public accommodation on a cybernet or something that doesn't exist at any one place, and that's what, that's what this other dimension of this case is. They are offering to everyone the opportunity to compete in the abstraction we call a tour, a circuit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "But Justice Kennedy, the Tour isn't an abstraction. The Tour literally is, are a series of events put on by a 501(c)(6) organization, a non-stock membership organization, and they are put on for the purposes of providing entertainment to the public. That entertainment, it seems to me, is a product that they offer at a place of public accommodation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Farr, there is another important question you haven't addressed. If we assume for purposes of resolving this case that it is a place of public accommodation, then there is a second question about what kind of accommodation is required. Are you going to talk about that before your time is up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Yes, Justice O'Connor. Let me talk about that now, if I may. The -- if one assumes for a moment, and for example, the Seventh Circuit in the Olinger case just assumed that Title 3 did apply to the type of claim that the professional golfer there made. If one assumes that, then the question is whether the modification that's requested here would fundamentally alter the nature of Tour events, and I think that where the Ninth Circuit went wrong on that particular question is that it never really came to grips with what professional athletics are. The professional athletics are as I said in the beginning, simply tests of excellence. They are questions of who can perform the best a particular set of physical tasks, and those tasks are defined by the rules of the sport."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But, but the PGA has let down its requirements in a couple of cases. One golfer had been injured and he was allowed to go in a cart, was he not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Not -- never in a high-level Tour event, Your Honor. There has never been a situation in the events we are talking about, which is the events on the highest level PGA tours where they have allowed different people --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And the thing that puzzles me is how it can be a fundamental rule that applies that does not apply in the qualifying events."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Well, because the, the principal events that they put on are, of course, the events of the Tour themselves, the two highest level events. Qualifying involves simply questions of logistics to be honest. There are, there are many more people who are playing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No. If logistics are sufficient to justify use of a cart, why isn't this handicap sufficient?"
    },

      "speech": "Well, first of all, let me make --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Well, let me make one point. That when carts are allowed, they are allowed for all players, and that is essentially because there are choices that the Tour has to make at any particular time about whether or not there are enough caddies available, whether there is enough time on the golf course to get however many people there are through the event in order to produce whatever result they are looking for. With respect to the events we are talking about, the actual competitions on the PGA Tour, on the buy.com Tour, which is the second level tour, the Tour has always required that all competitors observe all the same rules, including the walking rule. There have been no exceptions to that whatsoever."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "I want to make clear two points. First of all, that when I talk about rules, I am talking about what we have called in the case substantive rules. And that is rules that are intended to and do have the potential to affect performance and the outcome of the tournament. So first of all, when I'm using the term rules, I am. Secondly, though, the question is if, if you are saying do we mean that for any rule, or any accommodation, I think the correct answer is yes, although one sort of instinctively would think that there should be some process by which people can separate the performance affecting rules that really count from the performance affecting rules that don't really count. I actually don't think there is such a process."
    },

It could say well, we don't have to under Title 3, but we are going to do it voluntarily. Whereas, if we go on your second ground, mainly that it is a fundamental part of a sport, the Tour wouldn't be able to make such an exception, would it? It would in effect be admitting that it is not a fundamental feature of the sport."

The nature of a professional sport is very different, I think, from the nature of most amateur sports. Probably not all."

I mean, amateur sports do that to some extent as well, but amateur sports by definition, and particularly high school, college, grade school sports, things like that, have as part of their very nature, part of their very reason for being, an educational or recreational side. And therefore, when one comes to apply any fundamentally altered language to the nature of that, essentially amateur sports, most amateur sports have a dual nature. They have a nature that involves sort of sorting winners from losers, but they also have a nature that says we are trying to get as many kids in the high school or whatever to play. Professional sports are not --"

      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Well, if it changes the nature then though, I think one therefore, one has to look at the regulations for some guidance. And the regulations -- I'd like to take just a minute before I reserve my time, if I may, but the regulations are something that because the United States hasn't cited them, I think maybe get lost a little bit here. But under the regulations in Title 3, there is a specific provision that says a public accommodation does not have to change its inventory to accommodate disabled people. And the reason given for that in the preamble of the regulations is that Title 3 requirements are intended to assure access to the goods and services being provided, not to alter the mix in nature of the services typically provided. Now, typically provided in this context we would say are the tournaments with uniform rules, including the walking rule, at the very highest level. That is one that has been typically provided. And the reason I think for that, and I think this goes to your question, Justice Breyer, is that in a sense, any store or commercial entity is just whatever its goods are, a bookstore. An example is a bookstore does not have to stock braille, braille books. And there isn't an inquiry every time as to how much trouble it would be to stock braille books, whether there's shelf space, whether they could get them or not. There's a categorical rule in the regulations that says that's not what we're talking about, that would be a fundamental alteration, and that's exactly the same point we are making here. If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."

From 1965 until 1997, the PGA ran a Q School to determine --"

And the purpose of that Q School is to determine, it's a test of excellence, as Petitioner said, to determine who is the best and who can go on the Tour the following year. It's a very intense course. There are 14 sessions, 252 holes played on courses just like the PGA's regular courses that they play their tournaments on. The hard card, which is described in the briefs as the rules which impact tennis tournaments, golf tournaments under the PGA, the hard card applies to those events, but the walking provision of the hard card is eliminated for purposes of the Q School, and what happens is there is a winnowing down process. In 1997, when Casey tried out, there was something like 1,200 people, golfers from the public, who wanted to play on the PGA Tour. And they came in, paid their money, had their references, and started to play, and they winnow it down to 168 players by the third stage. Every one of those 168 players is going to either go on the PGA Tour the next year or on the Nike Tour at the time, and none of those players need ever have walked a single hole, not only in the qualifying, but in their lives."

I'd like to, I'd like to sit in the dugout, because after all, the, the rule that the pitcher has to bat is not fundamental to baseball. The American League doesn't have that rule."

Because just taking our 1997 case, the PGA has not had another lawsuit by a disabled person. The USGA, which is here, has had two lawsuits, basically similar facts. Now, there has not been a huge wave of litigation and the reason is, a person like Casey Martin is very unique. He never asked for any modification of any rule affecting where he hits the ball, how big the hole is or anything else. He plays every single rule of the game. The only thing is his disability and the whole purpose of the Act is to get people like Casey Martin a chance to get to the game."

Now, when you look at the rules of golf, promulgated by the U.S. Golf Association and St. Andrews, this is the bible of golf. If you want to play golf virtually in the world, you play by these rules. What do these rules say? Rule one of the game of golf, hitting the ball from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes. That's the game. There is no rule in the rules of golf --"

Other rules are like whether you look at the baseball before you throw it or hold it to your chest, which isn't part of the game, at least not an essential part. Now, how did we find out which is which because the question was raised and I want to be clear what the answer to that is, and how do we find out? Not we, me personally.

When an organization arranges a golf tournament and invites the public to compete for the opportunity to participate, it provides golfers with services, privileges, and advantages of the golf course."

      "speech": "Miss Underwood, may I just ask a question right there? Putting the qualifying schools to one side for a moment, at the time they have entries to the golf tournament itself, the public can't just -- anybody just can't come in and say I want to play, only those people who have graduated from the qualifying school."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Well, that's rather like the fact that a university that, that offers, to which the public can apply doesn't then admit the whole public. It has a selection process, and so what only, only the admitted people can attend, but the university is a public accommodation."

If it's open to the public to compete, to attend, then that whole process is, is something that's open, to which the public is invited. On the separate point, what are the circumstances --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Why is that any different with respect to employees? Couldn't you say that awful your employees are enjoying the opportunity to work for you in the place of public accommodation in which you employ them? That seems to me perfectly parallel to saying that these professional golfers who are making money by, by putting on this entertainment are enjoying the opportunity to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "You might be able to say that. There are two -- the words would allow you to say that. There are two reasons why you wouldn't. One is that Congress made very clear that it was covering employees in Title 1 and that it didn't intend to provide redundant coverage in Title 3 so whatever one might say ab initio, that possibility is excluded."

      "speech": "Well, I'd like to take, to answer that in two steps because I take issue with the proposition that these are employee-like independent contractors. I do say that even if they were, they would be covered, but this is a much stronger case because in fact, there is no independent contracting relationship here. The golfer does not, does not undertake any obligation to perform, even in the way that an independent contractor does. He is simply --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, that's just like saying an independent contractor doesn't have to comply with his contract there. The only thing is if he doesn't, he gets fired. I mean, it's the same thing."

      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "That's correct. In fact, PGA Tour explained in the district court when they were attempting to defeat the claim that this was an employee, that it doesn't hire golfers, that it's a membership organization, a professional association that arranges playing opportunities for its members and promotes their interests. It compared itself to the ABA in that regard. It provides opportunity for them. It provides services for them."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "No, you do not. In the -- that is, the, the particular sort of entity or status of Respondent here is, as I said, a much clearer case that he is a consumer of the services or the privileges or advantages of a public accommodation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Wait. It was determined in this case, as I understood it, that he was an independent contractor; at least the district court thought so."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Well, the district court said so in the context of deciding that he wasn't an employee, as if the only two options were that he was an employee or an independent contractor. That is, in deciding that he couldn't take advantage of Title 1 for employees, the court said he is not an employee, and looked to the body of law that said people who aren't employees are independent contractors. But I don't think that resolves the question whether he maybe was something else entirely, a member or a potential member who was neither an employee nor an independent contractor as that term is commonly used in the working context. He simply wasn't a worker here at all. Petitioner argues that players can't be consumers of services because they are providers of entertainment to the spectators, but that is simply a false dichotomy. PGA offers services to these two different groups. It arranges playing opportunities for golfers and viewing opportunities for the spectators. As a result, players both consume and provide services at the same time, just like the little league players who have uniformly been treated by the lower courts as protected users of a public accommodation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I suppose any business which is a successful business in the community holds out the privilege of independent contracting as repairmen come in and so forth, they are all independent contractors, and I'm not quite sure how you distinguish that from, from the golfers here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Well the difference is, as I said, I think there is an argument that even those independent contractors could be covered, that the Disability Act meant to open economic and social life to people with disabilities and that --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Let's -- let's assume I disagree with that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Yes. I think the simple answer here is that the privilege of working for, for money in an employee-like role is simply quite different from what is happening when somebody participates in a competition. The public accommodations laws, as we said earlier, protect gamblers at a casino, or exhibitors at a craft fair, or participants in a dance contest, whether there are money prizes or not, whether the people who are engaging in those competitions. I mean, I think the -- are doing it to make their living or are doing it as an avocation. It wouldn't work to distinguish the motivations of the different users of the services of that accommodation. They wouldn't be protected if they were employees. It's perfectly true that if golf arranged itself differently, and had employees here, they wouldn't be protected under Title 3."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But the independent contractor repairman has to do it for a living, and let's, let's assume that we think that that's what these golfers are doing. What's the difference?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "The difference is that the participation in a contest is a different sort of, that is open to the public, is a different sort of thing from the cut from the arrangement by contract, by employment contract or by some other contract to provide services. And I'd like to point out, of course, that covering people like independent contractors or like contest participants, which is what we have here under Title 3 is not as has been suggested some sort of end run around the limitations of Title 1."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speech": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Well, in a theater, of course, ordinarily there are employees so this issue, they ordinarily are employees so this issue doesn't come up. I would suppose though, that if, if a, if a performer sought to rent a performance space, he would be a consumer of the, of that facility and could claim that he was being discriminated against as a consumer of that facility. That's not usually the way performers relate to performance space."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "In your opinion, does it make a difference if, if there is no easy classification, that is, if a professional golfer is somehow unique, not this, not some other thing, not an employee, not a contractor, not a client, not exactly a customer, not a this, not a that. Does it matter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
      "speech": "Well, I think that the purpose of the Disabilities Act was to, was to be inclusive. I think that's clear both from the statute and from the legislative history so that I would suggest that if there's, that doubts should be resolved here in favor of coverage. But I don't think it's unclear. I think that, that the, that the public accommodations title was meant to cover golf courses and participation in events at golf courses so long as they are open to the public. And it seems to me this is right in the heart of what the statute was meant to reach."

      "speech": "Thank you, Ms. Underwood. Mr. Farr, have you three minutes remaining."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Excuse me. Just a few brief points. Responding in reverse order to the United States' argument, first of all, they say that the reason that employers, employees are not covered by Title 3 is because that covers Title 1, but Title 1 doesn't cover all employees. It only covers employees of a covered employer. You have to have at least 15 employees to be covered and if you are not an employee of a covered employer, you are not covered either. Yet, the United States' position is that no employees are covered by Title 3, but really independent contractors or people similar to that are in the same position essentially with respect to Title 3 as noncovered employees under Title 1. Secondly, the district court specifically said that Respondent was an independent contractor, not just in talking about Title 1, but on page 53 of the joint appendix, it says, the district court says, I focus only on the issue of whether he is entitled to his requested accommodation, the use of a golf cart, as an independent contractor playing in defendant's tournaments which are held at places of public accommodation. Now -- but I should point out, I mean, while he is an independent contractor as defined by the district court, our point is not exactly it turns on whether he is an employee or an independent contractor. Our point is he is not a consumer of goods and services, and there are a number of people who are not consumers. Employees are in the group. Independent contractors are in the group. Partners in a law firm, which is a type of public accommodation, are not in the group. Insurance agents are not in the group. The issue is what they are not. They are not people obtaining, seeking to obtain or gain access to goods and services. They are all in the category of people who are providing goods and services to the public accommodation so it in turn can provide its goods and services to other people. Secondly, just to make the contrast between the people who are also playing golf and who are covered, Title 3, we concede, it covers commercial opportunities, recreational opportunities, educational opportunities. Those are all things specifically mentioned in Title 3 in terms of defining who's a public accommodation. What it doesn't cover is professional opportunities, the people who are trying to get, to make their living essentially working for the place, the operator, the public accommodation. So they are not like the tout at the race track who is there in common with the other people enjoying it for recreation. They are people actually working like somebody who is behind the betting counter at the race track who is working for the operator. Now, just quickly on the points that Respondent raises, Rule 1.1 doesn't say golf is a sport of hitting the ball from the tee to the putting hole. It says it's a game of hitting it from the tee to the putting hole in accordance with the rules. That is Rule 1.1. And the rules for this particular competition include, as there are permitted to be, optional rules, and that in turn includes the requirement that competitors walk the course. So if you, if you are saying that you cannot, that you have to make waivers in that situation for someone who can't comply, then you are changing the game."
