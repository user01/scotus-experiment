      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Congress has directed the FCC to use auctions to allocate scarce wireless spectrum in a manner that furthers the public interest. Those auctions allocate spectrum to the party who will -- who values the spectrum most highly and, by assumption, will use it most effectively to serve the public. In addition, Congress has directed the FCC to consider a number of specific factors in assessing the public interest, including promoting opportunities for small business and ensuring the rapid deployment of wireless services. Nothing in that public interest regulatory regime runs afoul of section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code. To be sure, in administering its auctions the FCC does place consequences on the regulatory signals provided by the failure to meet regulatory payment deadlines. In particular, the FCC views the failure to make a timely regulatory payment as a proxy for a determination that continued possession of the license is not in the public interest."

    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Well, I think there's a difference, though, when a regulator regulates solely for timely payment for its own sake, and in that case it implicates only the policies that are addressed by the Bankruptcy Code, and I think it's a different situation when the regulator looks at the failure to make timely payment as a proxy for something else."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, but Mr. Clement, in your petition for certiorari, the question presented speaks of an obtained option automatically canceled. That suggests that it is indeed automatic."

      "speech": "Well, it's automatic in the sense --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I mean, automatic means without any discretion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "With respect, Justice, Chief Justice Rehnquist, when it says automatic, what it means is that it cancels without any, the need for any further action from the commission, but in any given case, the cancellation of a license is a result both of the automatic cancellation rule and the fact that a payment deadline has come forward, and where the commission has discretion is in relaxing the payment deadline, and you can see that in this very case. NextWave's license is canceled, according to the FCC, because NextWave failed to make the very first installment payment due under those licenses. Now, according to the licenses in the first instance, that payment was due on April 30, 1997, but the licenses didn't cancel on April 30, 1997 because the commission in its discretion, as part of a multifactor public interest determination, extended the payment deadline a full 18 months."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, Mr. Clement, it appears to me that the FCC went along with the bankruptcy filing, filed a claim for the amount that wasn't paid, and apparently went along with the proposals for a while to work this out and then, very shortly before the decision to reauction the things, the FCC decided not to go along with it. That doesn't sound like some automatic cancellation. I mean, the FCC appeared to treat it very much like the bankruptcy claim for quite some time, didn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Well, to be sure, the FCC participated in the bankruptcy proceedings and protected its interests as a creditor, but at the same time it has independent interests as a regulator, and the FCC, as we point out on page 19 of the reply brief, made clear at various points well before NextWave went into bankruptcy that it did not view bankruptcy as an exception from the regulatory provisions of the Communications Act, and I think if you look at the specific event that NextWave points to as the automatic cancellation, it's the failure to make a payment that was due on October 29, 1998, and it was due on the 29th of October, 1998, rather than April 30, 1997, precisely because of a public interest determination by the commission."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "You say a public interest determination, but the only correlation that seems clear to me is a purely economic correlation. When the value of the leases dropped, the FCC apparently went into the Bankruptcy Court and said, we want our full $4 billion, and when the value of the leases went up, the FCC took the position, we want to reauction them and get the increase in value. It seems at each point at which the FCC made a decision, it was making an economic decision, not a regulatory decision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think that's correct. When -- I mean, it is true that the FCC tried to go in and protect its interests as a creditor, but at the point that NextWave was trying to keep its regulatory licenses that it promised to pay $4.7 billion for, and trying to keep those licenses for just over a billion, the result of that process would have been that the rest of that amount, the $3 billion plus, would have been an unsecured claim of the FCC, that would have been really worth virtually nothing, so I think the better way to understand this case is that the FCC does have interests as a creditor, and it has tried to protect those interests in the bankruptcy proceedings and has participated in those proceedings, but at the same time, it has interests with the -- as a regulator, and in its capacity as a regulator it hasn't acted in a way that would result in a sole-cause cancellation."

      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "But again, but if a State had a regulatory purpose in ensuring that its drivers were financially responsible, and presumptively said that a license would fail to cancel for the failure to pay $500 in traffic tickets, but provided a mechanism for the driver to go in before the regulatory commission and say, look, I know I haven't paid $500 worth of traffic tickets, but I'm actually financially responsible. I have a ton of money in the bank, and so you ought to give me a relaxation of the rules or a waiver --"
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So you're just making up a regulatory purpose, as a regulator. I mean, as a regulator, as a creditor you can always say it's being done as a regulator, always."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "I really don't think that's true, with respect. I think the kind of waiver proceeding or opportunity to relax the rules would be out of place in a regulatory regime that was only concerned with timely payment. It's precisely because the FCC uses the timely payment, or the failure to make timely payment, as a proxy for a public interest determination that it has this waiver proceeding, and it gives the regulating entity --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "That's something that I don't fully grasp in your argument. First you say, this is fully automatic, this cancellation of the license. You don't pay up, license gone. But then you say, but we can extend the time if we want to. We can use our discretion. Well, the automatic argument seems at war with the discretion argument."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Well, I mean, there is some tension there, and the FCC has been at pains to try to make sure that it doesn't bend over one way too far or the other. In its restructuring order that I think is critical in this case. It froze the payments -- it suspended the payments ultimately for 18 months, and then it also provided some restructuring options that required further modifications of its rules."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",

It's not -- if you're a regulated entity and you don't want your license to cancel, you don't go to the commission and say, don't apply the automatic cancellation. What you do is, you go to the commission and you say, I've a regulatory payment. It's going to be due April 30. I'm not in a good position to make that payment, so what I'd like you to do is relax the payment deadline, and --"

      "speech": "Well, the reason we don't settle the case today, although obviously there were efforts to try to settle this, which would require congressional legislation, which we were unable to get in a timely fashion, but the reason that they are not in a position to cure their defaults, if you will, is because our view is that they have -- the opportunity to cure has passed. The licenses have actually already --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But is the option to cure -- if you wanted to settle, would you be disabled from settling, or could you settle, decide, well, we think it would be wise regulation now to accept the payment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "I think it would be within the agency's discretion to settle the litigation at this point. Now, of course, if we did that, I'm sure, as in the last time the commission tried to relax its rules, I'm sure we'd draw a D.C. Circuit challenge to that exercise of discretion to relax the rules. But the very fact that there is that reservoir of discretion to relax the rules demonstrates that the ultimate cancellation is not a sole-cause cancellation."

      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "No. We think the right-to-cure argument is best addressed on remand. I do think there are two reasons why the right to cure is not any longer available to NextWave. One is that the licenses automatically canceled on their own terms. The second reason is that the license restriction, the licenses themselves had a restriction on transfer or alienation, and there's law under 11 U.S.C. 365 that deals with executory obligations that says that the debtor in possession cannot take possession of a license, assume the obligations of a license if there are restrictions on its alienation or transfer."

      "speech": "Well, there have been situations like that, not necessarily in the C-Block license situation, but there was a situation with respect to a different program where a license canceled by its own terms by a failure to renew, and the commission renewed that license largely on the basis of the fact that that licensee was already providing service, and so the result of revoking the license would be to deny people service that was currently being provided. Now, in the reconsideration order that's the subject --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, a reconsideration order is different, but a new issuance it seems to me is quite questionable so far as the discretion of the agency, and I think I agree with some of my colleagues, I'm not sure that's before us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Well, I think that particular instance is particularly relevant, because NextWave relied on that in its reconsideration proceedings before the commission. And the commission, in rejecting that, I think demonstrated why this isn't a case of sole-cause cancellation. If you look at the commission's reasoning on page 82a of the petition appendix, the commission says, quote, \"NextWave is providing no service. The spectrum licensed to NextWave has gone unused since early 1997, and represents licenses in 90 markets across the United States.\""

      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Absolutely, it does, and what the commission decided in this order, which is under review in this case, is that it was not going to relax or provide an exception to the automatic cancellation rule, but the reason it decided that is because NextWave wasn't providing service, and that others stood ready to provide service under that spectrum, and what I would respectfully suggest is that under those circumstances the cancellation is not a sole-cause cancellation. It also reflects the fact that NextWave wasn't providing service, that others stood ready to do it, and that's enough to take it out of 525, which is, after all, a very narrowly written provision. It only protects against sole cancellation. It allows the failure to pay a dischargeable debt to be a contributing factor in a regulatory decision, indeed, the primary factor in the regulatory decision, just not the sole cause."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "May I ask just one question about your interpretation of the automatic cancellation? Is it the commission's view that they could -- there would be a cancellation, they could reauction the licenses, and that the original licensee would still remain liable for the entire debt?"

Congress intended to replace the cumbersome comparative hearings and unjust lotteries of the past with a new, more streamlined mechanism under which an entitlement to use our airwaves, everybody's airwaves, is allocated to the person that, or the company that values it the most, and the way we know that is that they must make good on the promises embodied in their auction bid."

What the FCC has done instead, and what it's done here this morning, is to instead suggest that section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code ought not apply because the FCC had a regulatory or public interest purpose for making a nonpayment an automatic sole trigger for revocation of a license, but in passing the Bankruptcy Code, Congress already weighed the public interests, and section 525 of the code is a clear expression of Congress's judgment about where the public interest lies."

The face of the license says that the licenses cancel automatically upon nonpayment and for no other reason.

Now, that is a matter entirely within the control of the FCC. All they have to do is make clear in their regulations when the obligation attaches. The reason that there was a problem here was that the regulations suggested that the obligation attached later and, therefore, if the value of the asset declined from the time of the initial auction to the time of the license award, section 544 would apply. But the FCC has changed its regulations, and at this point it is unambiguous that the obligation attaches at the time of the auction -- and therefore 544 can't operate."

As I read the statute, it seems to me, for at least your argument's sake, it is solely because, and moreover, of course this statute governs the FCC, but in reading the statute, I don't see how this statute was at all intended to govern the instance in which the Government is acting as creditor in respect to receiving payment for a good that it has sold. Now, I base that on first reading the purposes of this in the history, and reading the whole legislative history, which will not convince some of my colleagues, but nonetheless is a factor in what I think, and I think that this is clearly about a future loan, a future situation in which the future situation, the Government is forbidden to discriminate against a human being because he was once in bankruptcy. This seems to be to balance, to bring back into balance the Government vis-a-vis the private creditor. If you're right in your interpretation, and I am wrong, I see no way whatsoever in which the Government would have the right to take a secured interest or in any other way collect a debt which a human being owes it for buying a license. Now, that's my question. I want to get your response."

      "speaker": "VERRILLI",

It applies to someone who is or was a debtor, and it applies to debts that are dischargeable, as well as those that have been discharged and, therefore, it is clear on the face of the statute that it applies and protects companies while they are reorganizing and before the debts are discharged, so I think on the face of the statute that's -- it's not correct. It's not the right reading of the statute. And in terms of what it does in operation, it's this. Now, if -- if this had been a situation where the FCC had demanded cash on the barrelhead up front, and NextWave had gone and bid and gone out and borrowed that money from a bank, and had to pay the bank over time, and then filed for bankruptcy, there would be no question that that, that the debt to the bank could be reorganized and disposed of in the normal manner in bankruptcy."

If I could, I'd like to get back to the question of whether this was, in fact, an automatic revocation, and the reconsideration order, which is the order under review here, is the order in which the FCC says principally that it departed from the automatic character of the revocation, but that reconsideration order says no fewer than 14 times by my count that the revocation was automatic, and there's one statement in that in particular which I think should put to rest as a factual matter the question of whether this was anything other than an automatic cancellation, and that's at page 74a of the appendix to the petition, and it's right at the bottom of the page, before the footnote. And the FCC says in the reconsideration order, thus, the only way that NextWave could have avoided the loss of its licenses, even under the rule interpretation it urges, was to avoid a default by making full and timely payment on or before the payment due date. If the only way that NextWave could have avoided default was by making the payment, then there is nothing else that could have been shown, and nothing else that could have happened in the reconsideration process or any waiver process, that would have provided an additional ground for revocation. And if I could also point the court to a statement on the prior page, page 73a: For all these reasons we reject NextWave's interpretation of our default and cancellation rules and reaffirm that the failure to make full payment in a timely manner, following exhaustion of all applicable grace periods, constitutes a default and results in the automatic cancellation of the license without further commission action. Their theory is that this happens by operation of law on the day after nonpayment. It is as automatic as anything can be, and nothing about the reconsideration process, and nothing about their waiver authority changes that one iota."

    {
      "speaker": "VERRILLI",
      "speech": "Well, but they said in the reconsideration order that they were not going to do that, ever, because it was an automatic cancellation. They also said in the restructuring orders, Justice Ginsburg, that you referred to earlier, in each of the restructuring orders they said they would not grant a waiver of the payment deadline under any circumstances, and then when individual licensees sought waivers, the FCC rejected the waiver requests, and it cited back to those provisions in the restructuring order saying, we told you this was an automatic rule, and we reject your request, and it did so even in instances, in two cases where the licensees were providing service. And so there's just no question that this was an automatic cancellation rule and therefore precisely at the core of what section 525 forbids the FCC or any other licensing agencies from doing. If I may, I want to turn to the question of whether there is any conflict between the FCC's exercise of its authority under section 309(j) and the Bankruptcy Code. The answer is, as a statutory matter there is no conflict, because the FCC was not required to have an installment payment plan, and even if it were required to have one there wouldn't be a conflict because Congress didn't say that the FCC had to make license revocation automatic upon nonpayment. So the FCC's argument really is an implied repeal argument here, that 309(j) implicitly repeals 525 in some applications, but --"

      "speech": "Yes, and the authority is exactly contrary to the position that the FCC deserves deference. The FCC deserves deference only with respect to interpretation of its own statute, not with respect to the Bankruptcy Code. So the answer is clearly that they don't get any deference, and -- but there isn't any conflict. All there is is the FCC -- there isn't any statutory conflict. All there is, the only conflict arises from the FCC's desire to make this an automatic cancellation rule, and the conflict is between an FCC policy choice and a directive from Congress. When the conflict is at that level, there's no doubt about what the answer is, which is that the directive from Congress prevails."

But if we hadn't been in compliance with them and the FCC had moved to revoke the licenses because we weren't in compliance with the build-out rule, and we had said, well, the reason we are not in compliance with the build-out rule is that we're in bankruptcy and we can't pay the vendors to build it out, that would be a situation in which the FCC could enforce its rule, even though at some level it is because we were in bankruptcy. It's just not \"solely\" because. It's because we violated a neutral rule that was not focused solely on nonpayment. And I think there would be other circumstances in which the fact of nonpayment could be a consideration in a broader or a different -- in a broader or different set of circumstances. But when you have what you have here, is where it is the only consideration, the only factor, the determinative consideration, that is the paradigm case of violation of 525.

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Clearly, we're dealing in 525 with something that is an exercise of regulatory power, and as several members of the Court have noted, it's always possible to say, even though we are revoking or canceling this license automatically because you didn't make the payment, we have other motives in mind, responsible, financially responsible drivers on the road. We are not simply out to get you because of the dollars. That's, of course, not what this statute is about. The whole point of the Perez decision was to get rid of Kesler and Reitz, which required peering into the mind of the bureaucrats, not always a wonderful vision to behold, and not clear. This is a causation provision, and let me turn to Justice Ginsburg's question from the perspective of creditors who need to be able to rely on a bright line test of whether something was done solely because of nonpayment of a dischargeable debt, or solely because of insolvency, or solely because of an invocation of Chapter 11. The word solely, I think, does serve a function there, and that is, in its absence I suppose it would be possible for a licensee in regulatory default, a licensee who hadn't built out, to hide behind the existence of a fiscal default and say, you see, it's because of the fact that I didn't make a payment, not because I didn't build out. Then one has a complicated mess, and from the point of view of creditors who need to know whether an agency is going to pull out the lifeline without which this entire edifice collapses and is just a bunch of hardware, not worth anything more than the separate parts, from the point of view of creditors who need to know, it seems to me a very clear test is needed, and that is, was this the sole trigger? Have they come up with some other substantive, independent basis which either was the necessary cause or a sufficient cause? That's what the D.C. Circuit said, and it makes sense."

There are provisions in 1111(b) for dealing with both situations.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRIBE",
      "speech": "What I'm saying, Justice Breyer, is that after bankruptcy, if NextWave, for example, were to emerge from bankruptcy they would still have the license, but only on conditions in which you as the FCC, like other creditors, in light of your secured interest, had taken an appropriate piece of the pie. You don't get it all, that's the point. Nor does a private creditor get to grab the license and all the value from all the other creditors and, in fact, when you are an agency that is wearing really two sets of shoes, the ordinary regulator's running shoes but also the wing tips of the creditor agency, it makes the situation worse, not better. That is, this law is designed to assure that even the agency, which does not have a monetary interest, can't simply yank all the value for itself because it has the power over this license. If the agency, on top of all that, is a creditor and has that additional set of incentives, then it's all the worse. You wonder, for example, why it is that in the MMDS licenses, in which there are licenses that are held by a number of bankrupt licensees who did not make the payments they promised to make, why it is that the FCC does not regard them as not having been what they looked like at the time of the bid. The reason is that it's been paid in full. So it really is a situation in which the FCC's position as a creditor should not redound to its credit. If anything, that makes this statute all the more vital. The capital formation that is necessary to make 309(j) work, to make it possible, Justice Scalia, sometimes not to demand all the money up front, but to have something more creative, maybe demand letters of credit, guarantees, none of that can work if creditors who put in over half a billion dollars, not in a gamble but on a very careful business plan that was completely carried out, they're not providing service, but Catch-22, it's because their attempt to emerge and fully cure any default was frustrated by the agency that saw pie in the sky, large numbers. In that situation, for the agency to be able to collapse the capital formation here tells us something rather unpleasant about the future. How likely is it that Citicorp and the California and Kansas pension funds and all of the other organizations that have put money in on reliance on the way section 525 works will do this again next time around? The formation of capital, the market on which the FCC chose to rely, choosing to rely in the capacity of a first lender, with no more or less secured protection than others, that whole system depends on, in the most literal sense, the rule of law. It does not depend on the question whether we can attribute to the regulator some motive that does not relate solely to the money. So if the system is to work the way the FCC claims, 525 is a dead letter. Now, if you were right, Justice Breyer, if there really was a problem that couldn't be solved in the way the confirmation rules work, in the way the pie is divided up, then maybe, as with perishable commodities, there would be a problem for Congress to solve. Congress has in section 523 enumerated 18 categories of debts that are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, and sometimes it does it in another statute, not always in the Bankruptcy Code. These are policy judgments about whether something is unique about the situation that requires treating the Government in some different way, the way the Department of Agriculture is treated."

Let me first address Justice O'Connor's very proper concern that licensees are going to be able to enjoy their licenses for much less than they agreed to pay the commission. That is not a dead letter and, in fact, one of the cases that is being held for this case involves Kansas PCS, where the bankruptcy court approved the plan that gave the FCC 5 cents on the dollar for the value of its licenses. Now, it's true that one mechanism to get the licenses for less than they paid for, the fraudulent conveyance theory, is something that the FCC can address. That was the GWI bankruptcy, where the FCC only got 16 cents on the dollar. But there's a second way to do it, which is to only give the FCC the value for its security interest, the value of the licenses at that point, and the bankruptcy court did that in Kansas PCS, and only gave the commission 5 cents on the dollar. Second, let me address Justice Kennedy's concern with, where's the authority for the FCC to take into account bankruptcy policy concerns? The authority comes from a D.C. Circuit decision called LaRose, which is cited on page 79a of the decision, the reconsideration decision that's under review. The LaRose decision is a D.C.

But if you think the problem here is that the FCC didn't do the right balancing of bankruptcy policy and telecommunications policy, then the D.C. Circuit or this case could reverse for an arbitrary capriciousness, but that's not the role of 525. 525 is an exceedingly narrow provision that simply prevents a regulator under any circumstances from canceling a license solely because, and here it's just not true that the failure to make a payment was the sole trigger, because you have to look at it in context, and what triggered default is the failure to make a payment of a payment that was due for a particular reason. Now, anybody in -- any FCC licensee could have gone to the commission and tried to get a further extension of that payment deadline. They'd already gotten extended 18 months. They could have gotten extended even further, and it's hard for me to understand how there's a sole trigger when the very payment deadline that is supposed to be -- trigger the automatic cancellation is itself the reflection of a multifactor public interest determination by the commission. They extended it 18 months but no further, based on a consideration of the public interest. Now, on Justice Breyer's concern about what's going on here, I think your concern is exactly right, and what sense does it make from a bankruptcy policy to disable the Government to make installment payments?"
