      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act validly abrogates the States' sovereign immunities as applied to the class of cases involving the unconstitutional treatment of disabled inmates. That result follows from this Court's decisions in Nevada against Hibbs, and Tennessee against Lane. In Lane, this Court held that it was clear, beyond peradventure, that Congress had an adequate basis to enact prophylactic legislation to ensure that individuals with disabilities had access to public services. In reaching that conclusion, this Court surveyed a broad array of evidence, not just limited to the court-access context, and, indeed, surveyed evidence involving prisons, in particular. As a result, the sole remaining question, and the only question in Lane on which this Court applied an as- applied analysis, is the question of whether or not Title II's remedies are congruent and proportional as applied to the particular context; here, the context of the discriminatory, inhumane, or otherwise unconstitutional treatment of inmates with disabilities. Now, if one applies the congruence and proportionality analysis of Lane, in particular, in the prison context, it easily passes constitutional muster. For all of the factors that this Court emphasized as making Title II appropriate in the court-access context -- the absence of absolute mandates, the inherent flexibility of the reasonable modification standard, the fact that benefits are limited to otherwise eligible individuals, the defenses for fundamental alterations or undue burdens -- all of those factors apply with full force in this context."

And, of course, just last term, this Court, in Johnson against California and Wilkins -- and in the Wilkinson case, Cutter against Wilkinson, applied deference to prison officials even in the context of strict scrutiny.

And I think the fact that here's a case where the Constitution requires affirmative accommodation also helps narrow the prophylactic gap."

But I do think if we want to focus on the damage --"

      "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Well, I think punitive damages would be a harder case, in terms of proportional incongruence. But this Court has, even in the absence of congressional action, found damages to be an appropriate remedy for unconstitutional or unlawful State conduct. Take the Bivens cases, for example, or the Franklin case, in Title IX, and, I think, if damages are appropriate where Congress hasn't acted, I think where Congress has provided for damages, damages are clearly an appropriate remedy. But, with respect to damages, in particular, I think it's important to note that the prophylactic gap here is not large, because, in the Title IX context, in the Gebser case, this Court has already said that, in order for there to be compensatory damages, there needs to be a showing of deliberate indifference. And now, there may be some difference between what \"deliberate indifference\" means under Gebser and what \"deliberate indifference\" means under Farmer against Brennan, but, whatever that small gap is, that certainly seems manageable."

But one thing I think it's important to emphasize is that, although at the current time period all 50 States take Federal funds for their prisons, so that all 50 States are subject to the Rehabilitation Act, that wasn't true at the time that the ADA was passed. And I think what that illustrates is both that Title II plays an important gap-filling role and also that, for whatever reason, I think, this is an area -- prisons taking Federal funds -- where the degree to which they take Federal funds may wax and wane over time. And so, I don't think this is a situation where Title II is purely duplicative of the Rehabilitation Act, but the difference is really in terms of the scope of the coverage, not in terms of the substantive obligations under the --"

Under the -- under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, if you're bringing a constitutional claim under Section 1983, you have to exhaust your prison remedies before you can do that. And that is not the case here, is that right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "No, I don't think that is right, Justice Scalia. I think that we would -- we would say that the PLRA fully applies to claims under Title II and there is an exhaustion remedy. There is also, of course, an exhaustion remedy inherent in Title II, because, in order to get a reasonable modification, you have to ask for the modification in the first place. We also think that the PLRA applies, in all its provisions, to Title II claims. And one important provision to keep in mind is 1997e(e) -- 42 U.S.C. 1997 e(e) -- which is a limitations on the damages that are available. And, under that provision, in order to get damages for emotional or mental injury, you have to also show some sort of physical injury. And the lower courts have interpreted that to require at least the kind of more than de minimis injury you need under the Eighth Amendment. And I think the PLRA, together with Title II, in the particular area of damages, which is what Justice Kennedy has pointed out is the particular area of concern under the Eleventh Amendment, is even a further narrowing of the relief that's available and a further narrowing of the prophylaxis under the Title II. So, I do think the PLRA is actually something that actually helps make sure that the remedy here is congruent and proportional. May I ask you to comment on this? This problem of -- just troubles me a little bit. If we hold this provision unconstitutional because it is not congruent and proportional and so forth, does it not follow that the Title II is entirely unconstitutional, it cannot even be enforced by injunctive relief?"

I think, you know, one of the significant aspects of the Rehabilitation Act is -- and I think the amicus brief filed on behalf of Mr. Goodman by the former President George H. W. Bush really emphasizes this -- the ADA was passed based on a firm conclusion by Congress that the Rehabilitation Act had failed, that it hadn't worked. And I think the record of constitutional violations here shows that, that we have such an extensive record of judicially confirmed, judicially established findings of constitutional violations in the prison context, and we have constitutional rights that impose on States the same kinds of requirements, not in all particulars, but in very similar ways, as the ADA does, itself.

Here, Congress would -- had, staring in front of it -- right? -- a record of constitutional violations that showed -- right? -- proven constitutional violations showed that the 1983 remedy, which doesn't authorize damages against the State, wasn't working. We need to have some additional remedy. We need some additional deterrents and spur to compliance on the part of States. But I think it's also important to note how limited the damages remedy in this context is. It's not just the absence of punitive damages. It's not just -- you know, we also have the provision of the PLRA that says no damages for mental and emotional injury in the absence of physical injury, which means that, in the kinds of cases that are peripheral to core constitutional rights, we're not going to have damages anyway. It also -- we also have the exhaustion requirement of the PLRA, which imposes on plaintiff the requirement that they go to the prison and tell them, \"Here's the problem,\" which means that if we have a case that satisfies the PLRA, we're very likely to have deliberate indifference, a problem that prison officials have refused to resolve --"

    {
      "speaker": "BAGENSTOS",
      "speech": "Well, I think that, of course, the prison can reduce its damages liability, and, of course, where we have a continuing violation after exhaustion, which is what -- when people file these lawsuits, when they have continuing problems, like Mr. Goodman alleges were continuing problems in his case -- we will have cases where we have very much -- very likely to have deliberate indifference. And so, I think that's an important thing, too. I think the other important point about Turner v. Safley that the Solicitor General spoke about -- right? -- many of the constitutional rights in the prison setting that are significant here don't implicate Turner v. Safley. Eighth Amendment cruel- and-unusual-punishment claims don't implicate Turner v. Safley, as this Court said in the Johnson case. And we have a very substantial record of Eighth Amendment violations. Of course, the Eighth Amendment requires accommodation of serious medical needs, as this Court has said ever since Estelle v. Gamble, and \"serious medical means -- needs\" is a term that's very close to the way this Court has narrowly read the disability definition in the ADA. And so, I think another very significant aspect of the congruence and proportionality here is how close the ADA's disability definition is to the class of people who implicate constitutional rights, affirmative constitutional rights of accommodation, under the Eighth Amendment itself. And so, I think that's another very significant aspect of the tightness of the fit here. But, here, I think the most salient fact is, if you ever had a record justifying prophylaxis nationwide, the record here, that touches on 37 different States, that includes, in many cases, statewide findings of constitutional violations, is it, it's a record that justifies, certainly, some prophylactic legislation; at least -- at the very least, the minimal prophylaxis that we have in the ADA in the prison setting. It's a kind of -- it's a kind of prophylaxis that's very much like the kind of prophylaxis this Court has previously upheld in Tennessee v. Lane, where we had very similar affirmative constitutional obligations, and in Nevada v. Hibbs, where we had a much less significant record, nationwide, of constitutional violations. And so, for all those reasons, you know, we believe that the ADA is congruent and proportional in the prison setting. And if the Court has no further questions --"

Justice Kennedy, you asked the Petitioner's counsel about alternative remedies here, and I think there's an important point to make with regard to Title III of the ADA, and that's the title of the ADA that applies, not to public entities, as we have here, like the State prison, but the title that applies to public accommodations, like restaurants and hotels. And it's important to note, I think, that, in that title, Congress did not provide for money-damages remedies. Quite the contrary, it provided for an Attorney General action, and it provided for injunctive relief. And so, the notion that States somehow are special and should be the ones that get damages against them for violating the -- violating access rights is, in words that the Court has used -- in Boerne and the cases following it, that is a real indignity to the States. And, beyond that, the standard that applies --"

And I think, with regard to the choices that are available to prisons, much has been made in this case about the affirmative obligations of the State to provide the minimum standards of health and safety for prisoners. And I'd point out that, in the Court's decision in DeShaney -- specifically, footnote 7 -- the former Chief Justice wrote for the Court that, in determining both the scope and how to satisfy those, there is an enormous amount of discretion imposed in the State. So, it's hard to say that that provision is allowing for -- that minimal affirmative burden that's on the State is in any way congruent with the broad affirmative remedies that are at stake in this case. Now, if I could just go through, very quickly, the various constitutional rights that are being addressed here by the -- that are being claimed here by the Petitioner, you can see, in each case, why it's not a proportional and congruent remedy to use Title II of the ADA to enforce them. First of all, with regard to the Equal Protection Clause, it's almost obvious, from the findings of Congress, that they meant to impose a higher degree of scrutiny. By citing the words of Carolene Products, as well as Matthews against Lucas, that's -- have justified heightened scrutiny to apply to the disabled, this is almost proof positive that Title II -- and the ADA, in general -- is changing the level of constitutional law. It's not enforcing; it's changing the law."

With regard to the Petitioner's efforts to enforce the guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment, there is no intent standard in the ADA at all. In fact, this would scrub out the deliberate- indifference standard entirely, and, in the -- at least Goodman's reply brief, he admits that that basically would be what would happen.

My understanding is that the key difference between the Rehabilitation Act and Title II is that -- is that the Rehabilitation Act requires intentional conduct, which, obviously, is a much -- a much higher standard. Instead of dwelling on the record offered in support of Title II -- and we agree with Georgia that the record was not sufficient -- I'd like to focus on the congruence and proportionality requirements, which are quite separate from the record requirement, and which we believe are independently dispositive in this case, for two separate reasons. But, first, I think it's important to recall the two key purposes that the congruence-and- proportionality analysis serves. One of those, as the Court has reiterated, is to prevent Section 5 from becoming a kind of police power through which Congress can regulate the States and impose litigation and other burdens on them as though they were mere corporations. The second purpose, of course, is ensuring that the specific remedies that Congress chooses, and especially the abrogation of sovereign immunity -- sovereign immunity that this Court has held is within Congress's Section 5 power, are a measured response to Congress's legitimate goals. And that's obviously important, because of the -- of the -- of the tension between the Section 5 power, on the one hand, and the Eleventh Amendment and other provisions of the Constitution that protect --"

And, number two, the abrogation of sovereign immunity is not limited to the States, or categories of States, where there has been a finding of unconstitutional action.

Section 35.130(b). And if you -- if you look at Mr. Goodman's complaint, yes, there are some allegations there that obviously raise constitutional issues, but there are a lot of allegations that clearly state a claim under the Justice Department's interpretation of Title II, but, equally clearly, don't raise constitutional issues. For example, on page 65, he has a claim seeking to make the TV lounge and other entertainment facilities wheelchair accessible. Pages 53, 57, and 82, he makes a claim for better access to recreation facilities, rehabilitative exercises, and physical therapy. At page 64 of the Joint Appendix, he makes a claim to force the State to install wheelchair-accessible bathrooms."

So, I don't think it's enough just to say, \"Maybe there -- maybe there is an Eighth Amendment claim here that's legitimate, and maybe, therefore, in this case, the State's sovereign immunity can be abrogated.\" It has to be done pursuant to a legitimate exercise of Congress's power. Reason number two, Justice Kennedy, is that, as in Boerne and Garrett, even where constitutional issues are implicated, Title II effectively imposes heightened scrutiny on many decisions that are subject to rational-basis review under the Constitution -- for example, access to the law library, religious services, associational rights, those sorts of things. And that, I think, is the key distinction between this case and Lane and Hibbs. And so, as the Court put it in Garrett, even with the undue-burden exception, the statute makes unlawful a range of alternative responses that would be reasonable under the Constitution, but would fall short of imposing an undue burden on the employer. Number three, as in Garrett, Title II prohibits standards and criteria that have a disparate impact on the disabled, even though that obviously wouldn't be enough to establish a constitutional violation if the disabled were a suspect class. And, again, the Court need only look at the Justice Department's regulations to see how they impose a disparate-impact requirement. And, fourth, again, as in Kimel and Garrett, Title II reverses the burden of proof. As the Court held in Garrett, under the Constitution, classifications based on disability are prima facie --"

      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Before I say anything else, I want to just clarify that the scope of the Rehab Act and Title II is really coextensive. Mr. Schaerr made a reference to the fact that you need intentional conduct under the Rehab Act. I think that was true for a while in the lower courts with respect to damages claims. I think after this Court's decision in Gebser, in the context of damages claims, the lower courts have generally required deliberate indifference both in the Rehabilitation Act context and in the Title II Act context, to the extent they've reached the issue. But with respect to the substantive obligations, they really are identical. And I do think that's important, in a couple of ways. In particular, I think it's worth remembering here that the damages remedy in Title II -- and this is different than Title I, where there was a specific provision for back-pay -- but in Title II, the damages remedy is just an incorporation of the damages remedy available under the Rehab Act, which, in turn, incorporates Title VI and Title IX remedies. And those, of course, are entirely judge-made. And so, one of the things this Court recognized in Gebser, in deciding there had to be deliberate indifference for a compensatory-damages claim, is, this Court said, the judge-made nature of those remedies gives the court a particularly free hand in making those remedies make sense, in terms of the statute, and, I would think, a fortiori, in terms of the Constitution. So, if --"

I mean, if it's important to us how much of this applies, how do we address that issue?"

      "speech": "Well, let me address the specter of all these claims for TV access, because I do think that that's something that can be taken care of in any number of respects. One is, a sensible application of Turner-type principles to the reasonable-modification standard can certainly be done in a way to weed out those claims. I also think -- especially given Justice Kennedy's principal concern with damages, I think here's an area where the PLRA is particularly helpful, because I don't know what kind of physical injury you're going to be able to show to being denied access to the TV room. And since that's what you need to show under the PLRA in order to recover any damages for mental and emotional suffering that I suppose you could try to bring a claim for emotional suffering for not seeing TV -- I'm not sure which way that would cut -- but, in any event --"

      "speech": "-- I think, in those contexts, the PLRA is the gateway you need to some physical injury, so I think that's going to help weed these out as a matter of damages claims. And so, I think that's going to have a helpfulness, too. Also, I think, in some -- in some sense, you can't lose sight of the fact that perhaps the reason that somebody's being denied access to the TV room is because they're in a wheelchair on the second floor, and the TV room and the law library and the religious services and everything else they need in the prison is on the first floor. And, in those contexts, it may be an appropriate degree of prophylaxis. But I guess what I would say is, I would think that this Court would want to interpret the PL- ­ - I'm sorry, would want to interpret Title II in a way that avoids constitutional problems, rather than in a way that engenders it. And so, to the extent the access to the TV room is critical to the constitutionality of the statute, I think the reasonable-modification standard provides plenty of tools to apply Turner-type principles and ameliorate the constitutional problems. I mean, if you compared this case with Cutter against Wilkinson from last term, there you had a statutory strict-scrutiny standard that was specifically directed at the prisons in one other context. And, nonetheless, this Court said, \"That can be applied with Turner deference-type principles.\" Here, you have a statute that applies broadly, and I would think it would be a very easy act of interpretation and constitutional avoidance to say that, \"In the prison context, we're going to interpret in a way that avoids constitutional difficulties.\" If I could try to address just one or two specific questions -- Justice Souter, you asked about the practical experience of the Federal Government. And, as we point out in our opening brief, at page 45, it's been less than 1 percent of our litigation, and less than 2 percent of our compliance cost. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
