  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: The search of Savana Redding in this case was constitutional because Mr. Wilson had reason to suspect that she possessed contraband which posed a health and safety risk. Therefore, searching any place where she might be reasonably hiding that contraband was constitutionally permissible."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Any place, even though he had perhaps no reasonable suspicion to suspect that she was hiding the contraband in her underwear?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, as long as he had reason to suspect, which we believe the evidence does show, he was entitled to search any place where the contraband might be reasonably hidden."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Any place? I mean, prison inmates, for example, are subject to much more intrusive searches. Are you suggesting that would have been justified in this case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor. I'm -- I'm suggesting that where it might be reasonably hidden is based on an administrator's experience and certainly is proven out by the reported cases that we've cite in the reply on pages 8 and 9, which are that students often will secrete items in and under their clothing. That is not an uncommon thing to happen, although these kind of intrusive searches are rare."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "But I -- I think you're really caught in -- in a dilemma here. Your answer suggests that you would not have allowed a cavity search in this case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "But people have been known to secrete contraband in -- in bodily cavities. What is the -- what is the principle under which you would allow a strip search but disallow a cavity search?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "The principle is, Your Honor, is that the common experience with schoolchildren, as -- as school officials have a relation to schoolchildren, is such that they might hide things, and they do hide things, in and under their clothing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Was there --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "But --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Was there prior experience in this particular school? Were there prior occasions on which students had been strip-searched and contraband found?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't know, and that's not in the record, but I can tell that you that that would not be the threshold requirement under this Court's prior rulings to justify the search."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But you -- I thought your answer to Justice Scalia was that in the -- in the school's experience, children do hide contraband in their underwear but not in their body cavities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. To be more specific, in the nationwide school experience, based on the reported cases that we see, which are contained in the reply at pages 8 and 9, we find that they hide them in and under clothing, but I don't know of any case of which I'm aware where there would be items secreted in body cavities. And I -- and I feel, Your Honor, that that is a bright-line area because that -- that is -- that is something that the Court can clearly say is off limits. And --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Let me ask you about another bright-line rule that I think you're assuming. You -- you said in the course of describing the justification for this search that one -- one of the points of justification was that there was a health and safety risk. And I assume from the way you put it that you are grouping every drug, prescription or over the counter, as posing a health and safety risk; is that correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Why -- why should we accept that -- that blanket assumption? I mean, at some point it gets silly. Having -- having an aspirin tablet does not present a health and safety risk, and yet that's an over-the-counter drug, and presumably you would have gone through the same search for -- for an aspirin that was conducted here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "For the very same reasons this Court noted in T.L.O. 25 years ago, Your Honor, and that is that the school officials have deemed, in their judgment, that this is an important rule with regard to health and safety. So --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Oh, and I agree with you, and I -- I don't have any question with this kind of a, let's say, a -- a broad swath of judicial hands-off in determining what is a risk and what isn't. But at some point it becomes sufficiently questionable that I do think we have to raise it. And if your rule would criminalize -- I shouldn't say \"criminalize\" -- would put aspirin in the contraband category and justify the kind of search that went on here, I think we've reached the questionable point. And I -- my question to you now is, why haven't we?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, if -- if an administrator in their judgment, in their reasonable judgment, believes that any -- any drug poses a potential health and safety risk, because they have the custodial and tutelary responsibilities for those kids -- and it's not like a criminal issue where they're trying to prosecute; this is a case where they're trying to protect -- because they have those kinds of obligations to provide for the safety of children, to provide an orderly educational environment, it is best for this Court to defer to their judgment when they believe that certain rules are important and not second-guess those rules."

    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "I guess they might pop aspirin as well. I'm not aware that one gets a high on either one of those. Somebody in -- in the school had gotten almost fatally ill about a year before this incident; isn't that right?"

    "speaker": "WRIGHT",

    "speaker": "WRIGHT",

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "What was --"

  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "But just 7 days --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "What was -- what was the drug involved in that case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "I don't know, Your Honor, and it's not in the record."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

  },

    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Again, I don't know, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "You said it was a prescription drug."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "It was a prescription drug. And -- and 7 days before this event, Your Honor, just 7 days before, the student informant Romero had taken a prescription drug. Again, I don't know what the type of drug was, but he became violently ill, which caused he and his mother to come talk to the administrator. So we had those two recent events."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Yes, but he -- he was not the one who identified Redding. It was her classmate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Her friend Marissa Glines, yes, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "And on that classmate's say-so -- was the classmate ever asked, well, when did you get this pill? Where did she give it to you?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Where -- the question, where did this pill come from, was asked by the administrator."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "I mean, what place. I mean, the child is caught with the pills. She blames it on her classmate. She says: She gave them to me. Did the school ever bother to ask when in time she gave them, where in location she gave them?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "No, but that's clear from the record, Your Honor. The reason for that is Jordan Romero said to Mr. Wilson that morning: I just received this pill from Marissa Glines. The plan is that a group of these kids are going to take these pills at noon. So it's contemporaneous."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But it's contemporaneous with the -- with the student who blamed the other child. I'm asking if there's any link other than one child caught with the pills blurts out that it was someone else? The tip from the young man had nothing to do with Redding; it had to do with Glines."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "But the tip from the young man goes to Glines, and the young man's tip becomes reliable when Glines produces the fistful of pills that he said she would have, plus other pills."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Maybe it becomes reliable as to her, but it has nothing to do with Redding."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "But, Your Honor, then it ties in with the -- with the contraband -- excuse me -- the planner that was laid open before Mr. Wilson when he subsequently searches Savana Redding, and she admits to him that that was her planner, but she denies any knowledge of the contents. So did Marissa Glines. So --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Did the school know what -- what particular pills it was searching for?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Not --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Did it know that -- what -- what the threat was was ibuprofen or aspirin or -- or some prescription drug?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Not comprehensively, Your Honor. What they knew was there was IBU 400s in an OTC pill that was later identified. But he also knew there was a variety of pills. What Mr. Wilson did not know --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "How did he know it was an OTC pill?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Because he --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Just by looking at it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "-- called poison control."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "And -- and once that was assessed --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "What was in it? Did he say --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "It was Naprosyn 200 milligrams. And -- and, Your Honor, what -- that's a good point because what Mr. Wilson doesn't know is what other pills might be out there. He knows there's a variety of pills, but he doesn't know of what type. He doesn't know what amount."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Have you ever made -- has your side of the case ever made the argument that it needs this sort of blanket classification rule, any drug over the counter or prescription, because when a, a pill is found, they're not pharmacists, they don't know what it is, and therefore they've got to have a blanket rule or they simply cannot act effectively? I did not see that argument in the briefs. Has that argument been raised at any point?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Precisely, Your Honor. We have argued that our administrators are not pharmacologically trained?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Where did you argue it? I mean, I want to know whether that argument is in the case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "It's in the briefs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Is it? I don't remember it. Do you remember a page? Do you have a page reference offhand?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "I don't have one offhand, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "But you say it's in your brief?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "I'm fairly -- fairly certain it's in the brief."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Okay, I'll go back."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "In the case, this case, the school nurse -- the pills were given to the school nurse and she identified what they were."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Precisely. And she called poison control to figure that out, though, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Mr. Mr. Wright, could I ask you this question. There may be an issue as to what the assistant principal could reasonably infer from the facts that were known by him, whether he could reasonably infer facts that would create a reasonable suspicion that there were drugs hidden in the plaintiff's undergarments. Is that a question for -- for the finder of fact in a case like this, so that it can't be -- there can't be summary judgment for either side unless no reasonable factfinder could find to the contrary?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "The problem with that is, Your Honor, it wouldn't comport with the notion that we need to shield administrators from lawsuits and legal liability."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "No, not on the question of qualified immunity. On the issue of whether there is a Fourth Amendment violation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Whether or not that would be a factual determination, as to whether he could reasonably suspect that the pills would be there?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "I think -- I think it could lend itself to that, Your Honor, but I would prefer that the Court -- we would ask the Court and it's our position that the Court would lay down a bright line rule such that it wouldn't end up in a factual dispute, and that bright line rule is this. Once you had reason to suspect a student is possessing any contraband that poses a health and safety risk, then searching any place where that contraband may reasonably be found is constitutional, and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Any contraband, like the black marker pencil that -- that astounded me. That was contraband in that school, wasn't it, a black marker pencil?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Well, for sniffing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Oh, is that what they do?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "It's a permanent marker."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "They sniff them?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Well, that's the -- I mean, I'm a school lawyer. That's what kids do, Your Honor, unfortunately, Your Honor. But --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Really?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "But the point was is that the rule -- the rule, Your Honor, is -- is grounded in the notion that when there's a health and safety risk because these people are charged and tasked with the responsibility to keep these kids safe, they have to have the opportunity to act flexibly, immediately, and effectively when they're dealing with these risks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But there has to be -- I mean, some -- the stark difference between this case and T.L.O., in addition to the intrusiveness of the search, was there was a teacher said: I caught those girls; they were smoking in the bathroom. Here we have nothing but this Glines identifying her classmate. And nothing is done to check her veracity, nothing is done to follow up on it at all. And the search is quite different from the search of a purse that doesn't touch the child's person."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Your Honor seems to be concerned about the reliability of the tip in this case. Your Honor, I would submit to you to that student tips are the very thing that officials rely on probably the most."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But an official could follow up to see whether this child -- whether there is a basis for what she said. But there were no questions asked at all."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "There was additional corroborating evidence, Your Honor. There was -- there was suspicion by direct implication and there was suspicion by circumstantial corroboration. These two kids could, in Mr. Wilson's mind -- he believed that they were working together to conceal other types of contraband."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, the school could keep records on its students, like the police keep records on confidential informants. So if -- unless this student had a proven record of having accurately ratted out a certain number of classmates in the past, she couldn't be believed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Except that, Your Honor, there's a different incentive here. Students can be disciplined if they -- if they tell tales. And so if she tells a lie she faces the risk of discipline. In addition to that, there was evidence that these kids were friends, and he had reason to rely on that. He had reason based on their association at the opening dance. He had reason to believe that because --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "What discipline did the tipster receive? What discipline was the erroneous tipster given?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",

  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Was she subject to a civil suit by the plaintiff in this case?"
  },

    "speech": "Nothing at all. A bright line rule. I would not allow it."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "No cavity search in school, no matter what?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "We're not even clinically trained to do that, Your Honor. I would submit that if a child has something stuffed up one of their cavities -- and I assume we mean private parts, the very private parts -- that the first thing to do would be to send them to the hospital. I mean, we just don't have that clinical training."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Your basis -- your basis for saying that, I guess, is just sort of the practical one, we don't know how to do that type of thing. So far as the legal principle on the basis of which you justified this search, you could justify that search, too, couldn't you?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "On the legal basis I could see that, Your Honor. I could see that result. But practically --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "But if -- if we hold in your favor in this case and the next school district says, all right, we're going to have classes in body cavity searches, then there would be no legal basis, if we accept your principle, for saying that's out of bounds as a matter of the Fourth Amendment; isn't that correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "I see your concern. That's to be left up to the local governments, Your Honor. As you have mentioned, this Court has mentioned, in Ingraham and Wright --"

  },

    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "I just know that there has been concern expressed over body cavity searches, even in the prisoner environment and even in the border environment. I can say to this Court you will not restrict or in any way inhibit the discretion of an administrator by saying you can't go there on a body cavity search, nor would they want to, nor are they clinically trained to."

In addition to not following up with Glines, after Redding was searched and nothing was found, she was put in a chair outside the vice principal's office for over 2 hours and her mother wasn't called. What was the reason for that humiliating, putting her in that humiliating situation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, that is not a matter of the record, but the inference is that the -- that the investigation was still ongoing because there was a group of kids, and at that time the administrator was making efforts to try to make sure that he had gathered all the drugs that might be on campus. And in any event that wouldn't --"

I mean, if she's to be believed, then she was really naked, and the two administrators deny that, but you have to take her side of the facts. So taking her side of the facts, why couldn't the school administrators just do what they said they did? That is, you leave her in her underwear, tell her: Go shake her underwear. No reason to do any more than that. Or if she is really embarrassed about that, say: Go put on a swimming suit, you know. Shake the swimming suit, no problem. People see you at the beach all the time. Or call your mother. I mean, you know, we can think of another -- a number of things that seem a lot less restrictive than her version of what went on here."

And they had conducted a search of her pockets and her wallet and they had found pills in her pockets and her wallet. But they had not found pills in her underwear.

And the fact that the teacher believed that these pills were going to be consumed at lunch as part of an event that obviously wasn't simply intended to get rid of the students' headaches, we believe that that would give rise to reasonable suspicion to initiate some search. But we believe that without some particularized suspicion or some specific indication that this, the location, was a likely one to contain the drugs, that this search was excessively intrusive. And this is not a new standard. This is essentially the same standard this Court adopted in the Montoya De Hernandez case for intrusive body searches in other contexts. It has proved workable in that context and we believe that it would prove workable here. We believe that it is also better than the alternatives of a higher level of suspicion, which does not bear any necessary logical correlation to the likelihood that the --"

He's not a pharmacologist, he doesn't know what's in it. Wouldn't the reasonableness of the -- wouldn't the scope of reasonable search at least potentially be greater for the undifferentiated white pill than for the known ibuprofen?"

Again, the example was crack, and that is a situation where there is an understanding that that is -- can be a place in which suspects will hide that type of item.

And what they missed here is that this search violated the clearly established point that in order to conduct an intrusive search of one's body, the searching official needs to at least reasonably believe that the object is located underneath the undergarments.

Now, in T.L.O., the question was whether there were drugs to be found. There was marijuana in that case.

Putting those two together, he reaches the -- he suspects that the person who has the drugs has the drugs on his or her person so that they can be distributed at lunch.

Two things about the record: one, I think the hypothetical supposed that she had drugs, and in fact what the record reveals is that it was allegedly Savana provided these drugs at some point. It's not that she currently had them on her. Second, that they searched every other part, and it's an important -- it's an important point in this case. Where did Marissa have her planner? It was in the desk. Did they search the desk here? No. We know that. It's not in the record, as Mr. Wright said, but they have lockers in the school. Did they search any locker? No. Can students keep drugs anywhere else on school grounds? Perhaps, probably so. Did they search everywhere? They absolutely did not. But I want to get back to the legal answer, too, which is that this Court said in T.L.O., and it's on page 342 of T.L.O., that a search is reasonable only when there are reasonable grounds for believing that it will turn up evidence. There were no reasonable grounds for believing that this search would turn up evidence, none at all."

Nobody saw anything else. Now, what's your view of that one? I mean, let's also imagine that this is sufficient to prove -- to -- what happened was Marissa opens a planner, and in the planner there's some small knives, a cigarette lighter, and a cigarette. And who gave you the planner? Well, Savana gave it to me. And they find some pills. Let's imagine those pills are cocaine or something like meth or something. And she says well, where did you get those? Savana gave them to me. Okay. That seems to be possibly reasonable suspicion to think Savana has some of these pills. And they're going to distribute them at lunchtime. At that point they go look, whatever they did here. But then they bring Savana in to the nurse and the nurse and the female official say: All right, Savana, strip to your underclothes and shake your underclothes. That's what happens, period.

Let's assume, following your categorical rule that the -- the principal doesn't know whether it's ibuprofen or not. He just knows that there's a pill and one of the other kids said this person has got pills on -- on her person. The principal says, I know as a matter of reliable fact that one student got sick, violently sick, within the past week or so on some pill; we don't know exactly what it was. We also know within a reasonable period of time from where we are now that there have been kids who died from ingesting dangerous drugs. I've got suspicion that some drug is on this kid's person. My thought process is I would rather have the kid embarrassed by a strip search, if we can't find anything short of that, than to have some other kids dead because the stuff is distributed at lunchtime and things go awry. Is that the basis? Is that thought process, that reasoning, the basis for a -- a reasonable strip search?"

But if there is some doubt about that -- and I was hearing some doubt from Justice Breyer and perhaps other members of this Court -- well, that strikes me as a factual question.

There's too much at risk here when you're talking about the custodial and tutelary responsibilities this Court has time and again recognized as the most important elements in upholding the three search cases, student search cases, that this Court has upheld. The other thing about the government's proposal is -- is really troubling. It's because they do not justify why they would pass a rule that would so much stunt the administrator's discretion to respond, even in the most serious situations that confront the health and safety of kids.

    "speech": "There is an amicus brief that cites 189 school districts which have substantially limited strip searches, which proves the Ingraham v. Wright theory, which is that it will be taken care of at the local level. But administrators, for now, need a bright-line rule. And as to the scope, that bright-line rule is if you have reason to suspect that a student is processing contraband that poses a health and safety risk, then searching any place where that contraband may be reasonably hidden is constitutionally permissible. And in any event, Mr. Wilson in this case certainly could have believed that the Constitution permitted it, Mr. Chief Justice, and so immunity is a foregone conclusion in my opinion. But I would ask the Court to rule on the constitutional question in the affirmative because it would further the interests of judicial economy. There would not be any more Federal action in this case."

    "speaker": "WRIGHT",
    "speech": "-- the case is over. The additional issue, Justice Alito, on the factual question is I understand you're not talking about immunity, but the reality is we've got to be able to make decisions, and if we get sued on factual questions because somebody questions whether or not it's reasonable for us to search where contraband may be reasonably located, then we're going to end up in court anyway on those factual questions, which is going to -- you know, deter officials from acting immediately and effectively in those situations. So, I do not think it is a factual question. And the District Court and the first three-panel-judge court did hold as a matter of law that this search was constitutional. Thank you, Your Honors."
