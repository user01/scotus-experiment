This case is exactly the same, because the introduction of the corporate form changes things, and whether it's a one-person corporation or a multiple-person corporation, the issue is precisely the same."

And so under the Second Circuit's rule, unless you're suddenly -- unless we're talking about a corporation that wants to go off and commit crimes, the person's never going to be acting in the scope of his employment, so always he's caught within the statute. If there's, you know, several people, certainly. Am I right? Can you explain that very clearly?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EDLIN",
      "speech": "The problem that we have with the Second Circuit's decision is that it is hard to rationalize with the meaning of the statute and with the Court's decision in Reves. Reves clearly, for example, confers liability on all inside managers. Whatever else it does, it certainly confers liability on all inside managers. There's no question under Reves that Mr. King would be included within the operation and management test that this Court adopted there. The Second Circuit's decision immunizes precisely the same group of people, or a single person, that Reves would impose liability upon. And the Second Circuit's decision is not limited and does not distinguish between corporations in which there is one principal party or corporations in which there are many parties. I agree with you the scope of management test doesn't really work, but it's because it doesn't work. It's not because the Second Circuit has limited it to just this fact item."

It seems to me that if the scope of management test includes at least, as I assume it must, some reference to the purposes of the corporation, then no corporation, whether it's a regular corporation or a pure formality, can be organized as a matter of law to commit acts of racketeering. So the odd thing to me about the Second Circuit's opinion is the notion that one would be within the scope of employment while engaging in the prohibited activities. And I would have thought that that was a legal impossibility. Am I missing something?"

But even beyond the corporation, certainly RICO reaches both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises and, in the context of the illegitimate enterprise, scope of employment analysis makes no sense at all. So I just think that when you look at what the Second Circuit is doing, it can't be reconciled with what the words of the statute said. The words of the statute are extraordinarily broad. This Court has had many opportunities to look at this section of the statute, and when we look, for example, on page one of the blue brief, at the definitions, person includes any individual or entity, and an enterprise for this purpose includes any corporation. And 1962(c) refers to any person employed by an enterprise."

      "speaker": "EDLIN",

There's an individual, he is conducting his affairs through a corporate enterprise and engaging in racketeering activities. No question that that pleading is appropriate. Now if you flip it and you had Don King Productions conducting the affairs of Don King, depending upon what the facts were, that would not violate the plain language of the statute. There are contexts that one could probably come up with in which the facts would justify that sort of pleading. In this case, I think we've pled it the right way."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But as far as pleading is concerned, the rules allow you to plead in the alternative, and you don't have to pick your theory at the pleading stage, so I guess your answer to Justice Kennedy means that in your complaint you could have alleged it both ways and then waited to pick until later on."

    {
      "speaker": "EDLIN",
      "speech": "I think that that's no doubt technically correct, but I don't think that's what we're trying to do just because you can plead in the alternative. I don't think that pleading in the alternative means that you can plead wholly inconsistent theories of facts. You can plead alternative results, but I don't think that a pleading in the alternative like this would pass a motion simply because I do think that in terms of the structure of the person and the enterprise, you do have to pick it."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Do you need a corporation on your theory? I mean, I was reading your presentation and I had the notion that it wouldn't matter if it were a sole proprietorship. At least if it had employees, the sole proprietorship could be the enterprise and King could be the person. Is that correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EDLIN",
      "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. In that case, a sole proprietorship with employees would be an association-in-fact enterprise and, again, distinct from the person. So as long as there is no complete overlap between the person and the association-in-fact, those pleadings which are again not at issue in this case have routinely been upheld as appropriate pleadings. I think, Justice Ginsburg, that our circuit just got this one wrong, and I think that it's very simple to address it. Moving past the language of the statute and on toward the Reves case, again as I mentioned just a moment ago, Reves carefully considered the appropriateness of imposing liability upon employees or others who were in operational and management control of the corporation. There is no question that under that test Don King would qualify as someone in operational or management control of this enterprise, and that is the appropriate standard to use here. It is not a scope of employment standard. Reves is the appropriate standard, and under Reves Mr. King would have liability. The Second Circuit's decision simply immunizes that. The final vice with the Second Circuit's decision goes toward the evisceration of 1962(c) actions. 1962(c) actions, I believe -- I haven't done the math, but I believe they are the wide majority of RICO claims that are brought. There are many more cases there. Now, whether you take the Government's example of a --"

Congress made a choice in unveiling the broadest possible statute, that it would err on the side of including these kinds of cases, possibly even shifting the burden to Federal courts to deal with these kinds of claims so that loopholes were not created for clever racketeers to slip through and avoid liability. I believe that that demonstrates the breadth of the statute, and if that is a problem to be remedied as this Court has observed on many occasions, it lies with Congress. The plain language of this statute has been amply satisfied by this pleading, and I believe that the -- again, to my last point, the problem with the Second Circuit decision is that whether you take the Government's example of the corporate president who directs the company to bribe public municipalities, or whether you take our example of an organized crime family incorporating and appointing everybody an executive vice president, those two situations, under the Second Circuit standard, would not be caught within the scope of the statute, and --"

Second, it was a panel of two judges in the Second Circuit, but also Judge Lloyd George of Nevada who, in addition to presumably knowing something about boxing, knows something about the laws outside the Second Circuit and how his circuit interprets this. A per curiam decision which drops a very strong footnote in footnote 4 which -- in which the Second Circuit owns up to the fact that its decision, it's intention, if not direct conflict, with the laws of every other circuit on this point, I think demonstrates in some way that the Second Circuit was inviting this certiori."

That's it. And now all of those become RICO violations because it is claimed that this person, you see, is engaging or participating in the affairs of American Express Company or any other large company, through a pattern of racketeering activity, i.e. two instances of mail fraud.

This statute was not passed without Congress observing that these exact criticisms were possible. It was passed over opposition. The answer to the opposition was simply that the protections of the statute did not take place in the definitional sections, it took place in the pattern and enterprise sections so that garden-variety frauds are typically not committed with a pattern and continuity."

      "speaker": "SCHLICK",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1962(C) reaches racketeering activity by a defendant who is employed by the RICO enterprise, without regard to the scope of the defendant's employment. That is clear from the text of Section 1962(c) which reaches racketeering activity by any person employed by or associated with any enterprise. A scope of employment rule defies that plain language. In addition, a scope of employment rule is inconsistent with the statutory scheme in three additional respects. First, a scope of employment rule defies Congress's intent to reach criminals who infiltrate and corruptly run legitimate businesses. It's important in that respect to address the question of whether a criminal or otherwise wrongful act can be within the scope of employment. And the answer to that is yes, it can be. Section 231 of the Restatement of Agency addresses that point, but consider the example of a corporation which instructs its employee to make a sale, knowing that the way that that sale was made traditionally is through bribery. In that case, the bribery would be within the scope of employment, notwithstanding that it would be unlawful and, notwithstanding, there might not have been specifically urged by the corporation. Because of that, when criminals take control of a business, they are able to bring illegal activity within the scope of that business. And under the Second Circuit's scope of employment rule, that would immunize the racketeering activity. Second, the scope of employment rule would create additional difficulties in applying Section 1962(c), because the test itself is contextual and subject to the case-specific application. This Court discussed that in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton. The difficulties and the permutations of the rule. Third, a scope of employment limitation is inconsistent with the Court's holding in Reves that a defendant, under Section 1962(c), must participate in the operation or management of the affairs of the business. If participation and operation and management is necessary for there to be liability, then carrying out the affairs of the business cannot prevent liability. An employee who controls a corporation would, under that rule, be immune from liability when he misuses his control of the corporation to involve the corporation in racketeering. If the Court has no questions?"

The question is whether the Second Circuit's view of the application of 1962(c) should prevail, or whether the view of other circuits should prevail. The Second Circuit is saying that corporate employees acting with the corporation and for the benefit of the corporation are really a part of the corporation and are not distinct from the corporation for the purposes of the distinctness required by RICO."

Now, where the really bad people are in an enterprise and they're running it through really bad acts, your interpretation, according to the other side, will basically in the worse case bring them out of section (c). Because these are really bad people, they have a lot of really bad acts, so they're just the people that (c) wants, and you write them out, because after all they are not going against, they are even furthering what the enterprise is there for.

This statute says, as interpreted, says any person -- but it also says the enterprise shall not be liable for that person's conduct, and we believe the only fair inference from that, which is also consistent with what Congress was talking about overall and its dominant purpose of RICO, the only inference which can be taken from that is that Congress intended the persons to be liable when they acted within a corporation for their own personal benefit."

I think everyone agrees that (c) is absurd when it exposes all commercial America to the threat of RICO. We don't rely on that. We don't think the Second Circuit relied on that. I think the Secretary was saying a very simple thing. They were saying when employees and officers are working together for the benefit of the company, they happen to commit acts of alleged fraud, they are not distinct from the company. They are the enterprise, and there is no RICO person. Now, I answer the plain language argument in two ways: The Sherman Act said every person who contracts and combines, and the single actor model is imposed upon that quite correctly. I look not only at that, but I also look at what I've just described, and that is the absence of derivative liability.

Second, you know, this Court -- this Court in Copperweld said every person does not mean every person. In Pierson it said any person except a judge because it implicated the common law. In the Bach Laundry case, defendant was defined as any party. I think Justice Scalia defined it as a criminal defendant in a concurring opinion. In 42 U.S.C. 1985, which is conspiracy to violate civil rights, a number of dist -- a number of circuit courts and district courts have held that two or more persons does not mean two or more persons if they're employed by the corporation. So this single actor -- this unity of conduct which the Second Circuit focused upon -- is not foreign to the jurisprudence of this Court, and we believe it is the only appropriate way to harmonize the absurdity of this statute applied on a plain language basis, and RICO's purpose of punishing the -- call them racketeer -- person engaging in racketeering and, in this case, the quasi-infiltrator, the employee who goes bad and uses his job as a means of feathering his nest. The department talks about -- Solicitor General, I'm sorry. I'm always used to saying the department. The Solicitor General says they need RICO to get unions -- to bring injunctive action against unions. Think of that. What they are trying to do is to get rid of the union officers who, at the expense of the corporation, are feathering -- stuffing their own pockets, feathering their own nests. We think that's what Congress was looking at when it's talking about 1962(c), and the one thing we surely think Congress was not looking at was IBM against IBM, which is the effect of the any-person analysis. A question was asked about the use of it; I think in the Sedima case, we do not have the appropriate, we did not get the up-to-day statistics. In the Sedima case, the ABA reportedly cited that said that nine percent -- nine percent of the civil 1962(c) lawsuits were -- had to do -- had anything to do with organized crime, and the other ninety-one percent were commercial disputes. I go back to Justice Marshall's dissent in Sedima, as I go back to Justice Marshall in the Second Circuit. I think there is another consideration which he posed. The broad application of 1962(c) for which they contend is based principally, if not entirely, upon a quote, unquote, plain language, with all respect, Justice Stevens, with no real analysis and no answer to all to our point with regard to the absence of true liability. No answer at all. The application of their quote, unquote, plain language approach in essence does turn federal jurisdiction on its head because not only do you have people being threatened with treble damage liability where that should not exist, but you have federal jurisdiction being obtained where everything else lacking, you're in State court in a common law fraud case, or in this case in a supposed tortious interference with --"
