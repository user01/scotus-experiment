Yet, nearly a year into the case, after the parties had briefed the merits, the magistrate judge not only raised an argument that the petition was untimely, he actually imposed the State's limitations defense and dismissed the case, despite the State's procedural default and contrary concession. That was error, for two reasons. First, it violates the general principle of the adversary system in the civil rules that it's error to impose a forfeited limitations defense sua sponte, and the statutory text in rules have confirmed that this principle applies to habeas. Second, the State's concession of timeliness based on full information was an express binding waiver, and it was error for the District Court to override that concession."

And this Court, in Gonzalez and Mayle, says that when that happens, that's where you start, with the civil rules.

In addition, Granberry is different for several other reasons. Exhaustions is, unlike limitations, unique to habeas corpus; it's not covered by Rule 8. And, also, it's a common-law limit that this Court has developed on habeas relief. It's not a statutory affirmative defense. And, as our brief points out, Congress has treated these very differently when it codified them in AEDPA. And this applies not only to exhaustion, but nonretroactivity, abuse of the writ, and procedural default. I'm sorry, procedural default was not codified. But they other defenses -- the other limits on habeas relief that the Petitioner relies on were codified very differently in AEDPA; whereas, for exhaustion it says, \"Relief shall not be granted unless you exhaust.\" That's a substantive limit on relief.

      "speaker": "BUSBY",
      "speech": "Well, we disagree that this was up front, Your Honor. The answer in a -- habeas corpus cases, of course, heavily deals with the merits, as it did in this case. And then, Mr. Day replied. And, as the State's amicus brief points out, that's all that usually happens in most habeas corpus cases. So, we were near the end of the proceeding, as -- if you think of the run-of-the-mine habeas corpus case. And, also, speaking of run-of-the-mine habeas corpus cases, this is a very rare instance. There are -- there are lots of procedures for courts to vindicate the interest that the State describes in comity, finality, and federalism, whether inviting a motion to -- whether ordering the State to file a motion to dismiss under Rule 4, which we submit would be the proper procedure, or, if the State fails to raise it in its answer in certain circumstances, inviting them to file a motion to amend under Rule 15. That takes care of these interests in the run-of-the- mine case. There's no need to vindicate those interests in this case by creating an exception to the rules. This Court has said, in Lonchar and in Carlisle, that where there are civil rules that deal with the -- and habeas rules -- that deal with how these things happen, the Court cannot use its inherent powers to circumvent those rules. And we submit that that's exactly what the court did here. Now, in addition, I'd like to point the Court to New York versus Hill, which is not cited in our briefs, but can be found at 528 U.S. at 114 to -15 and also 118, on this express waiver issue. And this is a case where the Court recognized exactly the point that we make here, that not all -- you don't always have to show intentional relinquishment of a known right for that to be the standard for waiver. It depends on the right at issue. There, it was an International Agreement on Detainers Act case, and the Court held that the -- that the defendant's assent to delay waived the time limitation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, expressly waived it. And that's our -- that's our position here, is that the State's affirmative pleading of timeliness is an express waiver. In addition, the State could -- certainly couldn't prevail, under the Brady versus U.S. standard that applies to plea agreements, for saying that its concession was not knowing. There's no -- there's no suggestion here that the State was misled. There's no suggestion that they didn't have all the information they needed to make the calculation. And Brady says that simply misapprehending a factor -- a relevant factor in the analysis is not enough. And that's at 397 U.S. at page 757. In addition, the State makes an argument about policies beyond the concerns of the parties, and that the State -- that those should be vindicated in this case. But I'd like to point out that this Court has not adopted the \"beyond the concerns of the parties\" test; rather, it's acknowledged that Congress entrusts even important public policies, like comity, finality, and federalism, to the adversary process; and, thus, their -- and even private rights that benefit society can be waived, in Christiansburg Garment, for example. With the Court's permission, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."

We're not conceding that the State, in fact, waived it here, but we're saying that that's not essential to the answer to this question, because it's not the beginning and the end of the analysis.

If it is, in fact, permissible in these circumstances for the District Court to raise the issue, then doing it the way the court did it here, and the way that was approved in Bendolph, and the way that we believe the Eleventh Circuit approved it, is entirely appropriate, because it's consistent with what this Court said in its habeas jurisprudence."

And I -- what I'm saying, Your Honor, is -- is that we would not, because the District Court applied the appropriate test. In the first instance, I would say that the Eleventh Circuit did not, in fact, apply that test, did not believe that it was obligated to, but if this Court were to disagree, as Justice Scalia has presented the hypothetical, then I would say that the District Court did, in fact, apply the correct test. The District Court, as noted in -- on page 8(a) of the petition appendix, the footnote in the magistrate's report and recommendation cites Jackson, the Eleventh Circuit case which stands for the discretionary proposition, and indicates specifically that it is relying on a discretionary test. And so, the District Court in this case, in fact, applied the test that we are advocating, and in -- and, frankly, got it right. The District Court applied discretion, raised the issue, provided a notice and an opportunity to be heard, conducted the analysis of prejudice -- there was no prejudice in this case -- and ruled, on that basis.

To the contrary, to the extent the rules speak to the issue at all, they confirm that in light of the significant social cost of Federal review of State Court convictions, the Federal Courts have a unique responsibility to weed out unmeritorious claims and to enforce the limitations on habeas review. Rule 4 imposes an obligation on the court to dismiss unmeritorious petitions without even calling for an answer by the State. Now, Rule 4 is not applicable here, but the absence of an obligation to note the deficiency sua sponte does not connote a prohibition on acting sua sponte; rather, it suggests that it lies in the court's discretion. That is exactly how this Court addressed similar question in Granberry, where it rejected the two extremes -- one, recognizing the limitation as jurisdictional, that the court was obligated to raise it sua sponte, but also rejecting the opposite extreme, that the court was prohibited to address an issue that had not been preserved in the District Court."

    {
      "speaker": "DRIEMEIER",
      "speech": "Well, our point is that it is a matter for the court's discretion. And there may well be circumstances where it would be an abuse of discretion to interject a timeliness objection. For example, if the case had gone on for years, and a trial had been held, as Your Honor suggested in the question earlier, that might well be an abuse of discretion, but it would not -- for example, take the case where the District Court had dismissed, at the outset, on the merits, and it went up to the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals said, \"You know, that merits issue is a very difficult one. And, in fact, we think we might have to remand for an evidentiary hearing on that issue. But, you know, this case was untimely filed. We can dispose of it on that basis. And we can save all of those judicial and party resources by addressing that issue now.\" We think that would be an appropriate exercise of the court's discretion. Here, as Your Honor noted earlier, this was the first thing that happened in the District Court after the filing of the petition, the answer, and the reply. There was no waste of judicial resources by the fact that it was raised sua sponte by the court in the first thing that the court did after that briefing. There was no prejudice to the Petitioner, because it was omitted from the State's responsive pleading. There is -- as the Court said in Granberry, the failure to plead it perhaps waives the District -- the State's opportunity to insist on the defense. The State, because it said, in its answer here, erroneously, that the petition was timely filed, or if it had said nothing, would have waived its opportunity to stand on, and insist on, that defense. But it is not an absolute forfeiture. It does not bar the party from suggesting at a later time, \"We would like to amend,\" or, in this case, the court to note it sua sponte.

And obviously, as the State suggested, if the State didn't want to stand on the statute of limitations defense because, for example, it was particularly messy, there was going to be a lot of litigation about equitable tolling, it would in inappropriate for the court to insist on litigating that issue. But if, for example, the State said, \"Well, you know, if we didn't stand on this defense, instead this Petitioner would go back to the State Court, and the State's Courts are going to be very hospitable to this claim. We think you're more likely to deny relief, so we'd rather have it litigated here,\" it would inappropriate for the State to try to force the Federal Court to litigate that issue instead of the State Court. These are all fact- specific, case-specific considerations. And that's what the Court did in Granberry. It remanded -- after setting aside both extreme positions, it remanded to the Court of Appeals for a case-specific application of discretion. As to the question of whether the Eleventh Circuit here believed that there was an absolute obligation, I think that it's relevant to note that, although there was one point at which it said, \"The court was obligated to enforce the statute of limitations\" -- and, of course, that's true if the State has preserved the defense -- there were three other points in the Court of Appeals opinion where it used discretionary or nonmandatory language. For example, at petition appendix 4(a), the court said that the District Court \"may dismiss.\" At the petition appendix 5(a), it said that the State's failure to raise \"does not bar\" the court from acting sua sponte. Again, at petition appendix 6(a), the State's concession, quote, \"does not compromise the authority of the District Court.\" All of those are phrased in more permissive language --"

    {
      "speaker": "BUSBY",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to begin by addressing the \"must\" versus \"may\" issue that Counsel discussed. For the reasons I mentioned, I think the better reading of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is that there was an obligation, and that the most clear indication of that is its distinction of Esslinger, which expressly applied a Granberry-type analysis. But, even if the Court believes that the Eleventh Circuit was only saying \"may,\" and that the District Court was only saying \"may,\" and recognized the that it had discretion -- and there is a footnote in the magistrate's opinion that cites to Jackson that says, \"We have discretion\" -- I would submit that if you read Jackson, it's a standardless discretion. There are no factors anywhere in Jackson of the type that this Court discussed in Granberry. It -- and there's no indication that the -- that the magistrate judge considered any of those factors. There's no indication that the Eleventh Circuit considered any of those factors. And it's certainly an abuse of discretion for a court to apply the wrong legal standard or fail to consider the relevant factors that channel that discretion. And so, we -- our position is that, because the factors under Rule 15 and the other factors in our brief were not applied, that a remand, at a minimum, is appropriate in this case. Also, I'd like to speak to Granberry and Caspari. Again, those involve exhaustion and nonretroactivity. And I submit that it's not correct to characterize those two doctrines as affirmative defenses; rather, the way that Congress codified them is on -- as substantive limits on relief, unlike \"limitations,\" which it just said \"period of limitations,\" which the commonly accepted meaning is an \"affirmative defense.\" And so, that makes those very different from an affirmative defense, in terms of sua sponte consideration. Also, both \"exhaustion\" and \"nonretroactivity\" are unique to habeas. They're not mentioned anywhere in Rules 8 and 12. Whereas, \"limitations,\" of course, is mentioned explicitly. And so, our position is that Rule 8 and 12, not necessarily always, but at least in all but extraordinary cases, would prevent the judge from raising this sua sponte. Also, I would say that the rules that we rely on don't deprive the court of sua sponte authority, they channel that authority. Under Rule 4, they can plead it, or the court can make a motion to dismiss -- ask the -- order the State to make a motion to dismiss based on limitations under Habeas Rule 4. They can plead it in their answer, under Habeas Rule 5 and Civil Rules 8 and 12, or they can amend their answer, under Civil Rule 15. That's the way the drafters of the rules wanted them to do this. And Lonchar and Carlisle say they cannot -- that a judge cannot use his sua sponte power to circumvent the requirements of those rules. Finally, I'd like to mention that civil -- the statutes of limitations in civil cases also implicate broader social interests. And some of them, we've discussed in our brief. And, even more so, because there are lots of protections in AEDPA cases that don't apply in civil cases. There are presumptions of correctness and those sorts of things. But courts in civil cases, nonetheless, say that statutes of limitations can be waived. And the result should be no different here. Thank you."
