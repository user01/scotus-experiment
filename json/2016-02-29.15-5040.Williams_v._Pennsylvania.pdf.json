So as the Court has said, one looks at the psychological tendencies of human beings. That's what the Court addressed in Caperton. And we know that there are many cases, as ­­ as Justice Breyer has referred to, where judges or justices have been far more involved in an issue that came before the court, once they became a judge or justice later on, than Justice Castille was in this case. There are many instances where judges or justices worked on an issue, spearheaded an issue, fought for legislation, for example, for years and years and years, even may have had it named after them, and then sat in judgment on the constitutionality or scope of that legislation. Now, I think that the public would see at least as much potential for bias in a situation like that, at least as much possibility that the ­­ that given human psychology, a justice in that position would be reluctant to overturn his or her own statute. The reason that that's not a constitutional violation is because I think that Caperton, and this Court's law generally, recognize that judges are human beings, they have prior lives, and that we don't want to have a situation where the only people who can become judges and sit on cases are people with no prior experiences."

There were no such bright lines that arose out of Caperton, even on a ­­ a matter that is of great importance, which is the ­­ the nature of ­­ of campaign contributions. What did happen after Caperton, though, Your Honor, is that some ­­ there was a model rule, 4.4, adopted in which a bright line was drawn. Any amount over X, $3,000, $4,000, is a violation of these rules, any amount under it is not. A dollar more is a violation, a dollar less is not. That's a clear rule, Your Honor. But it was done by a rule, not by a constitutional mandate. And it will be up to each individual jurisdiction what number they plug in there, what campaign amount they ­­ contribution amount they think is the appropriate amount. Now there's also a rule, 211, and that is somewhat akin to the Federal statute 455 involving prior involvement by a government lawyer in ­­ in a case. And that really is the argument that the Petitioner has been making. He calls it a constitutional Caperton argument, Your Honor, but he uses the exact language of Rule 211. And that's ­­ that would certainly be making the constitutional floor into the ­­ into the statutory ceiling. There would be no room in between. But I would like to speak for a bit about the second question of the case, Your Honor, because I think it's actually even more troubling than the first one, and I think it would be a ­­ a radical departure from a previously ­­ from ­­ from previous practice. The Petitioner's position is that because we can't know exactly what the other judges on the panel do, we have to throw out the whole case. We have to assume, in ­­ in essence, the worst. We have to assume, as a constitutional mandate, that all the other justices or judges were tainted. And that's a reversal of the essential premise of judicial review, which is that at least nonrecusable judges follow their oath to apply the law.

Prior recusal motions were based on that assertion that he was personally recusing them. Now, there's any number of ways in which he could have done that. He could have hold ­­ held a conclave. He could have had a week­long meeting to decide every individual case. He didn't do that. What he actually did was much less involvement than that sort of process would have entailed. So the fact that they didn't have the memo didn't change the essential point of the ­­ of ­­ of the argument. And, in fact, Petitioner said here today that even if the district attorney had a flat policy and didn't look at any individual cases, that would still be a recusal problem. And I ­­ I think that the ­­ the participation or the involvement of other justices is ­­ is really one of the core problems here. Because under the Petitioner's point of view, it really can't happen, because they ­­ they will be tainted by the justice who they're looking at. They're collegial. It's a collegial process, he says. And because of that, they can't really know what they're ­­ whether they've been affected by what he did. And so we really have a ­­ a dead end or ­­ or a circularity here, Your Honor, because there's ­­ there's nowhere to go. And if you look to ­­ to pick up on earlier questions, if you look at this Court's historic practices, as it's termed in recusal matters, it is to refer a recusal motion to an individual justice, and that's it. Now, under Petitioner's approach, I think that's seriously problematic, a difficulty for the Court. You have two options: Either to continue that practice, having held, if you adopt Petitioner's point of view, that the failure to recuse, the erroneous failure to recuse, taints the votes of every other justice on the Court, but the Court declines to look at the issue; or you adopt a new practice in which the Court, in fact, looks at the recusal of ­­ the individual recusal and makes a decision for itself, which puts it in the position of deciding who the members of the Court will be on any particular case."

When, under the IOPs, a matter is assigned to an individual justice on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, a full court matter is assigned to an individual justice.

And that's where the problem ­­ that's where the due process problem starts. What separates this out from the ethical rules is that this is an extreme and rare case. That's what Caperton was talking about, where the ethical rules were not sufficient to cover the problems here.

On ­­ on question two, if you accept the Respondent's position, what you would be saying is it's okay to have one ­­ one biased judge on an appellate panel, or two, or three, so long as a majority voted in favor were not biased. And that's not appropriate under the Due Process Clause, the idea of fairness, the public confidence in the integrity of the fairness of the system requires that each judge be free from bias. And lastly, I would say about referring to the full court, we did that. We asked, if you look at our motion to recuse that's in the Joint Appendix, I think at Section 4 of our motion says if Judge Castille denies this, we ask that the full court hear it. And Justice Castille, using his power as the Chief Justice, blocked that. He said, I'm going to deny the motion to recuse, and I'm going to deny referral to the full court.
