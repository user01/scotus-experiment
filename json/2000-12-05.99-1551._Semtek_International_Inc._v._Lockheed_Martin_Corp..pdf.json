The suit was filed within Maryland's time limits, but the Maryland courts believed that they could not entertain the suit because it was barred by operation of Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It was barred, they believed, because a Federal district court in California had dismissed an earlier assertion of the claim on the ground that it was untimely under the California statute of limitations and it declared that dismissal to be on the merits. Now, that earlier California case had been filed by the plaintiffs in State court and, of course, we now know it was untimely. If the case had remained in State court and had been dismissed as untimely by the State court, it is absolutely clear that under California law it would not have precluded the suit in Maryland, and that's because the California supreme court has stated repeatedly that dismissals based on the statute of limitations do not extinguish the substantive right.

Now, as a result, when the defendant removed the California case to the Federal court and immediately moved to dismiss, so it's clear that it understood at the time it was removing, we're going to move to dismiss this case based on the statute of limitations, but by moving it from the State court to the Federal court and getting the exact same ruling, a ruling on California law, because, of course, the Federal court was obliged to apply the State's statute of limitations, by getting that ruling in a Federal court, it is now claimed, and the Maryland courts accepted the claim, that the rights which California's statute of limitations preserve had been extinguished because the statute of limitations was applied by the Federal court."

      "speech": "Well, you had five reasons and I sidetracked you. I'm sorry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOTTESMAN",
      "speech": "Yes, five reasons. The first is the text, and I'll come to that. Let me just rattle off the five, and then I'll go back and talk about each of them if time permits. The first is the text. It is not by its terms a rule-preclusion provision. Secondly, that's not inadvertent. As the advisory committee notes, and states repeatedly, the Federal rules do not state rules of preclusion and it would be improper if they attempted to do so, because such rules are substantive. The third is this Court's decisions since the Federal rules were enacted. Now, this Court has not had a preclusion case involving a State law diversity action since the rules were enacted, but it's had a number of Federal question cases, and so it's had an opportunity to discuss what are the sources of the preclusion rule that the Court applies in Federal question cases and it has never suggested that the source is Rule 41(b). Quite the contrary, the Court has repeatedly said these rules of preclusion are judge-made and the decisions of this Court that we have the power to determine when exceptions to the general rule are appropriate, et cetera, so that it's clear that this court does not understand Rule 41(b) to be directing the answer to rule preclusion questions. The fourth, and I hope I have time to explain this, is that the rule would be incongruous and in some respects implausible in operation if it were a rule preclusion law, and the fifth is that it would violate the Rules Enabling Act and would undermine important questions of sensitivity to State interests, these being things that would cause the Court, when in doubt, to interpret it as not being a rule of preclusion. Let me start with the text, because the argument on the other side is principally that the words of 41(b) are a rule of preclusion. The words of 41(b) are that a dismissal, unless it's in one of the exceptions, quote, operates as a judgment on the merits, end quote. Now, it doesn't say how a judgment on the merits operates. Often, judgments on the merits do operate to be rule -- to be claim-preclusive."

So as we understand what the right answer should be, it would not matter whether the second case is in a State court or a Federal court. The question is, is what happened in that first court preclusive of the suit that's being filed in the second court, and we have to answer that by looking to the law that appropriately applies to the first ruling."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Can this question be answered en masse, or doesn't it depend upon what the dismissal was for? Suppose, for example, the Federal case was dismissed not on statute of limitations grounds, this removed case, this diversity case, but because the plaintiff was recalcitrant and wouldn't comply with discovery requests, and the district judge gives lots of warnings and he said finally, plaintiff, I'm dismissing your case as a sanction under Rule 37 for your recalcitrance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOTTESMAN",
      "speech": "Well, we think in that case the dismissal is not for a reason of State law. In the case that Your Honor is describing, the dismissal is for behavior in front of a Federal court, a matter which the Federal court polices as a matter of Federal law. If that's what causes the dismissal, then we would agree that there is certainly at least a strong argument and maybe a compelling argument that a Federal rule of preclusion would apply to that, but the Federal rule of preclusion still would not be 41(b). The Federal rule of preclusion would be something independent of that. But -- in other words, to us it's not just that it's a diversity case that's important here. It's a diversity case that was dismissed for a reason of State law. That being so, we need to know whether that reason of State law precludes, and California says no, it does not."

Suppose there's a whole claim, and it gets adjudicated, there is a counterclaim that defendant failed to bring. Federal courts have a compulsory counterclaim rule. Defendant then goes in as plaintiff to a State court, brings what would have been a compulsory counterclaim in the Federal court, in the State court where it's not a compulsory counterclaim.

The same issue arises under Rule 23(b)(3), the class action provision. What if people don't opt out of a (b)(3) class? Are they then precluded -- if they lose, if the class loses, are they precluded from bringing their own lawsuit in another court? When Rule 23(b)(3) and (c) were drafted the advisory committee said, we cannot state in the rules that your failure to opt out means you are bound because we are not allowed, by the Rules Enabling Act, to declare what the res judicata effect of that is, so all we say in the rules is, if you don't opt out of the class you will be, quote, included in the judgment, and it will be then for those who determine what the preclusion rules are to determine what that means, and we think they're likely to say that that means that they are preclusive, but that's not for us to say."

Now, of course, one more thing has intervened since Dupasseur, and that is this Court's decision in Erie, and this Court's decision in Erie would independently suggest that if this is, quote, substantive in the sense that Erie makes the distinction, that State law would control, and it would be difficult to find anything that was more substantive than this in the two senses, the twin aims of Erie. First of all, California law says that the fact that you filed untimely here does not extinguish your substantive right. You still have it, if you can find somebody who will hear it. The right is still alive, but the Federal court is -- if it invokes a rule that would say, ah, but your right is not alive if it was issued by a Federal court you're getting exactly the opposite outcome on whether there exists a tort right, depending on --"

Secondly, even if you are foreclosed from pursuing that claim in California, you can take the same set of facts and say, well, we first alleged it as a tort. That was untimely, but those same facts actually add up to a breach of contract, and California will allow you to refile and pursue the claim as a contract claim. But thirdly, the California court has expressly said, and this is the Western Coal case, which is cited in our brief at page 48, that even if you are precluded from coming back to the courts in California you are free to go to a sister State if they are willing to hear the claim.

When 41(b) was adopted there were two preclusion rules announced by this Court, one for Federal question cases, one for State cases. The Federal question rule was that if it was, quote, on the merits it is precluded unless we find an exception. The State rule was, we look to the State law to determine what the rule preclusion is, so obviously 41(b) plays an important role. Wherever the operative preclusion rule says that on the merits dictates claim preclusion, then it will have that effect, but it's having that effect not because of Rule 41(b) but because of whatever the operative preclusion rule is.

Rule 41 serves an extremely important function in the structure of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It reflects an understanding by the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules that it is very important to determine at the time a Federal civil action is dismissed whether that judgment of dismissal brings an end to litigation arising between those parties and their privities on the same set of facts. It gives you that answer so that everyone knows whether this is an adjudication on the merits. It is not, as Mr. Gottesman suggests at some point, a complete rule of preclusion."

One, I do not think that Rule 41 can be read to be merely issue-preclusive rather than precluding the claim and, secondly, even if it were so read, it would lead to very unpalatable consequences on the first question. This Court, I think, has passed this point in Plout, where you specifically held that Congress violated Article III of the Constitution when it tried to reopen and revive Federal cases that had been adjudicated and determined to be found outside the statute of limitations and Congress tried to retroactively extend the statute of limitations, and the parties seeking to defend the act of Congress said, well, that's just statute of limitations, and this Court says in Plout that --"

I just wanted to make it clear that there is -- there's clear -- that what the Court does in Plout is to analogize a statute-of-limitations dismissal to a failure to prove substantive liability and a failure to prosecute. That is a judgment on the merits. The Court said, to be precise, the rules of finality treat a dismissal on statute-of-limitation grounds the same way they treat a dismissal for failure to state a claim, for failure to prove substantive liability, or for failure to prosecute, as a judgment on the merits, citing for that proposition Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). That wasn't dicta. That was part and parcel of why it violated Article III. 41(b) stands --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Dellinger, I don't think your colleague contests that.

But I think what he says is, it's up to the State courts to decide what an effect an on-the-merits decision has with regard to State causes of action.

Those three are claim-preclusive. I'm sorry. Those three are issue-preclusive, and because we know that the three exceptions are issue-preclusive, we therefore know that the basic part of the rule, not the exception, extinguishes the claims, and I think Plout makes no sense otherwise. With respect to the fact that -- the notion that Rule 41(b) should only operate where the first case is a Federal question case and not a diversity case --"

      "speech": "It would be contrary to Hannah to say so, because Hannah, the plain text of the rule covers both of these. Also, it's important to note how difficult it would be to follow the notion that Rule 41 provides the preclusive effect only in Federal question matters because often, increasingly these days, a lawsuit will encompass both Federal and pendant or supplemental State claims, so that there's simply no indication in the rule that when a Federal court reaches a judgment of dismissal in a case involving Federal questions, in a case involving State law claims, or in a case involving mixed claims, that you don't judge the preclusive effect by looking at Rule 41 and how it operates as a judgment of dismissal in the Federal courts. Whether it is a Federal question case or a diversity case, the Federal courts have a strong interest in establishing at the time of dismissal, whether this does extinguish the claim or not, and their suggestion that, you know, why would the Federal courts have an interest -- you may be asking whether the Federal courts have an interest when it's a State law cause of action. I'm just saying that that's the -- let me explain why the Federal courts do have an interest. They would say, look, this is a State law cause of action, and the next lawsuit is going to be filed outside the Federal court system in State courts, but it's important to recognize that the Federal courts do have a very vital interest in not allowing people casual access to try their cases in Federal court and not be bound by the results."

This is a case that was begun in California State court -- you're relying on Erie and no forum-shopping -- begun in a California State court, removed by the defendant to a California Federal court, and then the case is begun again in Maryland, which has a longer statute of limitations. But for the removal of that diversity case to the Federal court, this case, when it's reinstated in Maryland, would have been heard under the 3-year statute of limitations and one thing we know for sure, there is no substantive policy that either California or the Federal court there is putting forward. They're saying, we don't want to clog our courts with a stale claim, a claim we regard as stale. If Maryland wants to have its courts occupied by old claims, it's none of our business. We don't care what they -- this is a procedural policy in that sense, what cases do we want our courts to be dealing with. That kind of statute of limitations, as opposed to one that bars the right, is one that's directed to how long we want to open our court door.

California has determined that the substantive policy should be that there will be a cause of action for business torts. California has balanced the interest between keeping that alive and the interest of repose in favor of settling at 2 years for how long that should be tried in California.

Now, there may be many reasons why you would think, Justice Scalia, that a Federal judge sitting in diversity ought to make a decision dismissing the case on statute of limitation grounds or any other grounds not claim-preclusive, that the judge ought to specify otherwise, and Rule 41(b) provides for that, so that whatever the reasons are, a Federal court sitting in diversity and a party before that court can say, you should not make this claim-preclusive. One of the factors you ought to take into account is the existence of a contrary California law on claim preclusion. And if the judge insists on not otherwise specifying, or in this case making it absolutely clear, by saying this dismissal is in its entirety with prejudice and on the merits, you can seek relief under Rule 59 from the form of that judgment and you can go to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where they went to contest the merits of the statute of limitations claim. They didn't do that. They didn't take it to the Ninth Circuit. They didn't seek certiorari. If that judgment was wrong, it is wrong in a way that is still clearly preclusive under res judicata.

Another one is more laid back and says, you can come any time within 3 years, so the first State says, we're not going to clog our courts with this business. If someone else want to entertain it longer, it doesn't -- no skin off our teeth."

      "speech": "Mr. Dellinger, to what extent should we be guided by an opinion of this Court called Walker v. Armco Steel? Now, that case dealt with Rule 3 of the Federal rules, and Rule 3 says an action is commenced by filing a complaint, and this Court said, it does not determine when an action is commenced for the purpose of triggering a State statute of limitations in a diversity case, and the Court in Walker said that the rule did not displace the State's policy determinations underlying its statute of limitations. It seemed as clear a rule in its language as Rule 41, and in -- was a diversity case, and invokes the same concerns, I think, and yet we said, okay, there we're not relying on Rule 3's text. Does that have a bearing on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DELLINGER",
      "speech": "It does, but we still win. It does in the following sense. I think that the best argument that you can make for saying that a Federal court ought to apply nonpreclusive, ought to reach a nonpreclusive judgment when the State rule so provides. The best rule, the best argument for that would be an argument that follows from Walker and Justice Ginsburg's opinion in Gasperini, where those cases take the position that the Federal rules are to be construed, although under Hannah they clearly prevail, they're to be construed with sensitivity to State interest. So that you could imagine that the proper thing for a Federal court to do sitting in diversity is to say, well, look, it first looks like there's a direct conflict between 41(b) and State law, because 41(b) says these are all dismissals on the merits, but State law is to the contrary, and I have this otherwise-specifies clause, so I can make an exception, so I could in the sense of Gasperini make an exception where there's a contrary State law."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

That's the problem with -- your out is, this district judge should have otherwise specified, go up to the Ninth Circuit."

    {
      "speaker": "DELLINGER",
      "speech": "I appreciate the distinction, but it's important to remember that any argument you have with what Judge Collins should have done in the Federal district court is an argument that should have been made before her and taken up on the court of appeals, so that if in the future you wanted to tell district judges that they always had to defer to State statute of limitations the way to do that is on direct review of a diversity case. There's a certain oddness here, if you think about it, that we're talking about Erie and Hannah and Federal diversity cases on review of a State court judgment dealing with a matter of State law, because the -- it's just as if Judge -- suppose Judge Collins had said that she was going to decide this case, clearly erroneously, as a matter of Federal common law business torts, and they didn't appeal it to the Ninth Circuit, they didn't seek cert from that. Even though that would be clearly erroneous under Erie, they're bound by that and can't second-guess it. Now, I never got the question of the Federal interest here. You could have a litigant that's got a troublesome statute of limitations claim, because it involves possible concealment, possible latent defects, nondisclosure. They could say, look, we could bring this in Federal court in California. We can try it for 3 years, and if we lose on the statute of limitations grounds we'll have a very good practice opportunity, because it won't preclude us at all from bringing the very same case in some other State."

Don't we normally use State law to determine the meaning of that piece of paper called the judgment, which came out of diversity after litigation, or do we? I'm not positive. And then, of course, I'm thinking if we do, shouldn't we get to the same result here?"

Their best point under the Rules Enabling Act, which has troubled Justice Scalia in his questions, is that this is a -- all of a sudden we're making Rule 41(b) into a whole Federal law of preclusion. No, we're not. We're only saying it resolves one of the issues of preclusion. It doesn't reach all those other issues. For example, you have to establish a final judgment on the merits between the same parties involving the same claims. The only issue that 41(b) addresses is whether that first judgment was, in fact, on the merits. It's not a rule of mutuality. It's not a rule of all of these other things. There are a lot of preclusion issues where you would look to State law, and that's a possible outcome, some of which this Court hasn't resolved, but those are not issues with respect to which there is a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure squarely on point."

The fact is that if a dismissal on the basis of the statute of limitations under State law would not prevent the plaintiff from bringing the suit again, and if a Federal court, whether by mistake or not -- whether by mistake or not -- makes a dismissal on the basis of the statute of limitations and says it shall preclude further actions under State law, you're going to allow that to govern. I think that is an alteration of substantive law. Now, it maybe just a tiny bit of substantive law, but I don't see how you can --"

First, I think it must be evident that if respondent is right, every defendant in the 25 to 30 States which still adhere to the traditional preclusion rules is going to remove every possible case it can to Federal court if it thinks there's a time bar question because, by removing it, it will get preclusion unless, and this is now my second point, unless Justice Breyer's solution becomes the solution. Now, I want to make clear we do not believe 41(b) is a preclusion rule, but still I will address the question of whether these problems can get solved that way. For three reasons, I think they can. First, the advisory committee has said it is not the function of the rendering court, the first court, to worry about the res judicata effect of its decisions. That's in the advisory committee notes to Rule 23(c) in 1966, and that is a traditional Hornbook rule. The rendering court doesn't sit around and say, now, let's see what the preclusive effect of my decision will be. Secondly, it would be --"

Not to the court itself, but to the law of the state of the rendition court, that's correct, Your Honor, but you rarely see an opinion in which the opinion ends by saying, and I think this decision ought to have res judicata effect. I mean, it just isn't done, and the rules committee said it's not being done in the Federal rules. Secondly, it would be too complicated. Preclusive of what, as Justice Kennedy asked. Every decision precludes some things. The Court's going to have to write a Hornbook. If it's -- if the argument is, State law isn't preclusive of certain things, Your Honor, you should tailor your order appropriately, the parties are going to sit there and analyze the entire jurisprudence of that State in order to write in what it does preclude and what it does not preclude. It would be an impossible task. And thirdly, it would mean that you would have constant appeals, because districts -- we now have created a whole nother issue to litigate in the rendering court. Parties might not ultimately decide to bring a second lawsuit, but they're got to worry that in case I might I'd sure better get this thing right, and we are going to have endless litigation in that first court, and it will be a Federal court, because we're talking about Rule 41 here.
