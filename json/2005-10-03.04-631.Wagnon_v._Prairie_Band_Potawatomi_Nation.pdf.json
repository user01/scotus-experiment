First, the court of appeals opinion contains this statement, \"An expert on behalf of the tribe reported that basic economic theory teaches that the nation's station cannot charge prices high enough to allow collection of both the Kansas and the nation's fuel taxes.\" The red brief says, on page 8, \"It is undisputed that enforcing the State tax on fuel sold and delivered to the station would effectively nullify the tribal fuel tax.\" Finally, the yellow brief, on page 13, says, \"By selling its fuel at market prices, respondent\" -- the tribe -- \"is making both a profit and collecting a tax.\" My question is, Do we know, from the record, whether the tax that is assessed on the distributor is, in fact, passed through to the tribe so that, in economic effect, the tribe is collecting, via pass-through, the State tax and imposing its own tax and still selling at market prices?"

Now, I don't quite understand how you reconcile those two points that you've just raised. If it's -- if it's something that is economically not possible, how can it -- how is it that it's being done.

      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

That's what it said. When the State levies a tax directly on the tribe or members inside the reservation, no balancing. But then it also said that if the incidence rests on non-Indians, as here, with the distributor here, then there is no categorical bar, than balancing kicks in. So, all Chickasaw dealt with, with the categorical rule, is when the State says the incidence of the tax is on the tribe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "I -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. But the answer is that this is an entirely off- reservation tax on non-Indians. We're -- we submit that there's no balancing necessary in this case unless you're going to involve an -- require States to submit to litigation and engage in balancing every time an off- reservation tax on non-Indians has some downstream economic effect.

      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "But the Kaul case, in the context of deciding whether other retailers there had standing, basically said that there was an economic impact that affected the retailers. The Kaul case specifically referred, Mr. Chief Justice, to the fact that the legislature had -- and this is on page 67 of the Pacific 2nd cite of the Kaul opinion -- the legislature amended the statute -- this is at the bottom of the second column -- or the first column -- to clarify the question where the incidence of taxation falls. The legislature provided that, unless otherwise specified, the incidence of the tax falls on the distributor. Then, Mr. Chief Justice, the court went on to evaluate the standing question and allowed the distributors the -- to raise the issue, because the economic burden did come through the distributors. It's important, in that context, to note that the ultimate burden of any of these taxes is not falling on the retailer, it's falling on the consumer. It's falling on the consumer of the gasoline. The consumer puts the gasoline in the car, and then the car is driven overwhelmingly -- the facts are unquestionable in this case -- overwhelmingly on the highways of the State of Kansas.

So, this court thought that might be significant. Kansas, in part, I think, want to make -- wanted to make it very clear that the -- what was happening in the economic chain is cost of production of gasoline, including tax paid by the distributor, could be passed on in the form of cost of business to the retailer.

The only liability for the tax is on the distributor. The relationship is between the State of Kansas and the distributor.

The legal incidence of the tax, as I read this court's opinions, are -- is, it is exactly what it is here, the distributor must pay for the tax, the distributor must account for the tax, the distributor is liable and may be penalized if the tax is not paid. Nobody else is liable for it. The distributor has to pay the tax even if it doesn't sell the gasoline. Here, not only the language is as clear as it could be -- I mean, the legislature specifically says it -- but the operation of the statute -- and the two -- the -- twice, the tenth circuit considered this -- the tenth circuit decided the legal incidence of the tax was on the distributor. The two district courts that decided it before those two tenth circuit decisions, decided that the legal incidence was on the distributor. The facts support that the legal incidence is on the distributor. And respondents, on page 16 of the respondent's brief, it seems to me, acknowledge precisely that.

There are X number of distributors. You can imagine how many times X there might be retailers and how many different disputes and so forth. The point -- one of the points that this Court has repeated made in connection with tax cases, and inter- sovereign immunity issues with respect to tax cases, is vitally important that there be certainty, predictability, and some understanding of fixed events with respect to taxation. States can't be engaged in litigation constantly, depending upon how many casino customers were here, how many people bought this gasoline, how many people bought that gasoline the next month, and how much did the tribe charge for the gasoline on its reservation. That kind of balancing process makes no sense whatsoever, and it -- and it sentences the States to litigation, and this Court to repeated decisions, based upon specific facts. That's why, we submit, that although the balancing is overwhelmingly in favor of the State, because it's a tax for gas that will enable someone to drive on roads that the State has to pay for, that, in this situation, one balancing test makes little sense.

It said the legislature amended the legislation to clarify where the incidence of taxation falls. It provided that the incidence of the tax falls on the distributor. Then, in Victa, in connection with the standing issue, because economic burden fell on the retailers, it found that the retailers and -- those other retailers had standing. Kansas could not have been more clear. In Section 3401(f)(3), it defines a \"distributor\" as someone who receives the product. In 3408(c), it's -- taxes the distributor on the first receipt of the tax. In 3410, it again says it's on the distributor. Two district courts and two courts of appeals found that the legal incidence of the tax was on the distributor. The Kansas Supreme Court said the same thing, the distributor is liable for the tax, pays the tax. The retailer has no liability for the tax. What in the world can Kansas do to make it clearer? Now, the Central Machinery case that's -- that my opponents have been speaking about is a case that was decided under the Indian Trader Statutes with respect to the trading with the Indians, with respect to Central Machinery case, was -- over tractors sold on the reservation for use on the reservation. It fell within the scope of the Indian Trader Statute. But this Court has made clear, in a number of cases, the Indian Trader Statutes would not remotely apply."

In answer to your question, Justice Stevens, Would those other exemptions, the United States Government be required by the Constitution, or the other States? No, not under this Court's decision in the Blaze case, which, as I understood it, was unanimous. The Fresno case, U.S. vs. New Mexico, it's not a tax on the United States. It's -- or an agency of the United States. So they wouldn't be required. But they make sense, because the sales to other States are for people that drive on other States' highways. The sales to the United States Government is an exchange for almost the same amount of money that comes back. So, there's a rational purpose. It's not discrimination. The tribe makes the point that it's generating real value and reservation value. This is fuel that's used in cars that are -- drive all over the State of Kansas. The casino is there, so people come to the casino. And, under Cabazon, there might be some value added by the casino, which, by the way, is an exempt value created by an exemption from regulation. But the value for someone who puts fuel in their car is so that that car will then drive. And that -- cars that drive, in this case, drive on Kansas highways. This, ultimately is -­"
