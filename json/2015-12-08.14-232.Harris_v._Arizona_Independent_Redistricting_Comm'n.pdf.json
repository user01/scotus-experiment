Here, the Arizona Redistricting Commission malapportioned Arizona State legislature by almost 10 percent, 8.8 percent, and the district court below found it did so for two reasons. The first reason was to obtain a partisan advantage for the Democrat party. The second reason was a perceived belief that malapportioned districts were necessary to obtain Justice Department preclearance approval. Neither of these reasons justifies a deviation from the constitutional principle of one person, one vote."

And I think the numbers are, in total, Republicans won 56.6 percent of the State Senate seats, 60 percent of the State House seats.

But just fundamentally, the Voting Rights Act, even prior to Shelby County, could not compel a redistricting authority to under­populate districts. So the advice they had been given, you must under­populate these ten districts in order to obtain preclearance was flawed as a matter of legal advice that doesn't justify malapportionment. So they could have achieved as, in fact, their own expert, Dr. King, said. In the first map ­­ they had two maps. They had a draft map and a final map.

May it please the Court: Fortunately or unfortunately, in this case there are many facts that are not in dispute, addressing Justice Kennedy's questions. The State does not dispute that the Independent Redistricting Commission did indeed draw districts of unequal population. All sides agree that these deviations were not random, or that they were not incidental. We also know, and the record shows and no one disagrees, that this pattern to under­populate minority districts was done to help create or further ability to elect districts. And we also know that the direct evidence is they did it intentionally. So why are we here today? In the background versus Reynolds v. Sims, this Court has always held that equal protection is not a criteria ­­ another factor when it comes to redistricting, but it is essentially the background in which all redistricting ledges take place. The State of Arizona and the Secretary do not dispute the compliance with the Voting Rights Act was a legitimate or is a legitimate State interest. And we don't dispute that maybe there was an ­­ a good motive on the part of drawing these districts. The problem is those motives don't matter when what you have is an undermining of the fundamental principle of one­person, one­vote. So in this case, what we have is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, because by intentionally and systemically under­populating those minority ability­to­elect districts, the IRC violated Equal Protection Clause in that principle of one­person, one­vote. So essentially what happened was by overpopulating the other districts, the voters in the overpopulated districts had their votes diluted.

      "speech": "But this Court has said, over and over again, we want to give States leeway in this area, because representation is often better if you give them some chance to make districts within the 10 percent band. And if you allow them to do what's ­­ what's being suggested here, to accuse ­­ to bring partisanship in and they can get to Federal court and they can get to trial just by that, then exactly what you said is going to happen in ­­ in your dissent in Larios. Every ­­ everybody with a ­­ with a political motivation to try to do something to undercut a map is going to come in. It's easy enough to ­­ to allege partisanship. Here the ­­ all ­­ the only evidence they have of partisanship, leaving aside the little story of District 8, is simply the pattern, that the Hispanic districts they under­populated and the Native American district happened to vote Democratic. So you have this pattern. The chart on ­­ they point to on page 112a, but that's not evidence. It's equally consistent with what the court found happened, which is they wanted to make these districts more persuasive as ability­to­elect districts so they could get preclearance. And voila, they got preclearance. This is a ­­ this is a case where you wonder: Where's the beef? What exactly are we here for? There's no problem with this map. It's not a partisan gerrymander. It's not a racial gerrymander. It's within the 10 percent boundary. They ­­ they did everything in open. Everything that ­­ that's being complained about here, all of this under­population of these districts that was done at the ­­ was done unanimously by all five commissioners who adopted the goal of getting preclearance, who adopted the ­­ the ­­ the idea that they had to get 10 districts, not eight districts, that every single change to those 10 districts that increased their under­population was unanimously voted by all five commissioners. This is a case where there is simply nothing seriously being argued here that could possibly amount to a constitutional violation. And it seems to me that we can talk about whether a pure partisan case ought to, by itself, if the only ­­ if the only problem is deviation, to be unconstitutional, I would recommend that you not do that for the reasons you said in your dissent in Larios. But, boy, this ­­ this case is so far from that. I mean, the Republican commissioner ­­ appointed commissioners are voting for everything that they're complaining about because they, too, want to get preclearance. The State of Arizona wants very much to have its map go into effect for the first time since the 1960s when it became covered by the Voting Rights Act, rather than having a Federal court have to put the map into effect because preclearance was denied. And they ­­ they hire lawyers who worked in the Justice Department, told them how many districts they needed, told them that if necessary in rejiggering these lines, they could go down ­­ up to the 10 percent limit. They then tried very hard to minimize that. And one of the things that's important to recognize here is you could have probably equalized the population here and still gotten districts to the same level of Hispanic population, but you would have had to draw tentacles of the kind that the Court has many times criticized. There's lots and lots of other Hispanic people in the State of Arizona who are not in these districts, but that's because they're spread out all over the place. And so if you're going to draw compact districts, if you're going to draw districts that respect county boundaries, if you're going ­­ and census tracts and communities of interests, something has to give. And what gave here was this modest, tiny, small amount of population variation that seems to me just not a serious candidate for any kind of constitutional invalidation on the facts of this case, which aren't even challenged here, is clearly erroneous. If the Court has no further questions, thank you."

This Court has made very clear that when State districting plans are within the 10 percent deviation, total deviation from a perfect population equality standard, those plans are presumed to be constitutional. Now, that presumption is a substantive rule that serves three important principles. Just if I can briefly tick them off, the first is that such de minimis deviations do not by themselves violate equal protection. The second is that giving States a 10 percent leeway actually enhances citizens' fair and equal representation by allowing States to pursue other important districting principles. And the third is that limiting Federal court intervention in de minimis deviation cases protects State's sovereign right to draw districts for their own legislature."
