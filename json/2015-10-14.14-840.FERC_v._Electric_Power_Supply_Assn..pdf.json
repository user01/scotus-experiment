      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Power Act expressly authorizes FERC to regulate the process that sets wholesale rates for electricity, and that is exactly what FERC's wholesale demand response rules do. Demand response is a resource that is bid into the wholesale auction, and the wholesale market operators that run those actions rely on the bids to balance wholesale supply and demand, to set wholesale rates, and they particularly rely on those bids in periods of peak demand to avoid price spikes and to avoid blackouts and brownouts."

      "speech": "If there were a student in Economics I, it seems to me that he would conclude and his professor would conclude that wholesale affects retail, retail affects wholesale, they're interlinked, which means you win the case, except that the statute makes the distinction. We have to make a distinction. Can you tell us what the distinction is that marks the end of the Federal power and the beginning of local power?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VERRILLI",
      "speech": "So I ­­ I have several answers to that, Justice Kennedy. First, we completely agree that what ­­ any action that FERC takes at the wholesale level in some sense is going to affect the retail market. All things equal, if FERC sets ­­ FERC will set a higher wholesale rate, there is going to be a higher retail price. But that can't be a basis ­­ those kinds of effects can't be a basis, for denying FERC's jurisdiction. And the case I would particularly point Your Honor to is the Mississippi Power case. Now, there was a case in which what FERC did was conclude that a utility could recover at wholesale its investment in a nuclear power plant. And what the Court held in Mississippi Power was that that had the effect of denying the State regulator the ability to deny that utility recovery of those costs in the retail rates, even though under State law they would have been imprudent costs and not recoverable. That was a very direct effect on the exercise of State regulatory jurisdiction, which you do not have here, by the way, so I think a fortiori, this is certainly permissible under the rationale of Mississippi Power."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "I find that a pretty fuzzy line, \"very direct effect.\" I ­­ it seems to me that there is a distinction between affecting retail rates, which, as Justice Kennedy has pointed out, always happens, and using ­­ using effect upon retail rates as a means of regulating wholesale rates. And the argument here is that that is what has occurred, that effectively, FERC has raised the retail price during peak hours because somebody who wants to purchase at retail during peak hours not only pays ­­ you know, has to forgo the benefit that that person would otherwise get from FERC's program. That raises the price at retail, and that is the means of achieving what FERC wants to achieve. Yes, FERC has the ­­ has the power to regulate wholesale rates. But ­­ but, the argument is, not through the fiddling around with retail rates, which is what is asserted is happening here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VERRILLI",
      "speech": "So ­­ I think three points to be made in response to that argument, Justice Scalia. First, the ­­ the authority that's exclusively reserved to States by Section 824(b) of ­­ of the Federal Power Act is the authority over retail sales. Every retail sale that occurs in the regime in the ­­ in FERC's ­­ under FERC's wholesale demand response regime is a retail sale that will occur at the rate that the State regulator has set, and under the terms and conditions that the State regulator has set, every single sale that occurs that is true about. Second, what they have said is that this changes the effective rate. But what I would say in response to that, Your Honor, is that if I go out and buy a Ferrari for $100,000, everybody thinks that the price of the Ferrari is $100,000. Nobody thinks that the price of the Ferrari is actually $107,000 because I'm foregoing the $7,000 tax credit I can get if I bought an electric car. The rate is what it is. It's $100,000. And here, the rate is what it is. And third, the point I would make, it seems to me, it's a very odd argument to say that what FERC's rules do here is increase the retail price. What FERC's rules do is drive the retail price down by driving the wholesale price down by very considerable amounts in peak periods. This is ­­ this is a system that results in lower rates for retail consumption."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "But it's still based on direct price regulation of the retail rate. It may be the same point as your Ferrari hypothetical, but if ­­ if FERC is basically standing outside McDonald's and saying, we'll give you $5 not to go in, and the price of the hamburger is $3, somebody goes up there, there ­­ the price of a hamburger is actually, I think most economists would say, $8, because they give up the $5, they've still got to pay the $3. And your answer is, there's no impact on what the States can do, because they can still say, no, the price of the hamburger should be $2, or it should be $4. The point is that ­­ that FERC is directly affecting the retail price."

But ultimately it remains up to the States because FERC takes State law as it finds it here, whether citizens of the State can go into the wholesale market.

And that's all FERC has done here. It seems to me quite clear that that is, under the logic of New York v. FERC, permissible exercise of ­­ of FERC's authority. And so in a situation, it seems to me, in which what you've got is FERC taking State law as it finds it, you really can't say that this is a impermissible interference or a power grab or any intrusion into State authority because the States ultimately make the decision. I ­­ in fact, I think the Federalism argument is upside down here. This is a situation in which what you have is a FERC rule that really is a strong version of cooperative Federalism.

And what the statute says, in Section 824(e), is that FERC has authority over practices that affect rates in ­­ wholesale rates.

And we're quite comfortable with the Court drawing a line that would exclude the kinds of examples ­­ the hypotheticals that the D.C.

And ­­ but I think the way that you have to think about it is in terms of the actual market that operates in this particular case, which is a wholesale market. It's not a market that covers the entire United States. It covers less than half the States. But it is an important market that was created in order to create a basis for competition. And up to this point, up prior to the demand response initiative that was not adopted by FERC, but was, in fact, pushed by my clients and those we represent in private business, what we were trying to do was to create a demand­side component to that wholesale market. Because trying to regulate exclusively or trying to ­­ to deal exclusively with the supply side wouldn't work, or it's not as effective as it could be, or certainly wouldn't necessarily guarantee you just and reasonable rates. And so tariffs were filed in order to provide a basis for putting in the demand side. And the reason why this is a direct effect on the ­­ on the wholesale rates is because it's an absolute one­to­one relationship. If I put in a unit of ­­ of or reduce a unit of demand, I don't need as much supply, and that affects the price directly. And that's the direct relationship that derives from the economic principles. And ­­ and to my mind, the entirety of ­­ of the Federal Power Act, in 201, 204, 205, asks you in the first instance to look at the wholesale market that exists. And then once you do that, then is this ­­ you know, it's not: Does it affect the retail rate? Clearly it will. The question is: Did what FERC do here in the order directly affect the wholesale rate?

So the vast majority of the people that I represent are load­serving entities who are not exclusively on the supply side.

So that's who I represent. Now what I'd like to start, beyond telling you who I represent, is with the notion of what FERC was trying to do here, which was to reduce retail demand by providing payments to retail customers on an otherwise wholesale market in an effort to change the effective price for retail sales.

Every reduction in demand for a unit of retail electricity is ipso facto a demand for a reduction of a unit of wholesale electricity, and vice versa. So it's hardly surprising that anything they do in the wholesale market that adds to demand will add to demand in retail, and vice versa. But I thought that their motivation here is the following: On the 4th of August at 4:00 p.m., people turn on electricity for air­conditioning. That's the peak hour. The industry, leaving reserves out of this as a fixed matter, has to supply that. So if there are not enough generators at 4:00 p.m. on August the 4th, they have to build one. And to build an additional generator ­­ I don't know what gas costs now, but let's imagine it's $500,000, and that will be passed on in the wholesale price, and then probably, though the States are free to do what they want, in the retail price. So FERC thinks I have another way of doing this. For only $400,000, I can be sure that on the 4th of August at 4:00 p.m., the demand is not great enough to spend the 500, and so we group the people who will promise to fulfill their air­conditioning at other times. That way, the price of wholesale electricity falls. And, therefore, we satisfy all demand at a lower price. We are interested in wholesale. We are interested in how to satisfy peak wholesale demand. And we have worked out a way to do it cheaper. Of course it affects retail prices, so does everything we do in respect to wholesale prices. End of the matter. So I accept your characterization, but I do not see any law that prevents them from raising or lowering wholesale price despite the fact that that affects retail price."

The only ­­ the saving grace for them is, ah, but we're limiting ourselves to the wholesale market, and we're the wholesale regulator. So why shouldn't we do it? Here's the problem: These retail customers don't belong on the wholesale market. Whether you think they were lured in or you think they walked in the door, it doesn't matter. They are on a market where they don't belong. The fact that they are regulating in this context and this context alone, retail customers directly, is a profound signal that they've overstepped their jurisdictional bounds. And I think the way you can understand why the fact that they're on the wholesale market is not a complete answer is to consider the following scenario, which doesn't seem all that farfetched, which is to say a large retail consumer of electricity, let's call it Wal­Mart, decides, you know what, I like the prices on the wholesale market better, and I buy more electricity than a lot of load­serving entities in small jurisdictions. So I'm going to walk on to the wholesale market run by an ITO or an ITO, and I'm going to buy electricity for my own consumption at a better price. If they did that, I don't think there is any question that that would be a retail sale that could only be regulated by the States. And if that actually happened, then the RTOs and ISOs would have to make a choice. They would either open themselves up to regulation simultaneously by FERC and the States for that retail transaction, or they would do what I think they probably would do, which is, one regulator is plenty.

Another thing that is a complete anomaly that FERC has created here that, as far as I'm aware, exists nowhere else in the energy world, is you actually have the Federal government and the Federal regulators and the State regulators bidding against each other for the same customers to reduce their same retail demand. And the other side has made a very big deal that none of the States raised a jurisdictional objection before FERC itself. But there were a number of States, Ohio, Illinois, and all of the States that are participants in the MISO, one of the ISOs. And what they told FERC is, by all means, do not set the compensation level at LMP, because that's too high. And by setting it so high, what you are going to do is you're going to crowd out our own efforts at dealing with demand response. Because we love demand response. We want demand response. But we don't want to pay twice as much as the market really should pay for demand response. And if you're out there offering our same retail customers the ability to get demand response paid at huge LMP levels, then we're going to be crowded out. Now, the only response that FERC can offer to that is, well, then just opt­out, come on, you know. First of all, that's the third anomaly here, because there's no other area of regulatory authority where FERC allows States to opt­out. And if you think about what they're opting out and compare it to their legal theory, it doesn't work. I mean, since when is FERC all of a sudden enthusiastic about State experimentations with practices that directly affect wholesale rates? In every other context where they actually have jurisdiction, wholesale rates, transmission, not only would they not allow State opt­outs, but they would say it's going to lead to discrimination in a way that would be unjust and unreasonable. So the opt­out option here, though, doesn't work for another reason, which is it's worse for the States that most want to provide for demand response. Because what they're being told is, all right, you have a subset of your customers who are actually interested in demand response. And if you want to opt­out, what you have to tell your customers who are interested in demand response is we're actually going to pass a regulation that restricts you, and you can't go into the Federal market and get a better rate ­­"

I guess that FERC could not, in fact, insist upon a marginal capacity being generated from natural gas instead of from other things, because that will affect the price of natural gas, will affect the wholesale rate, thereby raising the retail rate, thereby stealing customers away from, let's say, Ohio, where it goes up, and forcing them to go to Texas.

And I believe that this is impermissibly on the retail side of the line. I think my friends on the other side ultimately think that the difference isn't between retail and wholesale but is between sales and nonsales, because they appear to concede my Wal­Mart example in the retail world. Which is to say, on page 39 of the SG's brief, I think they pretty much concede that Wal­Mart cannot walk on to a wholesale market and purchase gas at retail without coming into the scope of the State regulators. I think they also concede that, if the government's interest here was not to suppress retail demand but to increase it, they thought, you know, if we could just sort of boost retail demand a little bit, we'd get a whole bunch of these new green resources online and it would actually make, you know, everything better. So we want to increase retail demand. So here's what we're going to do: We're going to have either directly or through the wholesale operators ­­ we're going to pay a bonus to people who increase their retail purchases. That, I believe, my friends on the other side say, well, no FERC couldn't do that because that would affect a fully­consummated sale. So their position seems to be although we can pay ­­ we can't pay incentive payments to increase retail demand, we can pay incentive payments to reduce retail demand. Two observations about that: One is, why in the world would that make sense? I mean, why in the world would ­­ would Congress have divided the authority here in a way that allows the Federal government to suppress retail demand but not increase retail demand? The second thing that I want to say about that anomaly, though, is the line between sales and nonsales can't be the right line because it ­­ if it is, then not only can they do what Justice Scalia suggested, which is have FERC pay a direct bounty not to purchase. And I was actually quite surprised by the Solicitor General's answer to that. And he ­­ and he didn't fully complete the answer. He said that would be a harder case, but he didn't ultimately say how that would be answered. I think he has to say that, if FERC sort of cut out the wholesale operators and just said, we got a new appropriation, and every retail customer that reduces their retail consumption gets a $200 check from FERC, that has to be consistent with their position that FERC can do it because it doesn't interfere with a fully consummated sale. But we're still ­­ if they're right, then what FERC can do tomorrow is solve this problem much more directly. They can say, retail customers, you cannot buy at peak times. You simply can't. We're not going to allow it. Because that's going to reduce the ­­ the ­­ the wholesale demand. It's going to avoid brownouts. It's going to take all the pressure off our grid. So that's it.

And I think it's important to recognize that you really have to wrestle upfront with the 201(b) question because the other side loves to talk about 205 and 206 in the practices affecting language. But the problem with that is that 201(b) specifically says that the provisions of this subchapter, which include 205 and 206, shall apply to sales for wholesales and shall not apply to all other sales.

They can do demand response, true wholesale demand response, which they were actually doing before they went down this route and around, you know, the ­­ the two ­­ early 2000s. And the way that wholesale demand response works is the way you sort of naturally think it would work, which is through a participant in the wholesale market, namely through the load­serving entities who are mostly my clients. Because the way you can sort of do this is you work cooperatively with the States and the LSEs, and you encourage them, as Congress suggested in 1252(e) of the ­­ of the National Policy Act or the Energy Policy Act. You encourage them to do all sorts of things to reduce their demand, and then there's just less demand bid in to the auction in the first place. And so supply meets demand at a much lower level. Just for completeness sake, you can also have wholesale participants participate in a demand/response program in the forward­capacity markets, where, again, it would be the LSEs. And what they would do is say, we're going to ­­ we're going to ­­ three years hence, we're going to reduce our compensation ­­ or our ­­ our consumption by this level, and we're going to do it on the local level. And just to further complete that thought, you know, it's ­­ it's nice to talk that FERC has been doing this since 2000, but the States have been doing this long before that, at least since the 1980s. And there is a brief for other respondents that I don't represent, the Midwest load­serving entities. And it's worth a ­­ it's a short brief, but it's worth a quick read because what they say is, look, we've been doing this at the State level since 1984. We're a local utility. We work with our local regulator. Because we have plenary authority over the retail market, we can deal with demand response in all sorts of ways that FERC could never imagine. And we can do things like basically go in and get a local customer to agree with us to change the way ­­ their thermostat. We can go in, send somebody in, put different hardware in there, and then, based on a reduction in their retail rates, we can get them to agree that basically, on a hot day in the summer, we get to take over your thermostat. And we directly impose demand response through that. And that's the kind of thing that States have been doing since the '80s.

And the point I was making about the Southern company brief is operating in an area without ISOs, without RTOs, so without FERC, they actually have a greater level of demand response than other parts of the country that have the Federal rule. So to bring us to the arbitrary and capriciousness question, I think, Justice Kennedy, the way I think about it is that we have both procedural objections and substantive objections. The procedural objections are essentially that there are all sorts of objections to using LMP as the price to provide compensation. That wasn't just my clients. That was also the States that I alluded to who were worried that this high level of compensation would crowd out their effort. It was a particularly poignant comment from the ­­ the ­­ some of the ITOs and RTOs who design these ­­ run these wholesale markets. And the ones that I thought were most persuasive in some respects was the operators of the MISO, the midwestern one, because at FERC's direction, they basically spent two years trying to come up with ­­ get all the stakeholders in a room and come up with a formulation ­­ a compensation formula that worked. And what they came up with was essentially LMP minus G. And after having spent two years with all the stakeholders coming up with LMP minus G, they were then told by the Federal government at a late breaking hour that there was a one­size­fits­all solution, and it was LMP."

The whole formula is built on the idea that there is an ­­ an equivalence between less demand and more actual supply of energy. But of course, when you get to the nitty­gritty of it, it turns out that's not true, because the great thing about actual supply of energy is that other wholesale ­­ real wholesale customers buy it, and then the market clears naturally. But when you start getting a third­party in there, a retail customer who really doesn't belong there and start saying, we're going to pay you money, but that money doesn't actually result in load that ­­ a load­serving entity pays for, that creates a deficit in the wholesale account."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEMENT",
      "speech": "Yes. And yet, it's ­­ the market really can't take care of it because the market's designed to simply get a bunch of wholesale sellers and a bunch of wholesale buyers together, and the price of the sales and the price of the purchases equal each other out, and everybody goes home happy. But when you invite retail customers on and say, guess what, we're going to pay you not to buy, that creates a market imbalance. The FERC euphemistically refers to this is the billing unit effect. And then they have to solve that by making adjustments to the market clearing price. And then to make sure they don't go too far down, they apply the net benefits test, which is not only mind­bogglingly complex, but FERC itself recognizes that it's imperfect. The last thing I want to say, though, about sort of the substantive unreasonableness about this is there is a more fundamental problem here, and it's ­­ I think the economist's brief on our side gets at this very well, which is at the end of the day, if FERC gets to do this on the wholesale markets, what is being purchased is not energy, actual energy that's been bought and then sold. What is being sold is an option to buy electricity at a subsidized retail rate. And in any other market ­­ I mean, think of a stock where I have an option to buy it at 20 and the market price is 40. Lots and lots of people are going to offer me 20, 19 for that option because I have a valuable right to buy something at a below­market price. But nobody is going to offer me 40 for the option to buy at 20 just because the market price is at 40. But that is exactly what FERC has done by setting the compensation rate at LMP. And they made mincemeat out of poor Dr. Kahn, because what Dr. Kahn really says is that the market signal that the customer ought to get is LMP. But the market signal they get is LMP if it accounts for avoided costs. If you take the avoided costs out of the question, then you get LMP plus the retail costs. And of course, another irony here is the distortion is greatest in those markets where the States have done exactly what FERC would like, which is adopt retail price ­­ real time pricing, because then the retail price is LMP. And so what is the compensation rate for demand response providers? It's twice LMP."

    {
      "speaker": "VERRILLI",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice: Starting on the jurisdictional issue with text, my friend pointed to Section 824(b), which you can find at 1(a) of the appendix to our brief. What it says is not that FERC shall have jurisdiction over sales of electricity at wholesale. It says the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to sales of electricity at wholesale. One of those provisions is 824(e)(a), which says FERC shall have jurisdiction over practices affecting wholesale rates. So we're within the plain terms of the statute, and there is no statutory text that plainly forecloses FERC's exercise of jurisdiction. And my friend, in 30 minutes, didn't even try to identify one. So in terms of applying Chevron, there's no doubt that ­­ that FERC's interpretation has to be upheld. With respect to the Wal­Mart example that my friend identifies, I think it shows why his argument about hermetically­sealed­off retail and wholesale spheres really has nothing to do with the real world. In the real world today, large customers can buy directly. They can do it through contract, and they can also go into the wholesale market auctions and buy, if their States permit it, and that does happen in the real world. And this is really no different because demand response entities that want to come in and participate can only do so if their State law allows them to do so. So it's no different than what's been going on in the real world for quite a long time. Third, with respect to the load­serving entities, the ­­ the utilities, my friend says, well, don't worry about it; they'll do all the demand response. It will work great. FERC addressed that. It addressed it directly. It found that load­serving entities don't have sufficient incentives to engage in demand response. And it's obvious why they don't, because they cannibalize their own profits. The higher cost they have, the higher their rate of return profits are going to be generated. They will do it under commands from State regulatory agencies to do it, but they'll do it grudgingly. And what FERC said is you want people to come in who have a real profit motive to do it, and that'll incent the LSEs to get in there and try to get a piece of the action rather than letting it go to somebody else. But FERC addressed that issue specifically. Now, the idea that demand response can't work, the State­level demand response, retail demand response can't work where wholesale demand response is operating, you know, again, the real world just contradicts that. We have 24 States in which this is going on. And if this were a problem, you'd expect to see in this administrative proceeding some evidence that it was a problem, and there is zero evidence. You look at all these briefs; there isn't a citation to anything in the administrative record that suggests that the Federal and State programs can't work in harmony. And FERC made a finding that they can work in harmony. Now, with respect ­­ just one point on arbitrary and capricious, and I'd like to sum up. I think if you're going to look at one thing in terms of the concern you've raised, Justice Kennedy, I would look at page 223 of the Appendix to the petition ­­ of our petition, and what you will see right there is FERC directly identifying the problem that my friend spent the last few minutes of his argument on, and then going on to say ­­ and then going on to explain in great detail for several pages why that critique is wrong, and citing in particular the paragraph of Dr. Khan's declaration where Dr. Khan is responding to the specific critiques that my friend made. So it ­­ it certainly meets the threshold test of ­­ of ­­ of an adequate explanation for a decision. Now, if I could sum up, I think this is what this case comes down to. On one side of the scale, you've got a practice that saves billion ­­ that has saved billions of dollars in wholesale costs and will save billions of dollars, and it's an effective tool against blackouts and brownouts, and that nobody has shown in the real world does any harm. You have a statutory provision that gives FERC specific authority to regulate this practice. You have no statutory provision precluding it. You have Chevron in case there's any doubt. And you ­­ and you have, really, a strong cooperative Federalism program here in which States have the ­­ States are masters of their own fate. Whether ­­ whether customers in a State participate or not is up to the State. If the State thinks this is not a good policy, the State can say it doesn't operate in our State. On the other side of the scale, what you've got is an argument that all those benefits have to be extinguished, and ­­ and no argument in the record that there was any harm from this program. You have no clear statutory text for bidding FERC from engaging in this regulatory practice. And my friend used the phrase \"one size fits all.\" Well, I ­­ I suggest that really what we've got here on the other side is a faux Federalism argument. Their argument is the one size fits all. There are lots of States out there that want their consumers, want their citizens to participate in this because they think it's good policy and it's completely harmonious with their regulation. But what my friend's argument does is wipe that out and say, no, it's one size fits all, and then what's ­­ and that one size that fits all is that nobody can participate, not even the 24 States that want to do it. Thank you."
