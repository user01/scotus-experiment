This case presents an egregious violation of the law. Coca­Cola's label grossly misleads consumers , as Coke anticipated, but Coke says that it need not answer under the Lanham Act because its label is authorized by FDA regulations. The label is not, in fact, authorized for reasons we explain and with which the United States largely agrees, but even if it were consistent with FDA regulations that would not strip POM of its right to prove a willful Lanham Act violation. Courts are obligated to give full effect to Congressional enactments wherever possible. Here Congress has never precluded or conditioned enforcement of the Lanham Act in food labeling cases, and it is entirely possible, in fact, entirely easy for Coke to comply with both statutory obligations."

In those circumstances, as the government explains, of course a court is going to be required to ascertain what those parallel requirements are, and whether they were or weren’t complied with. But this is a case involving a different statute. Our submission is that it is entirely irrelevant whether or not the Coke label, in any particular, is consistent with a regulation that implements criminal prohibitions by announcing when and under what limited circumstances the FDA will forebear from exercising its criminal and regulatory penalties. Even in that instance, with respect, Your Honor, as this Court explained in Wyeth, misbranding provisions are, in fact, adjudicated by courts even under the FDCA."

The FDA, the misbranding provisions of the FDCA are prohibitions. They are not permissions. And the rules that the FDA has promulgated announce essentially an enforcement forbearance. They don't represent a judgment and the Federal Register provisions that we've cited that accompanied the promulgation of the juice naming regulations make this as clear as day. They do not represent a pronouncement that for all purposes, for all statutes, the name on ­­ the name ascribed to the product is okay. In fact, they say although for purposes of our forbearance under our government enforcement authority, we will allow you to do one or the other ­­ and this is 2919 and 2920 of Federal Register 58, We warn manufacturers that even compliance with this, where there is a small amount of the non­predominant juice name has great capacity to mislead and we encourage ­­ twice in the rulemaking, we encourage manufacturers, nonetheless, to name the juices in the product.

That subsection is not even the subject ­­ it's excluded from the limited preemption provisions of the NLEA. So it certainly wouldn't be preempted. There might be an open question if one of the things that we were challenging in the course of that state lawsuit was the name itself, and the question then would be is this name, in fact, compliant with the FDA regulation? Now, we've explained in our brief that there are three reasons why it is not compliant. And the United States agrees that a remand would be appropriate in any case to determine whether it is compliant. But generally speaking, our state law claim wouldn't be preempted at all.

Under the FDCA, we have an authoritative interpretation of that language by the FDA. 102.33 is a regulation that was reached after extensive rule­making proceedings over the course of 25 years. The FDA considered the exact same question that is being raised here.

And, in fact, that was the purpose of the very regulation at issue here, the idea being by allowing manufacturers to choose to name their juice product based on the juice that flavors the product as opposed to based on the juice that is predominant by volume, that consumers will come to understand that when a juice says pomegranate and blueberry flavored, what it means is that the juice is present as a flavor."

It had ­­ it simply was a judgment about whether the specific forbearance regulations that they promulgated, in fact, adequately accomplished what Congress's objectives were. Number two, we ­­ we are not saying that this is a misbranded product. We are not trying to enforce the FDCA. And the FD ­­ and the FDA itself has made clear, not only in its brief in this case and not only in its enforcement action in the Nestle case, but in the Federal Register discussion of the juice naming regulation, that the fact that the juice may comply ­­ and here it probably doesn't ­­ may comply with the naming convention does not mean that it is misleading. The FDA said over and over again in that rulemaking that we strongly caution manufacturers that, in fact, mere compliance with this does not mean that the label is misleading and ­­ and that manufacturers are under an obligation to ensure that the label is not misleading.

They wouldn't be precluded if the parallel cognate state law enforcement of an identical standard wouldn't be precluded. This is ­­ the closest cognate here is 343(a), which provides that a food is misbranded if it is false ­­ if the label is false and ­­ false or misleading at any particular. That isn't in this sort of Swiss cheese exception ­­ exemption­filled preemption provision of the NLEA. That one isn't preempted.

Now, Ms. Sullivan says, okay, we're not worried here. The FDA wasn't worried here about health or safety. That's not what's going on here. That is the point. That is the point. It's because there were concerns about health and safety with this juice naming regulation that they said, in the exercise of our sovereign enforcement authority, we are not going to go after you for complying with this naming convention, because, as they've explained, we don't know anything about how to protect competitors. We don't purport to know what is in the competitive marketplace. And we aren't about writing regulations under these criminal provisions. And Ms. Sullivan is right.
