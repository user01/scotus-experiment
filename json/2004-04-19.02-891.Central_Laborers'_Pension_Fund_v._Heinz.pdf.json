      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is an ERISA pension case. The petitioner is a multiemployer pension plan. The respondent plaintiffs are two plan participants. Each accrued a pension and took early retirement at age 39, and each claimed a full pension in the form of a life annuity. At issue in the case is a plan amendment. It authorizes the suspension of retirees' benefit payments during the time that they choose to go back to work as construction supervisors. Before the amendment, suspension was triggered only by work as a construction laborer. The change gives rise to an important, albeit highly technical, question about the relationship between two provisions of ERISA. The question is: may such an amended employment suspension provision apply to previously accrued benefits? The plan says the answer is yes; the participants say the answer is no. The expert agencies charged by Congress with administering ERISA have also spoken to the question. They say that ERISA does authorize such an amendment, and they reached that conclusion by construing the two ERISA provisions in para materia. Countless pension plans around the Nation, in turn, have relied on the agencies' guidance in shaping their plan amendments for decades, and that is the principal reason that the case is so important."

Now he cannot work as a supervisor. How can you -- I mean, certainly if you placed a dollar value on his right to receive money from the plan, you would -- you would put a higher price on -- on the -- the individual who has the right to work as a supervisor and still continue to draw money as opposed to the person who doesn't have that right. I mean, the -- the language just seems to me utterly plain. reason that the IRS has reached the opposite conclusion for decades is threefold, and I will focus on the text because that's where you focus. But just to lay them out, it's going to be the text, the purposes of the suspension provision, which is section 203(a)(3)(B), and what will best protect participants' expectations. You focus rightly on the text. The -- the key is what is a benefit versus what is a suspension of benefit payments. As I said in the introduction, the plan participants here earned a benefit and that is a life annuity in a service only pension. So they were able to retire and they got a life annuity that's available to them."

You have to accrue a benefit and then you vest in the benefit. The accrual is when you've earned the benefit. They earned the benefit. They earned their pension. Then they had to vest in it; that is, though they've earned it, they have what Alessi calls a non-forfeitable right to claim it. And what a suspension provision does it says your benefit still exists. Their benefit is a life annuity. It exists. There is an available stream of payments. There's a stream of payments that is available every single month. That's the accrual rule. Then you have to vest. You have to have a right to claim it, and that's what a suspension provision does."

That is not a benefit within the meaning of ERISA. The benefit is the life annuity. It's a -- this is -- the -­ ERISA is, of course, as you've often said, a highly reticulated statute. There are 3,978 pages of regulations implementing it in about 6-point font. The terms of art are highly, highly technical, and the benefit is the life annuity. It's not just the sense that I like it more. And I can give you an example. Justice, that is reproduced in the yellow brief. I don't think it will be necessary for the Court to track it, but it is at the bottom of 4a and 5a. This is a -- of the yellow brief. And this is a provision under which plans are authorized to change their vesting schedules. And so, take an example. There are two ways you can vest under ERISA. One if over the course of 7 years in individual steps. Another is so-called cliff vesting, and that is, you've got your benefit. You've earned it, but until you've been in service for 5 years, you don't have any legal claim to it notwithstanding that it's out there. Plans under section 203(c) are allowed to change their vesting rules so that if someone had earned 2 years of vesting credit, the plan can, nonetheless, change to a 5-year cliff vesting provision. Now, that's all very complicated, but the bottom line is that it makes it less valuable in the real-world sense for the plan participants."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but that -- that speaks to the future effect of such an amendment, and it -- when you're talking about getting vesting, you can't have a retroactive -- you would not already be vested.

      "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",

If I -- they have a life annuity and I were to say instead of paying you $1,650 a month, I'm going to pay you $1,400 a month, notwithstanding that they haven't vested in it, it still violates the accrual rule. But when you come to the question of the suspension of benefit payments, which throughout ERISA is a different concept than a decrease in benefits, when you come to a suspension -- that is, your -- your claim to the benefit payment each month -- I'm taking that away from you -- that's covered by 1053. And our point is that this plan amendment is -- and the Government agrees -- is authorized by 1053. I had said that I was also going to go beyond the -- move from the text to the purposes underlying the statute and the protection of participants' legitimate expectations. But before doing that, I do want to point to the regulation, Justice Scalia, that addresses our understanding of what it is to decrease, and we contend that the regulation, which is published after notice and is reproduced on page 8a of the yellow brief, and I will just -- it's quoted in our brief as well. And it explains that a decrease in a benefit is something that changes the computation of the benefit. This does not change the computation of the benefit. It's not just a rhetorical device. It is a theme that runs throughout the provisions of ERISA. Briefly, with respect to the purpose of the statute and plan's expectations, the critical point is that the suspension rule cannot work if it -- this is section 203(a)(3)(B), the 1053 provision -- cannot work if it does not apply to already accrued benefits. The point of the statute is to get people to move in and out of the workforce. And if you are not allowed to apply your suspension provision to existing retirees, you cannot influence them in response to current financial conditions, the shape of the construction labor market, the shape of the current trucking market. You have to be able to influence their decision whether or not to work or not to work."

That right is completely in the control of the participants. They can choose not to go back to work or to go back to work. They will receive their benefits. In addition, the plan is only allowed to limit the receipt of the benefit payment during periods of reemployment in the same industry, trade, or craft in the same geographic region only if they work more than 40 hours of -- a month, and a variety of other restrictions. And those showed that Congress was cabining the authority of plans so that they didn't unduly restrict the ability of plan participants to go back to work. But it is, I think, absolutely critical, to return to the point, that 1053(a)(3)(B), the suspension rule, cannot function as Congress intended and that is what the IRS concluded if it does not apply to already accrued benefits. We could not encourage or discourage the plan participants to go back to work or not to go back to work and thus calibrate the pension payments that are provision did not apply to their benefits.

And I think that that is broadly satisfied in this case because what this guarantee, as we've explained, is an annuity and a certain face amount that can never be reduced in face amount. And the only time it is not paid to them is under very narrowly cabined circumstances when they are, by definition, receiving essentially receiving replacement income from the same industry, the same trade or craft in the same geographic area that has funded their pension plan.

So that's not authority by which someone can actually look at an IRS publication and say, this is what we have -- the IRS allows. determinations that they have allowed these in the past, but those are not due deference under -- certainly not under Chevron, probably not even under Skidmore. Those are sort of individual case determinations and they have put none of these in the record.

The union wants to get benefits for its early retirees, and that argues for going back. But the union also wants to reflect -- or protect the wages of the people who are already there. And that means that if there is a recession, what we want to do is stop too many people from going back because that might have a depressing effect on the workers who are there.

Justice Breyer, is that plans -- that -- that unions and the employers want to prevent cross-subsidization. But there's -- while it is certainly the case that, at least according to this plan and its amici, they have started to rely on this purported right to deal with changing market conditions, they have no authority for doing so. The only thing they can point to is one floor statement by Representative Dent after that provision of ERISA, in fact, had been enacted, saying that there might be some change in market conditions which would affect things. Employers can deal with changing market conditions in the traditional ways. They can pay more or less money. And in any event, the thing missing in that approach to 203 is the foundational principle that ERISA is designed to protect participants. It's not designed to protect plans.

There are a couple of things to note about that. The first and foremost is probably that it shows that 203(a)(1)(B), the -- the suspension rule that we're talking about, talks about a plan providing for something. In 203(c), they talk about a plan amending the rules. If they had wanted to talk about an amendment in 203(a)(1)(B), they could have. They -- they talked about terms amending things elsewhere in the same provision. But more fundamentally, Mr. Goldstein is simply wrong that a plan can retroactively de-vest a participant of benefits that had previously vested. Under 203(c)(1)(A), which is on page 4a of the yellow brief, it -- it explains that a plan amendment shall not -- shall be treated as not satisfying 203 if the -- if the amended amount is less than such a non-forfeitable percentage commuted -- computed under the plan without regard to such amendment. So, for example, if a plan participant had earned 20 percent of their -- had a non-forfeitable interest in 20 percent of their accrued benefit and the plan switched from a progression to a -- a cliff vesting, where you got everything in 5 years, they could do that, but they couldn't remove your 20 percent.
