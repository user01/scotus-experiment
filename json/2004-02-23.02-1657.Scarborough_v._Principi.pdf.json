      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1999, Randall Scarborough won his disability appeal before the Veterans Court on the ground that the Government's position constituted clear and unmistakable error and that that position was, quote, not reasonably debatable. End quote. He then immediately filed a fee application under the Equal Access to Justice Act that contained three of the elements called for by the act, but it did not initially allege that the Government's position lacked substantial justification. The Government seized on that alleged omission and without any mention of this Court's path-marking decision in Irwin v. Veterans Affairs, both it and the Federal Circuit determined that this omission of this legal conclusion was jurisdictional, meaning in effect that Mr. Scarborough's amendment to the application could not relate back to his timely filed application. The Federal Circuit and the Government persisted in this view even after this Court remanded in light of Edelman v. Lynchburg College, which embraced the relation­ back doctrine both in a judicial and an administrative law context. The Federal Circuit's fundamental error here, the basic mistake, is that it perceived EAJA's limitations period as jurisdictional. As I said, that holding can't be squared with the decision in Irwin or as reiterated by this Court just two terms ago in Franconia Associates, and that principle is this: unless Congress has provided otherwise, limitations periods that run in favor of the Government like those involving private parties are not jurisdictional, but rather are subject to ordinary statute of limitations principles that provide exceptions under certain circumstances. And so then the question is, what does EAJA say to this? There's nothing in EAJA that even hints that the statute creates the absolute -­"

A lawyer reads a statute, it says, do this, that, and the other, and he doesn't do the other, and then it says, oh, but be equitable, court.

The logical answer to that question is found in the preceding sentence: shall within 30 days submit to the court an application which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award stating the actual time, blah, blah. The party shall also allege. Surely it means where? In that application that is referred to in the preceding sentence.

And they can only be resolved promptly if parties follow the rules that Congress has laid down. We believe that's why Congress set these rules, because they wanted to make sure that attorney claims would be resolved efficiently, and they cannot be resolved efficiently if parties don't play by the rules. Now, the relation-back doctrine is really an exception to the rules that Congress set forward, at least the -- the relation-back doctrine, as the -- as petitioners are suggesting it ought to be applied here. As a general matter, the relation-back doctrine is a principle that's codified in rules, such as rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. And it provides an exception for, in that case, pleadings being amended after the fact. But this isn't a case of initiating civil litigation and this is not a case where rule 15 applies.

With regard to equitable tolling, this Court said in Irwin that equitable tolling will be presumed to apply in those cases involving Government waivers of sovereign immunity where the Government is held liable on the same basis as private parties as in title VII. But as my colloquy with Justice Stevens pointed out, this is not a situation where the United States is being held liable for attorneys fees on the same basis as other parties. That's what section 2412(b) applies -- provides, and perhaps equitable tolling should apply there, perhaps not. That's a different question. Here -­"

Could we say -- and you'll -- could we say that in respect to the 30-day filing requirement, we don't have to decide whether it is absolute or not absolute, subject to equitable defenses of different kinds or not. In respect to the content parts of this, at least the fourth part, it's treated like any statute of limitations, any ordinary statute of limitations, and whatever they're subject to, Judge, you make this one subject to. Now, there you'd meet me with the argument but this is the Government and -- the one we went through. Is there any other reason for not doing it?"

      "speaker": "MINEAR",

It's not simply a formality like a verification or a signature. Rather, we're talking about the threshold allegation that triggers the right for attorneys fees and triggers the obligation of the Government to respond and show that its position was substantially justified. Without that, you really don't have a fee application as Congress conceived of it. When we look at what do we mean by a fee application, we have to look at 2412(d)(1)(B), and Congress indicated what it felt was essential in the fee application. You have to show that you prevailed. You have to show that you're a qualifying party under EAJA. You have to provide your costs, including an itemized list of costs, and you have to make the threshold allegation the Government's position was not substantially justified. Those terms define what a fee application is. And this Court's decision in Jean indicates it all has to be done in that 30-day period. Now, to apply any sort of relation-back doctrine simply negates the very careful, strict rules that Congress imposed on this charge against the treasury."

But in the case of the Social Security Administration, between August 2001 and August 2002, the Government paid 5,500, roughly, EAJA applications in a total amount of $18 million. Now, Social Security is only one small part. I shouldn't say small, but it's a significant part of the EAJA -- qualifying EAJA cases.

So there would be these questions of whether or not whatever criteria the Court decides to create for relation-back were satisfied. And I have to point out the Court is going to be creating all of these rules. As it stands right now, we have a simple 30-day rule. Once we inject relation-back and equitable considerations, then we're at sea in terms of what's necessary to satisfy this requirement."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, that's -- that's true of the doctrine in the first place, isn't it? I mean, we don't get into relation-back because Congress originally passed a statute saying there's going to be relation-back. In every one of these instances I suppose in which there is a relaxation of -- of a stated rule, we got into it because a court recognized it. And -- and it seems to me your argument about the satellite litigation at most means maybe we'll have a half a dozen cases deciding exactly what exceptions to the -- to the literal statement in the statute book there may be, but as -- as against EAJA litigation in which there are at least 500 a year on -- in the courts around the country on Social Security alone, that seems to be rather a -- a minuscule percentage of -- of extra cases."

      "speaker": "WOLFMAN",
      "speech": "I'd like to go immediately to Justice Kennedy's question. He asked about the best case. Well, the case that the Government relies on principally in its brief is Soriano v. the United States. The problem with that case is it was overruled by Irwin, and the problem here is that the principle we're now operating on, the problem with the Government, is that when we talk about statutes of limitations principles, you apply the same principles that apply among private parties unless Congress explicitly provides otherwise. Now, I did want to, if I might, turn to the relation-back doctrine just briefly. And the -- the question arose in Mr. Minear's presentation, well, this case doesn't involve rule 15(c). But either did Edelman v. Lynchburg College. Edelman is best read as a case that applied the common law doctrine of relation-back. The Court held, regardless of the EEOC's regulation, even if we were interpreting the statute from scratch, we would apply the relation doctrine back here because it has a common law pedigree. And that's all we're asking for here. The other principal submission by Mr. Minear is the efficiency argument, that these matters have to be done promptly and efficiently and there's thousands of suits. I have two basic answers to that, the general and the specific. The general is that the -- until the Federal Circuit ruled, this was the rule, the rule that we're asking for, in all of the circuits that had ruled on it. And the Government does not present an iota of evidence there were any problems in applying the relation-back principle in those circuits. It's the Third, the Sixth, and the Eleventh Circuit. The specific answer is I think we know what would have happened in this case if my client's amendment had related back. The matter would have been resolved 3 or 4 years ago. There is no serious efficiency concern here. The reason we're here much later is both because the Government interposed this jurisdictional defense and it asked for seven or eight extensions of time during the course of this litigation. The final thing I would like to say is that the Government's arguments presuppose that there's no good reason for relaxing rules. But there is. We realize that litigants and lawyers make mistakes and rules such as relation-back serve important purposes so that litigants and lawyers don't get tripped up by technical rules such as the one the court -- that the court below and the Government is trying to impose here. If the Court has no questions."
