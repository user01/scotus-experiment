But here there wasn't. Here, there was a claim for benefits only, and you didn't get benefits. That was the circuit's reasoning. So tell me where they erred and how we go back to defining \"some success on the merits\" in light of that position by the circuit?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ATES",
    "speech": "They misread the complaint, Justice Sotomayor. We are claiming a claim for benefits. As part of that claim, we asked for equitable relief for the ERISA violation. The heart of ERISA is the full and fair review process in 1133 of the statute. Because without a full and fair review by the plan administrator, that fiduciary cannot get to the right result. It violated that obligation here. We asked for the benefits, but the district court, instead of awarding the benefits, said in the first -- in the second instance, here's your second bite at the apple; get it right this time. That's success on the merits under ERISA, because they must abide by their fiduciary obligations, and they breached it here. The relief the district court formulated in essence was an equitable-type relief: Do it again. We asked for that in the complaint. We asked for equitable relief."

The relief accorded for that violation was a remand back to the plan administrator to get it right. That's the difference between our case and Hanrahan. In Hanrahan, there was no finding of a violation of law. No one was found to be a legal wrongdoer. We have that here. The fiduciary breached its obligation."

So, in that regard, she has succeeded on the merits by proving a violation regardless of the outcome at the end of the day. Now, here certainly she got the benefits, so we -- we meet even Buckhannon and beyond. But in the case where the district court is sending it back, it must be sending it back for a violation of law, save one instance. The claimant comes forward and says: I have additional evidence that I didn't -- I didn't submit below. I've got an equitable ground to -- to convince the court to, in essence, reopen the record. I want -- I want to send it back. In that instance, fees should not be awarded because it was the claimant's fault in not getting this record -- this record evidence in."

What I was trying to articulate earlier, perhaps inartfully, was that she -- she’s eligible for fees under the five-factor test, but in that instance the district court is not likely to use its discretion to grant fees in that instance. I was not --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, what if you get in Justice Kennedy's situation, where the court doesn't know what's going to happen on remand? You know, the objection is -- the administrator throws it out, saying, you know, you filed the wrong form, so you lose. And the district court says you can't throw it out on that basis; under trust law, it doesn't matter. And it goes back. Now, the district court doesn't know what’s going to happen. Does she get fees or not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ATES",
    "speech": "It -- it depends on what the district court does with it. But she has to prove a violation of ERISA for it to go back. And if she proves that, she’s eligible for fees. And the district court in its discretion can take all these factors into account."

    "speaker": "ATES",
    "speech": "I think the better practice is for the district court to hold the case over and supervise the remand. But if the district court enters judgment at that point, then -- then under Rule 54 or the -- they have to come in and apply for fees within 14 days of that judgment. But this case does not give this Court an opportunity specifically to give the courts, district courts, guidance whether to keep these cases open or not, much like the Social Security cases that happened in the late '80s and early '90s. But to get back to our main point, which is this is not a prevailing party statute, that was the fundamental error by the Fourth Circuit in imposing a prerequisite to determining whether a claimant is entitled to fees. Section 502(g)(1) is not a prevailing party statute for three primary reasons: first, the language and structure of the statute. The words \"prevailing party,\" a term of art that has been used for hundreds of years, is not within section 502(g)(1), but it is in other sections of ERISA. Its statutory sibling, section 502(g)(2), contains a judgment requirement. Another provision of ERISA, 1451(e), uses the terms \"prevailing party.\""

That's enough for fees to issue should the parties not be able to agree on fees as a part of the settlement. It's the judicial act in finding the violation that triggers -- triggers the success on the merits. And this case was on the merits. As we pointed out in our very yellow brief, the district court --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",

Why aren't you successful, if this is a non-ERISA situation, merely for a finding that the district court acted improperly?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ATES",
    "speech": "Because you have to look at the party who is violating. Here it’s the party who’s violating the law. It's a party to the suit who is violating the law. That violation is found in Hanrahan. It's a civil procedure. The district court didn't -- didn't do something right. Here -- and that's not a violation of the -- of law. That's a -- that's a misapplication of a civil -- of a rule of civil procedure. Here we have a violation of law by a party. That's the fundamental difference between us and Hanrahan."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "May I ask -- ask this question? The question here is whether there was eligibility for fees. Could the district judge in your view say, yes, I think the plaintiff is eligible for fees, but it was actually a very difficult legal issue, and the defendant's position was entirely reasonable, so I think as a matter of discretion I will not award any fees?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ATES",
    "speech": "The district court can exercise its discretion and not award fees. I think, however, that the better result is when a violation of law is proven, the plaintiff or in this instance a claimant or beneficiary should be entitled to some amount of fees because the purpose of the statute, explicitly stated in the statute, is to protect beneficiaries and claimants and have access to the Federal courts. If every case is a close case and you’re not giving -- giving fees, then -- these are folks with limited means. These are folks by definition cannot work when they are disabled, and you are eating up their benefit through attorney's fees. And that cannot be the point of the statute when Congress enacted this. It is to protect beneficiaries, to give appropriate -- give appropriate relief and keep open access to the Federal courts. If I can get back to, again, why this is not a prevailing party statute, the language and structure clearly show that. The history and context show it as well. And I'm not talking legislative history. I'm talking about the fact that ERISA supplanted the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act, which required a judgment before fees could issue, but Congress chose to remove that requirement when it originally enacted ERISA. It does not have that judgment language and does not have prevailing party language. Moreover, this Court repeatedly has held that trust law should inform the interpretation of ERISA. Trust law, for hundreds of years, has taken into account these principles that the district courts and courts of appeals have relied on for at least 30 years under ERISA to inform, guide, and limit district courts’ discretion in awarding fees. I’d like to reserve the remainder of my time."

    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court found that Respondent's original decision denying benefits disregarded pertinent medical evidence in violation of ERISA and found that the decision was otherwise unsupported by substantial evidence. Based on those findings, the district court ordered Respondent to make a new benefits determination, after which Respondent finally granted the benefits due. Those facts established Petitioner's eligibility for a fee award under ERISA section 502(g)(1), which authorizes a court to award reasonable attorney's fees, quote, \"in its discretion,\" end quote. That discretion, as per ERISA more generally, is to be exercised in accordance with well-established trust law principles, and those principles quite clearly reject a strict prevailing party standard."

I think if we’re operating under well-established trust law principles, that clearly qualifies as enough success to justify a fee award. And we can look at several of the trust cases cited in both our brief and Petitioner's brief. In re Catell's Estate is discussed in all the briefs. There the plaintiff brought a claim to remove a trustee, and the basis for the claim to remove the trustee was a contention that the trustee wasn't complying with one of the terms of the trust. After he filed the suit -- and this was before even any finding by the judge -- the trustee then complied with that particular term of the trust. And then what the court said was, well, because the trustee complied with the underlying premise or the motivation for your suit, I'm going to deny your claim to have the trustee --"

But we’re far afield from Ruckelshaus here, because we actually have a judicial order, and we’re far afield from the outer limits of the trust -- trust law cases which -- which, for example, In re Catell's Estate, which I just mentioned -- and by no means is In re Catell's Estate an outlier. The Third Circuit's opinion in Dardovitch, which is also cited in our brief, recounts In re Catell's Estate as falling well within the history of trust law cases. Petitioner's reply brief at page 11 cites Grien v. Cavano. That's another case where a plaintiff brought -- brought a claim that a union fund was not complying with accounting and proper bookkeeping procedures. After he filed the suit, they fell in line, adopted the various procedures that plaintiff had sought, and the court still said: Drawing upon trust law principles, we’re going to award fees.

A couple of responses, Justice Kennedy: First, if they didn't retain jurisdiction -- and in the Seventh Circuit, for example, that's one circuit which says that these orders have to be final, and final judgment has to be entered -- then we’re exactly analogous to a sentence 4 Social Security case. And this Court has made it clear in a line of decisions that upon entry of final judgment -- and those are exactly analogous in the sense that what happens is that the court finds that the decision below committed some error in law, it vacates that decision, and then sends it back to the Social Security Administration for a new determination without preordaining the result. Regardless of the result there, at the time of the remand and entry of judgment, that plaintiff is eligible for -- for fees. We think that the same outcome would be controlled here, even if the Court applied its strict prevailing party jurisprudence. Thank you."

Footnote 8 of Ruckelshaus addressed one sentence of legislative history of a different statute, and only so far as the Court pointed out that the sentence was of no use to Sierra Club in that case.

So the court had evaluated the evidence at that point as favoring Hardt. To that extent, it wasn't a purely procedural ruling. It says: As things stand now, Hardt should get fees; but I'm leaving the door  open. So it wasn't just a procedural decision. It was an evaluation of the evidence up to that point, wasn't it?"

There’s no substantial evidence to the contrary. But you, the company, want to take money from her instead of giving her the money. Now, I’ve read the record. It doesn't support anything contrary to what I’ve said. So now you send it back. Now, what is that but a big victory for the other side? Which then leaves the company to say: They're right; pay them. Now, if that isn't -- I mean, what words of English -- if you’re -- we’re talking about partial success. Partial success, or not total defeat. That is the language from Ruckelshaus. Not \"total success.\" You still get it. Okay. What in the English language can we read in a case or a statute that would say you shouldn't reach that commonsense result?

What the district court actually did was deny that motion for summary judgment.

And your adversary says the court found an ERISA violation. Now, the type of relief it grants is up to its discretion.

It's interlocutory; there is no decision; but the only thing that the plaintiff asked for the plaintiff got, that is entitlement to the documents. The court said: You are entitled to the documents. And then it goes back, and the documents are turned over because the court has ordered that. Under your theory, because there was no determination of benefits, even that ruling which was a total victory for the plaintiff doesn't open the door to fees."

So if a plaintiff arrives seeking only documents and the district court awards her, her documents, that would be the end of the case, and the district court would properly relinquish jurisdiction, and we could evaluate, compare the result that the district court gave -- gave a plaintiff with what the plaintiff originally asked for.

As a matter of policy, the plaintiffs -- or the Petitioner's rule would result in a second major litigation over attorney's fees, and this Court has rejected any such rules. The concern is that the fee-shifting inquiry ought to be simple and easy to administer. The ease of administrability of our rule is that it turns on the contents of judicial judgments. If the Petitioner wins in this case, the policy result will merely be stingier plans. So these are not plans that any private party is obliged to create, and this Court has emphasized that the purpose of ERISA is to balance the interests of beneficiaries, on the one hand, but also the interest in the creation of these plans and the generosity of these plans, on the other.

On the other hand, this Court has emphasized that ERISA is informed by trust principles. And under Sprague, the Court emphasized that trust principles would very rarely shift fees in a context like this. So to that extent, I do believe that this provision should be informed by this Court's holding on that point. Just to re-emphasize, Your Honors, what actually happened in the district court below: So the Petitioners sought judgment as a matter of law for benefits, and that motion was denied. Instead, she received an interlocutory procedural order, a remand to her adversary, a private party in litigation, to consider the question again.

I mean, if we’re being technical, if we’re going to just do this totally on some kind of procedural theory of what's a judgment, what's a judgment in your favor, and we just don't want to look to the merits of it and see what really happened, then why doesn't she win? Because she got a judgment in her favor, okay? End of the matter."

    "speech": "Again, Your Honor, the district court did not decide the merits of this case. The district court offered the possibility that it would enter judgment if something happened in the future. That thing did not happen in the future. There was no judgment in her favor in this case. Again, the issue was remanded to a private party to determine the issue. The grant of benefits on remand certainly could not constitute success on the merits. That was not judicial action at all. That was the action of a private party. Purely voluntary action. Certainly, couldn't constitute a judgment under Rule 54. And then when the case arrived back at the district court, the district court did the only thing that it was left to do, which was to dismiss the case. And those are the actual actions the district court took: denying the motion for summary judgment and dismissing the case. And under this Court's precedents, where we look for success is in those judgments. Those judgments show us no success on the merits for Ms. Hardt. If there are no further questions --"

    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I have two points on rebuttal: Under their we must have a final judgment on the benefits on her claim for -- final judgment on the merits on her claim for benefits, that is absolutely foreclosed by this Court's decision in Schaefer, where a Social Security claimant comes forward, shows a violation by the Secretary; it's remanded back to the Secretary; the case is closed at that point. There was no decision on the merits for the benefits, and yet this Court found that was prevailing party. Here, we don't need prevailing party, but moreover, even accepting their theory, it leads to absurd results. There is a provision in ERISA, 1132(c), that gives a claimant the right to seek documents. And yet, they are saying if the claimant is wholly successful to get the plan document from which certain claims you don't even know if you have until you read those plans, they would say it's a purely procedural victory; you cannot get attorney's fees. The whole point of that provision was to require the fiduciary to give the document over so people can understand their rights. Moreover, their final judgment on the merits original order merges into that judgment. We have a final judgment here as well. Although we don't need it under section 502(g)(1), we have it here. This Court should not require a judgment before fees can be awarded. The whole -- and it certainly shouldn't adopt a purely procedural rule out of thin air that's not in the statute. This is a procedural statute.
