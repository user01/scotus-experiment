As to people that are suspect of a crime, even if they're innocent, if you're -- if you're right that the name is protected, then I think the privilege -- that the privilege applies because even if they're innocent, it might be a link in the chain of evidence necessary to convict. That's the -- that's the test.

You know, they have like two pages here of different judges, Harlan, White, Berkemer, Davis, and each time the Court said, but they're not obliged to respond. Now -- now, I -- what I thought -- I guess I'm approaching this case quite differently, but I thought we're not talking about national ID cards. What we're talking about are Terry stops. And a Terry stop is a derogation from the ordinary situation where you can walk along and do what you want. So if we're derogating from the person's ordinary freedom, what the Court did in carving out exception was to create a condition. You can ask, but he doesn't have to answer. Now, the virtue of that is simple. Anyone can understand it and it doesn't get us into all these problems that were raised previously whether those problems are right, wrong, or indifferent. So if I read three Supreme Court cases and it all says that, I think maybe there's some burden in saying on your part why we shouldn't just follow what it says."

I grant you that could happen. But contrast that with a situation where you take Berkemer literally, and now you say if he doesn't answer, sure you can pat him down. What's wrong -- I -- I don't see it. I'm back to my point which you heard me ask, and I -- I'd really like an answer in terms of -- I mean, Berkemer cites Davis and Davis refers to the settled principle -- settled -­ that you can't -- you can ask what you want, but they don't have to answer. Okay? So there are a lot of circumstances where it may be national ID cards or whatever, which are not Terry stop situations. But why should we retreat from that dictum? Now, I hear your answer about the -- about the danger and I think that's an important point. But I -- I sort of canceled that by thinking not answering would also give the policeman a justification for the patdown. And -- and now, if that's right, what other reason is there for retreating from the rather strong dictum?"

      "speech": "I'm saying that the -- what -- the government's argument is based upon the assumption that everyone will tell the truth during a Terry stop, and I don't believe that corresponds with common sense, especially if Machine Gun Harry is there. He doesn't want to be identified and it's in his interest to say my name is Tom Smith. And if you follow the government's conclusion -- rather, it's position, then the officer then relaxes his guard, doesn't take appropriate steps. We believe that officers must protect themselves but do so in a way that is consistent with the Constitution. When the Court established the Terry rule, it created an exception to the previous rule was that seizures could only occur on probable cause, which was a greater evidentiary standard. And the Court was very careful to suggest that there was a limited right, not a general exploratory search, that now we will be involved when -- excuse me -- because a name, the government suggests, will be the key to unlock data that is endless, given the modern age of technology, that the government can learn about that person. It is a general exploratory search which the government ultimately is asking this Court to approve of. And then privacy is a -- a nice principle to talk about as a part of history. Going forward, it will not be part of American citizens' natural relationship by right that they can count on. There are related freedoms that this Court also looks to in the balancing."

They can temporarily detain the person to see if there are witnesses around who could identify the person as having engaged in criminal conduct and the like. But the -- the notion that a person has to affirmatively provide a ticket to terminate that Terry encounter really tips the balance too much in favor of the State and risks a lot of benefits to our society that accrue through freely being able to move, to be let alone, to engage in protected activity without being subjected to the accosting that one is subjected to during a Terry stop. Suspicious behavior is not easily or usefully quantified, so this Court has found. And because what is suspicious to an officer -­"
