    "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: We ask this Court to hold that a jail may strip search an arrestee in cases of reasonable suspicion. That is the rule that was applied throughout almost the entire country in the three decades after Bell v. Wolfish, without either administrative difficulty or any apparent increase in smuggling. We're here today, of course, because both the Burlington Jail and the Essex County Jail require every arrestee to stand 2 feet in front of a correctional officer and strip naked."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
    "speech": "We do apply it to all arrestees. The Respondents and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons do draw a line at major versus minor offenders. I think they do that because they think that people who commit more serious crimes might be inclined to greater criminality. But our rule is one of reasonable suspicion. Our question presented draws a line at minor offenders because this class definition is only people who were arrested for minor offenses."

You're just setting us up, and you're setting the detainee up for a classification that may be questioned at the time and will be seen as an affront based on the person's race, based on what he said or she said to the officers coming in."

    "speech": "Well, a couple of points, Justice Kennedy. I think it's an incredibly important issue. They don't have a blanket rule. Remember, the Respondents apply a reasonable suspicion standard. They do strip everyone naked, but if they're going to look for contraband -- that is, look at the person's mouth, look at their anus -- they apply a reasonable suspicion standard. Now, to your very serious concern that maybe we are inviting discrimination or at least an appearance of discrimination, remember that their rule is going to produce more of that problem than ours, because their rule is not that they have to strip search -- they have to strip search everyone for contraband, but their rule is they can.

This is different."

What the courts of appeals have uniformly recognized, in the lower Federal courts, what the literature recognizes and really what I think concerned this Court in the Safford case is that when you are standing so close to the person inspecting their genitals, looking directly at their most private parts of their bodies, that is a direct intrusion on their individual privacy -­"

Remember, this is -- the Court will recall that this is a reprise of the argument in the Safford case, where the schools there argued that, well, there's an observation of these students in gym class, they shower together naked, they undress naked. And the Court said it's quite different when you're standing right there looking over the student. Now, as to -- and said that's what implicates a Fourth Amendment right of privacy, and the distinction did make sense. As to your question, yes, there is a material difference, we think, although we think both should be covered by our rule.

That -- the second jail had a slightly different search protocol, in which the testimony is that he was required to bend over and cough and expose his anus for inspection. And the Respondents themselves regard that as a more significant intrusion, and they apply a reasonable suspicion standard themselves to that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Mr. Goldstein, what -- what you propose is reasonable enough, I suppose, and some States could adopt that kind of a protocol instead of what they have. But what you're asserting is that the Fourth Amendment prohibits them from adopting it, and the obstacle I see is that at the time the Fourth Amendment was adopted, this -- this was standard practice, to strip search people who were admitted to prisons. So, how could it be deemed an unreasonable invasion of privacy when it -- when it was done all the time and nobody thought it was unconstitutional?"

    "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
    "speech": "We don't believe that the premise is correct. If you read history differently than me, I'm not going to be able to persuade you. But our understanding of the history is that the closest they can come to is two things: First, that people were strip searched upon arrest, and that's certainly not the rule under the Fourth Amendment; and that in certain jails at the time of the founding, other inmates in a process of ablution, what is almost kind of a ritual cleansing, would strip search new inmates. It had nothing to do with the jail officials themselves or trying to intercept contraband."

And it's just a different kettle of fish entirely, that -- we don't believe, obviously, that that historical lesson obtains today, that the prisoners can strip search new inmates as they -- new arrestees as they come in. I do agree with the basic premise of your question that it's -- our position can't just be that, hey, I've got a reasonable rule. I do have to, in either under the terms of Bell v. Wolfish or Turner v. Safley, establish that this is an exaggerated response, that this is much more, materially more than is necessary to accomplish their goals."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
    "speech": "We say that under their written policy, they should have, but they didn't. The Burlington County -- the only evidence about a conclusion of the jail about reasonable suspicion is that the Burlington County intake officer filled out a form saying there is no reasonable suspicion here. And Essex I don't believe contends that there was reasonable suspicion to engage in a visual body cavity search. They deny, as a matter of fact, that it happened."

What happened here is that Essex, after this search occurred -- and this is described in the Essex brief in opposition, in case you want to look at it later, at 3 in note 1. Essex, after the search in this case, changed its policy."

The rap sheet -- and it's in the joint appendix. The rap sheet says that he had a single charge, he pleaded guilty, he got a term of probation. There is nothing about that the jail would have had any information suggesting that he had some charge involving a deadly weapon. And that's why they themselves certified that there was no reasonable suspicion."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",

I thought it was rather common -- correct me if I'm wrong -- just based on practice some years ago, that it -- it would take maybe 24 hours, 48 hours for the wiretap -- for the wire services and the Internet to -- to report that he was wanted for questioning for some very, very serious crime in some other State. I mean, in my practice at least, county jails were much more dangerous than penitentiaries, because you don't know who these people are. You arrest them for traffic, and it may be some serial killer.

As to what the rule is and how common it is and whether this works in practice, the jail here did look him up in the New Jersey Criminal Justice Information System. That's in the record. They're required by New Jersey law to do that. It's a -- every single one of these jails has computer access to the NJ CJIS, and also to the NCIC; they just type in his identifying information. They were able to pull him up without any difficulty, and they have not complained that they didn't have enough information about him. They filled out a form saying there is no reasonable suspicion here. And remember, our rule only operates in a system, Justice Kennedy, in which the jail does have enough information.

The -- the first question that it seems to me the Court should focus on is what policy is at issue here. And, obviously, since the class certification deals with one set of issues and the plaintiff's claims deal with another set of issues, I think you have to be careful. I think you have to focus on the policies that existed in 2005. That was the basis on which he was in fact searched under these circumstances.

Should we be considering a rule that basically says your right to search someone depends on whether that individual has in fact been arrested for a crime that's going to lead to jail time or not, whether that person's been presented to a magistrate to see whether there is in fact probable cause for the arrest and detention of this individual?

It is true that contact visits in Bell are different from a person coming into the -- to the jail for the first time in that there might be a greater opportunity for planning, but as one of the Justices pointed out, there was less of an opportunity to actually get contraband, the person coming in was going to be searched, the inmate, as Justice Marshall pointed out, was wearing a one-piece zip-up jumper, and he's being watched the entire time. The visit -- the contraband situation in this case at intake, the person does have an opportunity, even if they are not self-reporting, knowing that they're going to be arrested. Protesters, for example, who decide deliberately to get arrested. They might be stopped by the police, they see the squad car behind them. They might have a gun or contraband in their car and think, hey, I'm going to put that on my person; I just need to get it somewhere that's not going to be found during a pat-down search. And then potentially they have the contraband with them. Also, the process of going from the arrest -- point of arrest to the general jail population is not a quick one. The person typically goes, for example, to a metropolitan police department -- that's what happens here -- and the person would mix potentially there in a holding cell with other offenders. If this Court, for example, adopted a rule saying that minor offenders would not be searched in a way that other offenders would, I have no doubt that there are some offenders in those circumstances, all on the bus together to go to the general jail population, who would give the stuff to the minor offenders -­"

They are not kept in separate housing. These are cited in our brief. Six hundred thousand people, is their expert judgment, are subject to a reasonable suspicion standard when they're admitted to jail. The second point, about numbers, Justice Breyer, there is a significant empirical study, and that is the County of Orange case. The district judge there did an unbelievably detailed job going through the record of 26,000 admissions into the system and was able to identify only a single instance where contraband would have gotten in under a reasonable suspicion standard. There is also evidence in this case, and it is the evidence, to my surprise, that my friends keep pointing to. There's a memorandum from the Essex jail system. It's at page 70a to 71a of the joint appendix. And it tells you two really relevant things. It says every year they admit 25,175 people into this jail, and that they only found 14 instances of contraband. And they don't even make the claim that those 14 instances out of 25,000 would not have been found under a reasonable suspicion standard. So, you have evidence in this record about this particular case. Third, a couple of points have been made about whether -- Justice Breyer, you asked whether someone who's high on drugs. The uniform rule -- and this is not just the ABA but the expert standard of the American Correctional Association. What they say is that essentially almost anything will do. What will not amount to reasonable suspicion is when you have a minor offender -- and we do have -- there are 700,000 people in jail in the United States every year for misdemeanor offenses. This is -- this is a lot of people who are having a very significant intrusion on privacy. And the expert standard, the rule that was applied under Bell v. Wolfish, is that when you have people who come in on a minor offense -- they don't have any drug history. They are not high on drugs. There was no opportunity to hide a weapon. I'm not sure where they think the gun is going to be hidden that's not going to show up in the very close manual pat down that they do of every one of these people that isn't going to show up in -­"

    "speech": "Well, first, there are real categories that are overinclusive in favor of the jails, like if it's a serious offense or if they have any drug history. And then on top of that, if there's any individualized basis that the jails can articulate, that will do as well. We are not saying that categorically people will be excluded from being searched. We're saying that there are entire categories that will automatically be searchable. We're just saying don't throw the baby out with the bath water. When somebody is pulled over like Mr. Florence, and there's just -- it's laugh-out-loud funny to think he's smuggling in -- something into this jail; that it's too much of an intrusion to put him under the direct, you know, 2 feet away, I'm going to look at your genitals, as opposed to the ordinary intrusion of saying we're going to oversee the showers. There is no evidence when it comes to that group of people, and there are a lot of them, that they represent anything like a material threat of smuggling. And this is a very significant intrusion on individual privacy and individual dignity. Thank you."
