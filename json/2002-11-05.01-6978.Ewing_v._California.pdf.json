For grand theft, as a general matter, California provides a maximum sentence of three years. It also -- because Mr. Ewing had served a prior prison sentence, he would be subject to a recidivism enhancement of one year, so the maximum sentence that he would have faced under California law, but for the so-called \"three-strikes law,\" would have been four years in prison, which could have been reduced by one-half by his conduct in prison and his work in prison. However, because Mr. Ewing had a prior conviction for first- degree burglary, which has been classified as a serious felony by California, and for robbery, which has been classified as a violent felony by California --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would it be fair to add that another reason for the sentence was that the judge did not disregard the priors, and that was because the judge had the record in front of him and the record showed other --a history of other offenses? Would that be a fair statement?"

    "speaker": "DENVIR",

    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "Your Honor, we believe that the law, in itself, is not unreasonable and it could result in a proportionate sentence. It did not in this case. Under this Court's decision in Solem versus Helm, the Court has said that you can look to the prior record as relevant to the sentencing decision because it aggravates the present crime, but the focus must remain on the present crime."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, Solem stands with Rummel and with Harmelin. They're really three different points, and Solem is probably the case that favors you most. But certainly Rummel is good law, and Harmelin is good law. And I think those cases don't favor you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I believe that Rummel -- the Court said in Solem -- the majority opinion said that Rummel would be controlling only in a similar factual situation. We do not believe we have that here. And as far as Harmelin was concerned, the basic principles of Solem were reaffirmed by seven justices in Harmelin and, we believe, when applied here, will show that this is a grossly disproportionate sentence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Denvir, would you clarify whether your challenge is strictly as applied? Because some of the -- some of the points that you make seem to be going to the statute wholesale. So, for example, you talk about it -- the statute's infirm, because it has no washout for aging offenses, but there was no such offense at stake here. The strikes were all rather recent."

  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. And --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "-- and to answer your question, we are challenging only the sentence that Mr. Ewing received for the crime that he committed, that he was sentenced at. There's much discussion on both sides of -- as -- I -- as the background of the three-strikes law. We have no doubt the three-strikes law could result in a -- in a constitutional sentence. It did not, in this case. So however the scheme is that reached this sentence, this life sentence for stealing three golf clubs, that sentence is -- falls under the Eighth Amendment, in our view."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But we -- so we should leave out things like no washout, that someone who never served any time would subject to the three strikes --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "I think that's correct, Your Honor, that they don't play into this case. And I think that -- as I said, that the three-strikes law is merely -- it's the process that produced an unconstitutional sentence. It could have been produced by a different sentencing scheme, also."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, when we're examining the constitutionality of the three-strikes law, as applied to this sentence, we should take into account, should we not, the purposes of the California law, which was to have a law which was -- gave simple, clear notice of the three-strikes policy? And if you want us to take case-by-case, then that whole policy is undercut, it seems to me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't think that's true. In Solem v. Helm, the Court made very clear that it was looking only to the sentence that was imposed on Mr. Helm."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yeah, I was going to ask you about that, because you had said that the principal focus has to be on this sentence. I'm just not sure what your authority for that is when we have a recidivist scheme of this kind."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, the -- in Solem versus Helm, the Court, of course, had a recidivist scheme. The focus there was on number of prior offenses, as opposed to the nature of the prior offenses. The Court said that the defendant, under double-jeopardy principles, cannot be punished for those prior crimes; however, they are relevant to the -- to the sentence imposed for the present crime. And the -- and the reason they are relative -- and the Court said this best in Gryger versus Burke -- is what they -- what they -- what they authorize is a, quote, \"stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because of repetitive one.\" That's at page 8 in our reply brief. But what Solem v. Helm made very clear is, although the prior crimes are relevant, the focus must remain, when judging proportionality or gross disproportionality, on what this -- what this defendant did at this time, what he is being sentenced for at this time."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm just not sure how that works. What am I supposed to do with recidivism as a factor in analyzing this sentence?"

    "speaker": "DENVIR",

    "speech": "Well --"
  },

    "speaker": "DENVIR",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, what's the reason for saying that though -- that you can only -- that the focus remains on this crime, but others are relevant? I mean, that really is kind of meaningless, it seems to me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, because, as I say, what the Court has said over the years is that the important part about the prior crimes is that it shows that this is a repeat offense. And the fact that he has committed offenses in a row makes this particular offense worse. The fact that he has committed worse offenses in the past does not aggravate this crime. I -- this is -- this still remains shoplifting three golf clubs, regardless if he had been a triple murderer or anything else, and that's what he's being punished for. Because if he's being punished because of those prior crimes, their nature, there's really serious double jeopardy --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, if you look to our -- to the comparison with other jurisdictions -- and I just don't think this has been highlighted in our brief -- there are only -- there are only five jurisdictions that would have allowed a life sentence. There's only one additional jurisdiction, Montana, that would have allowed a term of years as great as the minimum sentence here, and that's -- Montana allows -- is five to a hundred years. And most states allow for either grand theft or recidivist grand theft --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "No, that's correct, Your Honor. In Solem v. Helm, the Court noted that he could -- that Mr. Helm could have received a comparable sentence in one other state, and nevertheless held that it fell under the Eighth Amendment."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, just help us one more time. The prior history is relevant, but then how relevant?"

    "speaker": "DENVIR",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You say the principal focus has to be on the three golf clubs, like we're some judges out of Victor Hugo or something and that's all we have to focus on. But this -- there's a -- there's a long recidivism component here, and that's the whole purpose of the California law that you're asking us to ignore, it seems to me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "Your Honor, and -- what I'm saying is -- I'm going back to what the Court said in Solem v. Helm in its analysis, which I think is controlling here. It made -- it made the point that the -- the prior convictions -- he cannot be punished for those, but they do aggravate this present crime that he's being punished for. And the way they aggravate it is that -- is that this shows that it's a repetitive offense. Now, he can have a reasonable enhancement of the normal penalty for grand theft based on the repetition aspect of it, but at some point it becomes unreasonable. And it becomes unreasonable if you go from three years to life based on his prior crimes. At that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why isn't it reasonable to say if he commits another felony -- he's committed, you know, three already and nine other convictions -- \"One more felony,\" California tells him, \"and you go away for life.\" Why isn't that reasonable? And this -- and this was a felony."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",

    "speaker": "DENVIR",

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why can't California decide that enough is enough, that someone with a long string like this simply deserves to be put away?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, if that were true, then there would be no limiting principle on recidivist laws under the Eighth Amendment. It would -- at that point, you could say the mere fact that he broke any law -- if he broke a traffic offense -- a petty offense would show that he couldn't follow the law and could get a life sentence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Oh, I'd be with you there, if it was a misdemeanor or, you know, some -- but this is a felony under California law."
  },

    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "It is a felony, and it's one of the least grave felonies in California."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But we have given -- we've said, at least, here, that we are going to give great latitude to state legislatures in determining how many years to give, and how to categorize an offense. Why don't -- why don't we look to the Harmelin case for the standards, rather than Solem? Harmelin came later."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DENVIR",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I think you do, because, as I understand the Harmelin case, if you take the dissent and the plurality, they both agreed on the basic principle here, which is that there cannot be gross disproportion between the offense and the sentence. And the reason I go back to Solem versus Helm is that it was a recidivist case and there was some further information. I don't -- as I read the Court's opinion, at least the plurality opinion, in Harmelin, the big change was that you would -- you would not look automatically to intra­ jurisdictional or inter-jurisdictional comparisons. You would first have to find an inference of gross disproportionality before you'd go to the second -- the other two steps. That's what I understood to be the major -- the major refinement of Solem v. Helm that was in the plurality opinion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm slightly stuck on this, because I -- I'd like -- there is some relevant information that I can't get a hold of, and you may have some in your experience, but it isn't in the brief. Imagine -- let's take the set of people who have committed at least two serious crimes or more, maybe 50 serious crimes. They're very serious criminals. And they're warned, \"If you do anything again, you've had it.\" So think of that set of people. Now, I would like to know, in light of that set of people, now one of the members of that set commits a crime equal to stealing $1200 -- whether they steal $1200 or equal to that; that's a very subjective judgment -- what's the longest sentence such a person has ever actually served? Here, they are going to 25 years, real years. And the second question I'd like to know is, What is the least bad crime that such a person ever committed who did serve 25 real years?"

    "speech": "I -- let me see if I can answer your question. As far as under the three-strikes law, there is -- because it sets this absolute minimum of 25 years -- it's a life sentence, but it adds a kicker to it which says, unlike other life sentences, you have to wait at least 25 years before you can even be considered. So we -- since this law was passed in 1994, we have no experience with this law."

And what the Court said at that time was that 90 percent of all defendants who came up for their first parole hearing were found unsuitable for parole and that 85 percent were found unsuitable at subsequent hearings. Now, that has not improved any, because, as you'll see in the amicus brief of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, at page 18, as of 2000, the Board of Prison Terms, which is the -- which is the parole authority -- their official records show that they only recommended parole in 1 percent of the 2000 cases that came before them with a life sentence."

But the other question is, there's no doubt that some deference has to be paid by this Court to legislative judgments or initiative judgments in the questions of punishment and in dealing with recidivists. The Court has made that very clear. But it is that deference that has led to the Court setting a very forgiving standard. The Court said that it would not require, in this area, or as excessive fines, strict proportionality between the crime being punished and the sentence. It has said it was only when there was a gross disproportion, and that's a very deferential standard. That is a standard that allows the legislature to make many reasonable judgments, but says that --"

But in a way, I think the -- Your Honor's question triggers an issue that I think is central here. The ISL, the old California law, was premised very explicitly on a penological theory that emphasized rehabilitation of the offender. I think the question that's raised in this case, and it's a question that's particularly apt in light of the Harmelin opinion, is, when can a state decide that they're going to move away from a more lenient policy of rehabilitation or extending leniency to a first- time offender, and move toward a policy, a tougher policy, of incapacitation?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So, tell me, am I fair to assume there never, in the history of the United States, has been a person who -- of the set -- I'm only -- I don't want to be pejorative; I want to characterize it your way, and I'll characterize it as taking the set of very serious criminals with very serious records, and a person in that set commits another crime, and the other crime is approximately theft of $1200 -- and am I fair in saying there hasn't been, ever, a sentence in the history of the United States in the last hundred years anywhere close to this one? And I base that on my knowledge -- which you could get; it's public -- of 35,000 real cases in the federal system where to get a sentence like this one for a prior offender, you had to -- you have to now, you know, hijack an airplane, commit murder, something really serious beyond belief compared to this, and that the worst sentence you could get for something like this is about four, five years. And then I look to the California Adult Authority, and I see, under that sentencing, nobody could have gotten more than ten real years, and, indeed, the average was somewhere around five. And you have all those records, and you have come up with nothing in your brief. And therefore, can I say -- my assumption is, this is by an order or factor of two or three times higher than anyone ever was sentenced before in the United States for such a thing? You see, I'm making a very extreme statement empirically, and I want to know what the response is to my statement, and I want to know why I shouldn't hold you to my statement since you have the information, and why I shouldn't say that's just way too much."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "One of the things that puzzles me about the statute -- maybe you can enlighten me -- I thought that if there were two priors that were violent but not related to property, such as murder and rape, that the third related to property wouldn't trigger the statute."

  {
    "speaker": "DE NICOLA",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor. The way the statute is written is that if the prior felonies meet the statutory definition of being serious or violent -- if you have two of those, then any new felony triggers the three-strike sentence."

That's why I'm very pushed to know what to work with unless you work with empirical fact."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE NICOLA",
    "speech": "Well, we -- in California, the felony is defined by the -- not just the locus of where the term will be served, but also by the length. It's more than a year.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE NICOLA",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, I think that is so, and there are political restraints on the legislature in enacting laws in general applicability. There are certainly economic restraints on a legislature in deciding to set a punishment scheme that provides for long terms of imprisonment. That's costly. And that to -- for a court to second-guess that, comes, we think, perilously close to the court suggesting that the legislature can, in some instances, not declare a certain crime to be a felony, but must declare it to be a misdemeanor, and we don't think there's anything in the Court's jurisprudence that would -- that would support that type of an intrusion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. De Nicola, there's a lot of discretion built into this scheme. It comes across as three strikes and you're out, and that's it; but it's not. There's discretion in the prosecutor and discretion in the judge. Are there, in Los Angeles or in California, any guides to prosecutors in exercising their discretion, say, whether to treat a wobbler as a misdemeanor or a felony?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE NICOLA",
    "speech": "There are no statewide standards. Each elected district attorney in the various counties in California has the option of promulgating guidelines. Some of them have. And the fact of the matter is some of them -- some of them differ. We think that's a rather unremarkable event in light of the fact that prosecutorial discretion is always going to lead to some sort of different approach depending on local conditions. But there is not, as far as I know, any statewide guideline, and certainly nothing that would be binding on the local prosecutors."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The prosecutor can charge something as a misdemeanor. As far as the striking a strike is concerned, is that solely for the judge? Or, I suppose, it depends on what's charged. The prosecutor can decide not to charge two strikes."

    "speaker": "DE NICOLA",
    "speech": "Yes, the prosecutor, under the statute, is required to allege the priors, but the prosecutor may seek dismissal of the prior strikes either in the furtherance of justice, or because of problems of proof. But the judge also has authority to strike strikes, even without the consent of the prosecutor, in California. And so --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DE NICOLA",

And do you think that is a justification that you want to rely on in this case?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right. Here's the problem that I have with that, and this is -- this is -- this is what I wish you would address. If we allow, for purposes of proportionality or gross disproportionality analysis, this kind of -- the consideration of varying intentions -- retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, and so on -- and every time the State gets to a very high offense, the State says, \"Oh, we've changed the theory. We've gone from deterrence to retribution,\" it seems to me that it makes this kind of analysis of comparables -- this proportionality analysis -- impossible because we no longer have two comparable entities on either side of our comparison. What we have is a low sentence on the one hand for deterrence, and a high sentence for incapacitation or retribution. We have apples and oranges instead of oranges and oranges. So my question is, if we accept the State's option to say, \"We've changed the theory,\" don't we read comparability analysis right out of the law? Doesn't it simply become logically impossible?"

    "speaker": "DE NICOLA",

I don't see what we can compare. We no longer have comparables."

I would have read Harmelin as establishing two principles, at a minimum. One is, the analysis is not proportionality; it's gross disproportionality, an extremely rare basis to invalidate a statute. Second, we recognize that the states are entitled to adopt different penological theories, or a mix of theories. In fact, I would have thought that a state's entitled to say, for example, that certain types of crimes ought to be addressed in terms of retribution; other types of crimes posing other kinds of issues can be dealt with in terms of deterrence and incapacitation. And if the consequence of that principle is that this Court has very limited review on comparability of sentences, at least where you're dealing with sentences that allow for the possibility of parole, then I think the conclusion is that it is the extremely rare case in which a sentence gets --"

  {
    "speaker": "CHERTOFF",
    "speech": "-- $476, and a similar one, I think, in South Dakota. Also, of course, as we look at the current sentencing regime, this is not, as in Solem versus Helm, where you have single judge who is apparently an outlier under the state sentencing scheme. In this case, if one takes, in fact, a petitioner's own figures, you have at least 2- to 300 individuals whose third strike, under the California scheme as it now exists, has, in fact, been a property-based crime. And I think the most compelling reason why this is not that very, very rare case where we strike down a sentence is precisely what Justice Ginsburg has been repeatedly asking about, the discretion that the courts have to tailor the particular sentence in this case to the facts of the case. If we look at the record in this case, in the joint appendix, the sentencing judge carefully considered the entirety of the file with respect to the trigger -- or the predicate offenses, which involved, actually, three burglaries in the course of a single month, one of which involved pulling a knife and threatening somebody, as well as at least nine prior offenses. And interestingly, in no case since 1988 had the petitioner ever successfully completed probation or parole. He was always violating probation or parole by committing his next offense. And that's precisely what the sentencing judge looked at and explicitly referred to in rejecting the request on the part of the petitioner either to downgrade the triggering offense to a misdemeanor, or to eliminate some of the strikes. And I would have thought that is precisely what we expect and want judges to do in a rational sentencing system."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In effect, you're -- going back to the beginning of your argument, I think you're -- I think you're saying that what the judge here did in rejecting the request to downgrade or to disregard, in effect, was saying, \"Yes, I am finding that this is a case in which it is appropriate to sentence on an entirely different theory, a theory of putting them away, as opposed to a theory of deterrence,\" and I -- that seems to be the logic of what's going on."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHERTOFF",
    "speech": "That's correct; an entirely different theory, though, that is embraced by the State in passing this law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And may I ask you one more question on that? Because again, you started toward it in responding to me at the beginning. Like you, I came in here assuming that the State could change its theories. If that is so, then I guess what that means for proportionate or gross disproportionality analysis is this: A State can do it and can pass our Eight Amendment test if it has a reasonable basis for saying, \"We are going, under certain circumstances, to say there is a changed theory of sentencing. The theory changes from deterrence or mere retribution to a theory or public protection, putting away the person who simply will repeat and repeat and repeat.\" So, for purposes of our proportionality analysis, the question would come down, do they have a reasonable basis for doing that under their statute, in general? And in particular, is there a reasonable basis for saying that this is a case for that? And if the answers to those two questions are yes, then it passes the test. Is that -- would you adopt that analysis?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHERTOFF",
    "speech": "I would absolutely agree that if it satisfies those two, it passes the test. That's not to say that if it flunks those, it automatically fails the test. But certainly if you meet those conditions, I think you pass the test. And I think there's a common sense to that. One could look, for example, at certain types of violent crimes, like murders and rapes and say, irrespective of whether it was a crime of passion or something that will never happen again, \"It is so heinous, our philosophy is we have to punish it.\" But one can also look at comparatively small crimes, at least if they're felonies, and say, \"If someone is repetitiously unable to conform their conduct to the requirements of the law, we don't have to wait until he commits the next felony or the next two felonies before we put an end to it.\" And interestingly, if one goes back to Blackstone, who talks a little bit about the issue of proportionality as it related back in his day, he discusses the fact that when you deal with habitual offenders, it would be cruel to the public to simply allow that person to get out again and commit their next crime. So, I don't know that it's so much that the State changes its theory, as that the State adapts its theory to the particular type of crime and particular type of offender. And that's, of course, what we want to have in sentencing. And, finally, I would say this. In a scheme like California, where the state judge has the power to tailor to the particular offender and the particular offense what the right answer is, for the federal courts to come in under gross disproportionality analysis and recalibrate that -- even if, sitting as state trial judges, the justices might feel we would do it differently -- would be essentially converting the courts into a constitutional sentencing commission.

One thing would be to treat a wobbler, if it is a wobbler, and reduce it to a misdemeanor; so you would go from 25 to life, or life, to one-year maximum penalty. That's not used very often. The other one is to strike a prior conviction. But that's a -- the California Supreme Court in Romero said that's a very limited discretion, that it is only when you can find that this offender is outside the \"spirit of the law,\" whatever that is. And there's an amicus brief filed by the Los Angeles public defender in Romero that shows that that discretion has been used very little in California. So the -- this limited discretion has no effect on it. The only other point I'd make, as far as the repetition -- as far as the labeling, if all the legislature has to do is say, \"What we're doing here is incapacitation, and, therefore, the Court can't look at that,\" then it really writes the Eighth Amendment protections against grossly disproportional sentences out totally. If it's just a question of -- they say, \"Here's our reason,\" and you can't even question that, because they can always claim they want to incapacitate any criminal for any amount of time."
