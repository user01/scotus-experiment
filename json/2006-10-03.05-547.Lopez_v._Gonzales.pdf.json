    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A drug-trafficking crime is defined in 18 U.S. Code Section 924(c) as any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act or two other Federal statutes. \"Punishable\" is a key term. If that word is omitted, the remaining phrase, \"any felony under the Controlled Substances Act,\" clearly refers to felony violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The parties agree that \"punishable\" means \"subject to criminal sanctions.\" So, a \"drug-trafficking crime,\" under 924(c), is conduct that is subject to being punished under the Controlled Substances Act. State felonies are not, themselves, punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. It is not a Federal crime to violate State law. The defendant's conduct may be punishable under both Federal and State law, but a State felony is not a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice Kennedy. Our position is, if the conduct would violate a felony provision of the Controlled Substances Act or one of the other two Federal statutes, it then is a drug-trafficking crime under 18 U.S. Code Section 924(c), and, therefore, it is an aggravated felony. But there are three additional textual indications, in addition to simply the \"felony punishable\" language, that misdemeanor offenses under the Controlled Substances Act are not drug-trafficking crimes under Section 924(c). The first one is, there are other provisions of Section 924 -- (e), (g), and (k) -- where Congress actually used very similar language. It referred to conduct punishable under the Controlled Substances Act or the two other statutes, or offenses under the Controlled Substances Act or the two other Federal statutes.

I mean, the -- if you looked at (e), for example, there it's a parallel construction; it's not broader. I think perhaps the government would say, \"Well, we're talking about offenses.\" That's a little different from a felony, but \"offenses\" is actually a broader term. I'll mention an additional statute, which was not in the appendix -- 18 U.S. Code Section 3559(c)(2)(H). This provision -- it's a similar provision; it defines a \"serious drug offense\" as an offense that is punishable under the specific sections of the Controlled Substances Act, or an offense under State law that, had the offense been prosecuted in a court of the United States, would have been punishable under the CSA. An additional textual indication is, it's agreed -- and this Court has already said, in Gonzales against the United States, that a drug-trafficking crime under 924(c), under the criminal statute, must be a Federal crime. 924(c)(1)(A) refers to a crime that may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, and that clearly refers to a Federal crime. The definition of drug-trafficking crime, by its term, says it is for purposes of 924(c), so there is no reason why Congress would have wanted to include State felonies in a definition that applies to a Federal criminal provision that all concede applies only to Federal predicate offenses.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "I believe the Government has a footnote in their brief where they suggest there are some State trafficking offenses that actually do not have a parallel in Federal law. Soliciting, I think, may be one of them. So, I think there are, in fact, some. And our position, of course, is that by adding illicit trafficking -- any trafficking offense, State or Federal, whether or not it is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, is an aggravated felony."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "Let me ask the same question a different way. If -- since 924(c) includes some \"mere possession\" offenses, and illicit trafficking in a controlled substance includes all violations of 924(c), doesn't that show that the way Congress used \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance\" is not in the sense in which the term is used in ordinary speech, but's much broader, so that it can include \"mere possession\" offenses?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "The -- Justice Alito, there is an argument -- it's developed in the brief of the American Bar Association -- that, because illicit trafficking is the general category, that all the aggravated felonies in this category should have a trafficking component; and, therefore, the felonies punishable under the Controlled Substances Act that are \"simple possession\" offenses should not, in fact, be included. That is not an argument that we have pressed in our brief. We read the phrase to say \"illicit trafficking, including any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\" So, I would agree with you, to the extent that if it is a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has said, by definition, that it is included in the category of illicit trafficking."

    "speech": "-- when we get to that language, Mr. Chief Justice -- and I do think it helps the analysis to first decide, What is the definition of a \"drug- trafficking crime\" under 924(c), the criminal statute? Once you've decided that -- now, when you move back to the INA, there is this language. The term \"aggravated felony\" applies to an offense described in 101(a)(43), whether in violation of Federal or State law, or the law of a foreign country. Now, we think that's pretty straightforward. It has to be an offense described. So, the simple example is money laundering. It -- the offense described in 18 U.S. Code Section 1956, \"money laundering,\" is an aggravated felony. So, a violation of State law or of foreign law can be an aggravated felony, but only if it is the offense described in 1956. If States or a foreign government has a broader definition of \"money laundering,\" that can't count, because it's not the offense described. And when you turn to a drug-trafficking crime, the way that offense is described in 101(A)(43) is -- Congress picked up, in its entirety and without any modification, the definition of \"drug-trafficking crime\" in 924(c), a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. So, if you agree that, in the criminal statute, that means a felony violation of the Controlled Substances Act, the offense described is the felonies in the Controlled Substances Act, not the felonies in the misdemeanors. And State -- if State law wants to call a -- something that's a misdemeanor under Federal law a felony, they can do that, but they can't expand the offense described. The offense described, the way Congress did that, is --"

His appeal of his sentence is not moot, primarily because he is still subject to the sentence that is the subject of that appeal. Even though Mr. Toledo-Flores was released from prison on April 21st of this year, and deported to Mexico, he's still subject to the supervised-release portion of his sentence, because supervised release is not automatically extinguished by deportation."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "-- we think it does, for several reasons. First, with respect to the constitutional requirement, the uniformity provision applies to uniform rules of naturalization; that is, citizenship. This -- we're not talking about citizenship here, we're talking -- we're talking about the eligibility of aliens to remain in the country. Beyond that, even where the Uniformity Clause applies -- and there's, for example, a parallel Uniformity Clause for bankruptcy -- that's never been interpreted to mean that consequences of certain conduct under State law can have no impact on bankruptcy law, and that there can't be a variation. The State-law homestead exemption under the -- under the bankruptcy laws is a good example of that. But, going beyond that, with respect to the issue of uniformity generally, Congress has established uniform standards in Section 1101, either in terms of identifying the conduct in certain instances; in other instances, by identifying the minimum sentence that was actually imposed. In this case, we think, with respect to drug-trafficking crimes, it -- it's imposed a uniform standard, in terms of the length of the sentence; it has to be a felony. That's -- that is uniformity. But the -- to answer your point more directly, it is a principle throughout 1101(a)(43) that one looks to State law, not to -- not to a -- some supposed uniform standard of Federal law. And, for example, if you -- several subparagraphs -- and if you'll -- 1101(a)(43) is set out at page 12(a) of the appendix to our brief -- three subparagraphs -- (j), (q), and (t) -- refer to the sentence that may be imposed for a violation. Well, when you're talking about a State conviction, that's clearly referring to the sentence that may be imposed under State law for a conviction. Four other subparagraphs -- (f), (g), (r), and (s) -- turn on the sentence that was actually imposed. That means that -- in the case of a State crime, as we have here, that State law has to authorize the sentence, and that the State Court, applying State sentencing principles, has actually imposed a crime of -- for -- of at least 1 year. So, it is -- it is infused in Section 1101(a)(43) that, in fact, you do look to the consequences of an offense under State law."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",

Now, going along the way -- maybe I'm making a mistake to point it out, if I am -- but I go to the key thing here, which is the words in 924(c), What is a \"drug-trafficking crime\"? A \"drug-trafficking crime\" is a crime -- \"any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\" That could mean an act, physically, that is a felony under some law, and is also punishable under the Controlled Substances Act as a misdemeanor. Okay? Felony under -- it could pick that up. And it also could mean any conduct which is punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act. And I could look at those words a thousand times and not have a clue which it means. So, I thought of an empirical test. This statute, 924(c), happens to be a statute that, if you engage in a drug-trafficking crime, as defined, and you have a gun with you, you get mandatory 5 years. That's the point of it. And the Government does all the prosecuting. So, in how many cases where a person committed a misdemeanor offense, simple possession, and had a gun, did the Government insist that they get the 5- years minimum? Now, if you're prepared to tell me \"a lot of 'em,\" I'm prepared to tell you, the Government has consistently interpreted the statute the way you are now. But if you're prepared to tell me \"zero,\" I would say I would be suspicious of an interpretation that comes along now for the first time. And my mind is open on it. I'm quite interested in the answer."

  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well, the Petitioner has conceded, as I understand it -- I heard Mr. Long, I think, concede -- that possession offenses can constitute aggravated felonies under this provision, that there is the recidivist possession, there is the possession of the date-rape drug, there is possession of 5 grams or more of cocaine. All of those are specified as being -- of being felonies under the -- under 940 -- or 844. But, beyond that, it's important to take into account that a lot of State statutes dealing with drugs do not -- are not patterned directly after the Federal statute, and there's no reason why Congress would have insisted that they do so in order for this statute to operate sensibly. And one notable example, for instance, is, when it comes to possession of a substantial amount of drugs, that that certainly would create a strong implication that the defendant was engaged in trafficking activities, or intended to. The Federal statute deals with that by making it a felony to possess with intent to distribute the drug.  A number of States don't do that. They, instead, have graduated possession offenses, based on the quantity of drugs that the defendant is possessing; that above a certain quantity of drugs, it would be a felony. They're getting at the same problem, but they've come at it in a different way."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

And that's what I understand Toledo-Flores to be arguing, is that if he applied for discretionary relief in the future, that it might -- it might matter, because his sentence might be reduced slightly. I should point out that in the District Court Toledo-Flores conceded that if he didn't get an eight- level sentence enhancement, he would get a four-level sentence enhancement, because this is at least a felony, within the meaning of the adjacent provision of the guidelines. That would result in a guideline range of 24 to 30 months. He would then have gotten 24 months, under that guideline range, the very same thing that he got here. And, under the guidelines at the time, a term of supervised release was mandatory. And a 1-year term of supervised release was mandatory in those circumstances. He would have gotten exactly the same term of supervised release if he had been -- if he had gotten only the four- level enhancement, rather than the eight-level enhancement. I also think that it is somewhat farfetched to think that, given the fact that Toledo-Flores had more than 12 illegal entries into the United States, and various State offenses, that the determination of whether the attorney general would actually grant discretionary relief would turn on a marginal difference in the sentence on that particular offense."

He said, \"Well, the Federal Government never prosecutes Federal misdemeanors under Section 924(c).\" He said, \"The reason is because of 924(c)(1)(A),\" and the language there is, it has to be an offense for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States. But that language -- a person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States for a misdemeanor. So, the Government is making an argument that, to my knowledge, has never been accepted by any court, has not ever been advanced by the Government in a criminal context, and that would significantly expand Section 924(c) and numerous other criminal statutes that we cite in our brief that used the same definition of \"drug-trafficking crime.\" The -- Mr. Kneedler also said that the aggravated felony provisions in Section 101(a)(43) refer to State law, but I read them just the opposite. There are two kinds. There are 21 of them. Many of them say, \"an offense described in 18 U.S. Code Section X.\" I mean, that's really what -- we're dealing with one of those here. So, it clearly goes to Federal law to define the offense. Now, if State law or foreign law also punishes that offense, then it's an aggravated felony, but, clearly, Federal law is defining the offense. There are other categories, such as murder and theft, that are defined, in general terms; but the Government's position, as I understand it, is, again, you use a generic uniform definition. You don't pick any definition that the States may have. The Court just granted --"

    "speech": "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. But, again, to be clear -- and I think this is consistent with the Government's position in other cases -- ultimately, there will be some uniform Federal definition of what constitutes illicit trafficking. It would be -- some commercial element would probably be the definition the Court hasn't decided. States can define it more broadly. But the actual definition -- just as the definition of \"burglary\" or \"theft\" --"

    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, it's -- I mean, as -- this -- in the Taylor case, in burglary, the Court has a methodology for this. You pick a sort of generic definition. It may not -- it may not come from a Federal statute; it could --"

    "speech": "There's -- they'll -- there's no variation in State offenses that would fall within that, a theft offense?"

    "speaker": "LONG",
    "speech": "Well, it's -- again, this is -- the provision we're dealing with is -- looks to Federal law, the Controlled Substances Act and two other statutes. My understanding of the Government's position -- and it's consistent with this Court's cases, in Taylor -- is that, even when it's a generic offense, you would -- you would still have a uniform definition. And that is certainly consistent with the principle of uniformity that applies both in criminal law and in immigration law. I mean, if there's any ambiguity, at the end of the day, ambiguities are supposed to be resolved in favor of uniformity, uniform Federal law -- uniform Federal criminal law, and uniform immigration law. Effectively, what the Government is arguing that -- is that States can banish noncitizens, and can do so by enacting drug laws, deciding to make a simple possession offense a felony. That's a decision that a State would make, almost certainly, for reasons that have little or nothing to do with immigration, and it's highly unlikely that Congress would have left that determination to States. On uniformity, aggravated felonies is a condition for citizenship. If you're convicted of an aggravated felony, you may not become a U.S. citizen. You are foreclosed from establishing good moral character. So, in fact, citizenship is at stake here, and the Uniformity Clause is in play. If there are no further questions, thank you."
