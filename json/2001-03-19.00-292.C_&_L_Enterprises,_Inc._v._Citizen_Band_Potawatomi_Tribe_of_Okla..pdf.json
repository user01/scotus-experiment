The contract contained an arbitration provision specifically adopting the rules of the American Arbitration Association and also specifically providing that the award, the arbitration award in such proceedings, would be enforceable by judgment. There is no question that the arbitration agreement provided that the tribe waived its immunity as to the American Arbitration Association and its arbitration proceedings. There is no --"

And we believe the standard, that no standard has required that it specifically state we waive sovereign immunity. Rather they clearly stated we agree to be brought into the American Arbitration Association and to be subject to arbitration, a binding arbitration. They went further than that and they said in the agreement we agree that a judgment may be entered upon that."

      "speech": "And the ambiguity that the respondent attempts to raise is regarding which court is being referred to where the phrase recites any court of competent jurisdiction. However, we believe that that argument of ambiguity fails for four reasons. First, the American Arbitration Association Rule 47C, which is incorporated by the very terms of the clause, states that awards under their procedures may be enforced as a judgement in any federal or state court. The contract itself selects Oklahoma law as governing law in addition to this Court's rulings in Mescalero, Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Potawatomi Organized Village of Cocky. All of those saying that when the tribe goes off the reservation, it is subject to the substantive laws of the state. The third reason is the Tribal Court is not mentioned anywhere in the contract. And the fourth reason is we don't believe the Tribal Court would have had jurisdiction to even hear this case under the ruling in Montana v. United States because it is undoubtedly non- Indian not on the reservation."

And in this situation, under the same circumstances, we believe that that standard would find a waiver because there is no other reasonable construction of this clause when you take what the clause incorporates. And in fact, in this Court's ruling in Port Authority v. Feeney, and subsequently in Kimmel v. Florida Board of Regents, the Court recognized that the consent provision may look to other provisions. In the Port Authority, it looked to a venue provision. And in Kimmel, it looked for an ADA claim; it looked to the Fair Label Standards Act and found--"

      "speech": "Mr. Mashburn, as this respects foreign sovereigns, Congress in 1988 made the specific provision that if you agreed to an arbitration dispute settlement mechanism, then you have no immunity. The Congress did that by statute and doesn't that imply that when Congress doesn't do it by statute, the immunity persists?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MASHBURN",
      "speech": "No, Your Honor, we don't believe that it does. First of all, we believe that a distinction has to be drawn. In that instance, Congress was attempting to bring some uniformity to a variation of rules that had been applied. And in fact, as this Court recited the history of foreign sovereign immunity in the Cairo case, there had been a move from virtually no immunity to virtually total immunity under I believe it was the Tate Letter. And then, shrinking back from that, and then applying implied consent from commercial operations. We don't believe that the fact that they acted there to specifically provide that as a waiver indicates where they have not acted that there is no waiver. And in fact, we believe the Court can take guidance from the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and from cases leading up to that finding waivers from entering into commercial relations, or in particular arbitration agreements, and find that that is within the appropriate policy that the United States has followed."

But, as a general rule, we believe that if the arbitration agreement, first of all, if it incorporates rules, as this one does from the American Arbitration Association, then we think it's perfectly appropriate for the Court to look to those rules and the parties are both on notice that those rules are going to govern the procedures. We also believe --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, of course, was just tracking developments in international law that had generally allowed suit on commercial transactions by states. Why do you think it's open to us to apply such a rule to the sovereign immunity of Indian tribes, which we made up ourselves anyway, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MASHBURN",
      "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. And it is correct that it was simply a codification of what was the emerging case law in the field. It certainly is appropriate for this Court to draw a waiver rule as lenient as the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Rule, and certainly no more strict than the Eleventh Amendment Waiver Rule. And this Court has complete authority to do that because, as Your Honor has stated, this Court recognized in Cairo that it is a court created doctrine. Especially in the context that it tends to impinge on the state's rights and be court created, we believe there's even more argument for the Court to move cautiously in; certainly in expanding any immunity that has been afforded to Indian tribes."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Mashburn, even if you could -- you've agreed the agreement is saying yes, they agreed for arbitration. That's explicit right out there that but they are going to resolve this through arbitration. But, where do you get tied to that, that the Court to enforce the arbitration award would be a state court? There is no explicit agreement due to that by the tribe, is there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MASHBURN",
      "speech": "No, Your Honor, we believe that there is and the reason that there is is because first of all it adopts the American Arbitration Association rule which says the award may be enforced in state or federal court. Secondly, it adopts Oklahoma's Arbitration Act, which says that the award may be enforced in any court of the state. And we believe when you combine that with the fact that, in our opinion, the Tribal Court would have had jurisdiction, there is no ambiguity that the court that is being selected is not the Tribal Court. So, the only other alternative would be to argue that the term, that the provision was meaningless and that it was selecting no court. But, we don't even believe that that argument holds water because the parties had adopted Oklahoma law specifically. The parties have adopted the American Arbitration Association rules. And under both of those bodies of law, the forum is either, you know, from a state court or a federal court, not the Tribal Court."

      "speaker": "MASHBURN",
      "speech": "I'm sure that they would assert that they are immune from suit in their court. I need to clarify one matter though for your previous question, Your Honor. There is some question because the agreement incorporates the American Arbitration Association rules and because that makes no reference to bringing an action to enforce the award in anything other than state and federal court. I suppose there could be some question there whether they were consenting to suit in their own court. However, no party has asserted Tribal Court jurisdiction here. No party has attempted to bring any action in Tribal Court."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

Now, what's the answer to that argument? You say they're not able to say that in a contract? Why not? You and your client and they could sign a contract saying we want to be sued in a Tribal Court. Is there a Tribal Court? Yes. What happens if they try to assert immunity in their Tribal Court? You say you signed a promise here not to by your own words. So, what's the problem? I mean, if this were a state, we'd say it meant any state court. This is a tribe, so they're saying by analogy it means any Tribal Court. Now, what's the answer to that? There's a kind of black hole in this case."

We do not question that the tribe could have said you may sue us, but only in Tribal Court. But, the language of the contract simply does not indicate that. The language of the contract, especially when you incorporate the American Arbitration Association rules that say state or federal court, certainly does not indicate that the Tribal Court is going to be the exclusive court of jurisdiction, if it indicates Tribal Court at all."

But, before that, you were taking a position about the subject matter jurisdiction of Tribal Courts. You were saying that parties can't confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court. And if we follow that reasoning, then your answer to Justice O'Connor should have been no. These courts are simply powerless to entertain the case where one of the litigants is a non-member and the episode and suit occurred off reservation, you started out, are you abandoning that position?"

I was attempting to respond in the sense that if that's the way the Court reviewed what's going on in Montana as personal jurisdiction, I do not believe it is. I believe Montana speaks in terms of subject matter jurisdiction. And I do not retreat from the statement that if it is subject matter jurisdiction, that in the ordinary sense it would not be able to be conferred on the court simply by the parties agreeing to it.

First of all, the standards that the states have set for waiving their own immunity are matters of state law and the states have adopted a variety of standards so one can't speak of a uniform standard of waiver. But, more importantly, the Eleventh Amendment developed in a different way. This Court in Chisolm said that the states didn't have immunity from suit in federal court. And it took a separate amendment to the Constitution, which now emanates from the federal government to protect the states from suit. It is a federally imposed limitation on the federal court's own jurisdiction that emanates.

But, the Tribal Courts themselves are courts of very limited jurisdiction and it's not clear that saying any court of competent jurisdiction would ratchet down to the Tribal Court, but would rather continue to apply to the state court, particularly when the contract is adopting state law.

They were bound by those rules as much as the tribe was and they simply could not under their agreement bring that confirmation action in Tribal Court. That is why we think under these circumstances that the tribe waived its immunity as to a confirmation suit in Tribal Court. And we think also that the United States discussion of Finney in its brief suggests that if they were to view the arbitration agreement as more than a simple agreement to arbitrate, but to evaluate the incorporation of those arbitration rules, as was the state statute in Finney and as this court considered by reference in Kimmel, that they too would agree that there has been a sufficient pointing to the court that the action should be brought in, that this agreement taken as a whole and interpreted according to the usual rules of construction, clearly indicates the tribe was willing to subject itself not merely to suit generally, but also to suit or more specifically to suit in Oklahoma State Court for confirmation of an arbitration award."

If the Court determines that there has been a waiver, that there is a waiver in the language, certainly the tribe may want to assert that defense again. But, it comes up before this Court with the presumption that authority existed. And certainly, 25 USC Section 81, which was recently amended, clearly contemplates that the tribe's will and can waive their sovereign immunity in the contracts themselves."

The relevant -- page six on the blue brief. The relevant language in the middle of the block quotes is this \"The award rendered by the arbitrators\", I'm skipping \"shall be final and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof\". That reference to jurisdiction thereof has to mean jurisdiction to enter judgment on an arbitration award. So, it is describing a court by reference to a certain kind of subject matter jurisdiction that that court has. When they agree that in effect they will be subject to a court, having that subject matter jurisdiction, and when they agree that they are subject to any court having that subject matter jurisdiction, isn't that a pretty clear waiver and doesn't it go beyond certainly merely an agreement to arbitrate? And doesn't it go beyond merely an agreement to be subject to a court with jurisdiction or with competent jurisdiction? Isn't it pretty darn specific in identifying courts by reference to a certain subject matter?"

Any contract is presumably enforceable in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

The suit was brought in Pennsylvania and they said New York law doesn't -- this is going to be construed under New York law, therefore you cannot get punitive damages.

    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Kiowa Tribe, this Court recognized that Indian tribes enjoy sovereign immunity from suit in state courts with respect to both the governmental and commercial activities. In deciding whether a tribe has waived that immunity, this Court applies the same stringent standard that is applied -- that it applies in determining whether a state, or the United States, has waived its immunity from suit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "What is the authority for that, Mr. Garre? Was that said in the Kiowa case?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Well, certainly this court in the Santa Clara Pueblo case --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "That was just dicta, wasn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "The Court said that the test was unequivocal expression. And the Court has in the Potawatomi case said the test was a clear waiver which certainly we view as being the same as an unequivocal waiver. And the court even in the Kiowa case cited Santa Clara Pueblo with approval."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But, you think clear waiver necessarily means the same standards that are required for a waiver by a state under the Eleventh Amendment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Well, we certainly don't mean that unequivocal means one thing for a state and one thing for a tribe. The court has expressed the standard as unequivocal expression and the Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, the court addressed the question of whether because Indian tribes had different attributes of their sovereignty than the states, or the United States, a different waiver standard ought to apply."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But, what's unequivocal? It may mean something different when you're talking about a state court and when you're talking about a Tribal Court. For instance, if I read this clause about, you know, you can bring suit in any court having jurisdiction thereof, if the tribe were taking the more limited position, which I gather the United States is, that this was at least an agreement to suit in the Tribal Court. Okay. If I had this agreement with a state, I would think that it might be limited to just the state court. But, if I entered into this agreement with a tribe with respect to real estate off of the tribal reservation, the notion of a Tribal Court just wouldn't enter into my mind when it spoke about in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Well --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I mean, what's unequivocal depends on what you have in your -- maybe I'm not enough of a westerner. I don't know. But, a Tribal Court wouldn't occur to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Well, that sort of interpretation I think goes beyond the four corners of the document that the Court would be construing. And this Court in finding unequivocal waivers has always limited its analysis to the language of the statute of contract. Here, that would be applying an understanding or a belief about the availability of jurisdiction in Tribal Court, about whether Tribal Courts exist. And that, we don't know from the record in the case. And that I'm not sure it'd be reasonable in the case --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No. I'm assuming they exist. I'm assuming they exist. But, I'm still saying the reasonable import of that language, the unequivocal import of that language with regard to a state might well be that you can only bring suit in the state court. I am not sure that it would be the same when you're dealing with a tribe simply because who thinks of any court having jurisdiction thereof as a Tribal Court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "But, the Court of course has said that in the context of the state in the Kennecott Copper case and in the College Savings case. And we think that that makes sense as a rule of construction, that a sovereign as a presumption would only intend to consent to suit if it were going to consent to suit in its own courts and not another sovereign's courts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but doesn't that presumption operate in circumstances in which the state is making agreements in the state context. The state is making agreements for work to be done in the state. And if here the agreement were for work to be done on the reservation, you would have a stronger argument. But, here the agreement is for work to be done outside the reservation on non-Indian lands. And doesn't that bring us back to what Justice Scalia said? That if you've got a contract within its four corners makes it clear that you're contracting about work to be done outside the reservation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Well, of course --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It doesn't have the implication that it's a waiver only as to Tribal Courts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "No, we don't believe that it does. Because the Court has held squarely and most recently in Kiowa Tribe that the on the reservation - off the reservation distinction doesn't work for purposes of tribal sovereign immunity. This contract was entered into with the tribe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "You know, but it's the -- but the question is what does unequivocal mean here? What is clear here? And it seems to me that what is clear here will perhaps vary depending on whether the subject matter of the contract is subject matter on reservation or off reservation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "But, we don't think that the Court has drawn that distinction or should draw that distinction in this case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Why isn't it a sensible distinction to draw? In other words, we're trying to find meaning here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "The contractor -- the contract was entered into with the tribe. The fact that the particular property underlying this contract was not on the reservation doesn't add or subtract any ambiguity from the language that's in there, which is again any court having jurisdiction language. It doesn't answer the ambiguity that this Court identified in Kennecott Copper --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But, it also might be helpful, at least to me I would think, if any tribe is supposed to be Tribal Court. I would like to know. Do Tribal Courts normally handle arbitration matters or don't they? You represent the Interior Department. I would imagine that they must have discussed this with you. So, are there normally arbitration matters in Tribal Courts or are there not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "The record in this case doesn't reflect that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I know. But, that isn't a matter of the record. It's a matter of what the Interior Department and the government would represent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "I'm not prepared to make a representation on that. It is clear, however, that this court and Congress has recognized that Tribal Courts are perfectly competent and capable of adjudicating important personal and property rights."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But, this contract does refer to application of the rules of the American Arbitration Association and it makes some reference to the state act. Both of those in turn refer to at least state court and in the American Arbitration Association to state or federal court. Now, why isn't that part and parcel of the contract then? We know what it referred to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Of course, it would require the Court to go beyond the contract to interpret it, which is -"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I don't think so."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No. It refers to it within the contract itself. It asked the parties. The parties agreed that's what's going to be binding."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "The contract provides that arbitration shall be in accordance with the rules. If that's all that were here, then the separate arbitration enforcement provision would not be necessary. And moreover, whatever ambiguity that is resolved by the fact that the rules provide for jurisdiction in a federal or state court, the fact that the contract omits that language simply reintroduces the ambiguity back into it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Just on this whole issue, you're arguing that this might be in Tribal Court. But, the tribe represented to us 12 minutes ago that it was not waiving its immunity in a Tribal Court. So, this is just a red herring that you're entered into it seems to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "We don't think so. We believe that the party's intent should be determined from the language in the contract as in any other contract case. And in reviewing this language, we believe that the language does not unequivocally express the tribe's --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes. But, didn't the agreement incorporate the rules of the American Arbitration Association which refer to federal or state court and don't mention Indian Tribal Court?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "As I said, the agreement says arbitration shall be in accordance with that. There would be no need for the separate enforcement provision of the clause if the reference -- if the parties thought that the reference to the rules alone resolved that. And the fact that the contract doesn't contain the federal or state court limitation that's in the rules simply introduces ambiguity as to whether the parties intentionally omitted that. Now, with respect to the choice of law provision, we don't think that the separate choice of law provision itself can unequivocally express the tribe's consent to suit in state court. And moreover, the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act by its terms is inapplicable to the contract in this case because that act only applies to agreements which provide for arbitration in this state. And the agreement in this case did not provide for arbitration in Oklahoma. So, that act doesn't apply."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, why couldn't you say it provided for arbitration in Oklahoma by virtue of the fact that it could be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "I think that gets back to the question of what courts would have competent jurisdiction. But, it is -- given the plain meaning to the language, providing for jurisdiction in this state we think that the conflict - that the law requires that the arbitration contract provide for arbitration in Oklahoma. That's not uncommon in this context."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "First I thought that in winning this case, the tribes would lose the war because they'd have an awfully hard time getting people to contract with them. In general, what contractors will go into this kind of thing with your fine spun arguments being used against them?"

      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Some tribes --"
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So, what is your answer to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARRE",
      "speech": "Some tribes, like some states, and the United States after 80 years of its existence, have decided to waive immunity from suit in breach of contract actions. The Navajo Nation has done that in its laws. Each tribe will have to make that determination in whether or not to waive its immunity from suit in any given case. In Kiowa Tribe, this Court recognized that Congress was in the best position to weigh the competing policy concerns and reliance interests in this area. The Court has consistently recognized the unequivocal expression standard. We don't think that unequivocal should mean one thing in the case of the states, which even here today has acknowledged this type of language would not waive their immunity from suit in federal court and should mean another thing for the tribes."
