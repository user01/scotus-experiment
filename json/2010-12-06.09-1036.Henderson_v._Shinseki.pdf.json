    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Circuit's decision in this case forecloses judicial review when the very disability for which a veteran seeks benefits prevents the veteran from filing a timely appeal with the Veterans Court. That decision is wrong, and for three reasons the court of appeals erred in holding that the deadline at issue in this case is jurisdictional. First, the statute contains no clear indication that the deadline is jurisdictional. Rather, the text and structure point away from a jurisdictional And, third, a jurisdictional reading would render some of the most disabled of veterans the least likely to obtain benefits and would treat veterans worse off than almost all litigants in our Federal system."

    "speaker": "BLATT",

And the most closely analogous context of an appeal of agency action to a court of first review is a Social Security context.

It calls it bringing a civil action -­ Justice Scalia, if Congress that passed this statute wanted to pick up on the jurisdictional rule under 28 U.S.C. 2107, presumably it would have written a statute that looks something like that statute with the safety valves. Of course, when a -- all litigants, civil litigants who are appealing a district court judgment to a court of appeals, they have a jurisdictional deadline, but the district court can extend it for good cause or excusable neglect or when the party lacks notice of an adverse judgment. More importantly, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure cure the situation when a litigant timely files his appeal but does so in the wrong forum. In this statute, Congress knew how to incorporate the jurisdictional rule of Bowles. It did so in a separate provision of the statute in 7292(a). It said when a litigant wants to go from the Veterans Court and appeal that decision to the Federal Circuit, the litigant has to follow the time and the manner it also goes on to say if you want to appeal to this Court, you have to apply for certiorari.

None of those words have \"jurisdictional.\" And if Congress was just thinking of the word \"notice of appeal,\" it -- I mean, the term has a non-jurisdictional meaning in the criminal context. But if you just look at this statute, which says -- it's directed just at the litigant's obligation to file his -- his appeal within a certain time line, and there's actually a completely separate statute that speaks to the power of the court, the Veterans Court, 7252(a), and that makes no reference to the 120-day deadline.

They were very esoteric situations, like an order from the Department of Agriculture. I mean, maybe the Government has different. What you mostly see is the Hobbs Act context, where you're talking about either an organic statute or 28 U.S.C. 2344, which is just a simple petition for review. That doesn't even use the word \"notice of appeal.\" So this case is not going to dictate a whole lot, except for the veterans context, where not only do you have the standard lack of indication that this is not jurisdictional, but you have the unique features in that Congress established this court to open the door to veterans seeking disability benefits, and it would just conflict with that purpose to, at the same time, shut the door when the veteran's disability prevents him from getting to the courthouse."

And you have to keep in mind that this is the type of extra time we're talking about. An extra 30 to 60 days would be an extremely poor and unlikely means for Congress to address the type of situation where equitable tolling might be needed, which is either because the Secretary has held onto the notice of appeal understand, but I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for -- I mean, when he loses below, he gets a notice that says specifically he has to file an appeal with this court, doesn't it?

And that is, the first, is that this is an extremely favored class of litigants. These are veterans who have fought for their country and who are seeking service-connected disability benefits. This is also the veterans' first opportunity to get to a court, which is true in the Social Security system. And, importantly, the vast majority of veterans go to the court without counsel. The numbers are over perhaps, the other way is that it's not a real adversarial system before you get to that stage.

This would completely counter that purpose, to say: Here's a court; we have built it for you, but if you can't get up the courthouse steps, that's too bad.

But let's take this case, because it's a good example. The doctor said he was -- he's paranoid schizophrenic, so he's having periods, and what -- to quote the doctor that was submitted to the Veterans Court, he had episodes of what was basically called psychomotor retardation and total inability to function, and at other times he was just simply disorganized, had difficulty with recall and memory. So he wrote a handwritten note within 15 days saying: I've been on and off. And he was obviously extremely heavily medicated. If I could reserve the balance of my time. please the Court: In Bowles v. Russell, this Court reaffirmed its longstanding treatment of statutory time limits for the taking of appeals as jurisdictional. Section 7266(a) imposes a 120-day time limit on the taking of an appeal to the Veterans Court, and under the rule reaffirmed in Bowles, that time limit is a limit on the court's jurisdiction, and the judgment of the court of appeals should be therefore be affirmed."

Now, that's something the Court seemed to emphasize. And here, when I looked at this statute, I noticed there are no exceptions written into it.

The extension provision that was specifically at issue in section 2107 in Bowles hadn't -- wasn't even enacted until 1991.

Now, you've listed -- and Bowles, I thought, left that open. But -- but if it does leave it open, and I'm looking to those factors, you've mentioned one: That this is a long period of time, 120 days.

So there's an express jurisdictional hook. And I think Justice Scalia points out an interesting fact on -- I think it's safe to say, in 1988, Congress wasn't sitting down thinking is this deadline jurisdictional; they're subject to equitable tolling. What we had is a period where veterans were not given judicial review. We had World War II and the can we not treat our nation's veterans the same? Now -­"

There is no question he had somebody helping him, a veteran's service organization process."

I understand, and I'm just telling you that my understanding from not only just the amici briefs, that they do not have anything to deal with the court, is that the veterans organizations don't have notice. They are the ones that are filing in this case telling you that this decision will be disastrous for them. But even if they do, they are uncounseled. They are not lawyers."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "And I understand the Government representing that there's notice, and I'm telling you that is not my understanding; that when he said authorized representative, I don't think that that meant veterans service organization. I may be wrong. It sounds like we have a different understanding. But if I can get back on to what is really before this Court, is that when there's no indication, all we have is the three words \"notice of appeal\" when jurisdiction. And the question is: Was Congress thinking about the type of people who appeal district courts to courts of appeals? Yes, they were, but they made separate provisions for that. Or were they thinking about the Hobbs Act, which deals with licensing of nuclear power plants and orders by the FCC, and has an express statement in the text that it's jurisdictional? I doubt that -- I think it is safe to say that Congress was not thinking about any of those contexts. They were trying to give veterans their day in court. And this decision would say no matter what the circumstances are, they are deprived. Now, there was some discussion on the 120-day deadline. I think another thing that is very safe to say is that time is not of the essence in the veterans system. It never has been. One hundred and twenty days is a blink of an eye. It's true that Social Security are given 60 days and other appellants are given 30. don't even -- the Government doesn't even contest these because it has to be based on the record before, and all we're talking about is an extra 30 days or 60 days."
