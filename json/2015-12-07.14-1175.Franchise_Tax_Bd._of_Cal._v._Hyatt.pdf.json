As a result, critics of the Constitution were quick to point out any possibility that the States could be haled into court by individual citizens without their consent in order to secure potentially bankrupting judgments. When this Court opened up the possibility of just such a judgment by allowing Chisholm, a South Carolina citizen, to sue the sovereign State of Georgia in this Court, the nation quickly and emphatically reacted with the Eleventh Amendment that eliminated the possibility of such a suit even in this most neutral of Federal forums. Regardless of all that, Respondent's position is that, if Chisolm has turned around and sued Georgia in South Carolina State court, and South Carolina in its unreviewable discretion decided to exercise jurisdiction over the sovereign State of Georgia ­­"

Even to this day, we couldn't sue France over the exact same situation today. But I don't think the way that this Court's cases apply the law of nations is the right way of thinking about this.

Every one of those cases with the ­­ every one of the Federal court cases and indeed every State sovereign immunity case, with the exception of ­­ of ­­ of Alden against Maine is a case that's applying sovereign immunity as of comity. Because the new Federal court system is a foreign court system. The sovereigns did not have sovereign immunity as of right in any distinct court system of a superior sovereign or of an independent nation. So when this Court says, well, the States had sovereign immunity and they didn't sacrifice it in the Constitution, they're not talking in those cases about sovereign immunity as of right; they're talking about sovereign immunity as of comity.

I would take that. That's fine. That's true, they are different issues. I do think they create one anomaly after another. I mean, Chisholm can't sue Georgia in a perfectly neutral Federal court; Chisholm can't sue Georgia in Georgia court; but Chisholm can sue Georgia in the least neutral court available, the State of South Carolina. That doesn't make any sense. There is also the anomaly that apparently, Alden's mistake was suing Maine in Maine court. If Alden would have sued Maine in New Hampshire court, probably for Federal law or maybe for State law, then that suit could have gone forward. It is also anomalous that the tribes apparently have greater immunity than the States, even though they're inferior sovereigns, because you apply these same principles to recognize tribal sovereign immunity.

Because your ­­ I mean, I ­­ I do ­­ that's ­­ I'm finding that rather hard, and it seems to me intuitively at some level correct that a State like Nevada should not be able to give less sovereign immunity to California than it gives its own officials. So I thought, well, where in heaven's name does that come from? And that's what's bothering me, and I'd like a theory. I have ­­ all I have so far is this: Full faith and credit, two statutes, sometimes exist. And there is also, when you're giving full faith and credit, the competing principle that, if you have a policy of your own State that cuts the other way and it's reasonable and so forth, you don't give full faith and credit. And here, if you're following that kind of principle, the same kind of principles in the Congress clause too, you would say, fine. Nevada, since it doesn't give its own people the sovereign immunity, doesn't have to recognize California's because of the public policy it's following. But as soon as they run out of sovereign immunity, which is at $50,000, I think, now they have no reason, and therefore they have to follow California's law. Now, I raise that because it's in the back of my mind. I've been thinking about it. And I don't find in the briefs either that theory or a competing theory about why you can't ­­ you ­­ you see where I'm going?"

But then they ­­ when they start to apply Nevada's law of sovereign immunity, they get to the point where there's a 50,000 damage cap and they say ­­ unbelievably in my view ­­ but they say, oh, well, this statute only applies to Nevada's government agencies.

So his position ultimately is the sovereign is worse off than the citizen, which can't be right. Now, I think there are two ways to respond to that complete anomaly. One is to say that, although maybe it's not right there in the text of it, that the principles of Article IV's Full Faith and Credit Clause provide the same principle, the same protection that the Privileges and Immunities Clause applies to a citizen. But I think ultimately the better way to look at it is to say the reason the framers put the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the unamended Constitution is they realized States could be sued in other States' courts. So there was a vulnerability they needed to address. They simultaneously implicitly recognized that there was no way on earth that a sovereign could be sued in another State's court because of age­old sovereign immunity principles. So they didn't feel they needed to give express protection to the sovereign the way they did to the citizen."

And the other is I want to subject another State to my court system when I feel like it, and I want the choice of doing that or reaching an agreement with another State that we should all treat each other nicely. So on your view, the States are giving up some significant sovereignty interest. They're keeping one, but they're also giving up one.

Because the authority to bring in a foreign sovereign into your court was unthinkable to that generation as a flat violation of the law of nations. And if they did it, it would be committing an act of war. And that's exactly like the other things that they gave up. The second reason I think it's glaringly obvious, though, is that, on the one hand they give up something that's inchoate and a violation of the law of nations.

It is true that they were not ­­ the States had not exercised their power, if we're talking about the late 1700s. They ­­ they'd only had the power for ten years, but they ­­ they hadn't exercised the power to subject other States to their jurisdiction. Nathan v. Virginia is an example where, with the intervention of the Pennsylvania executive officials, the Pennsylvania courts said, no, we're not going to exercise jurisdiction over Virginia. But the other side of that, of course, is that they always had immunity as a ­­ as a matter of comity from the other States. So if one is looking at the question of how do we think about this, looking back in time, several hundred years, what decision would the States have made? The answer is we really don't know.

Up to that point, the courts ­­ I mean, the courts of the various States ­­ were treating the other States as immune. There weren't very many suits filed, but immune as a matter of comity. But that, of course, is exactly what the relationships between these sovereigns are all about. If one goes back and starts with a foundational decision, which is Schooner Exchange, Schooner Exchange is a very important decision about sovereign immunity, but it's also, and principally, a decision about sovereignty. And what Schooner Exchange says is that each sovereign within its own territory has exclusive and absolute authority. And therefore, if another sovereign is going to come into that territory and act contrary to the laws of the sovereign, it can only do that with the consent of the home sovereign. That's the principle on which all of this is based. So this ­­ although there are obviously two sovereigns involved, and a sovereign interest in each case, an interest in immunity on the part of the visiting sovereign, an interest in having its exclusive authority over its territory over the home sovereign, Schooner Exchange actually tells you the answer if they come in conflict, because the requirement of consent of the home sovereign is what is ultimately predominant."

The Board's suggestion, I think, is what the Court really just needs to do now is put the third leg on the immunity triangle. It's already made clear that States have immunity in their own courts, which is the English tradition, and that States have immunity in Federal courts. That's the Eleventh Amendment. So all, really, the Court should be doing now is to draw the last part of that and say they have immunity in the courts of other States. But those are all different situations. They ­­ the States have immunity in their own courts, just as nations do, because they are the sole sovereign involved there. There aren't two sovereigns when you're talking about immunity in your own courts. So that's one separate thing. Now, to get specifically to the question you're raising, Justice Scalia: Immunity in the Federal courts, which is broader than the language of the Eleventh Amendment. And of course, the Federal courts are courts of a different sovereign, in a sense, than the State courts. But at the time that the Constitution was being drafted and the question of ratification came up, this was an issue that was specifically discussed. And therefore, when the States were concerned about ratifying the Constitution because of their war debts, they raised questions, and the Framers, like Madison and Hamilton, so on and so forth, gave them assurances.

State ­­ nations can be sued in the United States under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act for commercial torts ­­ I mean ­­ excuse me ­­ for commercial activities, for certain torts, without their consent.

When you're ­­ to go back again to the formation, Justice Kagan, if ­­ if one is looking at the situation that the States were facing at that time, they're forming a new union. So they get a say in this because they have to ratify it before it actually exists. So when they're looking at this, what do they see? They see a sovereign that is going to be a superior sovereign. What does that mean for sovereign immunity purposes? It means that, if that sovereign is sued in the States ­­ in the State courts, the States have to dismiss the suit. There is no principle that is any clearer than the fact that a superior sovereign cannot be brought to answer in the courts of inferior sovereigns. So that's ­­ that's the state of play.

Now, that doesn't seem intuitively right, but if I look at the Constitution, I see it says this. It says: \"Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts of other States.\" California has a public act which gives immunity. Nevada is not giving full faith and credit to that. I think those acts can sometimes include statutes or common law rules or decisions of courts. So I say, how does Nevada get away with that? Answer: Because they have a strong public policy in not doing it; namely, the policy of they don't give anybody, including their own officials, that kind of immunity. If that's the answer, that answer runs out of steam at the very point that they try to give officials more immunity than California is giving.

    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "The original argument ­­ the fact is that the Board has changed its argument about full faith and credit, and that's why it's confusing. In its brief, originally, the Board said we're asking that Nevada apply California's law of immunity. Now, they can't ask them to ­­ ask that it be applied totally, because that was already rejected in Hyatt I. So they say above the $50,000. That's what we're saying, apply California's law of immunity above the $50,000 mark. In their reply brief, however, at pages 4 and 5, they're emphatic that they're not asking the Court to apply California law at all. They say we're asking that ­­ that Nevada's law of immunity be applied. Well, that, in its literal term, simply doesn't work. California's law of immunity doesn't apply to California. So what ­­ what the Board is groping for is some sort of loose principle that the Court could apply to override a State's judgment about how to apply its own laws of immunity, all in the interest, I might note, of promoting State sovereignty. But leaving that aside, the question is where would that come from. If ­­ let's ­­ let's assume, hypothetically, that ­­ that California brought an original action in this Court, and it said we want an injunction ordering ­­ ordering Nevada to apply its damages cap to all suits against California in Nevada courts. This is assuming the Court doesn't overrule Nevada v. Hall, as I certainly hope it doesn't. What would the basis in Federal law be for that lawsuit? The only basis that I see in their brief in Federal law is the Full Faith and Credit Clause. And for the reasons I've explained, if you apply the standard Full Faith and Credit constitutional provision, that does not help them. Comity is a voluntary doctrine among States. And their equal­footing doctrine seems miles away from anything we're talking about. Secondly, even if the Court had the power, some Federal law, generally ­­ maybe Federal common law, which is always something the Court, I guess, can create if necessary ­­ why would they particularly choose this rule? Because, although it sounds perfectly logical, and it is a benchmark. I mean Nevada uses it not without this one exception, but Nevada uses it to knock down punitive damages claims against negligence, all of that. As a benchmark, it's a perfectly fine rule for States to choose. But as a mandatory Federal rule to impose on the States, it's not quite so good."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
      "speech": "It's a little odd that the Nevada courts say comity as far as punitive damages is going ­­ we're not going to slap California with punitive damages, but no comity before ­­ above 50,000."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "Well, I think that ­­ its explanation of that actually makes quite good sense. They say, you know, when we're compensating our people, we're not just compensating. Compensation serves two purposes. It serves ­­ the compensation, it helps the person, obviously, cope with their injuries. And I should, by the way, point out that under the overruling of Nevada v. Hall, anybody injured by a State gets nothing. It's just ­­ but that's a digression. But back to the main point, when ­­ when you're talking, however, about a situation with the officials of another State, we also want ­­ we have an element of protection, trying to protect our citizens. We don't need the same protection from our own government. We hire these people, we train them, we supervise them. We can keep things from getting out of hand like they did here where somebody just sets out on a vendetta against a particular taxpayer. We can stop that, but not when it's another State. So the idea of having more compensatory damages in order to discourage that kind of behavior, it actually seems to me quite reasonable."

But just let me take the ­­ the example, though, of California and Nevada, because again, if we're looking at equality here, which is supposedly what the equal treatment principle is all about ­­ and I put \"equal treatment principle\" in quotes. If we're looking at that, another possible way of looking at things which States and nations have done for years is reciprocity. Now, if you look at this case from the standpoint of reciprocity, what do you look at? Well, you ­­ that brings in Nevada v. Hall. And in Nevada v. Hall there was no cap on damages. Nevada was subjected to unlimited damages in California. That's exactly the same thing that happened here. California was subjected to unlimited compensatory damages."

But if you're looking at the relationships between the two States, which is what we're looking at here, and the question of how States treat each other, reciprocity actually is more important. It's no solace to Nevada to say, well, you had to pay unlimited damages in California, but they only have to pay $50,000 to your citizens because they have a different rule. That doesn't help. Nevada is being treated unequally, whether ­­ whether the California rule is different or not."

    {
      "speaker": "FARR",
      "speech": "To be honest with you, I have my doubts about that. I ­­ I suspect the subject would never come up. But in talking about this idea that there could be something that ­­ that this Court could impose on the States, there are things, for example, that could be drawn from international law that might, in fact, provide some sort of check, if they were truly universal values. Equal treatment is not a universal value. For example, United States is exempt in its own courts for torts based on battery and assault, and false arrest. Foreign sovereigns are not. Under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the foreign sovereigns do not have immunity for those same torts. So if there is an equal treatment principle at large in the world and is universal, then that seems to me to be something that the United States cannot do. But nobody suggests that that's inappropriate because these are all comity based. Ultimately, sovereigns can serve their own interests if they're willing to accept the possibility that other sovereigns will do that as well. So when ­­ when I go back to this idea is there something out there, I don't think one can ever completely rule that out when you're talking about arrangements among States and among sovereigns, because there is Federal common law. But there is no principle ­­"

      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three basic points in rebuttal. First of all, my friend on the other side quite rightly points out that the States, burdened with their war debts, were very, very concerned that they would be haled in front of the new Federal courts, so they sought an assurance. And the clearest place to see the assurance that they got is Federalist No. 81, where Alexander Hamilton makes clear that there's nothing to worry about here because they have sovereign immunity. And they have sovereign immunity as an inherent aspect of their sovereignty. And that assurance then becomes the postulate that this Court applies in Hans against Louisiana, and applies in Monaco against Mississippi, and all of these other cases where the immunity that's provided by the Constitution is actually greater than the text of the Eleventh Amendment. The assurance and the postulate are one and the same. Now, it may be that in the world of international relations, we've wandered away from the Hamilton Federalist No. 81 understanding. But I don't think that matters. If it's constitutionalized, as it is in every other context, then the understanding in 1789 is what controls. Now, as to the all­important point of this balance that you referred to, Justice Kagan, I do want to be as emphatic as I can that the States were not giving up anything they thought they possessed. And I came upon a quote from Edmund Pendleton. It explained ­­ talking about sovereignty. And he said the following in 1792 ­­ and if you want to find this, this is Volume 5 of the Documentary History of the Supreme Court. He said: \"I have been taught by all writers on the subject that there is no earthly tribunal before whom sovereign and independent nations can be called and compelled to do justice.\" Now, I think that's pretty emphatic, and I think pretty emphatically suggests that on the one hand, they weren't giving up anything that they could really exercise. On the other hand, they were desperately afraid of these war debts, and they were desperately ­­ wanted to ensure that they would preserve their sovereign immunity. I don't think the balance is even close. And what I think is so problematic about Respondent's position is that he seems to say at the precise moment that the States were going to give up all of the tools that nations used to make comity a reality, that they unilaterally disarmed. They gave up all those tools, and all they got was sovereign immunity as of comity, and which my friend's position makes clear, is as voluntary as can be and is just a matter of grace. There's nothing that supports it."

      "speech": "So I just wanted to finish with some anomalies here because we've talked about a couple of them. We've talked about this idea that the Privileges and Immunities Clause prevent Nevada from doing this to a citizen. Here's another anomaly. Now, my friend suggested briefly as a parenthetical that there's nothing that these ­­ these poor Nevada citizens are going to be able to do. One thing they can do is go to California and sue consistent with California's waiver of sovereign immunity. As we point out in the reply brief, there are some remedies there. But the other thing they can do, as Justice Kennedy pointed out for the Court in Alden, is there is still the possibility of an individual capacity suit against one of the California officers. Now, here's something anomalous: If you sued the California officer, who's presumably a California resident, they would have the protection of removal to Federal court, so they'd at least be given a neutral Federal forum. When my client tried to remove here, they were confronted with Mr. Hyatt's quite correct objection that the Eleventh Amendment prevented removal to Federal court. But, my goodness. You have now converted the Eleventh Amendment, clearly designed to enhance the sovereignty into the States ­­ of the States, into what Chief Justice Rehnquist called in Hall an albatross around their neck, that they are the one party that is least favored, even compared to an ordinary litigant. That can't be right. And of course, the granddaddy of all of the anomalies here is that the idea that Chisholm could have sued Georgia in South Carolina State Court. This Court doesn't lightly overrule its precedents, but when it's faced with an anomaly that dramatic and that inconsistent with the founders' understanding, it's time to overrule."
