      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: South Carolina seeks an equitable apportionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River. Both States act as parens patriae on behalf of all users of the river within their boundaries. For three reasons, this Court should not adopt the Special Master's recommendation that Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply Project be permitted to intervene as parties in this original action: First, the report articulates the wrong legal test for intervention. Second, under the New Jersey v. New York standard, none of the three entities should be permitted to intervene. And, third, the report's approach to intervention involves this Court in deciding intramural disputes between and among water users in one State. With respect to the first point, the Special Master applied the wrong factors, we would submit, in deciding whether or not a party or an intervenor should be allowed to intervene as a party. The Special Master sought to distill from this Court's cases three principles that we would submit are not the appropriate principles in deciding an intervenor's status. First, the report overemphasizes the, quote, \"direct stake,\" although the master found that the equitable apportionment had no specific impact on individual users of the water."

      "speech": "Your Honor, part of what you will be deciding in this case is the appropriate standard for intervention, and the Special Master, we respectfully submit, did not apply the New Jersey v. New York factors. Instead, the report distilled from other cases, not the New Jersey v. New York case, the principles that she thought should apply to govern an intervenor's status, and those three principles, we would submit, are incorrect. Under the New Jersey v. New York standard, the master did not make findings that would be appropriate to determine the intervenor status here as appropriate parties. There was no finding of inadequate representation by either State to support any of the intervenor’s request to participate as parties. There was no finding of a compelling interest in the sense that it was truly compelling. It's hard to argue in cases in -- where there is no case from this Court in the equitable apportionment area that three intervenors would have met the compelling interest standard here. And, finally, the New York-New Jersey standard talks about having interests that are apart from other interests. But both Charlotte and the Catawba River Water Supply Project are simply acting on behalf of all users of North Carolina water. They simply happen to be the largest ones."

In the Maryland case, the Court permitted intervention in a situation in which Louisiana had sued the pipeline companies in Louisiana State court for a declaratory judgment that its tax was constitutional. There was also a pending FERC action in Federal court in Louisiana raising the same issue, so when Maryland and eight other States who were not parens patriae of the various pipeline companies who sought to intervene filed the original action, I think the Court appropriately considered that interests of judicial efficiency called for handling the Commerce Clause challenge in the original action in this case.

Their argument, fundamentally, is that Union County, North Carolina, which is the North Carolina part of the joint venture with the Lancaster Water District, should be permitted to have water purchased from the South Carolina side of the boundary. So what's happening with that water project is the water is sucked out on the South Carolina side and piped north for Union County's consumption under a Union County permit with the State of North Carolina. Union County, therefore, is acting as any other user of water, along with Charlotte and all other users of water in North Carolina. The Catawba Project is not here to intervene to protect its interests on the South Carolina side of the boundary. Those are adequately protected, we submit, by the attorney general acting on behalf of the State. So in effect the Union County, North Carolina, claim here of 5 million gallons of water per day which they are seeking to protect through their intervention is no different than the other interests of North Carolina water users that they are seeking to protect --"

It's a series of molecules that do not accord property rights in any one entity or user. They all divine from the State itself. So if North Carolina, in its exercise of parens patriae responsibility, determines that Charlotte should have a larger share than what it currently has, that's a decision for Charlotte -- for North Carolina as a political entity to decide among its users. It does not necessarily implicate this Court's action in an equitable apportionment to say that what the Court will ultimately decide is what Charlotte's share is. That is not what we are seeking, and that's not what an injunction from this Court equitably apportioning the Catawba River would necessarily decide."

So even though the civil rules are not binding in original jurisdiction cases, isn't that a sound approach that we should adopt? Just as a court of appeals would defer to a district judge's decision, so we should give a healthy measure of deference to the Special Master's evaluation that this will be useful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "No, for several reasons, Justice Ginsburg. First, in any appellate review Situation, this Court would review de novo the legal test that would be applied. Our initial submission is the master applied and articulated the wrong legal test. So you would first need to determine, we would submit, what is the correct legal test for submission. That is a de novo review standard. But secondly, the Court has said in numerous original cases it does not apply deference, although it gives appropriate respect to special masters, and so there would be no basis for applying a deference standard to a special master ruling on a question of law that fundamentally is about what this Court's original jurisdiction under Article III is supposed to be about."

It is the rare situation in which a special master would allow intervention. And the only example that the other side can come up with is the Nebraska v. Wyoming case, in which finally Basin Electric, after 10 years of participating in the original action as an amicus, was allowed to intervene because the Special Master viewed there to be tension between the State of Nebraska's interest and that that Basin Electric was seeking to vindicate.

What the Court decided in 1932, Justice Ginsburg, in the Wyoming and Colorado case was that in situations involving interstate allocations of water, the claimants or users of a State are deemed to be represented by the State. The case on which the Court relied in the Maryland case was back into an old era in which it was unclear whether States acting as parens patriae had the responsibility to act on behalf of all claimants or users of water. The Maryland case, as I said before, did not analyze the New Jersey v. New York factors, and I would submit that in light of the other circumstances of the case, the fact that it was a Commerce Clause challenge involving Federal, State, and private companies, in which there was multiple litigation pending in various forums, it was an exercise of the Court's decision to efficiently decide the Commerce Clause challenge to allow those pipeline companies in, where some of those pipeline companies were not represented by States that were parties in the case."

These are the three biggest users of water, at least one of them straddles both States, another has a potential license. And so that each of them has a different situation than a normal water user. So, you're -- all you're begging is the question of whether we just say you can't. But why is the \"you can't\" compelled, either by our case law or by any original jurisdiction principle?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "Well, let's start with the original jurisdiction principle. Those are actions that are brought invoking this Court's original jurisdiction, which this Court could sit without a special master and would decide the matter as it sits as a court of nine. The fact that it appoints a special master to assist and facilitate that effort does not imbue the actions of that person delegated that responsibility with something akin to the deference given to district judges in making various fact findings. Secondly, on a question of law, as intervention fundamentally is -- and ultimately we are talking about the scope and contours of this Court's exercise of original jurisdiction -- what the Court has said is that there are two interests that are ultimately being protected: One is the dignity interest of the State acting in its sovereign capacity on a subject, water, that quintessentially is sovereign; and it is doing so for judicial efficiency purposes, because it allows the Court to expect each State to represent adequately all of the users of water in that State. So, for those reasons, we think that a special master recommendation ought to be reviewed with the same level of scrutiny that all other aspects of a special master’s --"

In an equitable apportionment action, the interest that is at stake is not a private property interest in water. Rather, it is the sovereign interest of a State in a particular share of the waters of an interstate river. For that reason, a private interest in water is not an appropriate basis for intervention in such a proceeding."

The only thing that this Court is deciding is what share of the river does each State get.

It would be entirely appropriate for parties that have information or a special perspective on the case to present an amicus submission to the Special Master or to this Court. And it's -- but that -- that's not a basis for allowing them to become full parties through intervention. And then, to the extent that there's a concern about the management of this case, I think it's important to keep in mind that the rule recommended by the Special Master and the rule that the would-be intervenors are urging this Court to adopt would, of course, apply not just in this litigation, but in every equitable apportionment action. And not only does it make the litigation of those actions much more difficult to have additional non-State parties in, but it makes it much more difficult for those cases to be settled."

And that's inappropriate for the more fundamental reason that these original actions in this Court are not ordinary cases. This Court has said that sitting in judgment between two sovereigns is one of the most grave -- grave and delicate responsibilities the Court has, and it’s a sparingly exercised jurisdiction reserved for the most serious of issues, issues of such importance that, if the States were independent countries, would be resolved through treaties or --"

So State law water rights are taken as a given, and it's up to the licensee to have the necessary State water rights, and a FERC license does not in any way alter the distribution of State law property rights in water. And what the commission has said in this case in the final environmental impact statement with respect to Duke's relicensing application, which is available on the commission Web site, it cited section 27 and it said: \"Any license that is issued will not impose requirements, including minimum flows, that infringe on water rights or apportionments.\" So the commission is aware of the pendency of this case."

New York, which were not entitled to intervene. I would also point out in further response, Mr. Chief Justice, to your question, that Duke is a North Carolina corporation, which may be why it's seeking to come in on the North Carolina side of this case. But I -- I want to return to the idea that these kinds of cases are not ordinary cases. They involve sovereign interests, and I think what's important about that is that the interest --"

They -- they welcomed them in, as I remember the papers."

That was even the dissenters. So you start out with in general it's not wise to let these people come in. And following up on the Chief's question, a State can't be sued without its consent. And it's true here that South Carolina is initiating the action, but it's initiating the action against a sister State. The Special Master's recommendation would require the State to have as its direct adversary three parties who are not a sister State, and that kind of dilutes the notion of original jurisdiction. It's a controversy between two States."

But that is not what has happened in equitable apportionment cases. In New Jersey v. New York, for example, this Court entered a decree, which enjoined the flow of the Delaware River to New York City above a specified level. I think 411 cubic feet per second. And -- and that is the kind of decree that South Carolina, I believe, is seeking in this case. If you look at paragraph 2 of South Carolina's prayer for relief, they want an injunction against the interbasin transfers currently being carried -- carried out by Charlotte and the joint venture. So this --"

I -- you know, in times of drought, this water barely trickles by, and, if it's cut back, the farm is going to go down. It seems to me that, when you say they have a special interest, you are just saying they have got a big interest."

      "speech": "It's not just that it’s -- it’s a big interest, and it surely is, but they are singled out in South Carolina's complaint, and injunctive relief is sought against them, which, I think, brings into the play the rule this Court announced in Kentucky v. Indiana, which is that, if a plaintiff or plaintiff State in an original action is seeking relief against a citizen of a State, that citizen ought to have an opportunity to come into the litigation and defend its interests. That's what Charlotte is seeking in this case. The joint venture, of course, is not represented by either State fully because both States are hostile to at least part of what the joint venture does."

Indiana, if there are improper parties in original action, they -- they can be dismissed, but I think it's noteworthy that the Court allowed the New Jersey litigation to proceed with New York City as a party defendant. And Charlotte's position is truly indistinguishable from the position of -- of New York City in that action, with -- with the sole exception that Charlotte seeks to intervene, whereas New York City was named as a party defendant. South Carolina invokes the principle that it is the master of its complaint, and we would agree with that, in part. A plaintiff is the master of the allegations in claims it seeks to make, but a plaintiff is not a master of the universe of -- of interests that -- that may be affected by the lawsuit they have -- they have brought.

I think that the question whether a proposed defendant -- and of course, you need leave from this Court to file an original action or to name someone as a defendant in an original action.

North Carolina can divvy up its water however it wants."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTOLOMUCCI",

The interbasin transfers take water out of the river basin, and -- and so it doesn't come back to South Carolina within the basin. Other types of uses of water are non-consumptive, in the sense that the water can be treated and eventually gets to South Carolina within that basin.

The first question dealt with Maryland v. Louisiana, and Mr. Frederick responded that that case, in which 17 pipeline companies were permitted to intervene -- according to Mr. Frederick, the States in that case did not serve as parens patriae with regard to those 17 pipeline companies. That is factually incorrect. In that case, two of those pipeline companies -- the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipeline Company was a resident of the State of Michigan, one of the complaining States in that case, as well as the National Gas Pipeline Company of America was an Illinois corporation."

Your proposal was that they be divided 10, 10, and 10. You didn't even want to be here.

That's at page 20, footnote 14, of our motion for leave to file exceptions. The FERC has said it will not affect, in giving its license, the equitable apportionment action now pending before you. In Duke's CRA, at paragraph 39.9, it says it does not affect State water uses.
