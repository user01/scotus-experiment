  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 30 years ago in Argersinger v. Hamlin and then more than 20 years ago in Scott v. Illinois, this Court established the principle that, under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, a State is not obligated to provide an indigent defendant in a misdemeanor case court- appointed and taxpayer-funded counsel, provided that the defendant is not actually imprisoned upon conviction. 8 years ago in Nichols v. the United States, this Court reaffirmed that principle. The Supreme Court of Alabama distorted this well-established and workable rule and held that a probated or suspended sentence, which actually liberates a defendant to return to free society, nevertheless triggers a right to court-appointed and taxpayer-funded counsel. There are three arguments that I would like to address this morning."

    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "Our reading of Scott is that -- that we cannot activate the suspended sentence. We acknowledge that Mr. Fried, as an amicus, certainly has a plausible reading that would allow the court to activate that sentence. In our judgment, that original sentence relates back to the original offense and that the court --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What -- what happens in Alabama if -- if a -- a criminal defendant is convicted of a misdemeanor and placed on probation and then violates probation? Does that enable the State to impose the original sentence for violation of the probation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "Yes, ordinarily it would. But for the problem presented involving an uncounseled defendant, it would allow the State to activate the suspended sentence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, then we're jumping probably ahead into what you're going to tell us, but while we're at this point, it seems to me that if -- if you say that the sentence cannot be reimposed, you're saying that the State courts are in the position of imposing a sentence that is something of a rouse. Why should you put your own courts in this position? I -- I just don't think it's very sound for us to tell the State courts, well, you go ahead and tell these people that they can -- might be put in prison, but that that won't really happen. It seems to me that that's your position."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "Well, there's still a risk of imprisonment, the same risk of imprisonment, under our reading of Argersinger and Scott, that -- that is accompanied with the judgment of a mere fine. Every court has the power to enforce any judgment as an essential aspect of the administration of justice through the power of contempt."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "That's -- that's correct, Justice Souter."

    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "That -- that's correct, Justice Souter. And -- and at a minimum I would say, although I don't think the Court has to ever address this question because there's been no violation of probation -- at a minimum the State would have the same power to enforce its judgment that it would a judgment of a mere fine which this Court held squarely in Scott does not trigger a right to court-appointed --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "From your point of view, General Pryor, what does the State gain as -- as opposed to what the Supreme Court of Alabama said, by following -- following your -- your line of reasoning? I think as Justice Kennedy said, it -- it imposes a sentence, but a sentence that everybody knows can't be enforced."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "The State gains the powerful tool of probation to rehabilitate an offender that the State believes is a good risk, a risk to return to free society who can be rehabilitated, depending on whatever mechanisms of probation have been adopted by the trial court. Meanwhile, the State is preserving its scarce judicial resources to incarcerate more dangerous offenders and provide counsel in more serious cases."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But what -- how effective is probation going to be if there isn't the threat of -- of a sentence in case of probation violation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "I think at a minimum, the probation is going to be as effective as a judgment of a fine because the State is going to still have the flexible power of contempt, whether civil or criminal in nature, to ensure that its orders are followed and -- and will continue to exercise jurisdiction of the probationer during that period of probation."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is it the -- is it the case in Alabama that probation cannot be imposed without a suspended sentence?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Wouldn't -- wouldn't we have at least a more candid system or wouldn't the interaction of Argersinger and -- and the Alabama system, as you view Argersinger, produce a more candid system if -- if we took the position that, no, they can't impose a suspended sentence, and Alabama would then presumably amend its laws so that probation could be imposed without imposing a suspended sentence, and you on your view would have your -- your contempt remedy. We wouldn't be -- in effect, the -- the two systems wouldn't be producing this kind of silly effect of -- of a sentence which everyone realizes as such cannot be imposed."

    "speech": "Well, why is it any more unseemly than the ordinary plea bargain?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",

There's an indicia of reliability there for the State that's not present in this kind of pretrial system. And -- and the States who trust their system to adjudicate innocence or guilt may find that that's a -- that the system that Alabama has is a preferable system."

    "speech": "But Shelton was not given any pretrial diversion. He was convicted, was he not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "That's correct, and Alabama doesn't have it in this context except with respect to drug offenders."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "General Pryor, I can understand a line between a fine and any kind of confinement, and probation may involve no immediate incarceration, but it does involve what could be very significant restraints on the person. So, isn't it more logical to draw the line between money only on the one hand and confinement, be it in jail or under terms and conditions of probation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, I'd say no for a couple of reasons. This Court has recognized that imprisonment is an intrinsically different form of punishment that has special constitutional significance. The probation system is one that is meant more as rehabilitation and not as punishment to give an offender a second chance in free society. And -- and even with the judgment of a fine, as I mentioned earlier, there -- it -- it is accompanied by the risk of imprisonment should the defendant willfully refuse to pay that fine. So, even in that context, in the judgment of -- of a fine, there is at least that risk, the same risk that would exist under the regime that we propose. I do not discount the fact that probation has -- can have serious restrictions on liberty, but it's not the -- the deprivation of liberty, the loss of physical liberty, that is, physical confinement that this Court has held triggers a right to court-appointed counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Under your view, if you enforced the jail sentence through the contempt mechanism and reached the same result, I take it you now have a second jury trial."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "Well, I guess it would be dependent in part on the nature of the contempt proceeding. If it's civil contempt, if it's a direct contempt or an indirect contempt, but if it's criminal contempt, I would imagine -- I say that. In Alabama, a criminal contempt procedure only has a maximum term of imprisonment of 5 days. So, I'm not sure that -- that there would be a right to a jury trial. For more than 20 --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But then -- but then the contempt is -- is really not a substitute of an equivalent for the -- for the imposition of the suspended sentence. They're not equivalent. If it's just 5 days, that's not equivalent to the suspended sentence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "Oh, absolutely. That's absolutely right, although I would argue that -- that the threat of imprisonment is still enough to give the probationer an incentive to follow the orders of the court. It's absolutely correct that there is a material difference between activation of the probated sentence in this case and the use of -- of the criminal contempt remedy that's provided by the code of Alabama. There's no doubt about that. The -- what is at stake in this case is -- is the use of probation, a valuable tool for the States that allow them the freedom and flexibility again to ensure that scarce judicial resources can be preserved for more serious cases to provide counsel and to incarcerate more serious offenders. If there are no further questions from the Court, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Very well, General Pryor. Mr. Fried, we'll hear from you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIED",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: First, if I might just refer to the deferred prosecution point, which was raised by Mr. Duke in his amicus brief and in one of the questions. I think that's a red herring because, as Mr. Duke points out, the deferred prosecution requires the consent of both the prosecutor and the defendant. Obviously, the kind of prosecutions we have here are usually not consented to by the defendant. I think it is --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why -- why is that a red herring? Because I got from your brief the impression that the -- the -- there's a practical problem that a lot of States do without giving people lawyers. Perhaps thousands and thousands of cases say, go plead guilty. We'll give you some light sentence that won't involve prison, but then they attach to that a suspended sentence. And what I wondered is, well, isn't the solution to this to say -- it's called pretrial diversion or pretrial probation or they call it different names, but to say if you violate the condition, what happens to you is not prison, what happens to you is the trial that we haven't yet given you with a lawyer. And I thought maybe that works as a practical matter in a lot of these States in a lot of the cases to which you referred."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRIED",
    "speech": "It -- it does work. For instance, we use it a great deal in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts where there is a quite different rule from -- from the Argersinger rule where in Massachusetts we say if there's a risk of imprisonment, you must get a lawyer. And a number of States have that rule which is perhaps why they also have the deferred prosecution. I say it's a red herring because what we're considering today is not the very best possible system but what is the constitutional minimum. Our emphasis in the brief on Nichols is not in order to show that Nichols somehow resolves this question in favor of allowing the probated sentence and in favor of allowing it then to be activated on violation, but rather Nichols shows that the question is an open one. Nichols doesn't resolve it, but then neither does Argersinger. And I think it's a mistake and it's a mistake the Alabama Supreme Court made to treat Argersinger as having resolved this question. Argersinger made quite clear that there is a continuum here all the way from mere due process, which was the law prior to Gideon, to a criminal -- to the right of a criminal defendant having a counsel in any criminal case. And it picked a point. It picked a point which the Court recognized had a certain arbitrariness, and it picked it for reasons of practicality and fairness. And those considerations of practicality and fairness require no more than that there be counsel if the person is sentenced immediately then and there to prison. The fairness aspect is, as the Illinois court pointed out, that in these cases the defendant carries the key to the prison in his own pocket. Whether he ends up in prison is a matter of his choice whether or not he violates the terms of the probation. That's why I think Mr. Duke enters two more red herrings into the argument. The stay on appeal. Obviously in a stay case, the keys are not in the pocket of the defendant, but in the pocket of the appeals court. And the 30-day or $30 prison which is executed immediately, in those cases the fine is either an illegal fine under the -- this Court's decision in Bierdon -- the person doesn't pay because he cannot, and that is itself a constitutional violation -- or once again, he is imprisoned because he chooses not to pay. And once again, that is the fairness point. The keys are in his pocket. That is a reasonable place to draw the line because of the very important practicalities. The practicalities are the literally millions of misdemeanor cases, the very large number -- it's hard to say exactly what the number is -- the very large number of probationary misdemeanor sentences, and the fact that those probationary sentences overwhelmingly are intended to serve a rehabilitative or preventive function. Don't drive again. Take a anger management course. Go to counseling. And the -- this is meant to keep people out of prison, not to put them into prison. Unfortunately, if you insert a mandatory formality into something which is a little bit like family court proceeding, necessarily you will have a perverse effect. The State has to spend more time, has to spend more resources. It will do this less frequently, but it will make sure it gets more of, if you like, deterrent bang for its buck, and the result will be perverse. This system, as simply a constitutional minimum, allows the States the flexibility which this Court from the beginning, from Argersinger on, has recognized."

It may be in the hundreds of thousands because as -- as we explain in our brief, there are a very large number of persons on probation who did not have lawyers, and given Argersinger, we may assume that they were misdemeanors. So, it's a very large number. But the number of persons who are actually incarcerated for breach of those conditions is quite small. It's in the thousands. And that's why I think it becomes quite practical to offer an attorney to help in that condition, but really I think very confining and perhaps with a perverse effect to require it as a constitutional minimum in the much larger -- very much larger number of cases where the matter is first considered. After all, if the person has to be sent to prison, that's a failure. I thank the Court for its attention."

It seems to me that the background of the Argersinger and Scott cases, of course, are the -- the Powell v. Alabama, Gideon v. Wainwright series of cases. And in those cases, it seems that the Court has established the purpose of the Counsel Clause which if we -- if we reduce to its barest terms is this. The purpose of the Counsel Clause is to prevent, to the extent humanly possible, the conviction of the innocent in an adversary proceeding. That seems to be what Justice Sutherland said in Powell v. Alabama and what Justice Black said in Gideon v. Wainwright, that what is to be done is to eliminate the risk that the innocent may be convicted. And when we come to the Argersinger case, although the -- the Gideon case had -- had spoken of this as being a -- or nobel idea was the -- were the words used -- but I believe spoke of counsel for every defendant in every case as being a constitutional ideal. I think in Argersinger, the Court was faced with the argument of practicability and expense and -- and the other arguments that -- that the State makes in this case, that the mandate can't be absolute, that there must be some accommodation to those arguments.

So, the position that you're urging is kind of a superior justice for the indigents. Counsel, you would say, in every case where, at the end of the line, there may be any jail time, although most people who can't afford counsel do not have counsel in cases of -- of this kind."

  {
    "speaker": "MILLS",
    "speech": "That happens occasionally in Alabama. It used to happen a lot. It's -- it's fairly rare at the present time. But -- but that does happen. That does happen. And, of course, in -- in Alabama, all misdemeanors, except those that are initiated by indictment, the first trial is in a -- a district or municipal court where there's no jury trial. And the jury trial, if there is a right to jury trial, comes only by a -- an appeal and a de novo trial in the circuit court, which is an administrative problem. I don't see that as a -- as a philosophical problem. It's -- it's still the -- most misdemeanors are -- are being tried in courts where there is no jury, certainly all of them in the first instance or most of them in the first instance. It seems that the petitioner's position overlooks the fact that -- that the Sixth Amendment is -- is prophylactic rather than curative. Now, its -- its ideal is to prevent the convictions, not to do something about them after they occur. Now, let me jump right quick to -- to the point that Argersinger deals with it somewhat in that way. Argersinger is what we might call an outcome-based analysis of whether there's a right to counsel. And -- and to that extent, maybe it's -- it's curative rather than prophylactic. But if -- if it is to be outcome-based analysis, certainly it ought to be the -- the total outcome not just the immediate outcome, and if a suspended sentence results in incarceration, when the probation is revoked, that certainly is a part of the -- of the outcome that Argersinger was -- was dealing that the trial judge is required to make some decision on before trial even begins. So --"

Let's assume there's a condition of suspension that says you will be home every night at 9 o'clock to keep you away from the -- you know, the bad influences you've had, and he willfully refuses. I take it your position is that the suspended sentence still cannot be imposed. Is that correct?"

It would -- in fact, it would cost the State a lot of money because of the formalities required in a criminal contempt proceeding. There must be a separate proceeding. I think there probably would not have to be a jury trial, but certainly there would have to be counsel if it is anticipated that imprisonment will be one of the punishments for willfully refusing."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But -- but it would only -- it would only undergo that expense where there has been a breach of the conditions of -- of probation. Whereas, you're arguing that the State must undergo the expense of counsel in all cases. The number of cases where there's a violation of probation is -- is presumably quite small, and -- and to say that the State has to provide counsel in those cases in order to get the contempt sanction is -- is not nearly as much of an imposition as -- as you're urging us to impose."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MILLS",
    "speech": "Well, I would say one thing. Perhaps the -- the number of cases would not be as large as -- as might be anticipated. Presumably in many of the suspended sentence cases, the judge perhaps has already made that decision, this is a possible jail case or this is not a possible jail case. Or if he's made a decision it is a possible jail case, appoints counsel, he may, of course, impose a suspended sentence rather than an immediate sentence. So, perhaps many of the cases are already being appointed counsel. So, the -- the number may not be that large. I thank the Court."

This is a serious offense prosecution. As such, it is a criminal prosecution within the Sixth Amendment. The Sixth Amendment guarantees counsel regardless of the sentence or sanction imposed. There are two reasons why this is so. One is textual; the other is common sensical."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DUKE",

    "speech": "But I thought that the main issue that we had here is the one we've been talking about, is you have to give a person a lawyer when it is a petty offense. And the fact is that there's going to be a suspended sentence. So, what about that question? I mean -- and I -- I thought that Mr. Fried's main point was don't do it because if you say you have to give a person a lawyer, where it's a petty offense and the only key thing is is a suspended sentence, I'll tell you there are 1,800,000 people who have received probation in petty offenses. And there must have been some stick if they violated probation, and that stick is like a suspended sentence. So, deal with it when you worry about the probation violation; don't worry about it up front. That's -- that's what, I take it, is basically the argument. And I've been waiting for you to talk because I thought you might be a person who'd know the statistics. So, you might know if that's really so if -- or which seems hard to get at how many of those $1.5 million walking-around probation people did -- were never offered a lawyer. What's --"

  {
    "speaker": "DUKE",

Scott dealt with the question of imprisoning somebody, but the -- but the fundamental question here that -- that this Court should not allow itself to get embroiled in it to repeat the mistake is to treat this as if this is a trivial case because -- or to put it this way, at some point someone has to ask the question how is it that this defendant in this case had a constitutional right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment because this was a criminal prosecution, but he did not have a right to assistance of counsel."

Wherever the right to counsel line is to be drawn, it must be drawn so that an indigent has a right to appointed counsel in all cases where there's a right to a jury trial.

It's fundamentally unfair to send somebody to prison without giving him a lawyer.

There would be a subsequent proceeding, and there would at least -- this is not a position he's arguing for this morning, but it would be consistent with his position that counsel be provided in that subsequent proceeding."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "There are -- at the bottom line of the Alabama Supreme Court has two phrases in it. The first one, it says, we reverse that aspect of his sentence imposing 30 days of suspended jail time. We reverse."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Then it goes to say, we tell everybody to the trial court vacate that aspect which imposed the suspended jail time. Those are two things. We reverse and we tell them to vacate. As to the first, we reverse that aspect, the State of Alabama agrees because they were there arguing in the Alabama Supreme Court that a real suspended sentence that meant something could be imposed, and here you're saying it's not a real sentence because we can never carry it out. So, am I right in thinking it's the second part that you disagree with and not the first part?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "We're trying to make sense, as we understand it, of -- of the application of the rule of actual imprisonment. And I will acknowledge Mr. Fried may be right, and if so, we would welcome that. But our understanding of Argersinger and Scott is we cannot activate the suspended sentence --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm not really asking about your -- I just want to know if you agree or you disagree with their part which says we reverse that aspect of the sentence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "No. No, Justice Breyer, I don't agree with that. And -- and the reason I don't agree with that is because Mr. Mills said something that I think is correct when he said that the Alabama Supreme Court struck only the suspended sentence and based only on Federal law, and what I contend is a misapprehension of Federal law. But the suspended sentence itself is not a sham. It's a device to allow the court to impose probation, which is at a minimum then fully enforceable through the same power that's available to the -- to any court to enforce any judgment, including a mere fine, which Mr. Mills concedes does not trigger a right to court-appointed counsel. Now, I wanted to address one of the concerns raised by Justice Souter as to the practicality. There are some aspects -- some statistics we know as to the practicalities that are helpful, but I will admit we don't know everything that we need to know. We know that there are approximately 115,000 misdemeanors each year in the State of Alabama. Those are addressed in our reply brief, the yellow brief. We know that approximately 25,000 of those result in supervised probation. We don't know from the administrative office of courts in Alabama how many result in unsupervised probation. We also know in Alabama -- this is not addressed in our brief, but I checked it with -- with information in State government -- that between -- there are between 2,100 and 2,200 attorneys in Alabama who accept court- appointed work. Unfortunately, the fact that we don't know is how many of these cases, whether supervised or unsupervised probation and in misdemeanor cases, involve indigent defendants. But I hope that's at least somewhat helpful."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let me ask you one more question. And I -- I don't imagine your statistics show this, but I want to pass it up. Out of the 115, do we know, A, how many of those were fine-only cases, not suspended sentences, but fine-only cases, and B, how many of those were motor vehicle cases?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "Were -- were?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Were motor vehicle cases because the motor vehicle cases take you out of this problem, I assume, in fine situations because if the fine isn't paid, the motor vehicle -- I mean, the -- the motor vehicle laws simply provide a -- a purely civil administrative means of -- of remedying the problem. And if they are a substantial part of the 115, then the -- the fear of what this will do, in fact, is somewhat -- the Alabama Supreme Court's view is -- is somewhat lessened. Do you know those numbers?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PRYOR",
    "speech": "No, I don't. But -- but I do know that 2,100 lawyers to take -- when we have 25,000 supervised probation and some number in excess of that of unsupervised probation, still means that it's a daunting task. Justice Ginsburg, the point that you raised about the cost of counsel not being incurred by more affluent defendants I think is relevant from this standpoint, when you consider that it is reasonable then for the State to preserve its own resources, just as a more affluent defendant would -- would preserve its resources not to incur the cost of counsel in this kind of circumstance. As to the argument that Argersinger would require the trial judge to inform the defendant that a sentence of imprisonment will not be imposed because counsel is not being appointed, that is not what Argersinger or Scott require. Argersinger and Scott merely deprive the trial court of that remedy upon conviction, but there's no requirement that the defendant be informed of that. As to Mr. Duke's argument that -- that there's a distinction made in those decisions between petty and serious offenses, it's -- it's simply not there, and -- and this is a misdemeanor case. It's clearly a criminal proceeding where the defendant not only enjoyed a Sixth Amendment right to retain counsel, but the record shows that he clearly understood that right to retain counsel. Thank you."
