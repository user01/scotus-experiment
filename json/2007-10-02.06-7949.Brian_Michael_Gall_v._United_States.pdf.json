    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Judge Robert W. Pratt of the Southern District of Iowa sentenced Brian Michael Gall on May 27, 2005, he found Mr. Gall to be an individual who had fully rehabilitated himself by having voluntarily withdrawn from a conspiracy five years earlier, by remaining crime-free throughout that period, by having rid himself of his addictions, by having graduated from college, by having learned a trade, by having built a successful and thriving business. Judge Pratt carefully weighed the Section 3553(a) factors and in a ten-page sentencing memorandum set forth cogent reasons why a sentence of probation would better fit the purposes and factors specified in Section 3553(a) than a sentence of incarceration. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that judgment on the basis of the extraordinary circumstances test that we would ask the Court to overturn today. The Eighth Circuit substituted its judgment for that of Judge Pratt, saying that Judge Pratt had placed too much weight on Mr. Gall's voluntary withdrawal from the conspiracy and in so doing had not satisfied or overcome the extraordinariness barrier."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

    "speech": "No. I wouldn't say -- well, let me -- the district court was certainly not irrational in our view."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "No. But in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, you hesitated in saying that, if the district court had taken the approach of the court of appeals, that would also have to be sustained. But under your analysis wouldn't it have to be unless you're going to argue --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "It would have to be. I hesitated because there -- there might be instances in which, as indeed the government admits in its brief, that the reasons and the facts and circumstances don't logically cohere with the sentence that's given. In other words, if all of the circumstances and facts point a certain way -- in this instance, for example, they point to a downward departure -- and suddenly the judge goes up to the statutory max, that might be an instance in which a court of appeals could say no reasonable judge would have imposed that sentence. There doesn't seem to be a reason for doing so."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "What about the Eighth Circuit, laying aside the extraordinary circumstances test, saying the judge, the sentencing judge gave credit for his leaving the conspiracy, but he didn't blow the whistle, so the conspiracy continued. He could have stopped the conspiracy. And, similarly, yes, he rehabilitated himself, but he earned some 30 to $40,000 in the drug business, and that aided his rehabilitation, and maybe there's some kind of obligation to pay back. So could a court of appeals try to instruct district judges and say: Now, in this factor, leaving a conspiracy, we want district judges to be aware of the difference between one who leaves and blows the whistle and one who lets it continue; and, similarly, one who uses the ill-gotten gains to set himself up in business."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, when someone leaves the conspiracy and blows the whistle, typically, that individual is not charged. The Department of Justice, for example, in its Antitrust Division says that if a corporation or individual comes to it and blows the whistle on, say, a price-fixing conspiracy, that individual is never charged to begin with."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Yes, but the point is that blowing the whistle is -- is not only a voluntary withdrawal, but also something so far beyond the bounds of what prosecutors typically see that that individual, typically or generally is the individual that receives immunity or amnesty in the case. To respond to the second part of your question, with respect to the amount of money that Mr. Gall made, he did not use it, and there's no information in the record that indicates that he built his business on the basis of the use of that money."

    "speech": "There is no indication that he gave it back, or there was no fine attached to it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "No, there was not, and in part because, as the sealed volume of the appendix demonstrates, Mr. Gall did not at that point have money to pay a fine. Remember that he was -- he left the conspiracy in September of 2000. He was not approached by agents until late 2003. He was not charged until 2004 and was not sentenced until 2005."

Each -- all of those cases, I take it, are upheld under your view on appellate review."

Those -- both of those are upheld under your view, I take it?"

Doesn't abuse of discretion at least require a broader view than simply the -- literally the case before the court?"
  },

    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Well, it does require a broader view, and certainly a judge could --"

But -- but -- I hesitate to add that, to the extent that there is a constitutional grounding for individualized sentencing and age is a key factor with respect to individualized sentencing, I -- I want to hesitate and I want to waver. I'm not sure --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But you said -- you said before that, and very definitely, that Congress could fix the case of where one judge said, I'm always lenient on 17-year-olds and the other said, I throw the book at him. You said yes, Congress could fix that. Well, how other than in the way that Justice Alito just proposed?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Well, in response to that question and your earlier question, Justice Ginsburg, certainly Congress could, to fix the entire problem here, could adopt the solution that we proposed in Booker and in Fanfan that to say that -- that in order to enhance a sentence at all, that has -- it has to be a fact found by the jury, what's so-called Blakelyizing of the Guidelines. That's one way to do it. Congress could also, as has been suggested and I believe legislation has been introduced on this, they could make the Guidelines essentially topless, so that there -- so that there was complete --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "If Congress can pass a statute without violating the Sixth Amendment saying age is ordinarily not relevant, then could Congress delegate to an expert agency the authority to make that decision without violating the Sixth Amendment?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Well, it could delegate the authority. There's no doubt about it. And this Court has said it's all right for Congress to delegate the authority to the commission. But the problem, Justice Alito, comes whenever we limit the statutory continuum from zero to the statutory maximum sentence, if we overlay a consideration. If on the extraordinary circumstances test we make the Guidelines the benchmark and we tether or we measure from the Guidelines, we have then set a kind of statutory range. If Congress says to a commission, we want you to develop a kind of mini-guideline based upon age, we think that there might be departure in some circumstances but not other circumstances, that might be an instance where we are setting a kind of ceiling and a floor and a range within the otherwise broader statutory continuum. That's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

    "speech": "Certainly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

    "speech": "So is it right to say if the broad range shows that most of these defendants get a sentence of 10 years in jail and in this case the person got probation, that the court should look for some reasons to explain what the difference, to justify the difference?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Certainly the court should look at the reasons and should look to see whether or not the reasons are rationally grounded in Section 3553(a). But our position is once they are, that's -- that's the end of the matter."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Of course, all these questions only -- only apply to departures downward from the Guidelines, and if you ask the same question with regard to departures upward you do run into constitutional problems when the -- when courts of appeals begin to establish certain facts that have to be found in order to move upward or -- yes, certain facts that justify moving upward. So you end up with a quite skewered system in which there is -- there is vigorous hearty review of departures downward, but -- but very, very slight review of departures upward."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "That -- that's correct, and that's essentially the kind of system that we've got now. This is not a fulsome abuse of discretion review throughout the range of sentencing. What we have now is a -- on this extraordinary circumstances test is a -- and this case is a perfect example of substitution of judgment."

One, this case Poynter out of, out of the Sixth Circuit, where the judge went all the way up to the absolute statutory max in a child pornography -- or rather, a child molestation case, on the ground that, first, the statutory max will take care of any unwarranted disparity. That's not -- that's not really a cogent reason and that would be an abuse of discretion. We have another case out of the -- recently out of the Eleventh Circuit, Valdes, in which -- in which the court departed upwards on the ground of the fact that the check that had been written that -- the fraudulent check that had been written, had been written to the district court. And so the court was angry that its own court had been -- or the neighboring court had been duped."

And now there are several situations: one, different from his fellow judges in the same court; two, different from other judges across the country; three, different from what the Guidelines did initially; four, different from what the Guidelines say after the commission has over and over and over reconsidered the same matter.

And when you put that latter criterion in there, what you're saying, and I think this was Justice Scalia's concern, you're really saying you've got to find that this case is somehow an outlier to the broad range of cases so that the policy does not fit. And that's a different thing from a general disagreement with the policy itself. Isn't that what you are saying?"

What is there about the facts of this case that -- that changes that?"

    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Age is a good example. Justice -- or, excuse me -- Judge Pratt in his sentencing memorandum, said -- cited studies that show that young people's risk inhibition behavior is not quite as well developed as people later on, and that recidivism drops remarkably as you move forward into your 20s. Now, he did not rely on that argument in order to impose the sentence he did. He used that as a contrast to say this where is Brian Gall was when he was a member of this conspiracy and look at where he has gotten to, having fully rehabilitated himself. So that is a means by which a judge can say, you know, the policy of the Guidelines may be that age should be a discouraged factor, but it could be relevant in cases."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",

And it -- i.e., the mind is less -- the brain is less developed in the case of everyone under a certain age. And that amounts, in effect, to a rejection of the policy for a certain swath of individuals, relatively young individuals, for whom the judge is saying age is relevant, the policy says age is not. That's rejection of the policy."

The question presented is about the extraordinary circumstances test and proportionality review. We've been talking a lot about what district court judges can do.

And it says to the district court: You must overcome a presumption against a sentence that is some unspecified distance from -- from the Guidelines. We don't know because we can't estimate exactly how far it's from. But what happens, and what will quickly happen, is that there's going to be a kind of -- maybe in the Eighth Circuit it's one standard deviation; maybe in the Second Circuit it's two standard deviations. But pretty soon we are going to have a kind of Guidelines with a penumbra beyond which you can't go. It is, as was indicated in the Rita opinion, a presumption of unreasonableness.  It says to the district court, you're making a risk if you go outside the Guidelines."

If you saw a judge who said the Guidelines range here is 30 to 37 months for petitioner and I'm going to sentence him to 24 months and the judge gives the same reasons as he gave here, no court of appeals is going to think this requires a particularly hard look or any greater justification than what the judge did. The court will understand that that's what abuse of discretion review means in an advisory system."

But where we disagree, I think, is whether a judge on a court of appeals panel can look at the results reached by the district judge and conclude, this is an excessive sentence on the facts of this case. We think that the judge can do that on a court of appeals and that in order to determine whether a sentence is excessive, a starting point is to compare what the judge did to what the Guidelines range does."

What you're saying is the criterion for fairness is the Guidelines and if you go too far one side or the other of the Guidelines, you're not being fair. That -- that's not -- that's not advisory. That's the Guidelines as a criterion of sentencing."

But appellate review is conducted through the lens of 3553(a) and 3553(a) directs the judge to consider a variety of things in addition to the history and characteristics of the defendant, which is where youth comes in. It also directs the court to consider the severity of the offense and the need for just punishment. It directs the court to consider deterrence considerations, and it directs the court to consider the need to avoid unwarranted disparities between similarly situated defendants, and that's where this court fell down. It's not that what the court said was wholly unreasonable, although in one respect, I think, with the emphasis on withdrawal for the reasons that Justice Ginsburg mentioned, the judge did overstate the point. But the judge lost sight of the fact that this is a defendant who over a 7-month period engaged in a sustained drug conspiracy at age 21, not as an adolescent, and made 30 to $40,000 for that.

I'm not saying that Petitioner is the most culpable defendant that could be sentenced under this statute. This is a statute that carries a range --"

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "This is exactly the kind of case, though, that I think would give tremendous discretion to the district judge. Because, as I just listened to you, you are listing a whole lot of features of it that are very case-specific, that require thorough knowledge of fact and thorough knowledge of the kind of judgment, a kind of individualized judgment, that sentencing judges are supposed to do. And that's what's worrying me about the test that the circuit court gives here. It lumps together things like what you just talked about with other things like: I don't agree with the policy of the guideline, itself. And this is a typical case and, therefore, I think we should look to try to find ways to unpack the sentence that it used, the statement -- you know, the worse it is, the worse the harder you look, et cetera, because that doesn't tell us much at all. It suggests a proportionate test, mathematical, which must be wrong. It must be wrong because the same degree of departure could result from a view of an abuse of a vulnerable victim as could result from a total misunderstanding of what robbery is about. Now, it's not the percentage there that matters. It's the rationale. It is what the judge did. And can you unpack it? We just did in the last discussion try to unpack that, and we continue in the next case to try to do it. What we want -- I think what we want -- is to interpret that word \"reasonable\" so that we get back to a situation where judges do depart when they have something unusual and maybe occasionally when they think the guideline wasn't considered properly, and then the iterative process takes over, going back to the commission. Now, how do we get there?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Let me try to draw one distinction and make a point about proportionality that I think is not encompassed within what you said. There is a distinction between a judge forming a view based on the defendant's character and behavior in front of the court and the history as revealed in the presentence report where the judge has an institutional advantage over an appellate court for obvious reasons. And this was recognized in Koon versus United States. It hasn't changed today. On the other hand, a district court has a disadvantage, really, in formulating broad policy as compared to the Sentencing Commission. Because the Sentencing Commission has the ability to absorb vast amounts of data and to consider the views of all segments of the criminal justice community and to respond to Congress. And it is really the component of the sentencing process where you would expect broad policy to be, as an initial matter, best formulated. Now --"

There are seven different factors listed in Section 3553(a); and the commission, when it formulated the Guidelines, looked at the same sorts of factors and attempted to balance them. This judge here did not devote particularly significant consideration at all to the fact that Petitioner sold 10,000 ecstasy pills, which have the potential for causing significant harm. And he earned a great deal of money out of it. He didn't give the money back. He may have invested it in the house that he bought."

What is reasonableness?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Reasonableness requires more of a balance of the policies and a consideration of the overall goal of the system of achieving uniformity. And I think perhaps the best way to illustrate the point is through a hypothetical similar to the one that Justice Kennedy posed. Suppose that a district judge, confronting Petitioner, said: You were a college student. You had every advantage in life. You were 21; you weren't a kid. You made $40,000 over seven months. And when it suited you, you pulled out, and you did nothing to disrupt the conspiracy. Now, I have a statutory range here of zero to 20. And, although the guidelines call only for 30 to 37 months, I think you should go to jail for 15 years. I don't see Petitioner as really offering a court of appeals or the criminal-justice system as a whole a way for someone to step in and say that's excessive. It doesn't leave room to make reasoned distinctions among the kinds of defendants who violate this statute, and it doesn't provide any check on aberrant or outlier outcomes."

The notion of reasonableness, you know, whether a reasonable person could have given a sentence of this sort despite the fact that it is not what the Sentencing Commission did, that's -- that's something you can work with, but I don't understand what your rule is."

    "speaker": "DREEBEN",

Because it means that every district judge would get the opportunity to say: I've seen the guidelines, but I don't agree; and, as a result, I'm giving the 15-year sentence to Mr. Gall versus all the way down to probation, and the courts of appeals would have to affirm both. Now, I am trying --"

There are -- there are certain -- certain limits where you would -- the example you gave of that kind of an acceleration of the penalty, and I can see giving this person no jail time whatever would be extreme. But if you are trying to get a narrow range of sentences out of the guidelines, it seems to me you're just working in opposition to what our opinions have said which is that the guidelines are advisory. And they're not mandatory."

And the nine courts of appeals that have adopted proportionality review, even if they may have used slightly different words to express it, are -- I think, responding to a fundamental intuition, which is how do I know if the sentence in front of me is likely to be significantly outside the norm. And second, if it is, should I not look for more to sustain it than a sentence that's co-extensive with the guidelines sentence. I think this case is really the counterpart case to the Rita case that the Court decided last term when that judgment of the sentencing court and the district judge -- the sentencing commission and the district judge coincide, courts of appeals can assume it's likely, although not definitely true -- but likely that the sentence is a reasonable one.

And it may be that the sentence doesn't pose that risk at all. But the reasons that the judge gave to justify that sentence should be somewhat commensurate or proportionate to the degree of the variance, otherwise you're basically back to a system where so long as the judge can go through the facts of the case and give a rational explanation of why a sentence should be at that level, there's nothing for the appellate court to do but to affirm."

I see something we've lost. What we've lost is we've sort of pulled across the screen here a rather murky curtain called \"something of a presumption,\" which we can't quite define, which will lead to lawyers making endless arguments about whether this murky curtain -- they're on one side of it or the other. So let's sweep its aside. Let's get to the underlying facts."

    "speech": "Which have usefully facilitated their appellate review. They didn't select the standard because they drew it out of an opinion from this Court. They selected the standard because they considered it essentially a rule of reason. The rule being that under an advisory guideline system, we must accept that there will be considerably less uniformity than under a mandatory system. That's appropriate. But we don't have to accept the proposition that materially outlier sentences that are not supported by an adequate explanation should stand. And if the courts of appeals are told, you go back to the drawing board now, you can't use any kind of proportionality test, I think unless the Court gives them something that will allow them to distinguish between a materially out of guideline sentence that is reasonable and one that is not, the ultimate result will be every district judge knowing that in their courtroom, they can decide whatever they like about the fundamental policies of sentences, and it will stand. The reason why the sentencing guidelines system was originally adopted was to eliminate each district judge operating purely on that judge's philosophy."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "We were making progress? I thought our last discussion -- we were making progress on this very point, where we have the judgmental matters, the fact finding matters, and the pure policy matters, and we distinguished the latter from the first two? If you were a district judge, wouldn't you find it more enlightening to talk in those terms?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "No. I think that what the district judges need to understand is that they're not bound by the guidelines, but the guidelines remain something that is a reference point, that if deviations or variances are warranted, they should be explained, and they should be explained in a way that's consistent with the degree of the variance. Because the alternative of wholesale abdication to the district judge to assess the individual facts of the case means that one district judge can conclude that a defendant like Mr. Gall warrants probation, and another one can conclude that he warrants 10 or 15 years, and there'll be no remedy on appeal because it will all be very case-specific. It won't be policy driven disagreements. Most of what goes on in Federal sentencing is not fundamentally a deep-rooted policy disagreement of the nature of the kind that Justice Scalia and I were discussing, about whether white collar defendants should go to jail at all. Most of it is about how do the particular features of this individual defendant match up with the policy considerations --"

    "speech": "Mr. Dreeben, can I ask another question? I go back to percentages for just -- to illustrate the point. You say that the justification has to be responsive to the extent of the departure. And you -- you kind of disavow percentages that trigger -- you say substantial. But how do you measure the strength of justifications? For example in this case, there were four or five justifications -- withdrawal from a conspiracy, youth, that he got over alcoholism, so forth. Is the judge supposed to put a percentage value on each of those justifications and see if they add up to the percentage? And if not, aren't you comparing oranges and apples?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "It is more of a wholistic and judgmental process than a mathematical one, Justice Stevens. And I am reluctant to offer percentages because I don't want to be mistaken for saying there is some litmus test with superguidelines, ranges -- but I can say that courts of appeals that find a variance to warrant a substantial or extraordinary justification are typically looking at 40 to 50 to 60 percent away from the guidelines range, not sentences that --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",

  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Linguistically, the words used are, you need a compelling reason for an extraordinary departure -- an extraordinary reason for an extraordinary departure or variance. So in that sense, I agree with you. But the court of appeals have not attempted to create a mathematical grid, because such an exercise would be both contrary to the notion of advisory guidelines, and also one that is inherently arbitrary. And that's why I said that it is unfortunately more in the nature of, I know it when I see it, but I don't think that this is as bad as the predicament the Court found itself in in obscenity cases, because it really isn't that hard to tell the difference between a variance that is a few months outside the range or even a variance in the facts of this Gall case, say down to 15 months, and a sentence that just wipes out all prison time altogether. I don't think the Court should have any difficulty saying that if a judge is just going to wipe out all prison time --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "Can I ask you -- if it wipes it out entirely, does that make this case different or like a case in which the maximum was say -- was 30 years instead of 30 months? Are they both to be judged by the same standard on the justification?"

I think if the guidelines are calling for a very substantial period of imprisonment, and a judge says, I just don't think the culpability of white collar offenders ever warrants sending them to jail, I think the better approach is you have them go out and make speeches to fellow potential defendants about how terrible their experience was, that is something that's going to produce a very widespread potential for disparity."

And it has specified those -- those facts in prior decisions. At that point, in order to go 30, you know, 30 percent above the guidelines, that fact becomes necessary for the conviction and -- or for the sentence, and, therefore, you would need the jury to find it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "No, Justice Scalia. I don't think that courts of appeals conducting reasonableness review should in effect construct their own guidelines system. They should respond to the reasons and the facts that are before them."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "That's what common law adjudication always amounts to. By trial and error, one case, the next case, you eventually end up knowing what is necessary in order to give 30 -- 30 percent over. Unless you're accomplishing that, I don't know what you're accomplishing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Well, I -- I think you're not accomplishing that kind of a common law system in reasonableness review for many of the reasons that the Court has already identified in describing why an abuse-of-discretion approach is warranted. The court of appeals will not be saying that this is the maximum sentence you could give on these facts. It would say these -- this is an unreasonable or a reasonable sentence based on the policy considerations that the judge articulated and the facts that he relied on."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "He said this fact is okay. You can go 30 percent above with this fact. So then in the next case, the district judge says, I find that this fact exists and therefore you get 30 percent above the max, and the court of appeals affirms, but the jury has never found that fact."

  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Well, my response -- and if I could answer Mr. Chief Justice -- is that the fundamental point of this Court's Apprendi line of cases is that, so long as the statutory maximum is legally available to the judge, the judge can find facts within that range that justify the sentence, and that's all the Booker remedial opinion authorizes judges to do. Thank you."

    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Most bluntly, an I-know-it-when-I-see-it test or a holistic test is not likely to generate much in the way of warranted uniformity either. Justice Scalia, you pointed out, in your question about whether this sentence was excessive or not on the basis of the -- of the facts, that the government is blowing smoke with respect to its statement that the guidelines is purely advisory. Well, it's not only doing that; it's removing the exercise of discretion by the district judge. It's saying to the district judge, you must demonstrate to us facts. You must come to us with facts that not only consist of explanations of reasons but are sufficiently persuasive or compelling to overcome our natural resistance to an outside-the-guidelines sentence. That I submit is, as articulated earlier, making the guidelines presumptive. And it imposes a fact-finding requirement that is in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Justice Ginsburg, you asked about whether the prosecutor had, in fact, heard all of the evidence with respect to -- or stated all the evidence to the district court with respect to Mr. Gall. The answer to that question is he most certainly did. And I agree with my colleague that this case is the mirror of Rita. In Rita, the district judge was presented with a wealth of facts about Mr. Rita's prior good works, his military service, et cetera. Here, the district judge was again presented with a wealth of facts with respect to Mr. Gall's voluntary rehabilitation, with respect to his having grown, developed, and established a business and rid himself of crime and drugs. And this district judge exercised his discretion to go down on the basis of those facts and imposed a sentence of probation. And, Justice Stevens, the Eighth Circuit, even before the Guidelines, even before the Booker case, in 1993, in 1999, in cases called One Star and Decora respectively, went down from even higher levels to probation based upon the particular facts of the case. We would ask the Court to overturn the judgment of the Eighth Circuit and abandon the extraordinary circumstances test. Thank you."
