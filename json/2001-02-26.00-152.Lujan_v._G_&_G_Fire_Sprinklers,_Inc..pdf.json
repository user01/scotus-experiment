      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case comes on a second time for review before this Court following the initial petition for granting petition for certiorari in 1999, when the Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and sent the case back for reconsideration under this Court's decision in American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company v. Sullivan. We argued at that time that the decision of the Ninth Circuit was a radical departure from established principles of constitutional law, and the cases decided under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court, we would submit, has only paid lip service to this Court's decision in Sullivan and again renders a decision which compounds confusion in the law and is again a radical departure. The Ninth Circuit again takes the position that any interest or any declaim for payment under a public works contract is a property interest within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. That is a decision and a viewpoint which is contrary to every other circuit that has decided that question, including the Second District and the Court of Appeals in the First and Seventh Circuits. Also, in the Ninth Circuit the position has been for a number of years, as reflected in San Bernadino Physicians Services, that these types of interests in construction contracts, public construction contracts, were not within the concept of property within the Due Process Clause. This Court in Sullivan made it clear that in order to determine that there was a property interest, that a plaintiff had to pass certain minimum standards, had to surmount certain hurdles of pleading and evidence that were never surmounted in this case and it is clear in this case that, to use the language of Sullivan, that plaintiff has never made good on its claim."

They get the withholding notice, there's nothing to withhold. That's a very obvious example. There are also examples, for instance, where the situation of the subcontractor would be such that if there was a withholding it would put him out of business, and it might be in the interest of the prime contractor not to put the sub out of business because it might jeopardize performance under the contract. That is another example."

There's nothing in the record, and we've been in front of the Ninth Circuit three times on this, we've been in the district court two or three times, and there's no such claim. Now, one of the other questionable, we suggest, determinations of the Ninth Circuit was that a cause of action, a trial in a court of law was not a hearing within the meaning of due process, that somehow there was some requirement that the hearing had to be an administrative hearing, and we believe that that is contrary to the decisions of this Court in cases like Hudson v. Palmer, and Ingraham v. Wright, where the Court at least in those cases suggested that a trial in a court of law was, indeed, a hearing within the meaning of due process."

I mean, the State, without giving the sub even a chance to respond to these allegations simply directs the prime contractor to give the State the money owed to the sub?

      "speaker": "KERRIGAN",
      "speech": "Justice Scalia, we would say it is completely different than a garnishment. We would say there is a spectrum of situations that one would pose in these cases. You have on the far end of the, extreme end of the spectrum cases that like the James Good Realty, the Hawaiian case, where a party was divested of real property interest. You have the Sniadach case, where there was a garnishment, where property is in possession of the -- let's say, the subcontractor, and that property is divested and the right is divested. This is a situation where there are two parties, one party claims that the other party is not entitled to the property, or in this case the money, and the other party is claiming that they are entitled to the money. We think it's perfectly reasonable, especially in view of the well-known insolvency of the subcontractors, that for the protection of the workers on these projects, that the withholding is appropriate. And Justice Stevens in Sullivan said, and I think that -- as we said in our brief, I think that philosophy kind of tends to underscore the decision in Sullivan that there is nothing unreasonable if a party in good faith, who has possession of the property or the goods, takes the position that they're going to hold onto that property to preserve the status quo until some kind of a reasonable determination can be made, and we don't think it's high-handed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KERRIGAN",

Here there's a disputed claim, and that's all there is, and we are saying, based on the disputed claim, we're not going to pay you for the box of ballpoint pens that the supplier gave us. We're going to withhold payment on that. If, every time the State does not pay its bills on time because there's a dispute, a good-faith dispute, and if that's going to be a violation of the Due Process Clause, we don't think that's what was intended by the people who drafted the Due -- the Fourteenth Amendment."

    {
      "speaker": "KERRIGAN",

In cases like Loudermill, where the person could not be dismissed and had a guaranteed right to continued employment, this Court said there had to be a hearing before they could dismiss him for cause, and a person in that case, where there is a for-cause termination provision, has a present property interest in their employment, which cannot be taken away from them absent some sort of hearing."

It just hasn't been -- there's been no deprivation until you go into court and the court says, there's no cause of action, we will not recognize it, and you cannot convert this into a right to payment. The example is, in, for example, Logan v. Zimmerman Brush, the person submitted a claim for payment. that was a property right. When the court -- excuse me, when the agency in that case said, oh, we've moved to slowly, accordingly we're not going to make good on this claim for payment, and anyway, even if you're entitled, it terminated that property interest. It no longer existed. The chose of action was erased, and the person was remitted to a lawsuit for a court action to try and recover damages. In contrast, where you submit the claim, and the court is considering it, or you're sitting on the claim and you have not yet submitted it, the State hasn't passed on whether it's going to terminate it, or whether it's going to respect it. It's simply sitting there, an inchoate cause of action that you have not yet asserted."

That part I understand. But the fact that you haven't gone to court doesn't seem to me to have any bearing on whether you have a property interest or not."

    {
      "speaker": "LAMKEN",
      "speech": "Right. It is in a sense a lot like Williamson County. It's akin to a ripeness argument. In that case, the Court held that there's no taking without just compensation, if you haven't sought the compensation which you claim to be your due. In our view, there is no deprivation of property in the form of a chose of action without due process unless you've asked for the process that's your due and the State has, in fact, said to you, you cannot have process."

However, as of January 1, 1998, the State has authority to either order the prime contractor to withhold money, and the second thing is that it also exempts the prime contractor from certain penalties if the prime contractor -- and this is section 1775(b)(1) through (4) are the relative provisions, post-1998. It exempts the prime contractor from penalties if the prime contractor withholds money from the subcontractor. When the State threatens penalties against a prime contractor for not withholding, we would believe that is sufficient to establish State action. When it's left holding --"

There are books in California filled with State laws, and anyone could complain about any one of those laws, that they violate the Constitution and, indeed, if you had a law governing court procedure, which you thought was very, very, very unfair, I suppose that might violate the Constitution, too, so sure, maybe this is unconstitutional in that sense, but in that sense, what's unconstitutional about it?"

An awarding body, which can be school district, a city or whatever, makes a determination that payment is due under the contract, so let's say, they say today, payment is due, pick up the check Friday. On Thursday, at that point there is a marketable common law right to property, the right to money due, that has a value. If the payment request was submitted on behalf of the subcontractor, then the payment that's made by the awarding body to the prime contractor passes. It then goes to the subcontractor, so that that property right that exists at that time, there's a property right of the prime contractor and the subcontractor. The prime contractor's right as to that money is of little value. The valuable right is the subcontractor."

If you don't pay, then you're subject to potential losses imposed by the contractor who doesn't pay. If an owner, like an awarding body, like a school district or whatever, says I'm not going to pay you, they take the proprietary risk. You take -- they take a proprietary risk. You, as a contractor, can generate a lot of leverage to prevent baseless refusals to pay by an owner. You -- when the DLSE as an enforcement agency seizes money, you have no leverage and no ability to generate leverage."

We don't have Aunt Ella, we have a person who is called the labor department, and it's quite true that she doesn't say it formally, they do it formally in an order, and it's true that the contracting party is the State and not a private person. But again, if we accepted your view that it makes a difference, then all these building contracts would suddenly become State action under Roth, Zindeman, et cetera. Every claim like that would end up in court under some kind of constitutional analysis. I've never heard of anything like that."

The question they were addressing was, is the right that the other party won't breach the contract now a property right based on the status of a contract with the Government?

      "speaker": "KERRIGAN",
      "speech": "That is not the case, Your Honor. There is a stop-notice provision. The stop-notice provision is in the code. It was referred to on page 36-37 of our brief. That provides for a very summary hearing. The G & G type contractor files a stop notice with the State, the State withholds money from the prime contractor, and there is a hearing in a very short period of time. In addition --"
